          "abstract": "Exposure to economic inequality is widely thought to erode subjective well-being and mental health1,2,3,4,5, which carries important societal implications6,7,8,9,10. However, existing studies face reproducibility issues11,12,13, and theory suggests that inequality only affects individuals in disadvantaged contexts14,15,16. Here we present a meta-analysis of 168 studies using multilevel data (11,389,871 participants from 38,335 geographical units) identified across 10 bibliographical databases (2000–2022). Contrary to popular narratives, random-effects models showed that individuals in more unequal areas do not report lower subjective well-being (standardized odds ratio (OR+0.05) = 0.979, 95% confidence interval = 0.951–1.008). Moreover, although inequality initially seemed to undermine mental health, the publication-bias-corrected association was null (OR+0.05 = 1.019; 0.990–1.049)17. Meta-analytical effects were smaller than the smallest effect of interest, and specification curve analyses confirmed these results across ≈95% of 768 alternative models18. When assessing study quality and certainty of evidence using ROBINS-E and GRADE criteria, ROBINS-E rated 80% of studies at high risk of bias, and GRADE assigned greater certainty to the null effects than to the negative effects. Meta-regressions revealed that the adverse association between inequality and mental health was confined to low-income samples. Moreover, machine-learning analyses19 indicated that the association with well-being was negative in high-inflation contexts but positive in low-inflation contexts. These moderation effects were replicated using Gallup World Poll data (up to 2 million participants). These findings challenge the view that economic inequality universally harms psychological health and can inform public health policy.",

          "abstract": "Amazonia is the largest 1 and the most species-rich tropical forest region on Earth 2 , where hundreds of Indigenous cultures and thousands of animal species have interacted over millennia 3,4 . Although Amazonia offers a unique context to appraise the value of wildlife as a source of food to millions of rural inhabitants, the diversity, geographic extent, volumes and nutritional value of harvested wild meat are unknown. Here, leveraging a dataset comprising 447,438 animals hunted across 625 rural localities, we estimate an annual extraction of 0.57 Mt of undressed animal biomass across Amazonia, equivalent to 0.34 Mt of edible wild meat. Just 20 out of 174 taxa account for 72% of all animals hunted and 84% of the overall biomass extracted. We show that this amount of wild meat can meet nearly half of protein and iron dietary requirements for rural peoples, along with a substantial portion of their needs for B vitamins (18–126%) and zinc (23%). However, wild meat productivity is likely to have decreased by 67% in nearly 500,000 km² of highly deforested areas of Amazonia. Furthermore, the availability of wild meat per capita decreases significantly in areas with higher human population, greater proximity to cities, and more extensive deforestation. These findings highlight the urgent need to preserve the forest to safeguard biodiversity and traditional wild meat food systems, which will be essential for ensuring Amazonian peoples’ well-being and achieving several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 5 .",

          "abstract": "The discovery of Shimao city (around 2300–1800 bce1), a premier state-level Neolithic fortified settlement in Shaanxi, China2, played an important role in helping us understand the emergence of socially stratified urban societies. However, key questions remain regarding how ancestry and kinship shaped the hierarchy of this class-based society characterized by human sacrifice. The origin of the founding populations of Shimao and other Loess Plateau settlements, and their interactions within the broader ancestral landscape, have yet to be determined. Here we present, by sequencing 144 ancient genomes from Shimao city and its satellites, pedigrees among tomb owners spanning up to four generations. These findings reveal a predominantly patrilineal descent structure across Shimao communities, and possibly sex-specific sacrificial rituals. We also characterize the population history, revealing that Shimao culture-related populations originated mostly from a Yangshao culture-related population present at least 1,000 years earlier, and the lasting inflow of Yumin-related populations from Inner Mongolia did not interrupt regional genetic continuity. Broader genetic influence from southern mainland ancestry over Shimao culture-related populations supports evidence of rice farming expanding further north than previously expected. Together, these results uncover fine details of the regional peopling and social structure of early state establishment.",

          "abstract": "Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth’s deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5,6,7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8,9,10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration.",

          "authors": "Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon",
          "abstract": "Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using single-qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution1. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators2 or using entangled states to enhance measurement sensitivity3. Here we describe protocols for using optically unresolved NV centre pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise at nanometre length scales. For noninteracting NV centres, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations, leveraging the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable phase cycling even for co-aligned NV centres that are spectrally unresolved. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole–dipole coupling between two NV centres and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centres. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV centre spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate methods for detecting high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centres.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.",

          "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological strategy that relies on small molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues, which induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 1 . Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization 2–4 . Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors 5–7 . However, we lack an understanding of the frequency, generalizability and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. Here, to address this knowledge gap, we generated dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1,570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, therefore affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic whereby inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization or higher-order assemblies, which may be triggered by direct target engagement or network effects. Collectively, our data suggest that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a common event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.",

Soil compaction triggers reduction in root length and radial expansion driven by the plant hormone ethylene 2 . Here we report how ethylene controls cell wall biosynthesis to promote root radial expansion. We demonstrate how soil compaction stress, via ethylene, upregulates Auxin Response Factor1 in the root cortex, which represses cellulose synthase (CESA) genes. CESA repression drives radial expansion of root cortical cells by modifying the thickness of their cell walls, which results in a thicker epidermis and thinner cortex. Our research links ethylene signalling with root cell wall remodelling, and reveals how dynamic regulation of cellulose synthesis controls root growth in compacted soil.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is generally thought to be caused by expansion of a single mutant cell1. However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations2,3. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (123 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood4. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps—40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia—were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution.",

          "abstract": "The colorectal epithelium is rapidly renewing, with remarkable capacity to regenerate following injury. In colorectal cancer (CRC), this regenerative capacity can be co-opted to drive epithelial plasticity. While oncogenic MAPK signalling in CRC is common, with frequent mutations of both KRAS (40-50%) and BRAF (10%)1, inhibition of this pathway typically drives resistance clinically. Given the development of KRAS inhibitors, and licensing of BRAF inhibitor combinations2-4, we have interrogated key mechanisms of resistance to these agents in advanced preclinical CRC models. We show that oncogenic MAPK signalling induces epithelial state changes in vivo, driving adoption of a regenerative/revival stem like population, while inhibition leads to rapid transcriptional remodeling of both Kras- and Braf-mutant tumours, favoring a Wnt-associated, canonical stem phenotype. This drives acute therapeutic resistance in Kras- and delayed resistance in Braf-driven models. Importantly, where plasticity is restrained, such as in early metastatic disease, or through targeting ligand-dependent Wnt-pathway Rnf43 mutations, marked therapeutic responses are observed. This explains the super response to BRAF+EGFR targeted therapies previously observed in a BRAF/RNF43 co-mutant patient population, highlighting the criticality of cellular plasticity in therapeutic response. Together, our data provides clear insight into the mechanisms underpinning resistance to MAPK targeted therapies in CRC. Moreover, strategies that aim to corral stem cell fate, restrict epithelial plasticity or intervene when tumours lack heterogeneity may improve therapeutic efficacy of these agents.",

Here we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task flexibly engaging these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. In neural recordings, we found that task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Monkeys adapted to changes in the task by iteratively updating their internal belief about the current task and then, based on this belief, flexibly engaging the shared sensory and motor subspaces relevant to the task. In summary, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations.",

Here we sought to understand how organisms evolve completely new sets of centromeres that still effectively engage with the kinetochore machinery by identifying and tracking thousands of centromeres across two major fungal clades, including more than 2,500 natural strain isolates and representing over 1,000 million years of evolution. We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection and that the kinetochore, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, appears to act as a filter to determine which new centromere variants are tolerated.

          "abstract": "Lineage plasticity is a cancer hallmark that drives disease progression and treatment resistance1,2. Plasticity is often mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that may be reversible; however, there are few examples of such reversibility. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), plasticity mediates resistance to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors and progression from adenocarcinoma to aggressive subtypes, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE)3,4,5. Here we show that plasticity-associated treatment resistance in CRPC can be reversed through the inhibition of NSD2, a histone methyltransferase6. NSD2 upregulation in CRPC-NE correlates with poor survival outcomes, and NSD2-mediated H3K36 dimethylation regulates enhancers of genes associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. In prostate tumour organoids established from genetically engineered mice7 that recapitulate the transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states, and in human CRPC-NE organoids, CRISPR-mediated targeting of NSD2 reverts CRPC-NE to adenocarcinoma phenotypes. Moreover, a canonical AR program is upregulated and responses to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide are restored. Pharmacological inhibition of NSD2 with a first-in-class small molecule reverses plasticity and synergizes with enzalutamide to suppress growth and promote cell death in human patient-derived organoids of multiple CRPC subtypes in culture and in xenografts. Co-targeting of NSD2 and AR may represent a new therapeutic strategy for lethal forms of CRPC that are currently recalcitrant to treatment.",

          "abstract": "Upon viral infection, the current paradigm of humoral immunity posits that germinal centre reactions occurring within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) yield effector plasma cells that subsequently traffic to infected organs or the bone marrow1,2,3. However, it is not well understood how viral tissue tropism may govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of such responses. Here we demonstrate that infection with a prototypical systemic virus indeed induces liver-trafficking plasma cells generated in SLOs, whereas strictly hepatotropic hepaciviral infection elicits locally primed, virus-specific plasma cells in the liver independently of SLO contribution. Such locally derived progenies emerged from inducible hepatic-associated lymphoid tissue (iHALT) structures containing generative foci of T follicular helper cells, myeloid cells and germinal centre-like B cells, often arising from single founder clones unique to individual periportal structures and locally supporting somatic hypermutation. Critically, the cellular composition, cell–cell contact partners and microarchitecture of such iHALT structures in mice were closely mirrored upon hepaciviral infection in humans. Functionally dependent upon CD40L signalling and cognate B cell receptor specificity, emerging CXCR4+VLA-4+LFA-1+CD44+CD138+ plasma cells were immediately retained along CXCL12+fibronectin+ICAM2+osteopontin+type I collagen+ periportal fibroblast tracts, acting as cognate anchoring pairs that were critical to their maintenance therein. In summary, we characterize humoral immunity exclusively generated and maintained within its extralymphoid site of viral infection in the liver amidst SLO dormancy, in which functional iHALT successfully compensates for strictly hepatotropic virus-induced SLO-evasion strategies to prevent persistent infection.",

Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking (RB) techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot-based encodings. Moreover, we show the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate for exchange-only qubits and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade (PSB) readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB)2, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.",

Using deep long-read bulk metagenomic sequencing, we tracked prophage integration dynamics in stool samples from six healthy individuals, spanning a 2-year timescale. Although most prophages remained stably integrated into their hosts, approximately 5% of phages were dynamically gained or lost from persistent bacterial hosts. Within a sample, we found that bacterial hosts with and without a given prophage coexisted simultaneously. Furthermore, phage induction, when detected, occurred predominantly at low levels (1–3× coverage compared to the host region), in line with theoretical expectations4. We identified multiple instances of integration of the same phage into bacteria of different taxonomic families, challenging the dogma that phages are specific to a host of a given species or strain5. Finally, we describe a new class of ‘IScream phages’, which co-opt bacterial IS30 transposases to mediate their mobilization, representing a previously unrecognized form of phage domestication of selfish bacterial elements. Taken together, these findings illuminate fundamental aspects of phage–bacterial dynamics in the human gut microbiome and expand our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that drive horizontal gene transfer and microbial genome plasticity.",

Watching others being touched activates brain areas representing our own sense of touch: the visual system recruits touch-related computations to simulate bodily consequences of visual inputs 1 . One long-standing question is how the brain implements this interface between visual and somatosensory representations 2 . Here, to address this question, we developed a model to simultaneously map somatosensory body part tuning and visual field tuning throughout the brain. Applying our model to ongoing co-activations during rest resulted in detailed maps of body-part tuning in the brain’s endogenous somatotopic network. During video watching, somatotopic tuning explains responses throughout the entire dorsolateral visual system, revealing an array of somatotopic body maps that tile the cortical surface. The body-position tuning of these maps aligns with visual tuning, predicting both preferences for visual field locations and visual-category preferences for body parts. These results reveal a mode of brain organization in which aligned visual–somatosensory topographic maps connect visual and bodily reference frames. This cross-modal interface is ideally situated to translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats that are useful for action, social cognition and semantic processing 3 .",

          "abstract": "Glasses-free three-dimensional (3D) displays provide users with an immersive visual experience without the need of any wearable devices1,2. To achieve high-quality 3D imaging, a display should have both large linear dimensions and a wide viewing angle. However, the trade-off between spatial extent and bandwidth of optical systems, the space–bandwidth product, conventionally constrains the simultaneous maximization of the two. The two most common approaches to 3D displays are holographic3,4 and automultiscopic1,5,6, which, respectively, sacrifice either scale or viewing angle. Recently, some implementations enhanced by artificial intelligence have shown directions to mitigate these constraints, but they still operate within a set space–bandwidth product7,8. As a result, it remains challenging to fabricate large-scale wide-angle 3D displays9. Here we report the realization of a large-scale full-parallax 3D display with seamless viewing beyond 100°, maintained at over 50 Hz and 1,920 × 1,080 resolution on a low-cost light-field delivery setup. This device, called EyeReal, is realized by accurately modelling binocular view and combining it with a deep-learning real-time optimization, enabling the generation of optimal light-field outputs for each of the eyes. Our device could potentially enable applications in educational tools, 3D design and virtual reality10,11.",

          "abstract": "Stem-like progenitors are self-renewing cytotoxic T cells that expand as effector cells during successful checkpoint immunotherapy 1,2 . Emerging evidence suggests that tumour-draining lymph nodes support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish tumour sites and are a key source of expanded effector populations 3–6 , underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Here, using advanced three-dimensional multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, we identify antigen-presentation niches in tumour-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance and affinity evolution of TCF-1 + PD-1 + SLAMF6 high stem-like CD8 + T cells. Contrary to the prevailing view that persistent T cell receptor (TCR) signalling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement days beyond initial priming sustains the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway has a central role in this process through fine-tuning the TCR signal input that enables the selective expansion of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones as a renewable source of effector cells. PD-1 blockade disrupts this tuning, leading to terminal differentiation or death of the most avid anti-tumour stem-like cells. Our results therefore reveal a relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative-feedback regulatory loop and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumour effect at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high-affinity precursors.",

Its unique ‘string’ architecture3, where multiple cells are connected in series, requires high-voltage pass operation that causes a large amount of undesired power consumption4. Lowering the pass voltage, however, poses a challenge: it leads to an associated reduction in the memory window, restricting the multi-level operation capability. Here, with a gate stack composed of zirconium-doped hafnia and an oxide semiconductor channel, we report ultralow-power ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) that resolve this dilemma. Our FeFETs secure up to 5-bit per cell multi-level capability, which is on par with or even exceeds current NAND technology, while showing nearly zero pass voltage, saving up to 96% power in string-level operations over conventional counterparts. Three-dimensional integration of FeFET stacks into vertical structures with a 25-nm short channel preserves robust electrical properties and highlights low-pass-voltage string operation in scaled dimensions. Our work paves the way for next-generation storage memory with enhanced capacity, power efficiency and reliability.",

Here we describe an alternative slipknot-based mechanical transmission mechanism to control the intelligent operation of both human and robotic systems. Through topological design, slipknot tying and release can encode and deliver force with a consistency of 95.4% in repeating operations, which circumvents the need for additional sensors and controllers. When applied to surgical repair, this mechanism helped inexperienced surgeons to improve their knotting-force precision by 121%, enabling them to perform surgical knots as good as those of experienced surgeons. Moreover, blood supply and tissue healing after surgery were improved. The mechano-intelligence exhibited in slipknots may inspire investigations of knotted structures across multiple length scales. This slipknot-gauged mechanical transmission strategy can be widely deployed, opening up opportunities for resource-limited healthcare, science education and field exploration.",

          "abstract": "Land-use change causes widespread shifts in the composition and functional diversity of species assemblages. However, its impact on ecosystem resilience remains uncertain. The stability of ecosystem functioning may increase after land-use change because the most sensitive species are removed, which leaves more resilient survivors 1–3 . Alternatively, ecosystems may be destabilized if land-use change reduces functional redundancy, which accentuates the ecological impacts of further species loss 4,5 . Current evidence is inconclusive, partly because trait data have not been available to quantify functional stability at sufficient scale. Here we use morphological measurements of 3,696 bird species to estimate shifts in functional redundancy after recent anthropogenic land-use change at 1,281 sites worldwide. We then use extinction simulations to assess the sensitivity of these altered assemblages to future species loss. Although the proportion of disturbance-tolerant species increases after land-use change, we show that this does not increase stability because functional redundancy is reduced. This decline in redundancy destabilizes ecosystem function because relatively few additional extinctions lead to accelerated losses of functional diversity, particularly in trophic groups that deliver important ecological services such as seed dispersal and insect predation. Our analyses indicate that land-use change may have major undetected impacts on the resilience of key ecological functions, hindering the capacity of natural ecosystems to absorb further reductions in functionality caused by ongoing perturbations.",

A partial foot (BRT-VP-2/73)2 and several isolated teeth from two Burtele (BRT) localities, however, were not identified to the species level. Recently recovered dentognathic specimens clarify not only the taxonomic affinity of the BRT hominin specimens but also shed light on the diet and locomotion of A. deyiremeda. Here we present a comparative description of these specimens and show that they are attributable to A. deyiremeda. We also find it parsimonious to attribute the BRT foot to this species based on the absence of other hominin species at BRT. The new material demonstrates that overall, A. deyiremeda was dentally and postcranially more primitive than A. afarensis, particularly in aspects of canine and premolar morphology, and in its retention of pedal grasping traits. Furthermore, the low and less variable distributions of its dental enamel δ13C values are similar to those from Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis, indicating a reliance on C3 foods. This suggests that A. deyiremeda had a dietary strategy similar to the earlier A. ramidus and A. anamensis. The BRT foot and its assignment to A. deyiremeda provides conclusive evidence that arboreality was a significant component of the positional behaviour of this australopith, further corroborating that some degree of arboreality persisted among Pliocene hominins1,3,4,5,6,7.",

Here we use three closely related species, Drosophila sechellia (Dsec), Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, to study taste circuit1 and food choice evolution. Dsec, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia; noni), whereas the other two are generalists living on diverse diets2. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in Dsec and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity by means of calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni activates bitter-sensing neurons more strongly in Dsec than in the other two species owing to a small deletion in a single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain3, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sucrose signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data indicate that altered food choice may not be explained by peripheral receptor changes alone but rather by modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.",

          "abstract": "Detecting individual spins—including stable and metastable states—represents a fundamental challenge in quantum sensing, with broad applications across condensed matter physics1,2, quantum chemistry3 and single-molecule magnetic resonance imaging4,5. Although nitrogen–vacancy (NV) centres in diamond have emerged as powerful nanoscale sensors, their performance for single-spin detection remains constrained by substantial environmental noise and restricted sensing volume6,7. Here we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution relative to single NV centres under ambient conditions. The protocol uses carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway towards atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interfaces.",

          "authors": "Jacob Hochard",
          "abstract": "On Natural Capital: The Value of the World Around Us Partha Dasgupta Witness (2025)\n\nAn economist might celebrate a nation achieving record economic growth on one day, yet overlook a coral reef lying bleached and lifeless on another. This contradiction must be challenged, writes economist Partha Dasgupta in his elegant account of why the global economic system is exploiting, rather than sustaining, life on our planet.\n\nOn Natural Capital recaps the roaring economic advances of the past 75 years, including improved life expectancies and education and fewer people living in poverty. But it also shares how economic progress has benefited from the exploitation of our planet: an ecological debt that conventional accounting leaves off the balance sheet.\n\nHow to build nature back better — read this manual\n\nDasgupta starts by vividly portraying the essential workings of Earth’s life-support systems and how living processes regulate the climate, replenish soils and sustain food webs. He notes that one-third of the planet’s remaining wetlands, which are crucial for filtering nutrients, providing flood protection and storing carbon, have been lost between 1970 and 2015 owing to infrastructure construction, urban expansion and other human activities. He also describes how deforestation can create savannah-like conditions in parts of the tropics, because the disruption of moisture-recycling processes decreases rainfall and ecological productivity.\n\nNext, Dasgupta examines why economic principles have long treated nature’s functions as background scenery. He explains that this omission is rooted in the mid-twentieth-century origins of growth and development economics, in which economists constructed models that explained output using only human labour and skills, and physical goods. This was a reasonable assumption back when natural resources seemed abundant, the world wasn’t pressing against planetary limits and forests, soils and fisheries seemed too plentiful to constrain growth. What began as a practical simplification evolved into a blind spot.\n\nUneasy trade-offs\n\nBy stitching these two narratives together, Dasgupta succeeds in portraying woodlands, watersheds and wild species as bona fide assets, the depletion of which undermines the prosperity statistics that governments use to track and celebrate progress. He solidifies this narrative by estimating that humanity’s collective demand on nature now exceeds the planet’s regenerative capacity by around 70%. Effectively, this means that, since the early 1970s, we have been living off the planet’s ‘capital’ rather than the accrued ‘interest’, jeopardizing our biosphere’s solvency.\n\nBeyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now\n\nAs Dasgupta’s writing flows between nature’s processes and economic principles, he stresses the uneasy trade-offs that societies navigate daily. Each tonne of fish landed or cubic metre of water taken for irrigation is a draw on assets that must remain intact to avoid compromising future yields of food, income and ecological stability.\n\nDasgupta reminds us that these choices are not simply about extraction but also about stewardship. Overfishing might boost a nation’s gross domestic product for one fiscal quarter, yet deplete the reproductive stock that sustains the following year’s catch. Likewise, draining wetlands to generate farmland might bring an immediate harvest, yet erode the flood protection and nutrient-cycling processes that make such agriculture possible.\n\nSustainable forestry management preserves biodiversity and allows forests to regenerate.Credit: Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nThe constant tension between nature’s bounty and the ecological conditions that make that bounty possible is revealed brilliantly by Dasgupta but left out of the accounting practices that currently define progress. As a result, society perceives the conversion of natural resources as costless profit and celebrates growth figures, but the natural systems that made that growth possible decline quietly.\n\nDasgupta’s call to put nature on the balance sheet is timely precisely because it indicates a rapidly expanding movement in policy that is beginning to give the natural world the accounting treatment it has often lacked.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nCountries such as the Netherlands, Canada and Colombia are developing or trialling natural-capital accounting and statistical frameworks that treat ecosystems as assets: measuring their stock (for example, wetlands, forests and soil microorganisms), tracking their depreciation (or appreciation) and defining the ‘interest’ they generate, such as flood protection and carbon storage.\n\nEnvironmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories\n\nIn the corporate domain, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures is a market-led, government-supported and science-based global initiative that encourages companies to include nature in their financial reports. It provides firms with a framework for disclosing nature-related risks, including biodiversity loss, as well as dependencies, such as supply-chain access to clean water.\n\nDasgupta highlights both the promise of natural-capital accounting as well as the areas that need improvement. Markets are finally aligning with the reality that woodlands, watersheds, wildlife and other aspects of the natural world are not ‘free’ inputs but assets, and their degradation erodes prosperity. The gaps, he emphasizes, lie in the valuation of natural systems (how to reliably price ecosystem services), governance (who owns and manages those assets) and integration (how to incorporate natural-capital metrics into macroeconomic indicators).",

          "abstract": "US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr and JD Vance shared a stage at the MAHA Summit in Washington DC.Credit: Alex Wroblewski/AFP/Getty\n\nWashington DC\n\nSocial-media influencers and anti-ageing entrepreneurs mingled with top US government officials, including the head of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), at an exclusive event steps from the White House last week. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss the future of health in the United States.\n\nOrganizers called it the MAHA Summit, referring to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s signature ‘Make America Healthy Again’ movement. Attendees included Kennedy, US vice-president JD Vance, NIH director Jayanta Bhattacharya, US Food and Drug Administration chief Marty Makary and the food activist Vani Hari, who blogs under the name Food Babe. Sessions at the summit, which Nature attended, covered a wide range of health-related topics, including psychedelics, brain implants and anti-ageing therapies. Academic researchers and clinicians were not among the speakers at the sessions, which were peppered by comments critical of the medical establishment.\n\nTrump team backs an unproven drug for autism — but does it work?\n\nThe conference showcased the influence of the MAHA movement, whose supporters say there is a chronic-disease epidemic in the United States that they blame in part on corruption in the food and pharmaceutical industries. To combat this epidemic, supporters advocate lifestyle choices, such as improving sleep and taking dietary supplements.\n\nThe movement has ascended rapidly from a loose network of Kennedy supporters into a political force that Vance, speaking at the summit, called “a critical part of our success in Washington”. The event also drew officials from corporate heavyweights, such as Walmart and Google, and biotechnology firms, such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, New York.\n\n“We didn’t have anything like this,” Robert Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2018 to 2021, during US President Donald Trump’s first term, told Nature at the summit. “Bobby [Kennedy] has gotten industry to sit down with him.”\n\nWarm praise\n\nThe nearly eight-hour summit featured remarks by several officials in Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services. Among them was Bhattacharya, who said that the “MAHA movement is an absolutely incredible thing to me”. He added: “I have waited my entire life to see this movement come.”\n\nOther speakers included mixed-martial-arts promoter Dana White and actor and comedian Russell Brand. Attendees also heard health advice from Bryan Johnson, a Silicon Valley multimillionaire known for his anti-ageing ‘biohacks’, such as receiving plasma transfusions from his teenage son, and his view that his generation might be first to never die.\n\nRFK Jr slings accusations and defends public-health upheaval at fiery hearing\n\nThroughout the event, speakers criticized established scientific and medical institutions. Both are frequent targets of Kennedy, who founded Children’s Health Defense, a non-profit organization in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, that is known for its anti-vaccine advocacy. One of these speakers was Bhattacharya, who said that the NIH, the world’s largest biomedical-research funder, has focused too heavily on small scientific steps instead of “disruptive” or “innovative” research.\n\n“What puts lives at risk is doing research that’s incremental,” Bhattacharya said. “All it does is advance the careers of the researchers that do it. It results in publications that don’t get used and aren’t replicable.”\n\nFollow the science\n\nMakary decried “groupthink that again and again led us astray”, citing as an example public-health recommendations against eating saturated fat. (Kennedy has suggested that saturated fats are part of a healthy diet; the US government has, for decades, recommended limiting saturated-fat consumption.) “We got ‘saturated fat causes heart disease’ wrong for 50 years,” Makary said. “That’s a war we’re going to end.”",

          "abstract": "Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, experienced a data breach in October. Credit: Ilnur Khisamutdinov/Alamy\n\nOn 10 November, hackers gained access to a Princeton University database containing the personal information of those in the institution’s community, including alumni, donors and students. In October, similar data breaches occurred at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThese incidents are part of a broader trend. Over the past few years, cyberattacks have been on the rise at academic institutions around the globe. Not only are attacks time-consuming and costly to contain and clean up, but they have also caused university employees to lose access to essential digital services, such as e-mail and research software, for weeks — or even months — at a time.\n\n“The number of cyberattacks is not relenting,” says Harjinder Singh Lallie, a cybersecurity specialist at the University of Warwick, UK.\n\nUniversities have been working to implement more-robust security systems, but specialists say that academic institutions need to do more to shore up defences, especially against attacks that are assisted by artificial intelligence, which might enable hackers to conduct breaches with greater speed and ease.\n\nToby Murray, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia, says that in today’s political climate, in which competition between countries has been on the rise, “universities remain a really attractive target”. It’s often difficult to trace where attacks come from, but some have been linked to state-sponsored groups, and often involve the use of ransomware, malicious software that blocks data or systems until a payment is made.\n\nNEWS: Cyberattacks are hitting research institutions — with devastating effects\n\nWhat makes universities vulnerable?\n\nAcross all sectors, from government organizations to private companies, cyberattacks have been increasing. Specialists say that universities are particularly vulnerable because of the valuable data they house, such as employee records and intellectual property, and because these institutions are difficult to secure. Many universities have older, outdated security systems as well as diverse digital infrastructures and communities that can make it easy for hackers to infiltrate such systems.\n\n“It’s going to get worse,” says David Batho, the director of security at Jisc, an organization that provides digital infrastructure to educational institutions in the United Kingdom. “Prevention is no longer enough. Building resilience is essential.”\n\nA UK government survey carried out between August and December last year revealed that the country’s educational institutions have had a high prevalence of cybersecurity breaches and were more likely to experience such incidents than were other businesses. According to an accompanying report, 91% of higher-education institutions and 85% of further-education colleges reported having experienced such an incident in the preceding 12 months.\n\nQuantum hacking looms — but ultra-secure encryption is ready to deploy",

          "title": "Why the world must wake up to China’s science leadership",
          "authors": "Kerry Brown",
          "abstract": "Two conversations have stayed with me over the past 25 years. Around 2001, a European Union official in Beijing — where I was then a UK diplomat — told a group of us that the reason countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom were allowing technology transfer to China was to see a day when the nation could return the favour. And, in 2017 in Austria, a retired UK security official stated wearily that if there was one constant in policymaking towards China, it was to perpetually be five to ten years behind the times.\n\nHow China can become a biotechnology superpower\n\nThose points resonate in 2025. China has become an important player in research and development (R&D). Yet, most of the outside world has still not woken up to this fact.\n\nOn 23 October, China’s Communist Party announced that, for the next five years, it will focus on “high-quality development” with “innovation as the fundamental driving force”. This will require, it says, “substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance and strength” (see go.nature.com/4ahcvj8). Policymakers should take this statement seriously for three reasons.\n\nFirst, China has an incentive. At a meeting a few days later, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump agreed to halt their tariff wars and trade skirmishes. But China knows that its technological dependence on the United States and others is a vulnerability, and that it needs to become autonomous.\n\nSecond, it is not just words but hard cash that the Chinese government is committing to achieving its goals. The nation’s R&D investments increased nearly sixfold between 2007 and 2023, overtaking the EU’s and coming close to US figures (see go.nature.com/4a2xres). The latest plans indicate that this trend is set to continue.\n\nChinese scientists increasingly lead joint projects with the UK, US and Europe\n\nAnd third, China has the human capital, too. In 2020, the nation produced 3.6 million graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), compared with 2.6 million in India and 820,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4ppekyx). And, in 2022, some 50,000 people in China graduated with STEM PhDs, compared with 34,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4iedi4z). China’s leading universities, including Fudan in Shanghai and Tsinghua in Beijing, rank highly on global lists.\n\nOver the past half-century, China’s development was achieved mainly by 250 million labourers moving from rural areas to urban ones, making the country the ‘factory of the world’. By contrast, going forwards, it will be young Chinese scientists who will drive progress.\n\nA powerful example is the unexpected January release of DeepSeek, an app based on artificial intelligence developed by a 200-strong technology company in Hangzhou. Despite criticism that DeepSeek has a lower capacity than other AI models, the firm’s proof that China could produce its own AI systems provided a powerful symbolic moment.\n\nHow provinces and cities can sustain US–China climate cooperation\n\nChinese leaders admit that their country has a long way to go. But it would take a brave person to dismiss China’s chance of achieving its goal of becoming a technological superpower by 2035. That is why it is important for other governments to engage with China effectively.",

          "title": "Waste not: how researchers harness pee and poo for science",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "As Mathilde Poyet ushers me through the Global Microbiome Conservancy’s laboratory in Kiel, Germany, I’m met with all sorts of state-of-the-art equipment. It’s an impressive facility, with typical lab apparatus, such as incubators, the latest sequencing devices and anaerobic chambers for culturing bacteria. But the most important stuff in the lab is stored in a freezer at −80 ºC. The samples are so crucial that there is a back-up battery system — if the electricity to the freezers goes off, the materials will remain intact. These test-tube samples aren’t some immortality serum or cancer-fighting bacteria: they’re faeces.\n\nTo be precise, they’re suspended stool samples and bacteria that have been cultured from faeces. But at one point, this was poo that Poyet and her colleagues, including her partner Mathieu Groussin, had collected as part of their work for the Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC), of which Groussin is a co-founder. Poyet likes to call the project their “first baby” (one of their real babies, their infant daughter Aelis, joins us in their office as we speak).\n\n“We’ve seen all sorts of poop across the Bristol stool scale — all shapes, all sizes, all colours,” says Poyet, referring to the stool classification chart physicians use to assess digestive issues.\n\nPoyet and Groussin’s work is predicated on the idea that faeces provide an ideal snapshot of the human gut microbiome: the genetic content of the community of organisms found in intestines. This differs across populations1 and can serve as a health indicator. Most research on the human gut microbiome focuses on populations of European descent. But the GMbC solicits samples that are more globally representative. The samples in the freezer come from as far afield as Ghana, Tanzania, Finland and Thailand.\n\nSamples being collected and frozen for the GMbC’s biobank of waste products.Credit: F. Rondon/Global Microbiome Conservancy\n\nOver the past nine years of the programme, the team has sampled 50 populations spanning 19 countries. Its members have worked with local scientists, ethics boards and communities to collect the samples, and have taken cars, boats, helicopters and even quadbikes to sample sites. Back in the lab, researchers analyse the stool content, sequence the genetic material of bacteria cultured from samples and store the live samples in their biobank.\n\nTo outsiders, taking stool samples constantly might seem — and smell — disgusting. In Kiel, the scientists occasionally make “poop soup”, using a vessel called a bioreactor to see the effects of different scenarios on procured bacteria. They do this only a few times a year, because the process can be long and expensive, and the aromas pungent, prompting their more-conventional floor mates to give the workspace the nickname “smelly lab”.\n\nBut faeces provide a remarkable window into human health. “It’s our best way to interrogate what’s in the gut from healthy people,” says Groussin. “It’s a little bit gross, but that’s just our best way to access this incredible and important biodiversity.”\n\nA treasure trove for science\n\nWith the microbiome a buzzy research topic, other scientists around the globe are taking samples to study it themselves. And as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater analysis is a valuable public-health tool — providing scientists with the means to monitor pathogens in the population before an infection surges.\n\n“The waste we put into the environment is really data rich,” says Janelle Thompson, an environmental microbiologist at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment in Singapore. Thompson and her team sample Singapore’s wastewater to detect harmful microorganisms in the environment, looking for biological “signals” from organisms or viruses that are shed from the human body.\n\n“You can identify where signals are occurring and follow them over time to see when they’re occurring,” she explains. For example, in 2021 and 2022, Thompson and her colleagues were able to identify variants of concern for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at university campus sites and treatment plants2. This was long before these variants became dominant, indicating “minimal silent circulation”, according to the team.\n\nThe implications of research into human waste span several scientific disciplines. Amid a global fertilizer shortage, some scientists (and farmers) are looking to urine as fertilizer, owing to its nitrogen content. A study in Nature Water3, published earlier this year by a group of researchers at Stanford University, California, created a prototype system that extracts nutrients from urine. The team estimates that its design could generate up to US$4.13 per kilogram of nitrogen recovered. And research published in 20204 shows that urine-based fertilizer might also help to conserve other resources, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and water use.\n\nA researcher pours urine-based fertilizer into a bottle.Credit: Marcin Szczepanski/Lead Multimedia Storyteller, Michigan Engineering\n\nAs well as a public-health bellwether, stool samples are being used in the development of a potentially life-saving process to treat infections of Clostridium difficile, through transferring healthy faecal bacteria and other microbes from one host to another.\n\nC. difficile infections are “really caused by a disturbed microbiota”, explains Josbert Keller, a gastroenterologist at the Haaglanden Medical Centre in The Hague, the Netherlands. Keller was part of a group that published an early clinical trial5 into the effectiveness of faecal transfers, also known as faecal microbiota transplants, in 2013. “If the patient is not able to restore this microbiota, then it can recur and recur, and that’s the moment that faecal microbiota transplants can really cure a patient.”\n\nNow, faecal transfers are being looked at as a way to treat obesity6, type 2 diabetes7, Parkinson’s disease8 and other conditions.\n\nHow to fix a gut microbiome ravaged by antibiotics\n\nSomething that’s often perceived as disgusting can actually have a lot of intrinsic value, says Bryn Nelson, whose 2022 book Flush: The Remarkable Science of an Unlikely Treasure was described by its publisher as “an urgent exploration of the world’s single most squandered natural resource”. As part of the research and writing process, the former microbiologist spent years looking at the applications of faeces — and found at least 24 fields that take important information from what we consider waste products. Referring to excrement’s ‘ick’ factor, he says: “We just have to kind of get past that hurdle to discover all the information that it contains.”\n\nGetting into the field\n\nPoyet comes from a wet-lab background. For her PhD, she studied the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii and often spent full days dissecting specimens of the insect. Her research now involves sifting through stool samples to access bacteria that are not exposed to oxygen. Some samples are more foul than others, she says, adding: “What is really gross when working with stool sample is actually when people don’t digest the food, and you can find food almost intact in the stool. I really don’t like it.”\n\nFor Thompson, working with waste materials was also a natural fit. “I’ve always just been fascinated by the microbial world and then accessing it for human benefit,” she says. “Microbes are slimy, they can be smelly, but I don’t find them gross.”\n\nStools and urine are also something that you get desensitized to over time. Chong Chun Wie, a microbiome researcher at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya, oversees stool-sample collection as part of his work on the human microbiome. His research looks at how the gut microbiome differs across ethnic groups9 in the region. Unlike Poyet and Groussin, he is not involved in fieldwork. Instead, bottles are sent to donors who deposit their samples at home, but there is still handling to be done in the lab.\n\n“The more you do it, the more you just get used to it because it’s something you do routinely,” he says.\n\nYour friends shape your microbiome — and so do their friends\n\nMarissa Ledger, a medical microbiology resident at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, studies the history of parasite infections. Ancient fossilized poo samples — decayed organic components that resemble soil — can be incredibly valuable in archaeology and palaeontology. Ledger’s undergraduate training was in anthropology, studying skeletal remains. She soon learnt that studying parasites in preserved faecal matter is a better way to chronicle infectious diseases throughout human history, likening the fossilized stools to time capsules that can yield nuanced details about infections and diets in a community.\n\n“When I decided that I wanted to look at parasite infections, understanding that they should have been a huge contributor to disease in the past, I was more like, ‘That’s a really cool goal,” she says. “I never really kind of thought of it as gross until I had the response of people talking to me saying, ‘You study ancient poo? That’s crazy.’”\n\nThere’s a stronger cultural taboo towards poo than towards pee, observes Marine Legrand, an anthropologist at OCAPI, an interdisciplinary action and research programme in Paris that looks at ways of recycling human waste, such as by using urine as fertilizer. Although funding is available for research on faeces, it seems to be directed more towards medical than agricultural applications. “When we look for funds, it’s easier to find funds to work on pee than to work on poo.”\n\nThe public restroom",

          "abstract": "This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee Farrar, Straus and Giroux (2025)\n\nThe World Wide Web is one of those rare innovations that truly reshaped the world. It is now so deeply embedded in our daily lives that it is difficult to imagine a time before it existed or even remember how it all began. So, who better to re-examine the state of the modern Internet ecosystem, and champion reform, than the web’s creator himself: computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee? However, he is not the kind of charismatic leader who can inspire a revolution, at least not through his writing.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nThis Is for Everyone reads like a family newsletter: it tells you what happened, recounting the Internet’s origin and evolution in great detail, but rarely explaining why the ideal of a decentralized Internet was not realized. Berners-Lee’s central argument is that the web has strayed from its founding principles and been corrupted by profit-driven companies that seek to monetize our attention. But it’s still possible to “fix the internet”, he argues, outlining a utopian vision for how that might be done. In it, social media would be designed to “maximize the joy” the user experiences instead of fuelling division, and technical standards would be introduced to prevent the mistakes of the social-media era from being repeated in the age of artificial intelligence. Both ideas are optimistic — some might say naive — but coming from someone so integral to the web’s creation, they carry particular weight.\n\nIn this personal history of the Internet, penned with co-writer Stephen Witt, Berners-Lee recounts decades of his career at various institutions, most notably CERN — the European centre for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Here, his seminal invention, the World Wide Web, began as a side project that his managers tolerated grudgingly. Much of this is a well-known tale, both because the web is so prevalent in our lives and because Berners-Lee has given plenty of interviews about how it came to be.\n\nComputer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.Credit: Sam Ogden/SPL\n\nAs an author, Berners-Lee is most powerful and persuasive when he looks beyond his own life to examine the web’s exploitative corners. For instance, he notes that some US Democrats — such as senator Ed Markey and former vice-president Al Gore, who both advocated for well-thought-out technology regulations — were more willing than Republicans to engage with the web’s inner workings. He argues that this imbalance partly shaped the web’s early development in the 2000s, establishing harmful norms that still persist today.\n\nBerners-Lee criticizes cookies — small pieces of data that websites store on users’ computers, often to track browsing behaviour — for needlessly spying on users. And he laments that the web is controlled by “a handful of providers” that “grew into dominant, unregulated monopolies”. He suggests that they ought to be brought into check.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nIn the later sections of the book, Berners-Lee is refreshingly candid. He criticizes Google for attempting to dominate the World Wide Web Consortium — the non-profit organization in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that sets web standards — by embedding its preferred coding language into its Chrome browser, effectively making this language the default choice. This fight over standards is comparable to his earlier run-ins with the creators of the Mosaic browser, including entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, whose profit-driven vision for the web clashed with Berners-Lee’s original ideal of a distributed, decentralized and open system. Berners-Lee seems to have a grudging admiration for Andreessen’s success in commercializing early web browsing by ignoring the niceties of the online community that had been the norm until this point. He made changes to how browsers render images, “as was his right, I suppose”, Berners-Lee writes. Mosaic quickly became “a dominant monopoly” in the 1990s, making its rendering method the standard. Another firm Berners-Lee condemns is Apple — for steering users towards its tightly controlled app store and making it virtually impossible to download apps that are outside Apple’s ecosystem. Social-media algorithms also draw his ire; he warns that they act like “an undercover megaphone”, distorting and polluting public discourse.\n\nHis solution is as radical today as the web was in 1989. Alongside his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, he has created a data protocol called Solid. This data-management framework gives users control over their personal information through secure ‘pods’ — individual data stores that let them decide which apps or services can access their data. This approach flips the power dynamic: sharing data with tech companies is possible, but only on the user’s terms.",

Credit: Addictive Stock Creatives/Alamy\n\nInserting easy-to-release slipknots into surgical thread could help surgeons to tie the perfect sutures — those that tight enough to heal a wound but not so tight that they damage tissue.\n\nResearchers at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, figured out how to precisely control a knot’s geometry and friction so that they could ‘program’ it to open when tugged on with a given force.\n\nThis allows a surgeon — or a robot — stitching up a wound to pull a suture closed with just the right amount of force, simply by tugging the free end of the knotted thread and stopping when the knot unfurls. Getting the force right is important: stitches that are too tight or too loose can lead to complications.\n\nIn simulated operations described in Nature on 26 November1, the slipknot technique allowed inexperienced surgeons to perform sutures as well as their experienced peers. In rats, slipknot-aided colon surgery led to blood flow being restored faster, fewer leaks and less scar tissue than using conventional stitches.\n\nStitches made simple\n\nSurgeons usually gauge how much tension is in stitches by look and feel — a skill that takes years to learn and remains variable even among experts.\n\nAdding a slipknot to the thread creates “a kind of built in mechanical fuse” that limits how much force can be transmitted to the tissue, says Tiefeng Li, a researcher in mechanics and robotics at Zhejiang University in China, who co-led the team of mathematicians, mechanics researchers and clinicians behind the research. “The surgeon only needs to follow a very simple rule: pull until it unfurls, then you know you are at the intended force.”\n\nThe type of knot used consists of a loop that unravels when one end of the thread is pulled. Although such knots appear simple, the mechanics inside them are complex, says Li. “When a slipknot opens, the thread bends, twists, slides, and rubs against itself, and the geometry of the knot changes very quickly,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Afrodi sat on the very edge of her seat. They were here, they were finally here. Like the rest of her team, her eyes were glued to the full-wall screen. Venus: the final frontier.\n\nNot that the public thought that, of course: completely uninhabitable was completely uninteresting. Afrodi couldn’t disagree more. She’d been enamoured with Venus ever since childhood, staring up at it through her mum’s telescope. A perfect, rose-tinted disk. She’d loved the constellations, loved the other planets, but none had captured her like Venus. She felt drawn to it.\n\nAs a teen, Afrodi had observed the public’s obsession with Mars. She read Kim Stanley Robinson’s Red Mars, listened to talks about a Mars landing, of potential colonization plans. She couldn’t understand the appeal. The next summer was the hottest on record, with each year after predicted to be ever hotter. Who wanted to live in a dusty red desert? People think Mars is Earth’s closest relative — but they’re wrong. Mars is small, more akin to the Moon. Venus is Earth’s dangerous sister.\n\nAt university she’d studied astrophysics, absorbing everything she could about Venus’s history. She learnt that once, perhaps a billion years ago, Venus could have been habitable. Afrodi found this enchanting. What would it have been like on the surface? When they first found hints that there might have been life on Mars, her classmates buzzed with excitement. But why should she care about crusty old Mars when Venus rained diamonds?\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nTop of her class was a boy named Res, from Greece. He wanted to be the next Michael Collins, overseeing his very own Neil and Buzz to their safe landing on Mars. He told everyone about Collins’s joke with the Moon landers, that they should say ‘Oh God, what is that thing?’ and cut their mic. He told everyone he had something even funnier he’d make his crew say. Afrodi wasn’t sure Res had the right impression of Collins’s job, but she didn’t care to correct him. Instead, she kept her nose down and learnt everything about Venus.\n\nThe biggest problem astronomers had in viewing the surface was the temperature, which regularly rose to more than 800 K: robot-meltingly and electronic-fryingly hot. The picture they did have was mainly from spectroscopic data and wavelength information, rather than anything seen. Afrodi did a master’s in materials, and a joint PhD in robotics and astrophysics. She wanted to see Venus under her protective shell. She learnt about tungsten, which would withstand temperatures about ten times Venus’s heat. She risked her life hanging around active volcanoes, testing her tungsten-crafted cooling mechanisms and a heat-resistant nanopolymer designed by one of her classmates.\n\nWhen she got an active picture from the inside of a volcano, Afrodi leapt for joy. It would be possible. Her dream would be possible. She left the robot down there for four weeks, just to be completely sure, and once she pulled it out she sent it to Antarctica, to see if it could handle the cold of space.\n\nRes was in her postdoc programme. He didn’t remember her. She didn’t care. They worked together under a disinterested supervisor. Res told her he’d hoped to work on a Mars project, but slots were highly sought after and he’d missed out on a place, which is why he’d been stuck with this second-rate Venus shit. He asked her what she’d wanted to do. She told him they were going to be the first to see the surface of Venus and he should grow up — but in more colourful language.\n\nHe was a nuisance for the next two or so months, rabbiting on about Mars. She learnt to tune it out, like the trains passing her window at night.\n\nGradually — as they worked together on the templates she had for a robot, figured out landing gear, how to get it into space, the trajectory and timing — his Mars worship stopped. She was quiet and introspective, and he did not pick up enthusiasm, exactly, from her, but he grew to appreciate Venus nonetheless. In his own way.\n\nTheir first date was to the observatory in Tartu, Estonia. He’d planned the trip without telling her where they were going, held her hand as they gazed up at Venus’s pink-gold surface. London was on fire while they were away. She’d had to pay for the taxi to get home, as surge pricing ballooned it to twice his budget. But he didn’t complain, eating packed cheese sandwiches every day for the next month to pay her back. She accepted only half.",

          "abstract": "An AlphaFold model of Tmem81, a membrane protein involved in the fusion of egg and sperm.Credit: Google DeepMind/EMBL-EBI (CC-BY-4.0)\n\nFor nearly a decade, Andrea Pauli, a biochemist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, has been trying to work out how sperm and egg get together.\n\nIn 2018, her laboratory found a protein on the surface of zebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs, called Bouncer, that was essential for fertilization. But Pauli’s team and others struggled to show how Bouncer recognized sperm cells. Then a revolution happened.\n\nAlphaFold reveals how sperm and egg hook up in intimate detail\n\nFive years ago, in late November 2020, researchers at London-based Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaFold2. The artificial intelligence tool for predicting protein structures generated stunningly accurate 3D models that, in some cases, were indistinguishable from experimental maps, dominating a long-running structure-prediction challenge. The first version of AlphaFold was announced in 2018, but its predictions weren’t nearly as good as its successor, which limited its impact.\n\nThe 2021 release of AlphaFold2’s code and a database that has swelled to hundreds of millions of predicted structures mean that scientists can now get a reliable prediction for almost any protein.\n\n“Having models for anything has had a huge impact,” says Janet Thornton, a bioinformatician at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL-EBI). “It’s like the second coming of structural biology.”\n\nRapid discovery\n\nFor Pauli’s team, the software shone a light on a path they might otherwise never have found. The model predicted that a protein, called Tmem81, stabilizes a complex of two other sperm proteins, creating a pocket for Bouncer to bind to1. Experiments backed up the tool’s predictions. AlphaFold “speeds up discovery”, says Pauli. “We use it for every project.”\n\nSource: OpenAlex/Google DeepMind\n\nHer team’s paper about this, published in 2024, is one of nearly 40,000 journal articles to cite the 2021 Nature paper describing AlphaFold22. Unlike many other highly cited life-sciences and biomedical papers from the same period, including seminal reports about the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in AlphaFold doesn’t seem to be slowing down (see ‘Peak citations’).\n\nDeepMind’s John Jumper — who shared half of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with chief executive Demis Hassabis for developing AlphaFold — says he is “deeply proud” of how useful the tool has been for scientists such as Pauli. “When will someone win one of these major awards because they used AlphaFold?” he wonders.\n\nPart of AlphaFold2’s rapid impact is down to its accessibility, say researchers. Google DeepMind made the underlying code and other parameters freely available to scientists, and it quickly became possible for them to run the software themselves at scale: this is what Pauli’s team did.\n\nSource: AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\n\nSome 3.3 million users in more than 190 countries have accessed the AlphaFold database (AFDB), which is hosted by EMBL-EBI and contains more than 240 million structural predictions, encompassing most known proteins. More than one million AFDB users come from low- and middle-income countries, including China and India (see ‘Global appeal’).\n\nProtein-structure revolution\n\nThe field in which AlphaFold seems to have made its biggest impact is structural biology. Researchers who used AlphaFold submitted around 50% more protein structures to a repository of experimental models, called the Protein Data Bank (PDB), than did a non-AlphaFold-using ‘baseline’ of structural-biology researchers, finds a Google DeepMind-funded study of AlphaFold’s impacts released this week. AlphaFold2 use was also associated with higher rates of PDB submissions than those of researchers using other ‘frontier’ methods in AI, structural biology and protein structure prediction (see ‘Protein pile-up’).\n\nSource: AI in science: Emerging evidence of impact from AlphaFold2\n\nJumper says he is especially gratified that AlphaFold2 — which was trained using PDB data — has proved so useful for deducing protein structures. The predicted structures can help researchers to make sense of raw data generated by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. “I love that it helps the people that gave us the data,” Jumper adds.",

You could see the place was on the blink from halfway down Dagenham Dock Avenue, the ninth floor flashing green and opal in a lengthy, repeating rhythm. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe lobby lay silent and deserted, as they all do these days. Up on ninth, I swiped in and entered the office. Employees shimmered in their nooks like hummingbird wings, faces flipping back to front with every surge peak. Some were translucent — always a bad sign. I checked the manifest. Cubicle 18 was the locus point. First, I’d calibrate the wavefronts. Next, wrap a firewall around the entire grid, and —\n\nThe inhabitant of cubicle 18 stared up at me, mouth drawn tight with worry. Hair, skin, face — she was as human as me. Neither of us said a word. I don’t know who was more surprised.\n\n“You’re auditing?” I finally managed. “Or did they keep someone on?”\n\nShe looked like my aunt. Her lanyard said Pam Dewsbury. “Did … did they send you to remove me?”\n\nI indicated my badge. “Travis Ovis, maintenance. Where’s number 18?”\n\n“I’m number 18.”\n\nI’d heard enough. I said, “That attitude’s hardly going to help you. Don’t you know about the Time bomb?”\n\nPat gave out a sad little laugh. “Right. The Time bomb.”\n\nJust to make sure she understood, I explained the Time bomb.\n\n*****\n\nOpinion is divided as to whether the population-time-bomb theory has any real validity. It’s simple enough. Over generations, the fertility rate drops below replacement levels and economic meltdown follows. Supposedly. Growth is all.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nHence the government initiative. Multiplying the citizenry without any of the complications; expanding the horde; getting in on the ground floor. Call it what you like. Invent people to the nth degree — social security, tax codes, even birth certificates — and send your children out into the world. In this case, to the Cloudberry Tower, ninth floor.\n\nSo it came to be. And the irksome regulations stating that these citizens-without-sin must at least have a physical presence? The vested interests that pushed them through Parliament administrate the holographic technology themselves. Of course they do. Rental of their services equates to roughly the newbies’ wage. Thus, everyone’s happy.\n\nEveryone except Pam. “Oh, I know all that,” she said. “I may as well tell you, then. My son Ned helped me out. They used to call people like him hackers, I think. Now they call them data assistants. When we all got the word here about the new directives I asked him to look into alternatives.”\n\n“Did he suggest UBI?”\n\n“You think I want to spend the rest of my life on universal basic income?” Her worry was turning to righteous anger. “Playing online games all day every day so some analysis centre can extract my neural response data, no thank you.”\n\nI couldn’t waste time arguing about it. The inhabitants of the adjacent cubicles had turned a not-unpleasant crimson hue. “Look, if they don’t get you for trespassing, they’ll haul you up for inhibiting growth forecasts. What do you do here anyway? Push files around, probably. Wouldn’t you prefer putting your feet up somewhere?”\n\nShe tried too hard to look innocent. “Someone has to water the plants. And what about you? Maintenance will be shifting to automation soon enough.”\n\nI doubted she was wrong. I’d seen holograms in the backs of cabs, through the windows of ice-bars, occupying park benches, their accompanying projector drones hovering silently overhead. It seemed the Time bomb issue was well on its way to being solved. The tech companies would just have to keep an eye on runaway inflation. You don’t want wages over-matching output.\n\nI changed tack. “This is fraud, you know.” The crimson shade surrounding us deepened. “I’ll have to report your presence. Besides, you’re upsetting the transmissions.”\n\nShe turned back to her desk and swept her fingers over the touch-screen. “Let me show you what Ned turned up. It’s Travis Ovis, right?”\n\nA face swam into being. A cold lump formed in my stomach. There was no denying it — the visage was mine. I never knew I looked so good in blue.\n\n“There’s one of these for everyone,” Pam said. “Here they sit, biding their time until our overlords decide all of us are fully expendable. Ned believes they’ll even have a voting-rights override.”",

          "authors": "Nicola Jones",
          "abstract": "Will computers ever match or surpass human-level intelligence — and, if so, how? When the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), based in Washington DC, asked its members earlier this year whether neural networks — the current star of artificial-intelligence systems — alone will be enough to hit this goal, the vast majority said no. Instead, most said, a heavy dose of an older kind of AI will be needed to get these systems up to par: symbolic AI.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nSometimes called ‘good old-fashioned AI’, symbolic AI is based on formal rules and an encoding of the logical relationships between concepts1. Mathematics is symbolic, for example, as are ‘if–then’ statements and computer coding languages such as Python, along with flow charts or Venn diagrams that map how, say, cats, mammals and animals are conceptually related. Decades ago, symbolic systems were an early front-runner in the AI effort. However, in the early 2010s, they were vastly outpaced by more-flexible neural networks. These machine-learning models excel at learning from vast amounts of data, and underlie large language models (LLMs), as well as chatbots such as ChatGPT.\n\nNow, however, the computer-science community is pushing hard for a better and bolder melding of the old and the new. ‘Neurosymbolic AI’ has become the hottest buzzword in town. Brandon Colelough, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, has charted the meteoric rise of the concept in academic papers (see ‘Going up and up’). These reveal a spike of interest in neurosymbolic AI that started in around 2021 and shows no sign of slowing down2.\n\nPlenty of researchers are heralding the trend as an escape from what they see as an unhealthy monopoly of neural networks in AI research, and expect the shift to deliver smarter and more reliable AI.\n\nA better melding of these two strategies could lead to artificial general intelligence (AGI): AI that can reason and generalize its knowledge from one situation to another as well as humans do. It might also be useful for high-risk applications, such as military or medical decision-making, says Colelough. Because symbolic AI is transparent and understandable to humans, he says, it doesn’t suffer from the ‘black box’ syndrome that can make neural networks hard to trust.\n\nSource: updated from ref. 2\n\nThere are already good examples of neurosymbolic AI, including Google DeepMind’s AlphaGeometry, a system reported last year3 that can reliably solve maths Olympiad problems — questions aimed at talented secondary-school students. But working out how best to combine neural networks and symbolic AI into an all-purpose system is a formidable challenge.\n\n“You’re really architecting this kind of two-headed beast,” says computer scientist William Regli, also at the University of Maryland.\n\nWar of words\n\nIn 2019, computer scientist Richard Sutton posted a short essay entitled ‘The bitter lesson’ on his blog (see go.nature.com/4paxykf). In it, he argued that, since the 1950s, people have repeatedly assumed that the best way to make intelligent computers is to feed them with all the insights that humans have arrived at about the rules of the world, in fields from physics to social behaviour. The bitter pill to swallow, wrote Sutton, is that time and time again, symbolic methods have been outdone by systems that use a ton of raw data and scaled-up computational power to leverage ‘search and learning’. Early chess-playing computers, for example, that were trained on human-devised strategies were outperformed by those that were simply fed lots of game data.\n\nThis lesson has been widely quoted by proponents of neural networks to support the idea that making these systems ever-bigger is the best path to AGI. But many researchers argue that the essay overstates its case and downplays the crucial part that symbolic systems can and do play in AI. For example, the best chess program today, Stockfish, pairs a neural network with a symbolic tree of allowable moves.\n\nAI models that lie, cheat and plot murder: how dangerous are LLMs really?\n\nNeural nets and symbolic algorithms both have pros and cons. Neural networks are made up of layers of nodes with weighted connections that are adjusted during training to recognize patterns and learn from data. They are fast and creative, but they are also bound to make things up and can’t reliably answer questions beyond the scope of their training data.\n\nSymbolic systems, meanwhile, struggle to encompass ‘messy’ concepts, such as human language, that involve vast rule databases that are difficult to build and slow to search. But their workings are clear, and they are good at reasoning, using logic to apply their general knowledge to fresh situations.\n\nWhen put to use in the real world, neural networks that lack symbolic knowledge make classic mistakes: image generators might draw people with six fingers on each hand because they haven’t learnt the general concept that hands typically have five; video generators struggle to make a ball bounce around a scene because they haven’t learnt that gravity pulls things downwards. Some researchers blame such mistakes on a lack of data or computing power, but others say that the mistakes illustrate neural networks’ fundamental inability to generalize knowledge and reason logically.\n\nMany argue that adding symbolism to neural nets might be the best — even the only — way to inject logical reasoning into AI. The global technology firm IBM, for example, is backing neurosymbolic techniques as a path to AGI. But others remain sceptical: Yann LeCun, one of the fathers of modern AI and chief AI scientist at tech giant Meta, has said that neurosymbolic approaches are “incompatible” with neural-network learning.\n\nCan AI be truly creative?\n\nSutton, who is at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and won the 2024 Turing prize, the equivalent of the Nobel prize for computer science, holds firm to his original argument: “The bitter lesson still applies to today’s AI,” he told Nature. This suggests, he says, that “adding a symbolic, more manually crafted element is probably a mistake”.\n\nGary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur, writer and cognitive scientist based in Vancouver, Canada, and one of the most vocal advocates of neurosymbolic AI, tends to frame this difference of opinions as a philosophical battle that is now being settled in his favour.\n\nOthers, such as roboticist Leslie Kaelbling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, say that arguments over which view is right are a distraction, and that people should just get on with whatever works. “I’m a magpie. I’ll do anything that makes my robots better.”\n\nMix and match\n\nBeyond the fact that neurosymbolic AI aims to meld the benefits of neural nets with the benefits of symbolism, its definition is blurry. Neurosymbolic AI encompasses “a very large universe”, says Marcus, “of which we’ve explored only a tiny bit”.\n\nThere are many broad approaches, which people have attempted to categorize in various ways. One option highlighted by many is the use of symbolic techniques to improve neural nets4. AlphaGeometry is arguably one of the most sophisticated examples of this strategy: it trains a neural net on a synthetic data set of maths problems produced using a symbolic computer language, making the solutions easier to check and ensuring fewer mistakes. It combines the two elegantly, says Colelough. In another example, ‘logic tensor networks’ provide a way to encode symbolic logic for neural networks. Statements can be assigned a fuzzy-truth value5: a number somewhere between 1 (true) and 0 (false). This provides a framework of rules to help the system reason.\n\nAnother broad approach does what some would say is the reverse, using neural nets to finesse symbolic algorithms. One problem with symbolic knowledge databases is that they are often so large that they take a very long time to search: the ‘tree’ of all possible moves in a game of Go, for example, contains about 10170 positions, which is unfeasibly large to crunch through. Neural networks can be trained to predict the most promising subset of moves, allowing the system to cut down how much of the ‘tree’ it has to search, and thus speeding up the time it takes to settle on the best move. That’s what Google’s AlphaGo did when it famously outperformed a Go grandmaster.",

Their discussions cover theatrical performances in ancient Greece, plagues and gas attacks in the First World War and present-day urban smog and surgery, while addressing the crucial issue of mask efficacy.\n\nThe Maya Myths\n\nMallory E. Matsumoto Thames & Hudson (2025)\n\nDeciphering Mesoamerica’s ancient Maya hieroglyphs was a fascinating achievement of the twentieth century. But “about one-third” of some 1,000 distinct hieroglyphs “remain to be deciphered”, notes anthropologist Mallory Matsumoto in her intriguing book about ancient Maya myths. The logical structure of the Maya calendar, which could accurately predict astronomical phenomena such as eclipses, is clear, as is the Maya’s preoccupation with the natural world.

These leeches are just millimetres long and are symbionts — meaning they live in a close, long-term association with their host. They feed on microorganisms and debris that collect on the host’s surface. In small numbers, they help to keep the crayfish clean, but in large colonies, they can become mildly parasitic.\n\nHere, I’ve just caught a crayfish under torchlight, and I’m holding it carefully so that the symbionts aren’t washed away.

          "title": "What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution",
          "authors": "Blaise Agüera y Arcas",
          "abstract": "Ten years ago, I would have turned my nose up at the idea that we already understood how to get machines to think. In the 2010s, my team at Google Research was working on a wide variety of artificial-intelligence models, including the next-word predictor that powers the keyboard on Android smartphones. Artificial neural networks of the sort we were training were finally solving long-standing challenges in visual perception, speech recognition, game playing and many other domains. But it seemed absurd to me that a mere next-word predictor could ever truly understand new concepts, write jokes, debug code or do any of the myriad other things that are hallmarks of human intelligence.\n\n‘Solving’ this kind of intelligence would surely require some fundamentally new scientific insight. And that would probably be inspired by neuroscience — the study of the only known embodiment of general intelligence, the brain.\n\nScience and the new age of AI: a Nature special\n\nMy views back then were comfortably within the scientific mainstream, but in retrospect were also tinged with snobbery. My training was in physics and computational neuroscience, and I found the Silicon Valley hype distasteful at times. The cultish view that Moore’s law — the observation that computing power increases exponentially over time — would solve not only every technological problem, but also all social and scientific ones, seemed naive to me. It was the epitome of the mindset “when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.\n\nI was wrong. In 2019, colleagues at Google trained a massive (for the time) next-word predictor — technically, a next-token predictor, with each token corresponding to a word fragment — codenamed Meena1. It seemed able, albeit haltingly, to understand new concepts, write jokes, make logical arguments and much else. Meena’s scaled-up successor, LaMDA, did better2. This trend has continued since. In 2025, we find ourselves in the rather comical situation of expecting such large language models to respond fluently, intelligently, responsibly and accurately to all sorts of esoteric questions and demands that humans would fail to answer. People get irritated when these systems fail to answer appropriately — while simultaneously debating when artificial general intelligence will arrive.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nLarge language models can be unreliable and say dumb things, but then, so can humans. Their strengths and weaknesses are certainly different from ours. But we are running out of intelligence tests that humans can pass reliably and AI models cannot. By those benchmarks, and if we accept that intelligence is essentially computational — the view held by most computational neuroscientists — we must accept that a working ‘simulation’ of intelligence actually is intelligence. There was no profound discovery that suddenly made obviously non-intelligent machines intelligent: it did turn out to be a matter of scaling computation.\n\nOther researchers disagree with my assessment of where we are with AI. But in what follows, I want to accept the premise that intelligent machines are already here, and turn the mirror back on ourselves. If scaling up computation yields AI, could the kind of intelligence shown by living organisms, humans included, also be the result of computational scaling? If so, what drove that — and how did living organisms become computational in the first place?\n\nOver the past several years, a growing group of collaborators and I have begun to find some tentative, but exciting answers. AI, biological intelligence and, indeed, life itself might all have emerged from the same process. This insight could shed fresh light not just on AI, neuroscience and neurophilosophy, but also on theoretical biology, evolution and complexity science. Moreover, it would give us a glimpse of how human and machine intelligence are destined to co-evolve in the future.\n\nPredictive brains\n\nThe idea that brains are essentially prediction machines isn’t new. German physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz advanced it in the nineteenth century in his Treatise on Physiological Optics (1867). The idea was developed further by the founders of cybernetics, especially US mathematician Norbert Wiener, in the early 1940s — a starting point of modern, neural-net-based AI research.\n\nWiener realized3 that all living systems have ‘purposive’ behaviours to stay alive, and that such actions require computational modelling. Our internal and external senses enable us to compute predictive models, both of ourselves and of our environment. But these are useful only if we can act to affect the future — specifically, to increase the odds that we will still be a thriving part of it. Evolution selects for entities that use predictions to make the best survival decisions. The actions we take, and the observations that ensue, become part of our past experience, creating a feedback loop that enables us to make further predictions.\n\nHunting is a prime example of this predictive modelling. A predator must predict actions that will get the prey into its stomach; the prey must predict the predator’s behaviour to stop that from happening. Starting in the 1970s, neuropsychologists and anthropologists began to realize that other intelligent entities are often the most important parts of the environment to model — because they are the ones modelling you back, whether with friendly or hostile intent4. Increasingly intelligent predators put evolutionary pressure on their prey to become smarter, and vice versa.\n\nThe hunting behaviour of whales is the product of a shared, social intelligence.Credit: Nick Garbutt/NaturePL\n\nThe pressures towards intelligence become even more intense for members of social species. Winning mates, sharing resources, gaining followers, teaching, learning and dividing labour: all of these involve modelling and predicting the minds of others. But the more intelligent you become — the better to predict the minds of others (at least in theory) — the more intelligent, and thus hard to predict, those others have also become, because they are of the same species and doing the same thing. These runaway dynamics produce ‘intelligence explosions’: the rapid evolutionary increases in brain size that have been observed in highly social animals, including bats, whales and dolphins, birds and our own ancestors.\n\nDuring a social intelligence explosion, individuals get smarter, but so do groups. Bigger brains can model more relationships, allowing groups to become larger while retaining social cohesion. Sharing and division of labour enable these larger social units to do much more than individuals can on their own.\n\nTake humans. Individually, we aren’t much smarter than our primate ancestors. Humans raised in the wild, like the fictional Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book (1894), would seem unexceptional relative to the forest’s other large-ish animals — if, indeed, they survive at all. But in large numbers, humans can achieve many improbably complex feats beyond any individual’s cognitive or physical capacity: transplanting organs, travelling to the Moon, manufacturing silicon chips. These feats require cooperation, thinking in parallel and division of labour. They are group-level phenomena, and can justifiably be called superhuman.\n\nSymbiogenic transitions\n\nWhat applies to human sociality arguably also applies to every previous major evolutionary transition throughout life’s history on Earth. These include the transition from simple prokaryotic cells to more-complex eukaryotic ones, from single-celled life to multicellular organisms, and from solitary insects to colony-dwellers. In each case, entities that previously led independent lives entered into a close symbiosis, dividing labour and working in parallel to create a super-entity5.\n\nAI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that this ‘symbiogenesis’ is much more common than has generally been supposed. Horizontal gene transfer between cells, the incorporation of a useful retroviral element into a host’s genome and symbiotic bacteria establishing themselves in an animal’s gut are commonplace examples that would not count as ‘major’ transitions. Yet they have certainly produced organisms with innovative capabilities. The ability of termites to digest wood, for instance, depends entirely on enzymes produced by symbiotic microorganisms. The formation of the placental barrier in humans depends on syncytin, a protein derived from the envelope of a retrovirus that fused into the mammalian germ line tens of millions of years ago.\n\nStandard Darwinian evolution, involving the familiar mechanisms of mutation and selection, has no intrinsic bias towards increasing complexity. It is this less familiar mechanism of symbiogenesis that gives evolution its arrow of time: life progresses from simple to more-complex forms when existing parts merge to form new super-entities. This process speeds up over time, as the catalogue of parts available to be combined afresh increases in size and sophistication. Over the past billion years, symbiogenesis has produced increasingly complex nervous systems, colonies of social animals — and eventually our own technological society.\n\nIs this nature’s version of Moore’s law? Yes and no. As originally formulated in 1965 by US engineer Gordon Moore, the co-founder of chip company Intel, the ‘law’ states that transistor size shrinks exponentially6. This translates into exponential declines in computer size, cost and power consumption, and exponential increases in operating speed.\n\nBiological cells have not become exponentially smaller or faster throughout evolution. The advent of electrically excitable neurons sometime around 650 million years ago introduced a fast new computational timescale, but that was a one-off: since then, neurons have not become faster or smaller, nor have their energetic requirements decreased. This does not obviously resemble Moore’s law as it played out in the twentieth century.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nBut look at the law in the twenty-first century, and a connection becomes more apparent. Since around 2006, transistors have continued to shrink, but the rise in semiconductor operating speed has stalled. To keep increasing computer performance, chip-makers are instead adding more processing cores. They began, in other words, to parallelize silicon-based computation. It’s no coincidence that this is when modern, neural-net-based AI models finally began to take off. Practically speaking, neural nets require massively parallel processing; for a single modern processor to sequentially perform the trillion or so operations needed for a state-of-the-art large language model to predict the next token in a sequence would take minutes.\n\nThis starts to look a lot more like the story of biological intelligence. AI emerged not through speed alone, but from a division of labour arising from the cooperation of many simple computational elements running in parallel: what we might term technological symbiogenesis.\n\nIn this context, computer science is a natural science as well as an engineering discipline. Humans did not invent computation any more than they did electric current or optical lenses. We merely re-discovered a phenomenon nature had already exploited, developed mathematical theories to understand it better and worked out how to engineer it on a different substrate. Our phones, laptops and data centres could aptly be called ‘artificial computers’.\n\nComputogenesis\n\nIf symbiogenesis explains the evolution of natural computational complexity and the emergence of intelligence, how and why did nature first become computational? Work that I and colleagues have been doing on artificial life over the past couple of years helps to clarify this.\n\nTo set the scene, imagine an enormous variety of randomly configured feedback mechanisms that are simple enough to arise spontaneously in a thermally variable environment such as that of Earth. Now, assume that each of these mechanisms can work only within some narrow temperature range. After a while, the mechanisms that persist will be the ones that work as thermostats, maintaining their temperature within the right range, so that they can continue to operate. This thought experiment illustrates how purposive behaviour, oriented towards self-preservation — a kind of proto-life — can emerge from random initial conditions.\n\nEven a thermostat is, by definition, performing a computation: it implements a behaviour (turn the heat on or off) that is conditional on an information input (the temperature). Thus, a minimal kind of computation — perhaps nothing more than an ‘if … then’ operation — will arise and persist whenever the output can affect the likelihood of whatever is doing the computation continuing to exist.\n\nThis kind of simple operation is still a long way from a general-purpose computer, which was defined by English computing pioneer Alan Turing using a theoretical construct we refer to today as a universal Turing machine. It consists of a ‘head’ that can move left or right along a tape, reading, writing and erasing symbols on that tape according to a table of rules. Turing realized that a rule table can also be encoded as a sequence of symbols on the tape — what we’d now call a program. Certain rule tables exist that will cause the machine to read that program from the tape, performing any computation it specifies.\n\nHumans and machines exist in a mutually dependent technological symbiosis.Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty",

A gel-based synthetic tongue can give a ranking of foods’ spiciness without human discomfort.Credit: AFP/Getty\n\nA gel-based artificial tongue can determine the spiciness of a wide range of foods, from the forgiving bell pepper to the more formidable ‘facing heaven’ chilli of Sichuan cuisine.\n\nThe device, as the researchers report1 in ACS Sensors, might be the secret to determining the heat levels of spicy foods without risking any human taste buds.\n\nThe artificial tongue itself is not a new feat. Scientists have created similar devices that can use electronic sensors to detect sweet, sour, spicy and umami tastes. But the authors of the new paper wanted to focus on spiciness in particular and to measure spice levels as precisely as possible, which is especially important for quality control in food, says co-author Jing Hu, a chemical engineer at the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai.\n\nTaming the burn\n\nThe team’s solution was “inspired by the spicy-neutralizing effect of milk”, they write in the paper. Milk “proteins that affect our perception of spiciness” relieve the burn of a spicy dish, explains Carolyn Ross, a food scientist at Washington State University in Pullman.\n\nThe synthetic tongue is made of a gel that contains milk powder, acrylic acid and choline chloride. When a current is applied to the gel, its chloride and hydrogen ions can conduct electricity because they are mobile. To monitor changes in conductivity, the scientists placed the gel between copper sheets and connected the whole contraption to a workstation that measures the electric current.\n\nCapsaicin — the compound that gives chilli peppers their spice — interacts with the milk proteins in the gel to form bulky complexes that disrupt ion flow. As a result, when the tongue encounters capsaicin, its conductivity drops.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Suriya Silsaksom/Alamy\n\nPigeons can sense Earth’s magnetic field by detecting tiny electrical currents in their inner ears, researchers suggest. Such an inner compass could help to explain how certain animals can achieve astonishing feats of long-distance navigation.\n\nThe team performed advanced brain mapping as well single-cell RNA sequencing of pigeon inner-ear cells. Both lines of evidence point to the inner ear as the birds’ ‘magnetoreception’ organ. The results appeared in the Science on 20 November 1.\n\n“This is probably the clearest demonstration of the neural pathways responsible for magnetic processing in any animal,” says Eric Warrant, a sensory biology researcher at the University of Lund in Sweden. Studies have suggested that various animals, including turtles, trout and robins, can sense the direction and strength of magnetic fields, although the evidence has sometimes been contested — and the mechanisms have remained controversial.\n\nBird-brained navigation\n\nTwo leading hypotheses have led the research into how birds sense magnetic fields. One is a quantum-physics effect in retina cells where birds ‘see’ magnetic fields. Another is that microscopic iron oxide particles in the beak could act as tiny compass needles. However, it’s largely unknown where magnetic information is sensed in animals’ brains and how sensory neurons confer sensitivity to electromagnetic changes.\n\nIn 2011, researchers found hints that magnetic fields triggered pigeons’ vestibular system, the organ that enables vertebrates to sense accelerations (including gravity) and helps them to stay balanced2. The structure is made of three fluid-filled loops which are mutually perpendicular, so they can communicate to the brain the direction of an acceleration by breaking it down into three ‘x, y, z’ components.\n\nCompass protein attracts heap of criticism\n\nDavid Keays, a neuroscientist at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, designed an experiment that could reveal how pigeons’ brains respond to magnetic fields.\n\nKeays’ team exposed pigeons to a magnetic field slightly stronger than Earth’s for just over an hour. The birds’ heads were immobilized and the magnetic field was continually rotated to simulate the heads’ motions with respect to Earth’s geomagnetic field.\n\nNext, the team used a method for measuring activation patterns of neurons across the brain — by measuring a genetic marker of cell activity in pigeon brains made transparent by a technique called clearing. Maps of brain activity in birds that had been exposed to magnetic fields were compared to a control group that had not been exposed to magnetic fields.\n\nThe results showed neuronal activity related to magnetic fields in the brain region that receives input from the vestibular system, as well as in regions that help to integrate various sensory stimuli. This result narrowed down the list of potential compasses to one — the vestibular system — although it did not explain how pigeon neurons can physically sense magnetic fields.\n\nA magnetic sense organ\n\nIn principle, a conducting material in an organism could produce electric currents in response to magnetic fields, giving an animal a ‘magnetic sense’ — a mechanism that has been proposed as early as 1882 by French zoologist Camille Viguier3.\n\nIn previous research, Keays had looked for a molecular mechanism of this magnetoreception by following inspiration from the biophysics of sharks and skates, which have organs that sense minute electric fields to help them find prey4. These animals express a protein sensitive to changes in neurons’ electrical activity, but modified with a 10-amino-acid-long insertion that allows them to sense electrical currents generated from magnetic fields.\n\nFruit flies’ ability to sense magnetic fields thrown into doubt",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Conferences offer researchers from under-represented backgrounds a chance to network.Credit: Dave Kotinsky/Getty\n\nSeveral US conferences that bring together scientists from under-represented groups have seen their attendance levels drop this year, in the wake of funding cuts and directives from the administration of US President Donald Trump targeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nSuch conferences typically provide crucial networking opportunities for scientists from marginalized backgrounds, including Black, Latino and Indigenous researchers. Fewer people attending this year means fewer chances for students and scientists to advance their careers, says Allen Pierre-Louis, a physicist and PhD student at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “This is another leak in the pipeline that was already not in a great place.”\n\nScientific conferences are leaving the US amid border fears\n\nThe crowds have been noticeably thinner than usual at some major conferences held in the past few months. Fewer than 700 scientists — compared with last year’s 1,100 — gathered last week at a joint meeting of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) in San Jose, California. And last month, there were only a few thousand attendees, rather than the usual 5,000–6,000, at a multidisciplinary science conference in Columbus, Ohio, organized by the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).\n\nFederal agencies that would normally have exhibit booths at such meetings to promote their research, as well as staff members on site to speak to prospective employees, were also not present. Federal funding that is normally available to pay for students’ travel to these conferences has also dried up.\n\n“Investing in these students isn’t ‘charity’ — it’s essential for the nation’s scientific future,” says Mario Borunda, a physicist at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater and the NSHP president. “If we exclude brilliant minds because they can’t afford a plane ticket or because they don’t see themselves represented in the field, the US loses that talent forever.”\n\nProjects cancelled\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that directed the government to terminate programmes related to DEI, which it called “illegal and immoral discrimination”. Agencies soon began cancelling projects, affecting a wide swathe of researchers. One of those agencies was NASA, which terminated a US$530,000 grant that was meant to support the NSBP/NSHP meeting over three years.\n\nThat and other cuts left the conference with none of the federal funding it usually relies on, says Stephen Roberson, the NSBP president. “The reason given for this behaviour is because our organization is considered a DEI organization instead of a scientific non-profit organization,” he says. NASA did not respond to a request for comment from Nature.\n\nTrump called for ‘gold-standard science’: how the NIH, NSF and others are answering\n\nBecause of the cuts, the conference had to cut back on travel, lodging and other support it usually provides to students and other attendees. Without that support, “the costs become prohibitive for many people”, says Pierre-Louis, who is the student council representative on the NSBP board. “I think it sends a message to the country about who is doing science and is seen as being worthy of doing science.”\n\nThere is no ‘woke’ agenda to the meeting, Borunda notes: conference registration is open to anyone, and the talks are on scientific topics, including quantum and plasma physics. “There is a sense of solidarity here that remains strong,” he says.\n\nThe SACNAS conference, a meeting officially known as NDiSTEM, was held in Columbus last month, but many federal agencies and industry partners withdrew from participating because of Trump’s DEI directive and budget cuts, says the organization’s executive director, Juan Amador. One immediate consequence was that the conference lost much of the content meant to connect students with the latest in artificial intelligence (AI) research happening at government agencies and in the private sector. “With them being gone we didn’t have a whole lot of AI — that puts the students behind,” Amador says.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "CAR T cells (pictured) are being used to treat autoimmune diseases.Credit: Eye Of Science/SPL\n\nEngineered immune cells are being used to successfully treat people with a range of debilitating autoimmune conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used to treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.\n\nCAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.\n\nThe use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells1. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment2, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.\n\nSimon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms any more,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”\n\nCAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for several types of cancer since it was first approved to treat blood cancers in 2017.\n\nA new frontier\n\nUlcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.\n\nIn September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis3. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.\n\nEarlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus4. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs5. Last year, Du was also involved in a world-first study of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases6.\n\nAs part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.\n\nThe results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Some German universities, such as the University of Hamburg, are trying to add more permanent research positions.Westend61 / Getty Images\n\nAfter 13 years of jumping between temporary contracts at German institutions, Dorothée Goetze, who was a history postdoc, was fed up. So in 2021, when she was offered a full-time, permanent lecturing position at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall she leapt at the opportunity.\n\nPart of the reason for leaving was simple: the permanence of the new post, a rarity both in and outside Germany. But Goetze says that there were other troubling aspects of German academia that led her to expand her job search. “When I started to look at other countries, I realized that there are other ways to structure an academic system.”\n\nAlthough Germany has become a hub for international students and researchers, attracting a growing number of foreign scholars each year, those who remain in academia after graduation often face an intensely hierarchical system with few permanent positions. This has led many, including Goetze, to search for jobs at universities and research institutions outside the country — or, in some cases, to leave academia completely.\n\nNature Career Guide: Germany\n\nLast year, the Postdoc Network of the Max Planck Society published a survey of close to 900 postdocs from 74 of the 85 Max Planck Institutes, in which only one-quarter of international respondents said that they were sure they wanted to stay in Germany after their postdoc (see go.nature.com/486jceo). A similar survey by the postdoc network of the Leibniz Association revealed that some 42% of respondents had considered moving abroad (see go.nature.com/3xesmtz).\n\n“There are a lot of good reasons to embark on a PhD or research career in Germany,” says Shyam Krishnan, a stem-cell biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology in Jena, Germany, and a spokesperson for the Leibniz PostDoc Network. These include the country’s globally respected research profile and ample opportunities for funding and collaborations, according to Krishnan.\n\nHowever, it is not always possible for early-career researchers to take advantage of these benefits — for example, most are on short-term contracts that don’t align with the long grant-application processes, Krishnan says. “When it comes to career paths, it becomes really difficult, especially for people coming from abroad.”\n\nA popular destination\n\nIn 2025, Germany had the fourth highest number of international students globally, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a figure totalling around 423,000 people.\n\nThe number of international students in Germany has steadily increased in the past decade, thanks to factors such as the affordability of education, a high quality of life and employment opportunities after graduation. Between 2013 and 2023, the Wissenschaft weltoffen report — using data from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) — highlighted a 74% rise in the number of foreign students enrolled at German universities. The majority of these individuals were in bachelor’s or master’s programmes.\n\nA structured system: the secrets of Germany’s scientific reputation\n\nInternational scholars are also common at the postdoctoral level and above. In 2022, foreign nationals made up around 15% of academic staff members across German universities — encompassing all roles from graduate-student research assistants to professors. At the Max Planck institutes, which employ the highest proportion of foreign scholars, more than half of the researchers come from abroad.\n\nThese numbers will probably continue to rise. In the past few months alone, there have been several announcements of initiatives aimed at recruiting international students and scholars. In October, for example, the DAAD launched Academic Horizons, a funding programme that helps universities to attract international scholars to master’s and doctoral programmes in disciplines such as artificial intelligence and quantum technology.\n\nThere are also several efforts aimed at attracting talent from the United States, where cuts to science funding and decreased workforce numbers have led many researchers to consider leaving the country. The Volkswagen Foundation, for example, recently announced the Transatlantic Bridge Professorships, which will provide financial support for US-based professors who are working on topics such as democracy and academic freedom to conduct their work in Germany.\n\nTo stay or to leave?\n\nAlthough Germany is an attractive destination for scholars, those who remain in the academic system after their doctoral studies face notable challenges. Two of the frequently cited issues are a lack of job security, owing to the lack of permanent positions, and a strictly hierarchical system that places a disproportionate amount of power in the hands of a few.\n\nIn German academia, short-term contracts are the norm: according to the 2025 National Report on Early Career Researchers (known as the BuWik), a mere 4% of early-career researchers are not on a temporary contract (see go.nature.com/4i78g4o). Older and more-experienced researchers tend to be in more permanent positions — this includes 38% of doctorate holders aged between 40 and 45 and 28% of junior research group leaders.\n\nAre these the happiest PhD students in the world?\n\nIn a bid to alleviate this problem, the German government passed the Academic Fixed-Term Contract Act in 2007 (also known as the Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz, or WissZeitVG; see go.nature.com/48kzoyl). This law limits the time that early-career researchers can be placed on fixed-term contracts to, in most cases, six years pre-PhD and six years post-PhD (nine years after medicine PhDs), with the intention of encouraging universities to hire these researchers permanently, rather than keeping them temporarily employed indefinitely.\n\nHowever, critics of the WissZeitVG argue that it backfired because it failed to lead to a growth in permanent positions. They say that it instead forces researchers out of academia — leading to knock-on effects such as lower-quality research and a loss of qualified personnel. “What universities do in most cases is say, ‘We cannot employ you temporarily any more, so we won’t employ you,’” says Mathias Kuhnt, a sociology postdoc at the Dresden University of Technology.\n\nIn some fields, such as social science and the humanities, contracts are not only short-term; they’re also often part-time. Amrei Bahr, a philosopher at the University of Stuttgart, has had fixed-term, mostly part-time contracts during and after her doctoral studies. Now, with her non-tenure-track junior professorship, Bahr is on a four-year contract with a possible two-year extension. “If I get the two years, I will be 42 once this is over,” Bahr says. “Then I will probably drop out.” Bahr is currently applying for other, longer-term professorships, but given the dearth of these positions, dropping out of academia is a likely outcome.\n\nPlanning an exit\n\nBahr is not alone. In 2024, the DZHW published a Barometer for Science report — a nationwide survey that included more than 11,000 academics in Germany — which revealed that 57% of researchers had contemplated leaving academia in the past two years (see go.nature.com/3jdogk0). Among postdocs on fixed-term contracts (which make up the majority), this rose to 71%. Work–life balance, workload and the WissZeitVG were cited as contributing factors.\n\nHistorian Astrid Wendel-Hanson left Germany for a position with a longer-term contract.Marten Puidak\n\n“Germany is incredibly valuable in terms of the resources it has for academics,” says Astrid Wendel-Hanson, a historian who moved to Germany after her PhD, but left earlier this year after accepting a position as an associate professor at Tallin University in Estonia. “But it can be very difficult to stay optimistic and to remain in a system that seems to actively be trying to push you away.” Although one of the reasons for the move was to be closer to family, Wendel-Hanson’s new contract is four years long — longer than what would be permitted under the WissZeitVG.\n\nGermany is not the only country with precarious employment in academia, however. According to a 2024 OECD report, in Australia, casual hires — those on hourly or seasonal contracts — make up the majority of academic staff members, and in the United States, part-time and non-tenure-track positions are increasingly becoming the norm (OECD. The State of Academic Careers in OECD Countries; 2024).",

          "authors": "Liam Drew",
          "abstract": "A brain–computer interface developed by neurotechnology firm Paradromics contains electrodes that record from neurons in the cerebral cortex and then convert the information into intended speech patterns.Credit: Paradromics\n\nParadromics, a neurotechnology developer, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a first long-term clinical trial of its brain–computer interface (BCI). Early next year, the company — one of the closet rivals to Elon Musk’s neurotechnology firm Neuralink — will implant its device into two volunteers who were left unable to speak owing to neurological diseases and injuries. It has two goals: to ensure the device is safe; and to restore a person’s ability to communicate with real-time speech.\n\n“We’re very excited about bringing this new hardware into a trial,” says Matt Angle, chief executive of Paradromics, which is based in Austin, Texas.\n\nParadromics’ BCI has an active area of roughly 7.5 millimetres in diameter of thin, stiff, platinum–iridium electrodes that penetrate the surface of the cerebral cortex to record from individual neurons around 1.5 mm deep. This is then connected by wire to a power source and wireless transceiver implanted in an individual’s chest.\n\nInitially, the two volunteers will each have one electrode array implanted in the area of the motor cortex that controls the lips, tongue and larynx, Angle says. Neural activity will then be recorded from this region as the study participants imagine speaking sentences that are presented to them. Following previous work by researchers who are now collaborating with Paradromics1, the system learns what patterns of neural activity correspond to each intended speech sound.\n\nWhen participants imagine speaking, these neural patterns will be converted into text on a screen for participants to approve, or into a real-time voice output based on old recordings of participants’ own voices.\n\nThis is the first BCI clinical trial to formally target synthetic-voice generation. “Arguably, the greatest quality of life change you can deliver right now with BCI is communication,” Angle says.\n\nElon Musk’s Neuralink brain chip: what scientists think of first human trial\n\nThe trial will also explore whether the system can reliably detect activity from imagined hand movements that would enable an individual to control a computer cursor. Depending on initial results, the trial could extend to ten volunteers, with these participants receiving two cortical implants to increase signal richness and to access other brain areas, says Angle.\n\n“I’m very curious. It’s an exciting step,” says Mariska Vansteensel, a BCI researcher at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. “For the field to move forward towards clinical applications, a fully implantable system is the only way to go.”\n\nNeuralink rivals\n\nParadromics is now one of several companies testing an implanted BCI system that is similar to what it intends to market in a long-term trial. Several more companies hope to follow suit soon.\n\nFurthest along is Synchron, a BCI company in New York City, and its device Stentrode. By incorporating 12–16 electrodes into a device that is based on an endovascular stent, the Stentrode records the average activity of a neuronal population from inside a blood vessel. Initial trials utilized a vessel in the motor cortex to allow users to select onscreen options by imagining that they are moving their foot.\n\nNeuralink has prioritized obtaining high-bandwidth signals by recording outputs from many single neurons. Its BCI consists of 64 flexible polymer threads, each with 16 recording sites. In the company’s initial trial, it targeted the region of the motor cortex that controls the hand. Users controlled computers and robotic hands with their thoughts, and the company has regularly reported that it is able to transfer information from people’s brains to computers at record-breaking speeds.\n\nA clinical trial will assess the safety and durability of Paradromics’ brain–computer interface after it has been surgically implanted into the brains of two volunteers.Credit: University of Michigan\n\nOther systems in development include several BCIs that place high-density electrodes on the brain’s surface to record the average activity of underlying neuronal populations.\n\nAs long-term trials now progress, clinicians and neuroscientists will be watching and comparing devices. Vansteensel says she hopes companies will be fully transparent and that, in time, they will make their devices available to academics to conduct independent studies.",

          "title": "ADHD diagnoses are growing. What’s going on?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "In some parts of the world, record numbers of people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the United States, for example, government researchers last year reported that more than 11% of children had received an ADHD diagnosis at some point in their lives1 — a sharp increase from 2003, when around 8% of children had (see ‘ADHD among US boys and girls’).\n\nWhy is autism really on the rise? What the science says\n\nBut now, top US health officials argue that diagnoses have spiralled out of control. In May, the Make America Healthy Again Commission — led by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — said ADHD was part of a “crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment” and suggested that ADHD medications did not help children in the long term.\n\nSo what, exactly, is going on?\n\nOne thing that’s clear is that several factors — including improved detection and greater awareness of ADHD — are causing people with symptoms to receive a diagnosis and treatment, whereas they wouldn’t have years earlier. Clinicians say this is especially true for women and girls, whose pattern of symptoms was often missed in the past. Although some specialists are concerned about the risks of overdiagnosis, many are more worried that too many people go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nAt the same time, the rise in awareness and diagnoses of ADHD has fuelled a public debate about how it should be viewed and how best to provide support, including when medication is required. The emergence of the neurodiversity movement is challenging the view of ADHD as a disorder that should be ‘treated’, and instead proposes that it’s a difference that should be better understood and supported — with more focus on adapting schools and workplaces, for instance.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\n“I do have a big problem with ‘disorder’,” says Jeff Karp, a biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who has ADHD. “It’s the school system that’s disordered. It’s not the kids.”\n\nBut many clinicians and people with ADHD argue that it is associated with difficulties — ranging from academic struggles to an increased chance of injuries and substance misuse — that justify its label as a medical condition, and say that medication is an important and effective part of therapy for many people.\n\n“I hear a lot of people talking about ADHD being a gift and a superpower, and I do applaud that,” says Jeremy Didier, a clinician specializing in ADHD who is president of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a non-profit US group based in Lanham, Maryland, and who has ADHD herself. “But I do not want to downplay the impact that ADHD can have on someone’s life when it’s either undiagnosed or poorly managed.”\n\nShe and others say both models — neurodiversity and medical — have merit. “Bringing those two together in a meaningful and productive way, I think that’s maybe the biggest challenge” for the field, says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n\nA real rise\n\nA slew of studies suggests that diagnoses of ADHD have gone up in many high-income countries in the past two to three decades — similar to a rise in autism diagnoses (see ‘ADHD on the rise’). The rate of new ADHD diagnoses in the United Kingdom, for example, doubled in boys and quadrupled in girls between 2000 and 2018, according to one study2. In adults, the rate shot up even more. “We have numbers suggesting that we’re seeing a rise,” says Max Wiznitzer, a paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSource: US CDC NHIS Annu. Rep. (https://go.nature.com/3XEGYXJ).\n\nSo what explains the surge? It doesn’t seem to be a big rise in the prevalence of the symptoms and traits that characterize ADHD — namely hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, researchers say. When scientists use standard procedures to rigorously assess symptoms in representative samples of a population, they find that the ‘true’ prevalence of ADHD is fairly consistent in different parts of the world — estimated at around 5.4% in children3 and 2.6% in adults4, according to two comprehensive global studies.\n\nExperts say there are several reasons these figures are much lower than the 11% diagnosis level in US children that the country’s health authorities reported last year1. That number comes from the US National Survey of Children’s Health conducted in 2022, in which parents were asked whether a doctor or other health-care provider had ever said their child has ADHD. But this method of assessing prevalence would lead to inflated counts, says Luis Rohde, a psychiatrist and ADHD specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Some children were probably misdiagnosed — perhaps by a physician without specialist training — and would not be classified as having ADHD in a thorough clinical evaluation. Some parents might have misremembered, perhaps if they were told that their child had symptoms without a formal diagnosis, he says. And some children who once had a diagnosis would no longer have received one at the time of the survey if their symptoms had waned and they were reassessed.\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nResearchers and specialists highlight other factors that are likely to be driving up the number of diagnoses. One is a change in diagnostic criteria in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In the fourth edition of this widely used manual, introduced in 1994, a child or adult ADHD diagnosis required the presence of at least six of a list of nine inattention symptoms and/or six or more of nine hyperactivity symptoms, and stipulated that these had to be present before the age of seven. (This reflects the idea that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises during childhood brain development.)\n\nWhen the fifth edition, DSM-V, arrived in 2013, the criteria were slightly relaxed. Symptoms had to be present before age 12, and adult diagnosis required a minimum of five symptoms. (Children still had to have at least six.) “So when we expand the criteria, obviously you increase a little bit the prevalence,” says Rohde, who was involved in those revisions. It has also become more common for clinicians to diagnose ADHD along with other conditions, when in the past they tended to focus on one, says Bölte: “That fuels the figures.” ADHD commonly occurs with autism, as well as with anxiety, depression and other disorders.\n\nThe impairment requirement\n\nToday, a thorough ADHD assessment involves collecting a detailed history and completing behaviour questionnaires, including input from family members and, for children, from schools. In the United States, the condition can be diagnosed by a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, other mental-health specialists and primary-care physicians such as paediatricians, who might not have dedicated training in ADHD. But countries differ: in Brazil and many other low- and middle-income nations, people with ADHD symptoms tend to be sent to neurologists and psychiatrists for ADHD assessment and diagnoses, and there is a shortage of such specialists, Rohde says.\n\nThe DSM-V defines three ‘presentations’ of ADHD. People with ‘predominantly inattentive’ ADHD show symptoms such as making careless mistakes, struggling to sustain attention, losing things and being easily distracted. Those with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have traits such as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively and interrupting others. In a third, combined presentation, people show both sets of symptoms. A diagnosis requires that symptoms are present for at least six months and in two or more settings (such as school, home, work); are not explained by another condition such as anxiety; and cause an impairment, such as struggling with schoolwork, losing a job or having relationship problems.\n\nIllustration by Ada Zielińska\n\nThe impairment requirement is key, clinicians say. These traits vary across the population: some individuals are very hyperactive or inattentive, and some not at all. But people tend to be diagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms significantly interfere with their lives. “The medical part of ADHD comes in when your life is becoming derailed,” says Margaret Sibley, a specialist in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nBölte says that clinicians are interpreting the diagnostic criteria “far more liberally and openly” than in the past. This is another factor — aside from changes in the diagnostic criteria — that is driving the apparent surge in ADHD.\n\nBut working out when someone crosses the impairment line involves a subjective and sometimes tricky judgement, say specialists. And there is an ongoing debate about whether a person’s level of impairment should be defined relative to their own potential or to a population average.\n\nWhat’s clear is that more parents as well as children are deemed as crossing that threshold. Wiznitzer says that when he diagnoses a child, “almost invariably [one of] the parents has it”, too. (That’s because genes are a major contributor to ADHD: the disorder has a heritability5 of roughly 70–80%.) Even though the parents were probably symptomatic as children, many were not identified as having the condition, he says. But now, they are.\n\nADHD on TikTok\n\nAnother reason why diagnoses have surged is an increase in public awareness of ADHD — fuelled by an explosion of discussion on TikTok and other social media.\n\nInformation online “connects with some people who have had these symptoms and impairments for a long time, but never understood what they were,” says Sibley. That leads them to seek information and professional help, pushing diagnoses up. And people might be eager to receive a diagnosis if it allows them to access help and services for themselves or a child, such as adaptations to support learning at school.\n\nThe surge in ADHD has led to concerns, particularly in the United States, about questionable diagnoses being given without a thorough clinical evaluation — through online services, for example, or by medical professionals without ADHD training. “They’ve got a visit for 15 or 20 minutes, and the diagnosis is made,” says Stephen Hinshaw, a specialist in child and adolescent mental health and ADHD at the University of California, Berkeley. But Didier says that a bigger problem is the number of people with ADHD who are undiagnosed or untreated. She emphasizes how important it is for people to have access to a thorough, accurate assessment from a trained professional who specializes in ADHD.\n\nThe lack of recognition of ADHD is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, says Rohde. “The problem here is clearly underdiagnosis, stigma and undertreatment,” he says, which particularly affects “vulnerable people and communities”.\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nMany specialists say they’re observing a rapid rise of diagnoses in girls and women6. In part, that’s thought to be because women and girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattention — rather than more-noticeable hyperactivity — and to find organizational and other strategies that ‘mask’ those symptoms. Didier says that, despite being an ADHD specialist and diagnosing the condition in three of her sons, she and other ADHD practitioners missed the signs and symptoms in her daughter until she was a teenager. “It’s egregious that we don’t have more research on ADHD trajectories in women,” Sibley says.\n\nChanges in the world itself are yet another possible contributor to increased diagnoses. Some researchers speculate that schools, work, technology and other aspects of modern lives have become so complex and taxing that they are pushing more people beyond the threshold of impairment. In Sweden, says Bölte, schools are sometimes chaotic, with complex schedules and grading systems. “Many students are very confused and fed up with school and do not understand it any more,” he says.\n\nA study published last year7 revealed that parents think their children are struggling more. The research team examined how parents viewed the ADHD symptoms of more than 27,000 nine-year-old children born in Sweden. Parents consulted in 2016–18 tended to say that their children were more impaired than did parents consulted in 2004–06, even though their kids had the same number of symptoms. “Environment around the child is crucial,” says Samuele Cortese, who studies ADHD at the University of Southampton, UK, and was involved in the work.\n\nContext is key\n\nKarp describes ADHD as “context-dependent”. In a school where children are expected to sit still and be quiet, “it makes these traits seem like a problem”, he says. But when someone with ADHD is in an environment that nurtures and empowers them, they “can then channel their neurotype to do incredible things”. Karp is not against medication — and sometimes takes it himself — but would like more emphasis on institutions and society evolving so that people with ADHD can thrive.\n\nResearchers, meanwhile, are finding evidence that the severity of symptoms can vary over time. In a 2021 study, Sibley and her colleagues analysed detailed records of more than 550 children who were diagnosed with ADHD and followed for up to 16 years8. The researchers found that 64% of young people had fluctuations in ADHD — times when their symptoms faded but then recurred.\n\nSibley and her team hypothesized that people’s symptoms might flare up when they were facing increased demands in their lives, such as when starting a new school or having a child. But in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, according to a later analysis by Sibley and her colleagues9. This could be because people are able to take on more responsibility when their symptoms abate. But the alternative explanation — one that has “really resonated”, Sibley says — is that people with ADHD need a degree of activity and accountability in their lives to perform and stay engaged. Sibley thinks there might be a U-shaped curve: too many or too few demands and obligations mean that people with ADHD don’t function at their best — but at a “sweet spot”, they do.",

She studies neutron stars — ultra-dense cores that are left over when massive stars collapse — by looking at gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of space-time. It’s an approach that brings together several disciplines, including nuclear, particle and condensed-matter physics.\n\nOn her return to India in 2020, she joined the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. In June, the 45-year-old was promoted to full professor, becoming the first woman to be awarded this role in the institution’s 37-year history. Her research group generates complex theoretical models to crack the mystery of the interior composition of neutron stars.\n\nShe also wants more women to pursue science subjects, especially astrophysics, and has held various roles to promote gender equity. She was a core member of the IUCAA’s committee to combat sexual harassment and was part of the Astronomical Society of India’s Working Group for Gender Equity, for which she helped to run campaigns highlighting pioneering work by female Indian scientists. An avid science communicator, this year, Chatterjee launched the Indian branch of the Pint of Science festival — an annual festival that invites scientist to pubs and cafés to share their latest research — this year across three cities. Chatterjee has also popularized the science behind the planned Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory-India (LIGO-India), which is to be built in a rural area called Hingoli. By delivering talks at schools, universities and astronomy clubs across India, she helps to inspire girls and young women to become scientists.\n\nChatterjee spoke to Nature about how she overcame sexual harassment to become an astrophysicist, and why she promotes gender and racial diversity in her field.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nCuriosity and adventure have always driven me. Since childhood, I have been obsessed with finding solutions, and I don’t rest until I get to the root of the issue. The fact that science can be about addressing extremely complex problems, which can take a lifetime to solve, excites me. Even for someone like Einstein, conundrums in fields such as quantum physics and general relativity were too difficult to solve in his lifetime. During my undergraduate studies at St Xavier’s College in Kolkata, my summer project at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) was about understanding how the Sun rotates, a question that remains unanswered. That was when I fell in love with how the academic world works.\n\nWhen I went to the IIA, I realized I didn’t need to pursue a 9-to-5 routine. I saw that some researchers woke up at 10 a.m. and worked past midnight — then they would go off to play badminton until the early hours. I was very attracted to this way of life. Also, visiting observatories such as the Vainu Bappu Observatory in Tamil Nadu, which is in the middle of a forest, felt like an adventure that I was ready to have for the rest of my life.\n\nDebarati Chatterjee (front row, second from right) with students at a Pint of Science outreach event.Credit: Kshitij Parshetti/Pint of Science India\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle racism and sexism in science?\n\nThere have been countless times during my professional life when I have confronted unfriendly racist or sexist attitudes. I remember one incident when I was a postdoc overseas. A visitor to the laboratory made an incorrect statement during a seminar, and I pointed it out. While I was having this conversation, several members of my institute walked out of the room in protest at my questioning the visitor. Such disrespectful microaggressions were a daily occurrence.\n\nAs a foreigner, if I didn’t speak the local language, I would be left out during important conversations, which sometimes happened when researchers were socializing. Many of my peers would give up and retreat into isolation. Instead, I learnt to speak five languages with enough fluency that I could give interviews in them. Adapting to new fields of research and work environments is crucial for all early-career researchers, and it is often necessary for people to receive full credit for their contributions and achievements. These days, there are welcome centres that help international students to tackle such issues.\n\nAt other times, while taking part in official inquiries into why there are so few women in nuclear and particle physics, I have had an institute director barge in demanding to know, “Why is this taking so long?”. These experiences have motivated me to stand up for myself, and to work towards diversity, equity and inclusion to set an example for others who might not speak up because of a lack of support. I have heard from leading female theoretical physicists about how hard their journey has been and why speaking up is necessary.\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?\n\nDuring my PhD, I faced many instances of sexual harassment from a senior scientist. I had no choice but to continue my studies, because my living expenses depended on my fellowship. This person often told me that I was not good enough and that my work was inconsequential. The overwhelming pressure of the situation threw me into clinical depression, and I had to consult a therapist. I also took my grievance to the head of the department, who advised me to focus on completing my degree, because I was close to submitting my thesis. Two decades ago, there were hardly any female theoretical physicists at my university, and there was no office to which one could complain. I even trained in martial arts for self-defence at the time.\n\nTowards the end of my PhD, I won a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) fellowship, which gave me and my work international exposure, and helped me to develop a wide collaboration network. That is how I became an independent researcher who did not have to rely on any senior scientist for advancement.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?",

Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/Science Photo Library\n\nIn a technological tour de force, researchers have sequenced the whole genomes of more than 100 individual cells from one 74-year-old man. The results exposed chaos within: an extra chromosome arm here, a missing chunk of chromosome there, and smaller snippets of DNA altered, deleted or duplicated. In several of the cells, the Y chromosome had been lost entirely.\n\n“There were some cells in there that were very messed up,” says Joe Luquette, who studies bioinformatics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and is an author of the study.\n\nCancer drugs are closing in on some of the deadliest mutations\n\nThe findings, which were posted earlier this month on the preprint server bioRxiv1 and have not yet been peer reviewed, paint a comprehensive portrait of the genetic variation present within a person. That portrait is just the beginning: the study is a pilot project for a US$140-million consortium that aims to catalogue mutations in cells from 19 sites in the body, using cells from 150 donors2.\n\nThe resulting catalogue will provide a valuable tool for researchers studying the influence of genetic variation between the cells of a single individual — a phenomenon known as mosaicism — on health and on diseases such as cancer, says Soichi Sano, who studies mosaicism in the cardiovascular system at Japan’s National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center in Suita. “I’m sure that this field will be accelerated very rapidly,” he says.\n\nA lifetime of mutations\n\nPeople accumulate changes to their DNA over the course of their life, whether from errors that occur during DNA replication and repair, or from exposure to DNA-damaging environmental factors, such as ultraviolet light or tobacco smoke.\n\nAs DNA-sequencing technologies have improved, researchers have gained a clearer picture of how common mosaicism is, and how it can affect health. The accumulation of DNA mutations in some cells over time can cause cancer, for example, and loss of the Y chromosome in blood cells is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease3 and fatal heart attack4.\n\n‘Phenomenal’ tool sequences DNA and tracks proteins — without cracking cells open\n\nBut it is difficult to catalogue those differences or to determine when in life they arise. Most genome sequencing is performed by isolating DNA from many cells at once and sequencing it in bulk, making it difficult to detect DNA variants that are present in only one or a few cells. And although methods for analysing the genomes of a single cell are becoming more advanced, these techniques often focus on sequencing RNA molecules, which can be present in many copies per cell, says Diane Shao, a neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who has studied mosaicism in the developing brain5. It is a much greater challenge to sequence DNA from individual cells, because there are only two copies of the genome to work with, she says.",

          "abstract": "COP30 left many countries disappointed because no new road maps were created to help nations transition away from fossil fuels.Credit: Wagner Meier/Getty\n\nTen years after the Paris agreement was adopted, world leaders left the United Nations COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, with an outcome that kept the process alive but does little to stave off the perils of global warming. Many scientists walked away dismayed and disappointed.\n\nDespite years of commitments and research that have laid the groundwork for action, the climate summit achieved “essentially nothing”, says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\nBut, there were some signs of hope that multilateralism can tackle climate change. Over the course of two weeks, representatives from nearly 200 governments worked through hot days, long nights, a fire in the venue and numerous protests — including by Indigenous groups and others fighting for the protection of the Amazon and other tropical forests.\n\nHeatwaves linked to emissions of individual fossil-fuel and cement producers\n\nIn the end, governments agreed to a package of measures that pushes forward discussions on financial aid and a new ‘just transition’ mechanism designed to ensure a fair and equitable shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. A glaring omission was language calling for the creation of road maps to phase out fossil fuels and halt deforestation, but Brazil has announced it will push those ideas forward independently of the COP process.\n\nHere, Nature takes a look at the results from COP30 and what comes next.\n\nSidestepping fossil fuels\n\nThe summit failed to deliver major new pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Of the 194 entities and countries that sent representatives to COP30, roughly 80 didn’t submit new commitments for 2035, as required under the accord, and the rest submitted weak pledges that are unlikely to alter the global trajectory. As a result, scientists with the Climate Action Tracker consortium still project that the world is on track for upwards of 2.6 ° C of warming by 2100.\n\n“The new commitments don’t even move the needle,” says Niklas Höhne, a climate-policy researcher at the NewClimate Institute, an environmental think tank based in Berlin. “It’s really a sign that countries have limited appetite to support something more ambitious on climate.”\n\nFossil fuels took centre stage briefly. More than 80 countries joined Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the call for the creation of a road map to phase out fossil fuels, but the proposal ultimately foundered after reported opposition from oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the idea isn’t dead yet. Brazil promised to push forwards with it independently of the COP process, while the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced that they would host the first global conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels in April next year.\n\nProtesters carrying signs that read “our forests are not for sale” broke through security lines of the COP30 climate talks on 12 November.Credit: Pablo Porciuncula/AFP via Getty\nFinancing climate action\n\nOne of the largest disputes at the summit was who should pay for climate action and help developing nations to prepare for and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of global warming. Progress was made: wealthier nations committed to tripling the amount of money they provide to help low-income countries tackle global warming — to US$300 billion annually by 2035. The agreement also carries forward a broader goal of boosting the total to $1.3 trillion annually from all sources, including private investments.\n\nBut questions remain about how this will be financed. Previous deals on climate action have been plagued by delays in achieving financial goals as well as by disagreements about how much money should come from publicly funded grants, as opposed to loans and private investments.\n\nChina pledges to cut emissions by 2035: what does that mean for the climate?\n\nThe final deal at COP30 lays out a process to clarify these issues over the next two years. It’s a step towards ensuring that wealthy countries meet their responsibilities to provide climate finance to those in need, says Jodi-Ann Wang, who researches equity and climate finance at the London School of Economics and Political Science.",

          "authors": "Liz Allen, Veronique Kiermer, Simon Porter, Ruth Whittam",
          "abstract": "A decade ago, we and others launched a tool for clarifying the roles of each author of a research paper. The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) includes 14 types of contribution, from conceptualization to software and data curation. It was designed to prevent questionable authorship practices and make it easier for researchers to demonstrate the diversity of their contributions to science, among other benefits.\n\nCredit where credit is due\n\nThis year, taking stock, we’ve shown that adoption has risen steadily (see ‘More CRediT is being given’)1. By 2024, CRediT information was included in nearly 850,000 publications (encompassing articles, preprints and conference papers) — around 22% of the 3.7 million publications for which the full text was available that were recorded last year in Digital Science’s Dimensions, a database of scholarly publications.\n\nThis level of uptake is remarkable, given that there have been no coordinated efforts or mandates from publishers and funders. But the issues that the taxonomy was conceived to tackle remain rampant in the research literature. Here we call for CRediT to become the norm, to support researchers and research integrity across the whole academic landscape.\n\nCRediT is still needed\n\nDespite widening use of CRediT, authorship conventions in scholarly publishing remain opaque and confusing, and differ by discipline. They typically provide little to no information about who contributed what in a study (see ‘The parts we played’). A name’s position in a list of authors is an unreliable indicator of the significance of that person’s work or the time they spent, particularly when the author list is long or alphabetical, as is common in economics2 and for large collaborations, and as also occurs in biomedical research3.\n\nStop treating code like an afterthought: record, share and value it\n\nQuestionable practices, such as including honorary authors, who are named but have not contributed, and excluding ‘ghost authors’, who have contributed but are not named, also remain prevalent — perhaps occurring in as much as one-fifth of biomedical papers4.\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of misconduct allegations and retractions in research is skyrocketing. When results are questioned after publication, transparency as to who did what helps investigators, supports accountability and can help to foster a responsible authorship culture more generally5.\n\nCRediT data can also be used to inform policy interventions that help to drive innovation, equity and impact in science. Data on author contributions have been used to study gender and the division of labour in research6,7, as well as variations in the distribution of roles across disciplines8, for example.\n\nSource: Analysis by L. Allen et al.\n\nThe tool can help institutions and funders to identify skills being used in cutting-edge fields. Institutions could use the taxonomy to analyse the contributions of their researchers and identify talent that should be retained and developed. Funders can identify specialists — such as data scientists or research software engineers — for targeted funding opportunities or to serve as expert peer reviewers.\n\nInitiatives such as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), launched in 2012, and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) now champion the need to consider diverse contributions to research when assessing individuals’ performance9. And the value of CRediT is increasingly acknowledged by science organizations such as the UK Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2022, the taxonomy became a recognized standard of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) — meaning that publishers and other stakeholders internationally are encouraged to adopt it.\n\nRoadblocks to progress\n\nDespite the need for CRediT, further progress is held back by the changing research landscape, a lack of resources and inconsistent implementation.\n\nThe use of CRediT has spread across disciplines and geographies1 — indicating that it strikes a chord. But some roles might fall outside the original 14 or be better represented by improving definitions of the existing roles, especially in fields such as social sciences and engineering, which were under-represented in the corpus of publications used to develop the taxonomy. For example, community engagement is becoming an increasingly important role as researchers strive to improve relationships with study participants, and because of citizen science. The CRediT term ‘software’ might need to be expanded to better reflect infrastructure development and data science. And the spread of new technologies, such as AI, could also alter the roles of scientists across the research landscape, from hypothesis generation to the writing-up of results.",

          "abstract": "A tropical forest meets the Atlantic Ocean at the Amazon Delta.Credit: NASA/Alamy\n\nAs the world gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the COP30 United Nations climate conference, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reignited an old but urgent debate: whether the multilateral process that has sustained climate diplomacy for three decades is still fit for purpose. His proposal for a global climate council — a smaller, more agile entity to lead negotiations and ensure that climate commitments are implemented — reflects mounting frustration with the slow pace of outcomes from the annual Conference of the Parties (COP).\n\nHow to fight climate change without the US: a guide to global action\n\nLula’s proposal deserves serious consideration. The COP process has become sprawling, performative and, at times, politically paralysed. Yet, as someone who helped to draft the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1991–92, I think that the answer is not to abandon this architecture, but to reform it.\n\nWhen we negotiated the UNFCCC, our goal was to create a durable legal scaffold that was flexible enough to evolve with scientific understanding and national capacities for climate action. In 1992, there was no precedent for a framework that addressed an issue that spanned every economy, ecosystem and generation of people. We had the science, but not yet the institutions or political will to act at scale. The framework-convention model allowed successive protocols, decisions and mechanisms to develop.\n\nThat design has proven remarkably resilient. If someone had told me in 1992 that the world would still be negotiating climate action at COP30, I might have sighed. Yet, if they had told me that every nation would still be adhering to the same framework, guided by science and law, I would have been profoundly hopeful — as I am today.\n\nClimate diplomacy is slow because it is systemic. It forces nations to reconcile competing imperatives — development versus decarbonization, growth versus justice, and responsibility versus capability. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was born from these tensions: recognition that all countries share the problem but not the same level of blame or means to act.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nProgress has been incremental but cumulative. The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris agreement have created a coherent legal architecture for climate governance. The International Court of Justice delivered an advisory opinion in July, reaffirming that states have binding obligations to protect the climate, an indication of how far we’ve come.\n\nCriticism of the COP process is understandable. Yearly gatherings of tens of thousands of people can seem detached from the crisis outside the conference halls. But dismissing COPs ignores their ability to provide universality, legitimacy and accountability. President Lula’s call for a leaner climate council acknowledges this frustration while maintaining the inclusivity of the COP process.",

          "abstract": "Human behaviour has been identified as a key dynamic in sustainable waste management and circular economy research. Drawing on recent behaviour publications from both fields, this Perspective highlights three issues relating to how they frame people. First, reference to ‘consumers’ in circular economy research contrasts with ‘people’ in some sustainable waste management papers. This represents an artificial separation of approaches to activities that are interwoven; furthermore, it implicitly defines a business agenda for the circular economy. Second, research into behaviour needs a broader methodological approach to identify variable needs and address underlying contextual and structural issues. Third, attention is needed to ongoing inequalities within and between countries that limit the effectiveness of circular economy implementation. Future research in these fields should prioritize human-centred approaches, including critical realism and qualitative methods, to uncover the socio-political constraints on behaviour and guide sustainability strategies that address the needs of people.",

          "abstract": "The invention of agriculture is widely thought to have spurred the emergence of large-scale human societies. It has since been argued that only intensive agriculture can provide enough surplus for emerging states. Others have proposed it was the taxation potential of cereal grains that enabled the formation of states, making writing a critical development for recording those taxes. Here we test these hypotheses by mapping trait data from 868 cultures worldwide onto a language tree representing the relationships between cultures globally. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses indicate that intensive agriculture was as likely the result of state formation as its cause. By contrast, grain cultivation most likely preceded state formation. Grain cultivation also predicted the subsequent emergence of taxation. Writing, although not lost once states were formed, more likely emerged in tax-raising societies, consistent with the proposal that it was adopted to record those taxes. Although consistent with theory, a causal interpretation of the associations we identify is limited by the assumptions of our phylogenetic model, and several of the results are less reliable owing to the small sample size of some of the cross-cultural data we use.",

More than 62 million tonnes of e-waste were generated globally in 2022, with an expected increase to 82 million tonnes by 2030 (ref. 1). E-waste contains highly toxic substances (including lead, cadmium, mercury, brominated flame retardants and persistent organic pollutants) and a mix of precious metals (such as gold, silver and palladium)2.\n\nIn many developed countries, e-waste management systems are established and regulated. Yet in many low- and middle-income countries, e-waste recycling is primarily driven by the informal sector: it is typically conducted in unregulated environments and often without the use of protective equipment or modern technologies2. Practices such as open burning, acid leaching and manual dismantling are common. These methods release toxicants into the air, soil and water, which creates widespread community exposure. Workers engaged in dismantling electronic components often suffer impaired renal and hormonal function, as well as increased risk of DNA damage3,4,5. Residents who live near recycling sites have also reported reproductive health effects, which raises concerns about intergenerational impacts6. Moreover, prenatal exposures have been associated with adverse neonatal physiological development7.",

Here we show that natural-language-like systematicity arises in codes that are constrained by a statistical measure of complexity called predictive information, also known as excess entropy. Predictive information is the mutual information between the past and future of a stochastic process. In simulations, we find that codes that minimize predictive information break messages into groups of approximately independent features that are expressed systematically and locally, corresponding to words and phrases. Next, drawing on cross-linguistic text corpora, we find that actual human languages are structured in a way that yields low predictive information compared with baselines at the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax and lexical semantics. Our results establish a link between the statistical and algebraic structure of language and reinforce the idea that these structures are shaped by communication under general cognitive constraints.",

It is unclear whether other animals require social learning to acquire adult-like breadths of information in the wild, including by key developmental milestones, or whether animals are capable of constructing their knowledge repertoires primarily through independent exploration. We investigated whether social learning mediates orangutans’ diet-repertoire development, by translating an extensive dataset describing wild orangutans’ behaviour into an empirically validated agent-based model. In this model, diets reliably developed to adult-like breadths only when simulated immatures benefited from multiple forms of social learning. Moreover, social learning was required for diets to reach adult-like breadths by the age immatures become independent from their mothers. This implies that orangutan diets constitute culturally dependent repertoires, with social learning enhancing the rate and outcomes of diet development past individual potentials. We discuss prospective avenues for researching the building of cultural repertoires in hominids and other species.",

          "abstract": "Dogs display temperamental and behavioral variation between individuals, just as psychiatric, temperamental, and cognitive traits vary in humans. In both species, these traits are highly heritable, yet causal genes remain incompletely understood. We performed 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for behavioral traits quantified using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) in ~1,000 golden retrievers, identifying 12 genome-wide significant loci ( P &lt; 2.97 × 10 −6 ) for 8 traits and 9 additional loci exceeding a suggestive threshold ( P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 ). A human phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) showed that most of the 18 canine positional candidate genes identified were associated with one or more of 190 psychiatric, temperamental, or cognitive traits in humans (7/12 genes at genome-wide loci and 5/9 at suggestive loci). For example, a genome-wide significant locus near PTPN1 (dog-directed aggression) overlapped with human measures of Intelligence, Educational attainment, and major depressive disorder. The gene ROMO1 was within a genome-wide significant locus for trainability in dogs and associated with intelligence, depression, irritability, and sensitivity/hurt feelings in humans. Other genes located at genome-wide significant loci associated with behavioral, psychiatric, temperamental, or cognitive traits in both species included PRDX1(dog-directed fear), VWA8 (touch sensitivity) , ITPR2, and ADGRL2/LPHN2 (trainability), and ADD2 (stranger-directed fear). From suggestive loci we also found cross-species associations for HUNK, and ZC3H12C, (dog-directed fear), SLC35F6 and IGSF11 (separation-related problems). These results suggest that shared genetic and molecular mechanisms underlie complex behavioral and temperamental states across species and may inform our understanding of emotional states driving undesirable behaviors in dogs.",

Drawing on the mental model theory of reasoning, our two preregistered interventions undercut these problematic conclusions. They do so by testing the effectiveness of two mental model-based interventions juxtaposing problematic claims with visualized or verbally explained models of basic biological and vaccination systems. Study 1: a) graphically modeled how mRNA COVID-19 vaccination works (Model 1); b) verbally modeled ways in which cells protect themselves from foreign DNA (Model 2); and c) provided ancillary material designed to bolster perceptions of mRNA vaccination safety. Study 2 deployed an animation of the cell-protection model (Model 2), alone, and in combination with Study 1’s messaging. Neither the mRNA vaccine nor the DNA protection model explicitly acknowledged the problematic DNA-integration claim. Both preemptive (before) and rebuttal (after) positioning of the models were effective. Within-person analyses suggested that preemptive positioning may be somewhat more effective than rebuttal positioning. Some positive effects of exposure to the modeled knowledge messaging condition in Study 1 persisted 2 mo after exposure.",

This work demonstrates that the foundational assumption of survey research—that a coherent response is a human response—is no longer tenable. I designed and tested an autonomous synthetic respondent capable of producing survey data that possesses the coherence and plausibility of human responses. This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in our data infrastructure, rendering most current detection methods obsolete and posing a potential existential threat to unsupervised online research. The scientific community must urgently develop new data validation standards and reconsider its reliance on nonprobability, low-barrier online data collection methods.",

          "abstract": "Balancing efficiency and flexibility in collective decision-making is increasingly critical in modern societies characterized by rapid sociocultural and technological change. Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has proposed two contrasting computational algorithms for social learning: value shaping (VS) and decision biasing (DB). VS posits that others’ choices serve as “pseudo-rewards” that directly shape an observer’s valuations, leading them to prefer popular options even in the absence of outcome feedback. In contrast, DB confines the influence of social information to behavior—observers may imitate popular actions, but they update their valuations solely through personal experience. Although both algorithms facilitate individual adaptation under uncertainty, their interactive dynamics and group-level consequences remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed computational models of VS and DB within a reinforcement learning framework and conducted agent-based simulations to examine collective performance in uncertain and dynamically changing environments. The results reveal a trade-off: VS enables rapid convergence and high efficiency in stable contexts, whereas DB promotes greater adaptability under environmental volatility. These differences are amplified in larger groups, particularly under strong majority influence. Importantly, evolutionary analyses indicate that both learning types can coexist stably, allowing their complementary strengths to enhance group performance. Together, our findings provide a computational and evolutionary account of how social learning can both enhance and impair collective intelligence—and suggest design principles for fostering resilient collective decision systems in human and AI societies facing rapid change.",

Individuals born in historically safe states remain safer wherever they go, while individuals born in historically dangerous states face a greater risk, including from police violence. This pattern holds across demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and marital status, across migrant groups with different average levels of education, income, and even when comparing migrants from different states who reside in the same county. To help understand why, we conducted a large national survey that oversampled internal White US migrants. The results suggest this persistence may reflect a sociocultural adaptation to dangerous settings. Residents and migrants from historically unsafe states—mainly former frontier states and the deep South—see the world as more dangerous, react more forcefully in aggressive scenarios, value toughness, distrust law enforcement, and say they rely on self and family in violent situations. These adaptations may have kept them safe in historically dangerous states, but may increase their vulnerability to harm in safer states.",

Dynamic, stochastic economic models used in policy evaluation necessarily simplify the world as we know it. This motivates us to explore, refine, and extend tools aimed at producing marginal valuations that shed light on why some policies are optimal and how others, though suboptimal, can be improved. We present representations of these marginal valuations that embrace uncertainty and support robust implementation-even in environments characterized by “deep uncertainties.” These representations offer a more complete understanding of how interactions among multiple state variables, concerns about model misspecification, and uncertainties surrounding potentially long-term implications contribute to the cogent assessment of policies. We argue that these methods are particularly salient for evaluating the global cost of climate change and the global value of research and development with long-term prospects for success.",

We evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can provide valid predictions of well-being across global populations. Using natural-language profiles from 64,000 individuals in 64 countries, we benchmark four leading LLMs against self-reports and statistical models. Unlike regressions, which estimate relationships from survey data, LLMs draw only on individual characteristics (e.g., sociodemographic, attitudinal, and psychological factors) together with associations encoded during pretraining, rather than from the survey’s subjective well-being responses. They produced plausible patterns consistent with known correlates such as income and health, but systematically underperformed relative to regressions and showed the largest errors in underrepresented countries, reflecting biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. A preregistered experiment revealed that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic associations rather than conceptual understanding, leading to predictable distortions in unfamiliar contexts. Injecting contextual information partly reduced—but did not remove—these biases. These findings demonstrate that while LLMs can simulate broad correlates of life satisfaction, they fail to capture its experiential and cultural depth. Accordingly, they should not be used as substitutes for human self-reports of well-being; doing so would risk reinforcing inequality and undermining human agency.",

Designed in an “adversarial collaboration” among researchers with competing perspectives, these experiments disentangle whether students’ preferences for curtailing academic freedom are based on viewpoint discrimination, professional academic standards, or prosocial concerns. Our findings show that a substantive share of university students support viewpoint-based restrictions on academic discourse. While they also apply academic and prosocial criteria, they apply them more strongly to conservative viewpoints. The results further show that conservative statements are perceived as causing more social harm. However, prosocial concerns do not fully explain the higher demand for ideological viewpoint discrimination. These results are important because they can inform the debate about universities as ideological spaces—a view often invoked in recent government-led attacks on academic freedom.",

          "abstract": "Violent sentiment is deeply tied to racial threat from the changing racial demography of the United States. Extending the historical idea of White flight, we find shifting local racial demographic conditions in tandem with a simple prime of national conditions causally drive more violent, antidemocratic attitudes across White Americans. We term this as “White fight sentiment.” Across four experiments conducted over the span of 3 y, using probability, state targeted, and convenience samples, we find that when we randomly prime national diversification among White Americans in locations that experienced local Black population increase or White decline, they become expressively, consistently more extreme when primed. Surprisingly, we consistently find null effects in communities that recently experienced Hispanic and Asian population change, short of one case across our four studies. Through a series of robustness checks we confirm national considerations specifically activate White fight.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how individuals perceive their social networks, with a focus on their own positioning. Using experimental methods and network analysis, we show that people have a limited understanding of their social standing in terms of popularity (in-degree) and centrality. Few participants accurately estimate their popularity, and even fewer correctly identify their decile of centrality. A similar pattern emerges for their perceptions of the most popular and central individuals, but we find no correlation between the ability to assess one’s own position and the ability to detect key network members. Popular participants correctly perceive themselves as more popular, although they tend to misjudge their popularity more than less popular peers. They are nonetheless more accurate in estimating their centrality. Perceived centrality is only weakly correlated with actual centrality, but central individuals misperceive both their popularity and centrality to a greater extent. We further show that these misperceptions have real-world implications. Conditional on network positioning, students who see themselves as less popular and less central–and those with more accurate self-perceptions–tend to achieve higher grades, whereas individuals recognized by others as popular and central perform significantly better academically. These findings challenge theoretical models that assume accurate self-awareness of network positions and highlight the need to reconsider the implications for key-player interventions in public health, education, and organizational contexts.",

          "abstract": "The plant hormone gibberellin (GA 4 ) regulates numerous developmental processes. Within the root, GA 4 controls growth, in part, by controlling the extent of cell elongation. The nlsGPS1 FRET biosensor revealed a GA 4 gradient within the Arabidopsis root growth zones, with GA 4 levels correlating with cell length. We developed a multiscale mathematical model to understand how biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport create the GA 4 distribution within the root growth zones. The model predicted that phloem delivery of the biosynthetic intermediate GA 12 contributes to higher levels of bioactive GA 4 in the elongation zone, with the GA 4 synthesis pattern being further modified by local GA 12 synthesis in the quiescent center region and the spatial distribution of biosynthesis enzymes (GA20ox and GA3ox). Model predictions suggested that while GA20ox and GA3ox transcript is present throughout the growth zones, these enzymes are inactive in the dividing cells, which explains steep GA 4 gradients observed in the GA3ox overexpression line and improves agreement between model predictions and data in wildtype. The model suggested that the GA 4 gradient also depends on a balance of diffusion through plasmodesmata and catabolism. Both model predictions and biosensor data demonstrated that plasmodesmatal diffusion enables a more gradual GA 4 gradient, with higher diffusion antagonizing the GA 4 gradient. Model predictions suggested that catabolism limits GA 4 levels, which we validated via biosensor imaging in the ga2oxhept mutant. In conclusion, our results suggest that local GA 4 synthesis combines with diffusion and catabolism to create a spatial GA 4 gradient that provides positional information and patterns cell elongation.",

          "abstract": "The solute carrier (SLC)29A3 exports nucleosides from lysosomes into the cytosol, maintaining solute homeostasis and providing metabolic intermediates for cellular processes. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC29A3 cause H syndrome, characterized by histiocytosis, hyperinflammation, and immunodeficiency. While dysfunctions in various cell types contribute to H syndrome and to SLC29A3 deficiency in mice, the mechanisms driving hyperinflammation and immunodeficiency are incompletely understood. Remarkably, the possible role played by dendritic cells (DCs), the most efficient antigen (Ag)-presenting cells and the main cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity, remains unknown. We show that, in murine DCs, SLC29A3 is recruited to phagosomes after bacterial capture, maintains phagosomal pH homeostasis, and ensures optimal antimicrobial phagosomal signaling to the production of IL-6, IL-12, pro-IL-1β, and CCL22. In addition, SLC29A3 promotes Ag presentation on MHC-II molecules to initiate adaptive immune responses. Notably, SLC29A3 supports the activity of the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1, promoting the nuclear translocation of transcription factor TFEB and inducing autophagy, a major anti-inflammatory mechanism. Overexpression of human SLC29A3, but not the transport mutant G437R, in SLC29A3-deficient murine DCs restores cytokine production in response to bacterial phagocytosis, suggesting that SLC29A3 transport activity is required to drive phagosomal signaling. Our data suggest that SLC29A3 supports and controls immune function in DCs by promoting effective antimicrobial signaling and Ag presentation, and inducing autophagy. Our findings also uncover a TRPML1-dependent mechanism by which SLC29A3 activates TFEB and suggest that defects in phagosomal antibacterial signaling, TFEB activation, and autophagy may contribute to immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation in SLC29A3 disorders.",

          "abstract": "To migrate efficiently through tissues, cells must transit through small constrictions within the extracellular matrix. However, in vivo environments are geometrically, mechanically, and chemically complex, and it has been difficult to understand how each of these parameters contribute to the propulsive strategy utilized by cells in different confining environments. To address this, we employed a sacrificial micromolding approach to generate polymer substrates with tunable stiffness, controlled adhesivity, and user-defined microscale geometries. We combined this together with live-cell imaging and three-dimensional traction force microscopy to quantify the forces that cells use to transit through constricting channels. Surprisingly, rather than enlarging the constriction via pushing forces, we observe that mesenchymal cells migrating through compliant constrictions generate inwardly directed contractile forces that decrease the size of the opening and pull the channel walls closed around the nucleus. This had the effect of increasing nuclear deformation compared to cells migrating through comparably sized rigid confinements. Additionally, the nucleus took longer to transit through compliant constrictions compared to similarly sized rigid constrictions. These findings show that nuclear deformation during confined migration can be accomplished by internal cytoskeletal machinery rather than by reactive forces from the substrate, and our approach provides a mechanism to test between different models for how cells translocate their nucleus through narrow constrictions. The methods, analysis, and results presented here will be useful to understand how cells choose between propulsive strategies in different physical environments.",

          "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is catalyzed by a large nitrogenase enzyme complex, has evolved in both bacteria and archaea. Indeed, nitrogen-fixing species are found in diverse living environments, and BNF has evolved even in aerobic bacteria, although the function of nitrogenase is inhibited by oxygen. BNF is, however, highly energy-costing, requiring 16 ATPs in a single nitrogen fixation reaction. To explain this paradox, we hypothesized that nitrogen-fixing species gain not only nitrogen-fixing ( nif ) genes but also non- nif genes to facilitate nitrogen fixation. We examined over 3500 nitrogen-fixing genomes and found that they have gained genes directly or indirectly related to BNF in diverse types of living environments, so that nitrogen-fixing species tend to have larger genomes than their non-nitrogen-fixing relatives. Interestingly, the non- nif genes gained tend to be located near nif -gene clusters, probably to achieve proximity effects such as coordinated gene regulation. For example, the most frequent among the genes gained are ABC transporter genes, which facilitate the absorption and physiological metabolism of carbon (e.g., sugars), nitrogen (e.g., amino acids), and trace elements (e.g., molybdenum), and many ABC transporter genes lie close to nif -gene clusters. From our findings, we propose the following scenario: BNF evolved in many archaea and bacteria because BNF is advantageous to its hosts, although it incurs a high energy cost. Then, gaining genes to facilitate BNF compensates the cost of BNF, facilitating the spread of nitrogen fixers to all living habitats. This expansion benefits the biosphere, as nitrogen is essential for all organisms.",

Starting with some initial subgraph, at each iteration, we apply a randomly selected edit to the current subgraph. Such edits vary in nature from simple edits consisting of adding or deleting an edge, or compound edits which can affect several edges at once. This evolving process generates a random walk on the set of all possible subgraphs of the host graph. We show that the eigenvalues of this random walk can be naturally indexed by subsets of edges of the host graph. We also provide, in the case of simple edits, a closed-form formula for the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix and a sharp bound for the rate of convergence of this random walk. We consider extensions to the case of compound edits; examples of this model include the previously studied Moran forest model and a dynamic random intersection graph model. Evolving graphs arise in a variety of fields ranging from deep learning and graph neural networks to epidemic modeling and social networks. Our random evolving process serves as a general stochastic model for sampling random subgraphs from a given graph.",

          "abstract": "Cells in tissues navigate fibrous environments fundamentally differently than they do on flat substrates, but the establishment of cell forces in physiological fibrous settings remains poorly understood. Although factors such as the stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to drive behaviors, including cell motility on flat nonfibrous substrates, the interplay between fiber architecture and stiffness in fibrous ECM is not known. Here, we find that in fibrous environments, the directionality of mechanical forces overrides ECM stiffness as the primary regulator of contractility in migrating cells. Using an approach combining phase microscopy with deep learning to map forces in real time, termed deep learning-enabled live-cell fiber-force microscopy (DLFM), we reveal that when cells transition between anisotropic and isotropic stress fields, their contractility significantly drops despite encountering stiffer ECM, contrary to the behavior of cells on flat nonfibrous substrates. Unlike the peripheral adhesions observed on flat nonfibrous substrates, cells in fibrous matrices form force-generating adhesions throughout their body, stabilized by out-of-plane mechanical components unique to fiber geometry. Cells exhibit distinct force signatures during migration, division, and differentiation, with temporal signatures that predict stem cell fate. These findings, enabled by combining deep learning and the mechanics of cells and fibers, explain long-standing paradoxical behavior of cells navigating deformable fibrous environments, how they can pull and tug at them, and identify tension anisotropy as a master regulator of cell behavior, with implications for cancer invasion, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.",

Herein, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was used to differentiate malignant from benign endometrial tissues and assess lipidomic differences among patients with obesity and diabetes. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was performed in the same patients to gain insights into the altered signaling pathways and investigate the protein expression levels in endometrial cancer cases and controls. Tissues from 64 women (50 cancer, 14 benign) were analyzed with DESI-MSI achieving 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Discriminatory spectral features were primarily phospholipids [phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI)], all elevated in cancer. Proteomics revealed upregulated proteins linked to commonly dysregulated pathways in endometrial cancer, namely PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/RAS, and Wnt signaling pathways. Lipidomic differences were found between high- (obesity/diabetes) and low-risk phenotypes (no obesity/diabetes), with PE and PS elevated in high-risk benign and PE reduced in high-risk cancer cases. A single phospholipid (PE(O-38:4)) was found as discriminatory in both normal and cancer cohorts, which may serve as biomarker in women with benign histology at high-risk of developing endometrial cancer.

The data revealed responses that were largely uniform in rTreg, but diverse among aTregs, matching different STAT5 signal transduction efficiency. Individual Tregs displayed divergences in the preponderance of changes that may be attributed to STAT1 or STAT5 signal transduction downstream of IL2. Chromatin analysis identified an evolving implication of transcription factors that accounted for the waves of responsive genes. Covalent cytokine/Ab complexes that preferentially trigger high- (heterotrimer) or low-affinity (heterodimer) IL2 receptors activated the same signatures, yet with strong quantitative variations, especially in NK cells.

While various methods exist to study these interactions, investigating those that involve nuclear proteins, including structurally complex proteins containing long disordered regions, remains a significant challenge. Here, we developed nxReLo, a simple and fast cell culture-based colocalization assay, designed to identify and characterize interactions between nuclear proteins. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) safeguard germline genome integrity, and the PPIs that facilitate piRNA production are therefore essential for animal reproduction, yet remain incompletely understood. We used nxReLo to investigate interactions between members of the Drosophila melanogaster Rhino–Deadlock–Cutoff (RDC) complex and two associated components, Bootlegger and Moonshiner, a nuclear protein network required for piRNA expression. We demonstrate the utility of the nxReLo assay by systematically screening pairwise interactions within the RDC network and by assembling a multiprotein complex from four components. By combining nxReLo assays with AlphaFold structural prediction, we characterized the Cutoff–Deadlock and the Bootlegger–Deadlock complexes in detail, providing molecular and structural insights. Specifically, we refined the domains involved in the interaction and identified interface point mutations that interfered with complex formation, validating the predicted structures. In conclusion, nxReLo facilitates rapid and simple testing of direct interactions between nuclear proteins in a cellular context, which is particularly important when working with structurally challenging proteins or when established interaction assays prove unsuccessful.",

To date, only a few studies have extended HHG spectroscopy to liquids, and much remains unresolved concerning the information that can be extracted from HHG spectra about the local liquid environment and the potential of HHG as a nonlinear probe of solvation dynamics. In this work, we investigate HHG in liquid binary solutions consisting of mixtures of aromatic benzene derivatives solvated in methanol. We observe evidence of a localized solvation structure that is imprinted on the harmonic spectra in the form of a strongly suppressed harmonic order, and an overall reduction of the total harmonic yield. We characterize this behavior as a function of laser parameters, concentration, and other halogenated benzene derivatives in methanol solution. Guided by theory, we interpret the results in terms of a localized solvation shell that is formed in specific solutions and acts like a local scattering barrier in the HHG process. This work demonstrates the potential of high-harmonic spectroscopy in liquids to extract detailed information about the structure and dynamics of solvation while expanding our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of HHG in systems with short-range order.",

Yet, rapid cooling during freezing may not preserve the conformations at physiological temperature. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations starting with cryo-EM reconstructions can provide additional insights. For example, at 310 K, adenosinediphosphate (ADP)-actin filaments fluctuate on a nanosecond time scale around higher entropy states with partly twisted subunits and smaller rotations along short-pitch helix than the cryo-EM reconstructions, while cryogenic temperatures favor flattened conformations. In the active site, the positions of Q137 and the catalytic water 1 and activating water 2 optimal for in-line attack on the γ-phosphate of ATP are very rare at 310 K, explaining in part the slow rate of ATP hydrolysis in filaments. This favorable arrangement of the waters is not observed in simulations of actin monomers. At 310 K, subunits in ADP-P i -actin filaments have their backdoor gates open 60% of the time for phosphate release, a conformation not observed by cryo-EM. Rare fluctuations open binding sites for cofilin and phalloidin. The twisted conformations of pointed end subunits and interactions of the D-loop of the penultimate subunit explain the slow association of new subunits. The terminal subunit at the barbed end is tethered to its neighbor along the long-pitch helix but dissociates transiently from its lateral neighbor. These effects of subfreezing temperatures on actin filaments are surely not an isolated example, so molecular dynamics simulations of structures of other frozen proteins will be informative.",

To clarify its function, we studied cutA knockout mutants from two phylogenetically distant species, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Escherichia coli , using phenotyping combined with metabolomics. To investigate the interaction of CutA with potential substrates and cofactors, we performed a series of native metabolomics experiments with CutA and cell extracts from which we identified the lumazine 2’-deoxyxanthopterin B2, a previously uncharacterized pteridine, to bind CutA in both species. Based on these results, we identified a set of other pteridines, including the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, as ligands of CutA. In the presence of pterins, we observed an increased affinity of CutA for copper ions. In addition, E. coli CutA mutants exhibited decreased copper resistance. These findings, alongside the known role of pteridines as redox shuttles, suggest a previously unrecognized role for CutA in coordinating cellular copper homeostasis and redox balance via pteridine metabolism.",

These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here, we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system’s self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape’s self-similar geometry. Last, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.",

          "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout life, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF8), are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, which eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.",

          "abstract": "The polygamous mating system of free-ranging domestic dogs (FRDs) contrasts with the social monogamy typical of gray wolves and all other wild canids. The transition to polygamy in dogs could have been initiated by a shift from apex predator to human commensal during the early domestication stages. Here, we test this hypothesis by investigating the characteristics of the FRD mating system that could have been important for domestication. This inference is based on genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from three geographically distinct populations, including behavioral data for one of them. The reconstructed genealogies form a wide network of kinship relationships resulting from the frequent occurrence of maternal and paternal half-siblings, reflecting male and female polygamy. Reproductive success is positively correlated with the strength of social interactions and the number of connections with opposite-sex individuals, implying a preference toward familiar mates and the importance of social relationships in determining mating patterns. This is supported by a nonrandom distribution of reproductive partners and a reproductive skew in males and females. Multiple paternity within litters points to female polygamy within a single estrus, and sexual size dimorphism implies sexual selection favoring larger males. Physiological changes resulting from polygamy, including increased male fertility and reduced breeding seasonality, could have facilitated the natural spread of novel adaptive traits and limited the introgression from wolves. The change in reproductive patterns, typically considered a consequence of selective breeding, could instead have occurred naturally in response to the dietary niche change, triggering further changes that facilitated the domestication process.",

In Australia, the degree to which the arrival of Europeans and their dogs impacted the ecology and ancestry of dingoes is contentious. To test for gene flow with European dogs, we sequenced genomes of 18 ancient Australian dingoes from the Nullarbor Plain, two early 20th-century New Guinean dingoes, a mid-19th-century kangaroo hound, and 33 contemporary dingoes from across Australia. To quantify dietary shifts after the arrival of the First Fleet (AD1788), we generated stable isotopic ( δ 13 C, δ 15 N) data for 55 directly dated ancient Australian dingoes spanning the last ~2,300 y. We show that the diet of Nullarbor Plain dingoes shifted soon after European arrival, possibly due to shifts in prey abundance. Our genomic analyses demonstrated that pre-European dingoes were more inbred than most contemporary dog breeds, possibly as a result of population bottlenecks. We also showed that many dingoes, particularly those from Southeast Australia, experienced admixture with European dogs. Although we detected European ancestry dating to the early 18th-century, the majority of gene flow events coincided with the initiation of landscape-scale population control in the 1960s. Furthermore, some European dog alleles may have provided adaptive benefits to dingoes and alleviated inbreeding depression. Despite the existence of gene flow with European dogs, dingoes have maintained their distinctiveness. This suggests that management strategies should prioritize maintenance of substantial population sizes across Australia to both facilitate effective purifying and positive selection on introgressed alleles, and mitigate inbreeding.",

However, the models forecasting this ecosystem N loss are based on laboratory experiments that are inherently uncertain and have had few in situ validations. Over 6 y, we measured ~200,000 soil nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O; a powerful greenhouse gas) fluxes and used an upscaling approach to estimate N 2 fluxes after warming a temperate forest by 2 °C. Against thermodynamic theoretical predictions, warming unequivocally lowered emissions of NO by 19% and of N 2 O by 16%. These lower gaseous N losses were not explained by complete reduction of NO and N 2 O to N 2 , leaching, nor plant uptake, but rather by the warming-induced drying of soils that constrained microbial activity, consistent with other warming experiments where precipitation was less than 1,000 mm y −1 . Our findings challenge ecosystem model assumptions where warming, alone, accelerates N emissions and underscores how warming-induced losses in soil moisture and shortened freeze-thaw periods can offset temperature effects. Our data underscore the need for explicit consideration of in situ soil moisture when predicting changes on the terrestrial N cycle as the planet warms.",

ROPGAP3 promoted PIN2 clustering, inhibited lateral diffusion and endocytosis, and reinforced its polarity even on loss- or gain-of-function conditions for ROP6 activity.

However, the role of USP1 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) has remained unexplored. Our study uncovers a USP1-dependent survival axis driving chemoresistance in PTCL. USP1 is significantly upregulated in PTCL patients and correlates with poor prognosis through promoting mortalin degradation via TRAF2 deubiquitination. USP1 overexpression enhances TRAF2 stability by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby elevating TRAF2 levels. This, in turn, facilitates mortalin degradation, leading to diminished mortalin expression, reduced mitochondrial localization of mortalin, and impaired apoptosis. Notably, silencing mortalin in PTCL cells further decreases sensitivity to doxorubicin and suppresses apoptotic pathways. Mechanistically, reduced mitochondrial localization of mortalin disrupts calcium transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria through the IP 3 R–mortalin–VDAC1 complex. The impaired calcium shuttling triggers the activation of NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, ultimately attenuating apoptosis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP1 with ML323 effectively enhances PTCL cell sensitivity to doxorubicin, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy to improve treatment outcomes in PTCL patients. Collectively, we have found that USP1 represents a compelling therapeutic target for addressing chemoresistance and improving outcomes in PTCL therapy.",

          "abstract": "Octocorals are the major source of marine-derived bioactive terpenoids. However, the vast majority of explored chemistry is known from shallow-water species, leaving deep-sea octocorals largely unexplored. Recent genomic work uncovered terpene biosynthetic pathways encoded in octocoral genomes, enabling deeper investigation into the evolution and ecological distribution of these compounds. Here, we collected nine deep-sea octocoral specimens representing both taxonomic orders and profiled their terpenoid chemistry. These samples revealed extensive diversity in sesquiterpene scaffolds, along with repeated detection of five widespread structural families of diterpenes (xeniaphyllene-, cembrene B-, elisabethatriene-, cembrene A-, and klysimplexin R; collectively, “XBECK-type” diterpenoids). Phylogenetic analysis of terpene cyclase (TC) sequences from these samples, combined with publicly available sequences and functional characterization of selected genes, indicated that most TC genes encode functionally diverse sesquiterpene cyclases that corresponded to deeply rooted taxonomic origins, rather than biochemical function. We further identified five monophyletic clades, each comprising isofunctional enzymes that produce precursors for distinct XBECK-type diterpenoids and showing broad representation across octocoral taxa. These findings suggest that diterpenoid biosynthesis evolved early in coral evolution, with the last common ancestor already possessing multiple functionally distinct TC enzymes. Our results establish terpenoid production as an ancient, central trait of octocorals, irrespective of habitat, thereby highlighting the tremendous potential of deep-sea corals as sources for bioactive terpenoids. Finally, these findings raise intriguing questions about the evolutionary origins of these pathways within early cnidarians and across animal phyla more broadly.",

Full space–time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions.

What divergence that does exist between different actin isoforms is primarily tissue–specific, rather than species-specific. Sorting of actin isoforms into distinct cellular compartments is believed to be controlled by actin-binding proteins (ABPs), but little is known about how ABPs can differentiate between actin isoforms. We show that the actin-binding repeat (ABR) of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus effector VopV binds to cytoplasmic actin in a unique mode with a low nanomolar affinity, over a thousand times stronger than to muscle actin. Actin mutagenesis and cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that isoform-specific residues of previously unassigned function deep in the cleft between the two actin protofilament strands determine this selectivity. These results suggest a mechanism of highly selective, isoform-specific interactions between actin and its partners, and have broad implications for understanding the evolution of actin.

Nevertheless, several Cavendish somaclonal variants with stable TR4 resistance have been developed and widely cultivated in Taiwan. Despite this success, the underlying genetic and molecular bases remain largely unknown, limiting the broader application of this resistance to other varieties. Here, we apply genomic and functional analyses to uncover somatic mutations and key genes associated with TR4 resistance. We observe recurrent selection for large deletions on chromosome 5 and a tendency for elevated expression of salicylic acid-responsive genes in resistant variants. Within deletion regions, we pinpoint two members of the autoinhibited Ca 2+ -ATPase ( ACA ) gene family, known negative regulators of plant immunity, as candidate susceptibility genes. Both ACA genes are downregulated in resistant variants. Silencing the ACAs in susceptible bananas enhances salicylic acid response and attenuates TR4 disease symptoms. Our study highlights the role of structural variation and copy number change of susceptibility genes like ACAs in shaping disease resistance in clonally propagated crops. Also, these findings provide a genomic framework for the development of TR4-resistant banana cultivars through targeted gene editing or selection of somatic variants.",

In Arabidopsis , an oppositely oriented and LAZY-independent form of gravitropism causes the inflorescence stems of a lazy quadruple mutant ( atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ) to grow down and along the surface of the soil. Here, we report on a suppressor mutation that restores an upright inflorescence to a plant lacking LAZY functions. The suppressor of lazy quadruple 1 ( slq1 ) mutation alters one amino acid in a protein belonging to the NPH3/RPT2-like (NRL) family. The wild-type SLQ1 protein restores prostrate growth to the atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 mutant when expressed specifically in the gravity-sensing endodermal cells of the stem. The SLQ1 protein interacts head-to-tail with itself and, regardless of direction, with a homologous protein called SETH6. Distinct subcellular bodies apparently containing concentrated head-to-tail SLQ1 oligomers coated with SETH6 occurred primarily at sites of contact between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM), including plasmodesmata. The suppressing slq1 mutation (S149F) prevented these bodies from forming and reinverted the auxin gradient in the atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 inflorescence, switching its gravitropism from downward to upward. Thus, SLQ1 and at least one homolog (SETH6) function at ER–PM contact sites to counter the LAZY-dependent mechanism, not by inhibiting it but by regulating an apparently LAZY-independent gravity-directed process for creating an auxin gradient. Variation in the relative strengths of a LAZY-dependent and a SLQ1-mediated, LAZY-independent process of opposite effect may produce the great variety of stem organ postures observed in nature.",

Here, we describe a yeast display pipeline that can be deployed to rapidly screen peptides to identify class I pMHC binders across many alleles. Through this, we isolate unique biological phenomena such as alteration of the peptide presentation of HLA-B57 via interaction with the antiviral small molecule abacavir. We apply this approach to multiple pathogen proteomes ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis Type VII secretion substrates, SARS-CoV-2, Dengue, and Zika) to create a comprehensive list of potential T cell antigens. Altogether, this platform acts as a flexible tool to generate large unbiased datasets for class I peptide binding at a speed and scale competitive with the biological systems they represent.",

Recently, ultrasound-based printing (“sonoprinting”) approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to address this challenge. However, an approach to sonoprint conductive materials has yet to be realized, limiting potential bioelectronic applications. Here, we extend sonoprinting to conductive materials by designing temperature-based and pressure-based methods to polymerize conductive polymers with focused ultrasound (FUS). Our temperature-based approach relies on the acoustic attenuation of the surrounding medium to generate heat under FUS, whereas our pressure-based approach leverages the acoustic vaporization of perfluorohexane double emulsions to trigger polymerization. We demonstrate that both approaches can be used to print the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) through optically opaque hydrogels and biological tissue with high spatial resolution. Taken together, our results establish complementary temperature- and pressure-based methods for sonoprinting conductive polymers, paving the way for future efforts to fabricate bioelectronic interfaces in tissue.",

We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and treating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent. We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move toward areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our model: the first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient fixed over time and centered at the cancer site; the second is a more speculative, dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents sense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly than by simple Brownian motion. For the first variant, we present simulation and analytical results to bound the time it takes for agents to reach the cancer site. For the second, simulations highlight collective benefit from agent-generated signaling, showing significant runtime improvement via chemical signal amplification.",

The 3CL protease of coronavirus acts as a key mediator, serving a dual role in cleaving viral polyproteins to produce essential components for replication and targeting host proteins to disrupt regulatory pathways and suppress immune defenses. However, the mechanisms by which 3CL protease manipulates host proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we identify STIM1, a substrate of the 3CL protease, as a dual immune suppressor. Cleavage at the Q496 residue generates two stable products, N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) fragments, which acquire de novo immunomodulatory functions. NT suppresses MAVS aggregation and MAVS-TRAF2-TBK1 signalosome formation, while CT attenuates IKKα-induced p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by interacting with HSP70. Collectively, these dual modules simultaneously lead to the suppression of IFN-β production and the weakening of antiviral defenses. These findings reveal a distinct function of STIM1 and delineate a strategy employed by coronaviruses to modulate host immunity, offering insights into viral pathogenesis and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

This aggregation mechanism exerts a broad inhibitory effect on various enzymes and facilitates the construction of artificial cells with controllable reaction processes. Leveraging this phenomenon, we have developed a microfluidic platform to fabricate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that encapsulate CFPS systems, thereby constructing artificial cells with finely tunable protein expression. By incorporating targeted DNA templates, these artificial cells can selectively express specific proteins in response to pH adjustments. Furthermore, in vivo studies using a bile duct ligation mouse model with liver injury further confirmed significant differences in protein expression under alkaline conditions compared to neutral conditions.

While precipitation increase (Pi) is a major facet of climate change, its impacts on root- and AMF-mediated SOC formation and stability remain largely unexplored. Here, we combined a meta-analysis across global grasslands with a multiyear precipitation manipulation experiment in a semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau to disentangle the relative effects of roots and their associated AMF on microbial communities and SOC as influenced by Pi. We show that Pi induced tradeoffs between roots and AMF, and promoted SOC formation and stability via the mycelium- rather than the root-pathway, leading to an increase of 136% (±40) and 297% (±90) in mycelium-derived C and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC), respectively. Pi altered plant community composition, favoring subshrubs and forbs over grasses. Also, Pi reduced specific root length, but increased root diameter, tissue density, and root colonization and extraradical biomass of AMF. Furthermore, Pi-induced change in AMF shifted the soil bacterial community by favoring K-strategists, increasing bacterial necromass C and promoting MAOC accumulation. Our findings provide direct evidence that Pi enhances AMF-driven SOC sequestration by expanding the mycorrhizosphere and promoting microbiota with high C use efficiency, highlighting a key mechanism by which mycorrhizal fungi mediate SOC formation and stability under shifting precipitation regimes.",

Recent studies have revealed that many mosquito species regularly engage in high-altitude wind-borne migration, but its epidemiological significance remains unclear. The hypothesis that high-flying mosquitoes spread pathogens over long distances has not been directly tested. Here, we report that high-flying mosquitoes are commonly infected with arboviruses, protozoans, and helminths and provide a insights into this pathogen–vector aerial network. A total of 1,017 female mosquitoes intercepted on nets suspended from helium balloons at 120 to 290 m above ground over Mali and Ghana were screened for infection with arboviruses, Haemosporida, and filariae. The mosquitoes collected at altitude comprised 61 species, across 10 genera, dominated by Culex , Aedes, and Anopheles . Infection and infectiousness (capacity to transmit a pathogen to another host inferred based on disseminated infection) rates of migrant mosquitoes were 7.2% and 4.4% with Plasmodium spp., 1.6% and 0.6% with filariae, and 3.5% and 1.1% with flaviviruses, respectively. Twenty-one mosquito-borne pathogens were identified, including Dengue, West Nile, and M’Poko viruses, 15 avian Plasmodium species including Plasmodium matutinum , and three filariids, including Pelecitus sp. Confirmed head–thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in Culex perexiguus , Mansonia uniformis , and Anopheles squamosus reveal that pathogens carried by high-altitude wind-borne mosquitoes are capable of infecting hosts far from their departure location. This high-altitude traffic of sylvatic pathogens (circulating in wild animals) may be key to their maintenance among enzootic foci as well as initiating outbreaks at distant locations.",

          "abstract": "The estimation of natural selection is used to understand ecological and evolutionary processes in wild populations and is often used to predict change. However, the direct application of quantitative genetic methods, originally developed in animal breeding, has been less successful in the wild; in particular, predictions of evolutionary change are often made that are not observed. This misprediction, known as the “paradox of stasis,” can arise due to bias in estimates of selection via nonrandom missing data in phenotypes if viability selection has previously occurred on correlated traits. Here, we check for this bias in a wild population of Soay sheep where estimates of selection suggest that “bigger is better” for adult size, but evolutionary change of the predicted magnitude does not occur. We establish that standard procedures for estimating total lifetime selection are biased by prior viability selection. In particular, while phenotypically large lambs have high first year survival, we also show that lambs that are genetically predisposed to large adult size traits also suffer elevated juvenile mortality. While the phenotypic traits driving early-life selection against large adult body size are unknown, our genetic analysis reveals correlated selection against larger adult sizes that essentially resolves the paradox of stasis for adult body size traits in this wild population. The pattern we reveal is potentially widespread in nature; previous results showing predominantly positive selection of large body size could in general be explained by this kind of antagonistic prior viability selection.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which fuels metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified multiple heterogeneous tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) subpopulations as key regulators of PDAC progression, which coexpress MRC1 and exert their effects by actively suppressing antitumor immune responses. To overcome this barrier, we developed a spatiotemporal macrophage reprogramming platform that leverages STING phase separation to reprogram TAM plasticity and reshape the immune landscape. This system, MRC1-targeting peptide–M@BLZ945 (PMMB), integrates a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor and a STING agonist within a macrophage-mimetic nanostructure, enabling sequential, controlled reprogramming of TAMs. By leveraging STING phase separation, PMMB stabilizes TAMs in an antitumor CD80 + phenotype while preventing excessive inflammation, achieving durable immune activation. In preclinical models, PMMB not only suppresses both primary and metastatic PDAC but also enhances CD8 + T cell infiltration, reinvigorates anti-PD-1 therapy responses, and mitigates immune exhaustion. These findings establish spatiotemporal macrophage circuit engineering via STING phase separation as a cross-scale strategy to override PDAC’s immune barriers and drive next-generation macrophage-targeted immunotherapy.

We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity. Tuning for naturalistic structure was both strongest and most dispersed in V4.

Here, “reverse translation” experiments are performed where intact fecal microbiomes collected from trial participants before and at the end of treatment are introduced into female gnotobiotic mice just after delivery of their pups. Pups received diets designed to resemble those consumed by children in the trials to recreate “unrepaired” and “repaired” gut ecosystems. Analyses of the abundances of bacterial strains (metagenome-assembled genomes), their expressed genes, and metabolic products, combined with assessments of ponderal growth and intestinal epithelial lineage transcriptomes (single-nucleus RNA-Seq with follow-up immunocytochemistry) disclosed effects of MDCF-2 associated microbiome repair that cannot be determined, in part because “no treatment” control arms cannot be ethically incorporated into these trials. Specifically, microbiome repair in these mice produced significant increases in ponderal growth, changes in microbial gene expression consistent with a less virulent gut ecosystem and alterations in expression of i) components of cell junctions in the enterocytic and goblet cell lineages, ii) pathways for synthesis and secretion of eicosanoid immune effectors in chemosensory tuft cells, and iii) goblet cell pathways involved in glycosylation and secretion of mucin.

To further investigate the effects of species-specific PrP primary structural variation on the evolution of prion host range and strain properties during interspecies transmissions, we generated mice with precisely controlled expression of both murine and either deer or elk PrP C and challenged them with cervid or murine prions. While CWD prion transmission was inhibited to varying degrees under these conditions, the strain properties and species specificities of the resulting cervid prions were not impacted. By contrast, although murine prions induced conformational conversion of mouse but not coexpressed cervid PrP C , the resulting prions produced disease in mice expressing either cervid or mouse PrP C . Our findings show that while mouse PrP C inhibited conformational conversion of deer or elk PrP C without affecting the host range of CWD prions, coexpression of cervid PrP C influenced the selection of strains with expanded host range properties during conformational conversion of mouse PrP C by murine prions. Our studies reveal diverse influences of bystander PrP C expression on the replication, host range, and strain properties of prions generated during conformational conversion of their coexpressed cognate PrP C . These cooperative or inhibitory effects occur in trans and derive from species-specific primary structural variations between coexpressed PrP C substrates and infectious prions.",

Here, using structured illumination microscopy, electron microscopy, and correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we show that the type III intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) participates in mitochondria constriction and fission by interacting with Drp1. Remarkably, loss of GFAP results in hyperfused mitochondria under physiological and even Ca 2+ -induced mitochondrial fission conditions. Additionally, mutations in GFAP, the cause of Alexander disease, result in more Drp1 localized to GFAP and lead to significantly increased mitochondrial fissions.

It relies on reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) that allow repeated light-induced transitions between fluorescent on- and nonfluorescent off-states. Because these transitions are induced by low-light intensities, RESOLFT superresolution microscopy is particularly suitable for live-cell imaging. So far, RESOLFT imaging has only been performed in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. To expand the RESOLFT concept into the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is characterized by reduced autofluorescence, lower scattering and decreased phototoxicity, we developed the p hotostabl e N IR r e versibly switchab l e flu o rescent p rot e in (PENELOPE), which is the first RSFP applicable in the NIR window. PENELOPE was generated by mutagenesis of the chromophore-binding domain of the Deinococcus radiodurans bacteriophytochrome. This NIR-RSFP exhibits high photostability and high ensemble switching contrast at low-light intensities. It also undergoes an unusually fast thermal fluorescence recovery from the dark state into an on-state. This was exploited for low-light intensity RESOLFT imaging with only a single wavelength, as the same light wavelength (660 nm) is used for off-switching and fluorescence readout, while the on-switching occurs in the absence of illumination. We demonstrate RESOLFT recordings both in chemically fixed and in living human cells using PENELOPE as a fusion protein.",

          "abstract": "The developing brain undergoes neuroplasticity driven by learning, experience, and memory formation. The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized membrane domain within the proximal axon that initiates action potential. Studies have demonstrated that the AIS exhibits plasticity by altering its length and/or localization to adjust the excitability in response to neural stimuli. However, how AIS plasticity may affect brain function is unclear. The 480-kDa giant ankyrin-G protein (gAnkG) is the master organizer of AISs and nodes of Ranvier. Previously, we reported that a neurodevelopmental disorder-linked variant (Thr1861Met) in the neuron-specific domain of gAnkG causes the formation of diffused AISs in cultured ankyrin-G null neurons. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse harboring this mutation. The knock-in mice displayed impairments in motor coordination and social interaction. Neurons from these knock-in mice formed elongated AISs with no significant reduction in the accumulation of key AIS components-including ankyrin-G, β4-spectrin, voltage-gated sodium channels, and neurofascin. Crucially, unlike wild-type AISs, which shorten in response to stimulation by high K + or chemogenetics (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), the elongated AISs in mutant neurons failed to undergo such shortening, indicating a deficit in AIS plasticity. Neurons in the primary motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex of knock-in mice exhibited AISs of normal length at early stage but failed to undergo the developmental shortening observed in wild-type neurons; by postnatal day 60, this resulted in elongated AISs and increased neuronal excitability in these regions. Thus, the gAnkG protein mutation impairs activity-dependent AIS plasticity, leading to abnormal neuronal excitability and behavioral deficits.",

          "abstract": "Dogs were domesticated at least once from a yet-unidentified wolf population at least ~15,000 y ago. However, how domestication took place is a topic of ongoing debate, and the ability of human groups to manage wolves in their communities during early stages of domestication is poorly understood. Here, we report multiproxy data from two canids excavated from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age contexts in the Stora Förvar cave on the island of Stora Karlsö in the Baltic Sea. The island is small (2.5 sq km) and, like the neighboring island of Gotland, carries no endemic populations of terrestrial mammals. Instead, the current consensus is that human introductions account for some mammal fauna on Gotland, and for the majority of that on Stora Karlsö. Genome-wide data show that the two canids have ancestry indistinguishable from Eurasian wolves, with no shared ancestry with domestic dogs of the Canis familiaris lineage. Their genome-wide heterozygosity is lower than that observed in 72 previously published ancient wolf genomes, and instead comparable to dogs. Stable isotope data (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) reveals a diet rich in marine protein, which is consistent with habitation alongside the human groups who used Stora Karlsö as a seal-hunting, fowling, and sea fishing station, and in the Bronze Age probably also for grazing. Skeletal size is at the lower end of wolf variability, and one individual shows advanced pathology consistent with reduced mobility. While other scenarios are possible, a parsimonious explanation is that these wolves were brought to the island by humans and were possibly under human control.",

          "abstract": "Given the repetitive structure of crystalline ice, it is unsurprising that highly active ice-binding proteins (IBPs), often with beta-roll structures, also have repeating motifs. Here, we introduce a de novo designed family of ice-binding twistless alpha-helical repeat (iTHR) proteins. Each iTHR protein comprises two planar layers of parallel alpha-helices connected by loops—a structural topology not seen in native IBPs. The ice-binding helices contain an ordered array of TXXXAXXXAXX motifs, precisely spaced to complement the pyramidal {201} and secondary prism {110} planes of the ice lattice, with a designed 98.2° residue turn angle that orients all threonines uniformly toward the ice surface. iTHR proteins show high solubility, thermostability, and produce varied ice crystal morphologies depending on their intended target facet. Crucially, iTHRs exhibit ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) at critical concentrations comparable to those of many native globular IBPs. Extensive site-specific mutagenesis shows that ice-binding activity in iTHR proteins is robust, remaining largely unaffected by changes in chemical composition. Variation in the repeat number reveals a nonmonotonic relationship to IRI activity. X-ray crystal structures of two designs confirm the intended orientation of threonines, uniformly pointing toward the ice surface. The iTHR family provides a versatile platform to systematically investigate the complex structure–activity relationships underlying protein–ice interactions.",

In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time, as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN 2 mo following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against two different types of vaccines. On the one hand, we observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with an messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. In contrast, we observed an enhanced response when vaccinated with influenza vaccine inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.",

          "abstract": "In nature, plants cope with various pathogens that compete for cellular resources during infection. It has long been suggested that plant defense activity must be linked to cellular energy and metabolic states to optimize the balance between growth and defense. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate immune activity in relation to cellular energy status remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the plant energy sensor SNF1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) plays a critical role in modulating defense responses and bacterial resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana . Bacterial elicitor-induced expression of defense marker genes, such as PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 ( PR1 ), is significantly repressed under sugar-limited conditions in wild-type seedlings, whereas this expression is markedly enhanced in the snrk1α1i/α2 knockdown mutants. SnRK1 restricts defense-related gene expression and resistance to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which are partly dependent on salicylic acid (SA). In addition, we found that the SnRK1 kinase activity is increased by high humidity. Consistently, SnRK1 is critical for the suppression of SA-mediated defense responses under high humidity conditions. SnRK1 physically associates with the SA-related transcription factors TGACG SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEIN 4 (TGA4) and TGA2 to attenuate PR1 expression. These findings provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms linking cellular energy status with immune regulation in plants.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic levitation provides a unique method for manipulating small particles as it completely evades effects from gravity, container walls, or physical handling. These advantages make it a tantalizing platform for studying complex phenomena in many-particle systems. In most standing-wave traps, however, particles interact via acoustic scattering forces that cause them to merge into a single dense object. Here, we introduce a complementary approach that combines acoustic levitation with electrostatic charging to assemble, adapt, and activate complex, separated many-particle systems. The key idea is to superimpose electrostatic repulsion on the intrinsic acoustic attraction, rendering a so-called “mermaid” potential where interactions are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. By controlling the attraction–repulsion balance, we can levitate expanded structures where all particles are separated, collapsed structures where they are in contact, and hybrid ones consisting of both expanded and collapsed components. We find that collapsed and expanded structures are inherently stable, whereas hybrid ones exhibit transient stability governed by acoustically unstable dimers. Furthermore, we show how electrostatics allow us to adapt between configurations on the fly, either by quasistatic discharge or discrete up/down charge steps. Finally, we demonstrate how large structures experience selective energy pumping from the acoustic field—thrusting some particles into motion while others remain stationary—leading to complex dynamics including coupled rotations and oscillations. Our approach establishes a design space beyond acoustic collapse, offering possibilities to study many-particle systems with complex interactions, while suggesting pathways toward scalable integration into materials processing and other applications.",

          "abstract": "Synapses must be resilient to the challenges they confront during development, experience, disease, and aging. A conserved form of adaptive plasticity, observed at the glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), is expressed following acute pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs). This challenge is counteracted by enhanced presynaptic neurotransmitter release to maintain stable synaptic strength. This retrograde form of homeostatic plasticity is termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How retrograde PHP signaling is acutely induced in the postsynaptic compartment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that acute PHP induction does not require reductions in ionic flow through GluRs. Rather, pharmacological blockade provokes nanoscale changes in GluR organization that propagates remodeling of the postsynaptic apparatus. These postsynaptic structural changes are necessary for the presynaptic remodeling that characterizes PHP, including enhanced active zone intensity. Next, using a CRISPR-based genetic screen, we identify Discs large (DLG), the fly homolog of mammalian PSD-95, as a key postsynaptic substrate selectively required for acute PHP signaling. Finally, we find that homeostatic remodeling of both pre- and postsynaptic compartments persists in the absence of synaptic activity. Together, we propose that acute pharmacological perturbation of GluRs triggers activity-independent conformational signaling that is propagated throughout the postsynaptic apparatus, transmitting retrograde information that rapidly induces PHP.",

We previously reported that multiple tissue stem/progenitor cells can be efficiently enriched from regeneration buds using the side population (SP) method. Here, we performed trajectory inference using single-cell RNA sequencing data of the SP fraction to construct differentiation trajectories and identify putative tissue stem cell populations that initiate differentiation pathways. We found that complement c1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 ( c1qtnf3 ) is specifically expressed in putative muscle stem cells (MSC) and, using knockdown (KD; CRISPR/Cas9-based F0 crispants) experiments, demonstrated that c1qtnf3 is necessary for tail regeneration. Furthermore, we found that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD was accompanied by abrogation of macrophage-like cell accumulation at the amputation site. These phenotypes were rescued by macrophage-like cell-specific forced expression of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 , a gene related to effector molecule production in myeloid cells, suggesting that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD is due to macrophage dysregulation. Our findings suggest that, in Xenopus , putative MSC modulate macrophage function via c1qtnf3 expression for successful tail regeneration.",

Nanoclusters of boron have also been found to exhibit intriguing structural properties, observed to have predominantly planar structures, in stark contrast to bulk boron allotropes, which are composed of the ubiquitous B 12 icosahedral building blocks. Here, we report observation of the 2D-to-3D transition and bulk-like structural features in the size-selected boron clusters, as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, chemisorption experiments, and first-principles calculations.

Notably, B 56 – is also found to be able to chemisorb and activate CO 2 . The global minimum of B 46 – is found to adopt a core-shell structure (B 2 @B 44 – ), consisting of a B 2 core within a B 44 shell, reminiscent of the interstitial B 2 dumbbells in the high-pressure γ -B 28 form of bulk boron. More remarkably, both the global minimum and the second most stable isomer of B 56 – exhibit nest-like configurations, featuring the iconic B 12 icosahedral core surrounded by a B 44 half-shell (B 12 @ h- B 44 – ), signifying the onset of bulk-like structural characteristics in boron nanoclusters.",

          "abstract": "The timing and quality of sleep is regulated by circadian- and sleep–wake-driven processes. The core clock gene Bmal1 not only affects the circadian timing of sleep, but also the response to sleep deprivation (SD), which, in turn, causes long-term changes in cortical Bmal1 expression. We aimed at separating the circadian- and sleep–wake-driven contributions to BMAL1 binding to its target genes in the cerebral cortex by scheduling 6 SDs at 4 h intervals across the daily 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. We show that BMAL1 rhythmically bound its tissue-specific targets with tissue-specific dynamics, reaching peak binding 2 to 4 h later in the cortex than in the liver, while trough times did not differ. The SDs affected BMAL1 binding most significantly in the cortex, causing 80% of rhythmically bound regions to lose rhythmicity, suggesting BMAL1 binding has a prominent sleep–wake-driven component in this tissue. Analyses of the promoters of other core clock-genes indicate that BMAL1 binding to Bhlhe41 and Nr2d1 have a strong sleep–wake-driven component, while for Per2 two binding regions were identified one with circadian- and the other with sleep–wake-driven binding dynamics. Our results attest to a nonadditive interaction of time-of-day and time-spent-awake affecting the core molecular circadian circuitry. It further highlights that rhythms in gene expression in peripheral tissues are an emergent property of molecular interactions beyond that of the core molecular clock circuitry.",

We report that beyond its function of degrading poly-ubiquitinylated proteins, the immunoproteasome (i-20S) is required for the proper function of ILC2s by controlling their mitochondrial capacity. We found that 90% of the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes in human ILC2s (hILC2s) are the immuno- (β5i) rather than constitutive (β5c) isoform. Specific, noncovalent, reversible inhibition of i-20S β5i (LMP7) in hILC2s induced ROS production, which inhibited aconitase, leading to altered mitochondrial function and reduced levels of ATP. Reprogramming of metabolic status by an LMP7 inhibitor impaired ILC2 activation, without significant cytotoxicity or preventing their recovery. Hence, the selective inhibition of i-20S in ILC2 cells did not kill them but reversibly depleted their ATP, preventing their activation and cytokine secretion. In mice, proteasome inhibition similarly blocked mitochondrial function and ILC2 activation, preventing airway inflammation in response to IL33 and asthma in response to house dust mites. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated linkage between proteasome blockade, central carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial function and identify a strategy to regulate immune cell metabolism in inflammatory diseases.",

Here, we apply state-of-the-art equivariant deep learning architectures to the task of assigning global labels to orbitals, namely energies characterizations, given the molecular coefficients from Hartree–Fock or density functional theory. The architecture we have developed, the Cartesian Equivariant Orbital Network ( CEONET ), shows how molecular orbital coefficients are readily featurized as equivariant node features common to all graph-based machine-learned potentials. We find that CEONET performs well at predicting difficult quantitative labels such as the orbital energy and orbital entropy. Furthermore, we find that the CEONET representation provides an intuitive latent space for differentiating orbital character for the qualitative assignment of e.g. bonding or antibonding character. In addition to providing a useful representation for further integrating deep learning with electronic structure theory, we expect CEONET to be useful for automatizing and interpreting the results of advanced electronic structure methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory. In particular, the ability of CEONET to infer multireference character via the orbital entropy paves the way toward the machine-learned selection of active spaces.",

          "abstract": "Following the late 2022 transition from its “dynamic zero-COVID” policy, China experienced a major nationwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron wave. To characterize the wave’s transmission dynamics, we used a Bayesian framework to fit a deterministic transmission model to two key data streams: reported COVID-19 daily case counts preceding the policy shift (up to November 11, 2022) and weekly virological and influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance data afterward (through February 12, 2023). We estimated a nationwide cumulative infection attack rate reaching 87.8% (95% CrI: 75.9 to 93.3%) by mid-February 2023. Notably, 84.1% of the population became infected within just 1 mo following the full policy relaxation on December 7. The estimated time-varying effective reproduction number peaked at 5.69 (95% CrI: 4.56 to 6.85) on December 8, 2022. Although transmission intensity increased during the Spring Festival travel rush (Chunyun), widespread population immunity prevented a subsequent wave. Prior to the Chunyun period, distinct relationships emerged: Estimated transmission rates showed a significant positive correlation with long-term population behavioral response coefficient (reflecting cumulative infections; Pearson correlation: ρ = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001), while mobility patterns correlated positively with short-term behavioral response coefficient (reflecting current infection prevalence; Pearson correlation: ρ = 0.87, P &lt; 0.001). These dynamic behavioral associations, which we further validated against empirical data on keyword search and media coverage, then weakened during the Chunyun period. In summary, this analysis quantifies Omicron’s transmission potential and highlights the importance of incorporating time-varying behavioral factors into epidemic models to accurately describe transmission dynamics, especially during periods of abrupt policy change.",

This oscillation, with a period of 30 to 60 d, is evident across multiple variables and involves interactions between convection, radiation, surface fluxes, and large-scale circulation. It is primarily manifested as convective perturbations in the tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool accompanied by oscillations in the large-scale tropical overturning circulation. Here, we examine the relationship between TWISO, the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the instability of radiative-convective equilibrium. Certain phases of TWISO coincide with specific phases of the MJO, suggesting a potential connection between the two. However, although the MJO can amplify the oscillation amplitude of TWISO, it is not essential for TWISO to occur. Finally, due to its broad manifestation across the tropics, TWISO potentially exerts widespread influence on tropical weather and climate at regional scales.",

We found that GPSM1 expression in lesional macrophages was increased during atherosclerosis development both in mice and humans. Myeloid-specific GPSM1 ablation protects mice against atherosclerosis and reduces aortic inflammation in both Apoe −/− mice and an AAV-PCSK9 injection model. Conversely, myeloid-restricted overexpression of GPSM1 accelerates aortic inflammation and promotes atherosclerosis development in mice. Mechanistically, GPSM1 deficiency suppressed monocyte activation including chemotaxis and adhesion through inhibition of the p38/ERK MAPK pathway regulated by the cAMP/PKA/KLF4/PMP22 axis, thereby alleviating proinflammatory responses within atherosclerotic plaques. Blockade of PMP22 using siRNA-loaded liposomes protected GPSM1 overexpression mice from atherosclerosis. Furthermore, a small-molecule compound inhibiting GPSM1 function could suppress atherosclerosis in vivo. In conclusion, our findings establish that GPSM1 is a regulator of atherosclerosis development and targeting GPSM1 might be a promising therapy against atherosclerosis.",

          "abstract": "Perennial plants, such as trees native to temperate and boreal regions, exhibit meristems that undergo annual cycles of activity and rest to synchronize their growth cycles with seasonal changes, ensuring survival under harsh winter conditions. The arrest of shoot meristem growth, known as growth cessation, is a critical initial step for trees to enter dormancy. This process is triggered by a combination of endogenous and exogenous signals, yet the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying growth cessation remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Populus orthologs of APETALA2-like transcription factors (AP2Ls), the primary regulators of global proliferative arrest (GPA) in Arabidopsis , play a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal growth cessation in hybrid aspen trees. In particular, AP2Ls act as important activators of the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T2 ( FT2 ), a key gene for short-day-induced growth cessation. This contrasts with the established role of AP2Ls as repressors of FT in annual plants. Yet, the pathway itself is conserved with the pathway regulating GPA in annual plants, a completely different process during the plant life cycle. Our research highlights both the conserved roles and functional diversities of AP2Ls in a more general balancing of meristem proliferation and arrest in perennial plants, providing insights into the evolutionary adaptation of growth regulation mechanisms across plant species.",

However, the mechanism by which OST1 regulates SLAC1 activation and its relationship with CPKs remain unclear. Here, we identify that OST1 primarily activates SLAC1 in this process through CPK15. Mutation of CPK15 significantly impairs ABA-induced stomatal closure and increases drought sensitivity. OST1 interacts with CPK15 and phosphorylates it at T103, which is essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CPK15 can phosphorylate eight sites in the N terminus of SLAC1 to activate its anion currents in oocytes. Expression of SLAC1 8D (a phosphomimetic form) in oocytes constitutively activates anion channel activity and effectively restores the impaired ABA-induced stomatal closure of cpk15-1 but not by SLAC1 8A (a phospho-dead form). Furthermore, activated CPK15 by OST1 and Ca 2+ enhances its activity toward SLAC1, and mutations of both OST1 and CPK15 have additive effect on ABA-induced stomatal closure, suggesting that CPK15 activates SLAC1 through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the key role of CPK15 in ABA-induced stomatal closure, revealing a connection between OST1 and CPKs in both Ca 2+ -independent and Ca 2+ -dependent pathways in ABA-induced stomatal closure.",

In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex.

Apical dendritic tuft in intratelencephalic neurons typically encoded reward and strategy, but these task-specific representations were altered in Scn2a +/− mice.

However, no therapies currently exist to mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction linked to genetic deficiencies in MFN2. Herein, we performed a drug repurposing screen to identify compounds that selectively activate the integrated stress response (ISR)—the predominant stress-responsive signaling pathway responsible for regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. This screen identified the compounds parogrelil and MBX-2982 as potent and selective activators of the ISR through the OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling axis. We show that treatment with these compounds promotes adaptive, ISR-dependent remodeling of mitochondrial morphology and protects mitochondria against genetic and chemical insults. Moreover, we show that pharmacologic ISR activation afforded by parogrelil restores mitochondrial tubular morphology, promotes mitochondrial motility, rescues MERCs, and enhances mitochondrial respiration in MFN2 -deficient cells. These results demonstrate the potential for pharmacologic ISR activation through the OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling pathway as a potential strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in CMT2A and other pathologies associated with MFN2 deficiency.",

While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow intercompartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios where slow particle exchange maximizes yield and minimizes assembly time for given suboptimal reaction dynamics, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intracompartmental reactions and intercompartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.",

We employed advanced live-cell imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological techniques to dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of exocyst subunit interactions and cargo vesicle association in Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells. Our results demonstrate that subunits from SC1 and SC2 colocalize and undergo actin-dependent transport to the plasma membrane (PM). Disruption of either SEC6 (SC1) or EXO70A1 (SC2) prevented PM association of both subcomplexes, indicating cytoplasmic preassembly of the cis -exocyst complex before PM recruitment. Critically, we found that the exocyst does not directly bind vesicles carrying cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Instead, exocyst subunits first migrate on CSC-negative vesicles, which then coalesce with CSC-carrying vesicles at the cell cortex via heterotypic fusion. Together, our findings reveal a parallel mechanism for exocyst assembly and cargo loading.

We identified phoP mutants were among the most highly sensitive strains to methylglyoxal in vitro. phoP mutants are highly attenuated in mice but a phoP mutant was even more attenuated in mice that accumulate methylglyoxal. We further found phoP bacilli were more permeable to methylglyoxal and accumulated glycated proteins.

          "abstract": "Cell migration relies on balancing focal adhesion (FA) stability—necessary for traction generation—and turnover—essential for forward translocation. Here, we dissect how integrin binding frequency and force-dependent bond duration jointly regulate this balance in fibroblasts. Using block copolymer micelle nanolithography, we create gold nanoparticle (Au NP) arrays with controlled spacings to vary integrin–ligand binding frequency. In parallel, tension gauge tethers (TGTs) with defined force threshold limit bond lifetime of high-force integrins under cellular traction. We find that intermediate ligand spacing coupled with a moderate rupture threshold dramatically accelerates fibroblast migration—up to twelvefold faster than on denser or sparser substrates. These conditions foster rapid FA turnover and support a dendritic actin architecture driven by lamellipodia, challenging the longstanding view of fibroblasts as inherently slow, mesenchymal movers. Knockout and blocking experiments further identify α5β1 as the mechanically dominant integrin subtype that plays a pivotal role in supporting this rapid migration. Mechanistically, FAs remain sufficiently stable to generate traction but also disassemble quickly, fostering continuous protrusion–retraction cycles essential for high-speed migration. These findings refine the classic biphasic model of cell migration into a two-dimensional framework that considers ligand spacing (binding frequency) and TGT force thresholds (binding duration). Beyond expanding fundamental understanding of integrin mechanobiology, our results provide broad avenues for tissue engineering and therapeutic applications, where finely tuned adhesion mechanics can markedly modulate cell speed and phenotype.",

ADGRG6/GPR126 is an aGPCR critical for axon myelination, heart development, and ear development; ADGRG6 is also associated with developmental diseases and cancers. ADGRG6 has a large, alternatively spliced, five-domain extracellular region (ECR) that samples different conformations and is essential for receptor function in vivo. However, the mechanistic details of how the ECR regulates signaling are unclear. Herein, we studied the conformational dynamics of the conserved CUB domain which is located at the distal N terminus of the ADGRG6 ECR and is deleted in an alternatively spliced isoform (ΔCUB). We show that the ΔCUB isoform has decreased signaling and is insensitive to inclusion of an activating splice insertion (+ss). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the CUB domain is involved in interdomain contacts to maintain a compact ECR conformation. A cancer-associated CUB domain mutant, C94Y, drastically perturbs the ECR conformation and results in elevated signaling, whereas another CUB mutant located near a conserved Ca 2+ -binding site, Y96A, decreases signaling. Our results suggest an ECR-mediated mechanism for ADGRG6 regulation in which the CUB domain instructs conformational changes within the ECR to regulate receptor signaling.",

How processive synthesis is maintained under these conditions has remained unclear. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy in live cells to show that Pol III rapidly rebinds the replisome within seconds of dissociation. This fast recruitment is driven by an interaction with single-stranded DNA–binding protein (SSB), which enhances Pol III target search efficiency by ~20-fold.

The success of this approach depends on the internalization and retention of the payload in target cells. This study introduces a method using a small protein domain engineered for conditional target affinity, enabling lysosomal trafficking independent of the biological fate of the receptor. Specifically, we describe the development of an EGF receptor binder, CaRA EGFR , with calcium-regulated affinity (CaRA), meaning the target binding strength is tailored by the available calcium concentration. This allows for endosomal dissociation, as calcium levels are lower in endosomes than in the bloodstream. Affinity measurements and structural modeling reveal the molecular basis of the calcium modulated affinity. Live cell imaging demonstrates efficient internalization and lysosomal trafficking of the calcium-dependent domain, while the EGF receptor is recycled to the membrane. When used as a drug carrier, CaRA EGFR effectively delivers the toxin to the lysosomes, resulting in potent cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 0.8 nM in EGFR-expressing cancer cells",

In jawless vertebrates, such as lampreys, T-like cells are thought to develop in lympho-epithelial structures at the tips of gill filaments, termed thymoids. However, it is unclear whether thymoids are functionally equivalent to the thymus of jawed vertebrates. Indeed, because the structural modules that are somatically assembled to form the antigen receptors of jawless and jawed vertebrates differ, development and selection of T cells may be governed by clade-specific genetic networks. To address this question, we have replaced the mouse Foxn1 gene, a key regulator of the thymic microenvironment in jawed vertebrates, with the orthologous FOXN1 lamprey gene, which is expressed in the thymoids alongside genes orthologous to known targets of the mouse Foxn1 transcription factor. The reconstituted thymi support normal T cell development, and, to a lesser extent, also support B cell development, indicating that the lamprey FOXN1 gene can rescue the block of thymic epithelial cell differentiation in mice deficient for the endogenous Foxn1 gene. The absence of overt autoimmunity in transgenic mice suggests that the reconstituted thymic microenvironment directs the development of a self-tolerant T cell repertoire. These findings highlight the remarkable similarity of thymic epithelial functions in jawed and jawless vertebrates, despite more than 500 My of independent evolution. Our results thus suggest that the emergence of the Foxn1 transcription factor in the common ancestor of vertebrates was associated with the advent of a specialized tissue environment supporting the development and selection of T cells.",

Although previous studies have explored the impact of acetylation on selected lysine residues within the M2 isoform of PK (PKM2), a more comprehensive selection of acetylation sites and their respective effects on both PKM2 and the highly homologous PKM1 isoform is lacking. Here, we describe the structural, functional, and regulatory effects of site-specific acetylation on an expanded set of conserved lysines in PKM2 and selected lysines in PKM1. To study homogeneously acetylated proteins, we genetically encoded the incorporation of acetylated lysine into PKM variants expressed in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells. Our integrated biochemical, structural, and computational approach revealed K115 acetylation as an inhibitory modification in both PKM1 and PKM2 that stabilizes a closed active site conformation of the proteins. We also show that, in contrast to K115 acetylation, previously reported acetylation of K305 inhibits PKM2 but has no effect on the activity and oligomerization of PKM1. These findings propose the existence of both uniform and isoform-specific regulatory mechanisms of PKM, mediated by acetylation.",

Here, we find recombinant human DDHD2 preferentially hydrolyzes diacylglycerol (DAG) over phospholipids, with a slight preference for DAG over triacylglycerol (TAG). DDHD2 also exhibits transacylase activity, which enables transfer of acyl chains from TAGs to DAGs and monoacylglycerols to remodel the acyl chains of TAGs. A predicted hydrophobic amphipathic helix on DDHD2 is essential for lipid droplet binding in vitro and in cells, and its lack reduces the enzymatic activity and TAG acyl chain remodeling. Adipose triglyceride lipase, but not hormone sensitive lipase, also has transacylation activity and can remodel TAG acyl chains, but to a lesser extent than DDHD2.

          "abstract": "Translation of mammalian G-rich telomeric RNA via the Repeat Associated non-AUG (AUG, the mRNA start codon) mechanism can produce proteins consisting of long repeats of valine–arginine (VR) or glycine–leucine (GL) dipeptides. Their role in the cell has not been elucidated. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with antibody staining we previously observed VR sequestered in punctate bodies and liquid droplets in the cytoplasm and nuclei of nonmitotic cells. Here, we report that cells in mitosis show diffuse VR staining throughout the cell, giving these cells a bright appearance. Upon mitotic enrichment using the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibitor RO-3306. RO-3306, 100% of the mitotic cells showed the same diffuse staining. Antibody staining showed colocalization of VR and the L4 ribosomal protein in mitotic cells and in an in vitro firefly luciferase assay, VR depressed translation. Affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry identified ribosomal proteins as the major class of VR interacting proteins in U2OS cells including L4 along with tubulin and proteins related to neural degenerative diseases. This change from a sequestered, punctate state in interphase to dispersed diffuse staining in mitosis, and the affinity of VR for the L4 protein which lines the ribosomal exit tunnel suggests that an oligomerization change of VR may facilitate its involvement in inhibiting of global translation during mitosis. Extension to mouse embryonic cerebral cortical development showed clear staining in the ventricular zone where neural progenitor cells with a high mitotic index proliferate and in the cortical plate where new neurons settle.",

          "abstract": "Identifying progenitor cells in laryngeal and vocal fold (VF) mucosa is essential for advancing stem cell–based therapies for VF diseases. In this study, we used Lrig1 (leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1) gene to label tissue-resident stem cells within laryngeal and VF mucosa, aiming to investigate cellular networks underlying VF homeostasis and regeneration. Lrig1 + cells exhibited hallmark features of quiescent stem cells—including slow cycling, long-term persistence, and differentiation potential—and contributed to sustained VF regeneration and repair after naphthalene injury. By one week post injury Lrig1 + progeny restored the damaged VF epithelium. Transcriptionally, these cells suppressed cell type specific genes and proliferation while activating programs related to RNA metabolism, epigenetic regulation, and protein ubiquitination, consistent with quiescence and readiness for activation. Lrig1 + cells were enriched in basal, parabasal, and immature secretory populations within surface epithelium and submucosal glands, residing in niches characterized by transcriptional flexibility and spatial shielding from direct stress—features that likely prevent premature or chronic mobilization. Notably, analogous LRIG1 expressing cells were identified in human laryngeal and VF tissues, highlighting the translational relevance of our findings. To explore regulation of Lrig1 + cell quiescence, we conditionally deleted Notch1, which led to epithelial hyperplasia, expansion of secretory populations, and mucus hyperproduction. In summary, Lrig1 marks a conserved, quiescent stem cell population in the larynx and VFs that supports long-term tissue homeostasis and repair, with quiescence maintained via Notch1 signaling.",

Yet, how MNC regulates microbial arsenic (As) methylation processes in soil remains unclear. Across major Chinese rice-growing regions, bacterial and fungal necromass carbon showed significant positive correlations ( P &lt; 0.05) with the transcribed arsM gene. Soil incubation experiments with seven soils explored how straw and three types of MNC—gram-positive bacterial necromass carbon (G + -NC), gram-negative bacterial necromass carbon (G − -NC), and fungal necromass carbon (F-NC)—affect As methylation. Our results demonstrated that all types of MNC enhanced As methylation, and G − -NC exhibiting the most pronounced effect on methylated As accumulation. The addition of 10 to 60 mg G − -NC maximally increased As(III) by 43.0 to 75.9% and enhanced methylated As by 4.4- to 18.0-fold in soil porewater vs. the control. Further, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses demonstrated that G − -NC addition upregulated the relative abundance of transcribed arsM and arsC2 genes, which were mostly assigned to Acidobacteriota , Pseudomonadota , Planctomycetota, and Bacteroidota . Notably, the transcriptional activity of arsM -harboring Methanosarcinales and Moorellales was markedly enhanced at the order level. By promoting As reduction process, G − -NC provides more substrates for As methylation process in soil. Furthermore, G − -NC could be used as a carbon source for As-methylating microorganisms, stimulating the transcriptional activity of arsM , which has been confirmed by the incubation experiment with pure culture of Paraclostridium benzoelyticum TC8. This study highlights the critical role of MNC in regulating As biogeochemistry, establishing a basis for predicting the extent of As methylation and risk of rice straighthead disease in paddy ecosystems.",

To identify reference point encoding at both the single-neuron and population levels, we analyzed neural activity from macaques performing a wealth accumulation task that dissociated objective reward values from the reference point. Across six frontal regions, we found that reference-related signals were broadly distributed at the single-neuron level. However, at the population level, only the ventral bank of the anterior cingulate cortex (vbACC) encoded the reference point significantly. In contrast, the dorsal bank of ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed population-level encoding of reference-dependent subjective value signals. The temporal sequence of these signals and their known anatomical connectivity hints at a dedicated neural circuit for reference dependence, with the vbACC potentially serving as a global source of reference point signal modulating activity in downstream value-encoding regions.",

Two concentric cylinders of actively dividing stem cells are the main drivers of radial thickening during secondary growth, each producing distinct vascular cell types toward the inside and the outside. While the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation have been well studied, it remains unclear how these stem cell layers determine which cell type is generated. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signaling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favoring the differentiation of only one type of cell. Our results thus show that the phosphorylation status of ANT regulates root girth and biomass accumulation by influencing bilateral stem cell production.

However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to a lack of experimental tools. Here, we introduce SurFlex microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering, self-interactions, and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA sequence linked to Huntington’s disease exhibits unusual flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a tool for quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental biological processes.",

While animal models have elucidated key conserved signaling pathways involved in early TE specification, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), WNT, and HIPPO, species-specific differences during early development emphasize the need for human-specific models. We previously identified VGLL1, a coactivator of TEAD transcription factors, as a human-specific placental marker. In this study, we employed a pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based model of TE induction by BMP4 to investigate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional dynamics during TE formation. BMP4-induced chromatin accessibility changes promoted a trophoblast gene expression program, while mesoderm lineage markers were only transiently expressed upon canonical WNT activation. We found that VGLL1 was expressed downstream of key TE transcription factors (GATA2/3, TFAP2A/C) but was essential for establishment of full trophoblast identity by up-regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and reinforcing GATA3 expression through positive feedback. Notably, VGLL1 enhanced canonical WNT signaling via direct regulation of WNT receptors and effectors. We also identified KDM6B, a histone demethylase that removes H3K27me3 repressive marks, as a direct VGLL1 target. KDM6B facilitated activation of bivalent promoters associated with TE markers, linking epigenetic regulation to lineage identity. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework positioning VGLL1 as a central regulator that integrates HIPPO, BMP, and WNT signaling pathways to drive establishment of human TE.",

While effects of such short-term plasticity on neural information processing have long been studied, it is unclear how interactions between short-term and long-term plasticity affect the learning abilities of neural networks. Here, we show that long-term changes to the short-term plasticity of individual synaptic connections enable neurons to learn to process temporal sequences of spikes as if they were spatial patterns. This mechanism allows neural circuits to flexibly increase their capacity and robustness at the expense of elevated spiking activity. We further show that neurons with plastic short-term plasticity can learn to discriminate between inputs on the basis of multineuronal spike correlations that extend over space and time. Our model fits recent electrophysiological measurements of short-term plasticity in the mouse and human neocortex and is consistent with the distributions of short-term plasticity induction and recovery. Our theory predicts that the learning rule observed at a given synaptic connection depends on the degree and type of short-term plasticity which is induced by the induction protocol for long-term plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Given the large amplitude of prograde annual polar motion, we are able to quantify year-to-year variability of prograde annual excitation amplitude since pre-1900 observations. We obtain a Prograde Annual Amplitude Modulation (PAAM) time series and use it to investigate several key topics, including variability in annual excitation amplitude, its climatic sources, and its potential role in Chandler wobble (CW) excitation. An important finding is that the PAAM series undergoes multiyear episodes of a near six-year oscillation (SYO). This provides observational evidence for a SYO in Earth’s climate and rotational dynamics seen in recent data and confirms SYO behavior in the climate system over the past century. Using climate model and other data, we find that several fluid components of Earth’s climate system contribute to the SYO, with atmospheric sources playing the dominant role. A SYO [~0.16 cycles per year (cpy)] modulation of the annual component introduces variations at the sum and difference frequencies (1 + 0.16 cpy and 1 − 0.16 cpy). Because the difference frequency 0.84 cpy is near the Chandler frequency, the SYO may be important in understanding CW excitation. Our results show the SYO contributes significantly to the excitation of CW. Year-to-year variability of the annual excitation was originally proposed as an excitation mechanism by Harold Jeffreys in 1940, and we confirm that more than half the CW excitation power can be attributed to this cause. We also found annual excitation modulation at a period near 17 mo (~0.7 cpy) that is a source of excitation power near 1 ± 0.7 cpy.",

Instances of wolf-to-dog introgression are rare, but adaptive introgression has been shown in association with high-altitude survival. Any widespread gene flow, however, has fallen below thresholds of detection in genome-wide statistical assessments. To reexamine evidence of dog–wolf gene flow, we analyzed 2,693 published dog and wolf genomes and combined highly sensitive local ancestry inference and phylogenomic analyses of nuclear genes, mitochondrial genomes, and Y-chromosome sequences. Although dogs and wolves segregate decisively at the nuclear level, no individual nuclear gene tree supports dog monophyly. Uniparental markers show mixed and interleaved dog and wolf clades with strong support and incongruent phylogenetic topologies. Using local ancestry inference, we find that 64.1% of modern breed dogs carry wolf ancestry from admixture that occurred nearly a thousand generations ago on average and now covers ~0.14% of their individual nuclear genomes. Among modern free-living village dogs (n = 280), 100% of analyzed genomes carry wolf ancestry. We find that wolf ancestry in dog breeds correlates with functional traits including size, breed category, and personality characteristics. In village dogs, wolf ancestry is enriched at olfactory receptor genes, suggesting adaptive introgression for sensory acuity that may have helped these free-living dogs survive in more challenging environments. In total, dog–wolf admixture has likely been an important factor in shaping the evolution of modern dogs.",

Understanding their mechanical behavior under high strain rates is essential for the use of these materials in extreme environments. We report on a highly unusual fracture behavior observed in borosilicate glass facilitated by stress-induced molecular rearrangements, allowing the glass to withstand tensile stresses up to 11 GPa. Converging surface acoustic waves (SAW) with controlled amplitude are generated optically and used to investigate the high-strain-rate (10 8 s −1 ) fracture behavior of borosilicate glass. Above a tensile stress threshold of 6 GPa, fracture of the glass surface is observed, characterized by ejection of material and radial cracking. Unexpectedly, upon further increase of the SAW stress, a second threshold of 8 GPa tensile stress is observed above which the fracture probability dramatically decreases. Raman spectra and nanoindentation measurements of shocked samples indicate significant changes in the topology and coordination numbers of silicon and boron atoms in the amorphous network. These results suggest the ability of thresholded atomic rearrangements to serve as an intrinsic high-strain-rate toughening mechanism for enhanced fracture toughness in amorphous borosilicate glass under dynamic strain conditions.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that provide alternatives to small-molecule drugs to combat infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To infect a bacterial host, a phage needs to bind to the bacterial surface via receptor binding proteins (RBPs), which are critical for determining host specificity. For functionally important receptors, the RBP–receptor interaction could be exploited via phage steering, where emerging bacterial resistance due to receptor modification could make bacteria less fit or virulent. Despite this, relatively little is known about RBP–receptor interactions. Here, we build on the recent discovery of coliphages that have the outer membrane (OM) lipopolysaccharide translocon LptDE as their terminal receptor and show via cryogenic electron microscopy that, surprisingly, the RBP of the small siphophage Oekolampad binds to a hitherto unobserved, open state of LptDE. The open lateral gate of LptD is occupied by a β-strand peptide originating from the degraded N-terminal jellyroll domain of LptD, suggesting the possibility of LptD inhibition via peptidomimetics. A structure of LptDE in complex with the superinfection exclusion (SE) protein Rtp45 of the Oekolampad-related phage Rtp shows a mechanism of SE where Rtp45-induced conformational changes in LptD resulting from steric clashes preclude RBP binding. Finally, analysis of spontaneous Oekolampad-resistant Escherichia coli mutants identifies mutations in LptD that abolish the LptDE–RBP interaction in vitro. SDS-EDTA sensitivity assays of the mutants show no major OM defects, consistent with largely preserved LptDE function, and suggesting that phage steering via LptDE might be challenging.",

Alternate splicing within the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) generates the PAC1R short variant (PAC1sR) that has selectively enhanced VIP function compared to the full-length, PAC1R null variant (PAC1nR). However, to date, a comprehensive pharmacological assessment of the downstream signaling outcomes of PAC1sR activation compared to PAC1nR has not been performed, and little information is available to mechanistically understand how ECD splicing may alter ligand engagement. Here, we demonstrated that VIP, but not PACAP, has globally enhanced activity across a broad range of functional endpoints at PAC1sR compared to PAC1nR. Cryo-EM structures of VIP-bound, stimulatory G protein (G s )-coupled PAC1sR and PAC1nR, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrate transient engagement of the null loop in PAC1nR, which is absent in PAC1sR, with residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the N-terminal helix of the ECD. These interactions result in differential engagement of VIP with these domains and the top of TM2/ECL1 with PAC1sR and PAC1nR. Moreover, MD simulations predicted differential interactions of the G s protein with the two PAC1R variants when bound by VIP that correlate with a greater allosteric influence of the G s protein on VIP affinity at the PAC1sR, relative to PAC1nR. Our study provides insights into the structural basis and functional consequences of PAC1R ECD splicing, increasing understanding of PAC1R ligand selectivity and signaling.",

In aging muscle, mTORC1 becomes overactivated, contributing to sarcopenia, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify DEAF1, a FOXO-regulated transcription factor, as a key upstream driver of mTORC1 in aged muscle. Elevated Deaf1 expression increases mTOR transcription, leading to heightened mTORC1 activity, impaired proteostasis, and muscle senescence. Remarkably, exercise suppresses Deaf1 expression via FOXO activation, restoring mTORC1 balance and alleviating muscle aging. Conversely, FOXO inhibition or Deaf1 overexpression blocks exercise benefits on muscle health. These findings highlight DEAF1 as a critical link between FOXO and mTORC1 and suggest that targeting the FOXO–DEAF1–mTORC1 axis may offer therapeutic potential to preserve muscle function during aging.",

None of the candidate variants had significant associations or predictive power for behavioral traits as previously reported. However, we found strong associations with aesthetic traits that differentiate breeds, such as height, leg length, and ear shape. Our results suggest that earlier studies using breed-average phenotypes, rather than individually measured phenotypes, were confounded by population structure. Behavior in dogs is polygenic and complex, and thus cannot be accurately predicted using tests that consider only a few genetic variants. Furthermore, behavior in dogs is only moderately heritable, and environmental influences inherently limit the potential accuracy of genomic predictions. Developing meaningful, accurate genetic predictions for complex traits that can improve dog health and welfare will require very large cohorts of individually phenotyped dogs.",

Here, we combine viral genetic tracing with high-resolution whole-brain 3D imaging to generate a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of cerebellar output development in mice. This systematic characterization uniquely distinguishes how excitatory and inhibitory cerebellar projections establish, expand, and refine their connectivity across the brain. Both axon types reach their principal brain targets within a narrow perinatal window, coinciding with the earliest formation of presynaptic terminals, and subsequently undergo postnatal expansion followed by region- and cell type–specific refinement. These findings define critical windows in the assembly of cerebellar output circuits, providing a framework to decipher the principles of cerebellar circuit formation and their impact on brain-wide function. Importantly, they also pinpoint periods of heightened vulnerability, when genetic or environmental perturbations are most likely to derail cerebellar-driven circuit maturation. By establishing this developmental blueprint, our study not only advances fundamental knowledge of brain wiring but also lays the groundwork for translational efforts to connect early cerebellar dysfunction with the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for accurate epidemic forecasting to predict pathogen spread, evolution, and evaluate intervention strategies. Forecast reliability hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across population segments, which may be inferred from contact surveys or mobility data. However, these indirect approaches make it difficult to estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp-up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between geographically defined communities. Our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from others based on how rapidly allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the United States, we uncover networks of intercommunity transmission that reflect geographical relationships while exposing significant long-range interactions. The scaling of importation rate with distance is consistent across both countries, yet weaker than expected based on mobility data, highlighting limitations of indirect inference. We show that transmission patterns can change between waves of variants of concern and analyze how the inferred heterogeneity in intercommunity transmission impacts evolutionary forecasts. While applied here to geographically defined communities, our approach could be applied to those defined by other traits (e.g., age, socioeconomic status), provided time-series data can be stratified accordingly. Overall, our study highlights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.",

          "abstract": "Actin networks in cells are dynamic and constantly turning over as actin subunits exchange between monomer and polymer pools. Understanding these dynamics in vivo requires a detailed understanding of pure actin behavior in vitro. The prevailing model is treadmilling, which predicts continuous growth of filament barbed ends balanced by continuous shrinkage of pointed ends, while filament length remains roughly constant. While treadmilling has been observed directly at the level of single filaments, length fluctuations—expressed as “length diffusivity”—are much greater than expected, and the origin of these high diffusivity values could not be identified experimentally. By imaging single filaments tethered to glass via α-actinin, we observed frequent, low-amplitude barbed-end fluctuations of ±2–6 subunits per event and rarer, high-amplitude fluctuations of ±50–150 subunits per event. Barbed-end fluctuations depended on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and were blocked by phalloidin and barbed-end capping agents. Barbed-end fluctuations consumed an estimated one-third of the ATP at steady state, while two-thirds is still consumed by treadmilling. Fluctuations result in diffusive spreading of filament lengths that exceeds predictions from pure treadmilling yet is lower than previously reported values, suggesting that earlier measurements captured additional sources of variability. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for kinetic models that proposed a dampened form of dynamic instability in pure actin where transient loss of the ATP/ADP•Pi barbed-end cap leads to rare, large excursions superimposed on more frequent, small fluctuations.",

FusB confers resistance to FA by rescuing the translocation factor Elongation Factor-G (EF-G) from FA-stalled ribosome complexes. FusB induces allosteric effects on dynamics in EF-G, causing significant changes in the conformational flexibility of domain III that result in an increase in a minor, more disordered state, overcoming the steric block induced by FA. We show that restraining flexibility in the two central β-strands of EF-G domain III prevents the FusB-induced increase in this minor state population, preventing FusB-mediated release of EF-G from the ribosome and thereby reinstating FA-induced stalling of protein synthesis. We further identify a region controlling access to the minor state population, potentially pinpointing the allosteric mechanism within domain III by which FusB acts. Our findings suggest a possible region that could be targeted for rational design of an inhibitor of FusB-mediated conformational flexibility, reinstating FA sensitivity even in the presence of FusB, which could rejuvenate the efficacy of this clinically important antibiotic.",

Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the dominant natural nitrogen source to the terrestrial biosphere and can alleviate nitrogen limitation but is poorly constrained in Earth system models (ESMs). Here, we compare terrestrial BNF from an ensemble of ESMs of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to a new global synthesis of observations across natural and agricultural biomes. We find that compared to observations, ESMs underestimate agricultural BNF but overestimate natural BNF in the present day by over 50%. Natural BNF is overestimated in the most productive ecosystems that contribute most to the terrestrial carbon sink (forests and grasslands). ESMs with different BNF representations yield a range of BNF responses to CO 2 enrichment. Some ESMs with phenomenological representations of BNF predict a natural BNF increase in response to a doubling of CO 2 that aligns with a meta-analysis of CO 2 enrichment experiments (31% increase) but fail to account for the substantial carbon cost of BNF. In contrast, ESMs with mechanistic representations of BNF account for its carbon cost as well as its regulation by nitrogen limitation but overestimate the BNF response to a doubling of CO 2 (135% increase). Overall, all current BNF representations in ESMs fall short of fully capturing its response to rising atmospheric CO 2 . Finally, we find a positive correlation between modeled present-day natural BNF and the CO 2 fertilization effect across ESMs, suggesting that overestimated natural BNF translates to an exaggerated CO 2 fertilization effect of approximately 11% in ESMs.",

Whether BLTPs are active in this environment and which lipid species are substrates for transport has been unknown. Here, we use synthetic organelles with bilayers (liposomes), monolayers (artificial lipid droplets), or a mixture of the two membrane structures to demonstrate the tight binding of ATG2 specifically to monolayers via its collection of COOH-terminal amphipathic helices. This stable binding enables ATG2 to transfer phospholipids much more effectively. Unexpectedly, the neutral lipid triacylglycerol is also rapidly transported, with kinetics similar to those of phospholipid transport. Lipidomics of purified ATG2A suggests that a similar transfer of both phospholipids and triacylglycerol occurs in cells. Our work implies that BLTPs likely collect on LDs as part of a broad lipid homeostasis program, which will include the movement of both phospholipids and neutral lipids.",

          "abstract": "Large, continental-scale drainage systems occupy nearly half of Earth’s land, shaping diverse ecosystems, with their activity primarily driven by climate and tectonism. Here, we investigate whether Mars, which lacks Earth’s tectonism, has similarly large drainage systems that could have impacted the extent of habitable environments, sediment transport, and the formation of large sedimentary basins. We reconstruct large drainage systems using globally mapped ancient martian water-formed topography—valley networks, outlet canyons, and fluvial depositional systems—revealing large drainage systems (&gt;10 5 km 2 ) similar in scale to those on Earth. However, collectively these systems cover only ~5% of ancient martian terrain (&gt;3.7 Ga), approximately nine times less than their counterparts on Earth. This estimate is conservative due to erosion, burial, and impact cratering, which have likely modified their preservation. Nevertheless, when quantifying the eroded sediment volumes from these large drainage systems, we show that they contributed nearly half (42%) of Mars’ ancient river-sediment budget. We further calculated the sediment eroded from large drainage systems surrounding the largest known fluvial depositional landforms on Mars and found that they potentially contributed ~21% of the planet’s river sediment budget, which we hypothesize facilitated the buildup of these sedimentary features. Our results indicate that although a substantial portion of Mars’ fluvial sediment was routed through large-scale drainage systems, sediment transport was predominantly accomplished within smaller-scale local basins. This drainage structure likely created a mosaic of habitable environments across the surface and facilitated significant sediment accumulation in a limited number of large sedimentary basins.",

In the densely forested regions north of the Alps, material culture was characterized by the use of wood as a primary raw material. Yet, the drivers behind the Roman timber economy and its impact on woodland exploitation and forest dynamics remain poorly understood. To address this, we investigated a unique collection of 20.397 dendrochronologically dated archaeological woods spanning a millennium of European Antiquity (300 BCE–700 CE). Our results reveal significant increases in exploitation during Roman occupation, with regional differences in onset, intensity, and duration. Due to rising civilian and military demand for wood, Roman logging increasingly extended into primary forests far from settlements, which indicates a significantly improved infrastructure, professionalism, and organization of lumbering. The 3rd century CE marks a tipping point, with sharp declines in wood use and long-distance transport, alongside evidence of overexploitation of old-grown forests (trees aged over 200 y). Late Antiquity is characterized by an overall decline in felling activities during the 4th and 5th centuries and a reestablishment of old-grown forests, manifested by increased tree ages thereafter. These findings demonstrate how Roman imperial expansion fundamentally reshaped woodlands north of the Alps and contribute to the environmental and economic history of European Antiquity.",

However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from ultraviolet (UV) absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here, we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals, and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process sensitively depend on the presence of defects in the lattice, such as vacancies and preexisting photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption; we suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.",

As the majority of animals, species with complex life histories may have distinct traits and ecological functions at different stages. Using all 557 Chinese anurans, we tested whether adult-based conservation protects entire taxa by analyzing functional trait diversity across life stages. We compiled adult and tadpole traits, mapped spatial diversity patterns, identified hotspots, recognized conservation priority species based on traits at different stages, and tested whether integrating information from different life history stages can effectively conserve functional diversity. Results showed functional diversity hotspots of adults and tadpoles are different. Species’ functional uniqueness between stages were not correlated, with only 18.8% species overlapped in conservation priority lists. Meanwhile, conservation strategies prioritizing species based on adult traits failed to protect tadpole functional diversity. The extent of functional diversity covered by these species was similar to that of randomly chosen species. These findings reject the hypothesis that conservation strategies made based on information of adults can adequately protect whole taxa. Nevertheless, when information from both stages is integrated, the conservation effectiveness has significantly improved. Thus, comprehensive biodiversity protection requires integrated assessments of all stages.",

Fat-specific Np55 knockout (Np55 FKO ) sensitized mice to high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders, which was attributed to impaired energy expenditure and WAT browning. We identified that mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (Manf) acts as a ligand for Np55 with high binding affinity. Mechanistically, Np55 forms a complex with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and conduct WAT browning after Manf stimulation. Additionally, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2470738600) in Manf compromised the binding affinity to Np55 and thermogenic capacity. Finally, we showed that Np55 is indispensable for Manf-induced thermogenesis and weight loss in obese mice.

Here, we show that targeting Lamin A/C also plays a previously unrecognized role in HCMV-induced rewiring of cytoskeletal connections that control nuclear movement and cell migration at later stages of infection. Specifically, HCMV was found to employ distinct strategies to downregulate Lamin A/C and SUN2, which together regulate linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes that most often connect the nuclear membrane with cytoplasmic actin filaments. Unexpectedly, inhibition of the viral kinase, pUL97, or expression of nonphosphorylatable mutants of Lamin A/C failed to restore SUN2 expression or significant actin filament assembly. Moreover, exogenous reexpression of SUN2 also failed to restore actin filaments. Instead, restoration of SUN2 or Lamin A/C expression impaired the formation of acetylated microtubules in infected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of pUL97, expression of Lamin A/C mutants or depletion of the tubulin acetyl transferase, ATAT1, all impaired HCMV-induced nuclear movement and cell migration. Our findings reveal that HCMV uses multiple strategies to selectively downregulate Lamin A/C and SUN2 in order to prevent these proteins from interfering with the formation of acetylated microtubules that mediate nuclear movement and cell migration, revealing additional roles for Lamin A/C remodeling during infection and insights into how cells control cytoskeletal interactions with the nucleus.",

A central question is whether clustering of bubbles enhances or suppresses their rise velocity compared to isolated single bubbles in quiescent fluid. We address this issue using a recently developed three-dimensional Lagrangian bubble tracking technique, with accurate rise velocity measurements obtained by simultaneously tracking tracer particles around each bubble. For bubbles within swarms, we find that clustered bubbles rise faster than unclustered ones. A conditional analysis based on cluster orientation suggests that this enhancement results from a wake suction effect acting on trailing bubbles. However, even clustered bubbles rise considerably slower than isolated single bubbles due to their exposure to turbulence generated by other bubbles, which randomizes their trajectories and reduces rising efficiency.",

Here, we demonstrate the applicability of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cocultures of primary human lung fibroblasts (LF) and breast cancer cells (BCC) as models of tumor–stromal interactions in lung metastatic breast cancer. Using these models, we find that BCC lines representing clinically relevant molecular subtypes differentially induce CAF-like phenotypes in primary LFs corresponding with their propensity for lung metastasis. Furthermore, we identify a mechanism by which juxtacrine signaling from LFs to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells promotes expansion of prognostic dormant-like cell subpopulations and instigates autophagy-dependent therapy resistance via integrin and Janus kinase1/2 signaling. A high content kinase inhibitor compound library screen using this model identifies vacuolar protein sorting 34 as a therapeutic vulnerability unique to BCC-LF interaction whose inhibition can resensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy and relieve LF-mediated extrinsic therapy resistance. Therefore, we propose coculture of primary human LFs and BCC as a reductionist model of interactions between tumor cells and lung-resident stroma and a tool for therapeutic and mechanistic discovery in lung metastatic breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) is a key systemic regulator of longitudinal bone growth and is widely used in pediatric endocrinology, including in patients without GH deficiency. Its primary target is the growth plate—a cartilaginous structure driving bone elongation—yet the cellular mechanisms underlying GH action remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a direct role for GH in regulating a recently defined population of cartilaginous stem cells within the growth plate. Using multiple transgenic mouse models, we show that GH reduces the pool of slow-cycling, label-retaining stem cells by promoting their differentiation into transient progenitors. Clonal and lineage-tracing analyses reveal that these stem cells renew via population asymmetry and that GH promotes their committed cell division, leading to stem cell depletion. Conversely, genetic deletion of the GH receptor in stem cells impairs their ability to generate chondrocytes, confirming a direct GH effect. These findings support a general principle by which endocrine cues regulate tissue regeneration, establish a mechanistic link between GH signaling and cartilaginous stem cells, and provide a potential explanation for certain related clinical observations, such as the declining long-term efficacy of GH therapy.",

          "abstract": "Aerosol–cloud interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic forcing of the climate; a significant contribution to this is due to the aerosol effect on the development of cloud fraction and liquid water path in stratocumulus clouds. Stratocumulus are strongly modulated by the diurnal cycle, but many previous observational studies have primarily focused on the daytime behavior of these clouds. In this work, a Lagrangian framework is used to characterize the day-night variation in the cloud sensitivity to aerosol. It is shown that the cloud fraction response to aerosol is driven by nighttime processes, whereas aerosols play a lesser role in daytime cloud fraction breakup. The liquid water path response reveals that aerosols act to thin the cloud during the daytime; however, this effect is partially offset by other processes during the nighttime. These nighttime cloud processes play an important role in setting the cloud state at the start of the day and hence the daytime cloud evolution, during which stratocumulus clouds have the greatest radiative impact. Our findings are consistent with an aerosol induced suppression of precipitation that acts most effectively at night, when stratocumulus precipitation is strongest. These results highlight a requirement for nighttime observations of marine clouds and an improved representation of the diurnal cycle in model-observation comparisons, especially when assessing climate forcing and the viability of marine cloud brightening.",

          "abstract": "Most biological populations are rich in diversity, and negative frequency-dependent (NFD) selection is a well-known mechanism thought to underlie this stable coexistence of multiple variants. Recent studies confirm its widespread presence at local spatial scales, however it remains unclear whether these local-scale dynamics are sufficient to maintain diversity across larger, landscape-level scales. While prior theoretical work has found that local NFD selection can indeed promote global coexistence, these studies only analyzed contiguous landscapes. In contrast, many ecosystems are not contiguous, but rather spatially fragmented or exhibit spatial variation in the local carrying capacity. Using a population-genetic model based on the classic island framework, we show that, in fragmented populations, NFD selection can paradoxically reduce coexistence and shorten fixation times, relative to neutrality. Fragmentation also generates a nonmonotonic relationship between fixation time and population size, with diversity minimized at intermediate scales, contrasting with the classical species–area relationship. Extending the model to a multispecies context reveals that these effects also shape species-level diversity. This allows us to develop a test for the influence of NFD selection in fragmented systems, based on the predicted nonmonotonic species–area relationship. Applying this test to an avian diversity dataset from the Ryukyu Islands, we find a signature suggesting that NFD selection and habitat fragmentation may interact to suppress biodiversity in this system. Together, our findings suggest that fragmentation can undermine the stabilizing effects of NFD selection, calling into question its generality as a mechanism for maintaining biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes.",

          "abstract": "While multiple chromatin-based epigenetic pathways are well characterized, their genome-wide coordination and hierarchical interplay remain poorly understood. We previously identified the BAH–PHD–CPL2 complex, where AIPP3 binds H3K27me3 via its BAH domain and, in concert with PHD2 and PHD3 (PHD2/3), recruits CPL2 to repress transcription by dephosphorylating RNA Polymerase II. Here, we show that CPL2 and PHD2/3 form a distinct module (CPL2–PHD2/3) that safeguards CHH DNA methylation and silences CHH-methylated sites at transposable elements (TEs) through engagement of multiple DNA methylation pathways. The CPL2–PHD2/3 module physically associates with SUVH4 and SUVH5 (SUVH4/5) to preserve SUVH4/5–CMT2-mediated CHH methylation at a subset of H3K9me2-marked regions. Chromatin enrichment of PHD3 likewise enables the module to sustain RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated CHH DNA methylation at sites bearing H3K9me2, H3K27me3, or neither. Thus, CPL2–PHD2/3 emerges as a previously underappreciated, multifunctional regulator of plant DNA methylation networks. Unexpectedly, its gene repression function is uncoupled from DNA methylation. CPL2–PHD2/3 represses Polycomb-marked genes by interacting with LHP1 or recognizing hypomethylated H3K4. While it cooperates with LHP1 at a subset of targets, it also independently silences many more genes that LHP1 alone cannot repress, both sets of genes being critical for proper development. This dual, yet largely LHP1-insufficient, repression mode singles out CPL2–PHD2/3 as the essential executor of Polycomb silencing. Together, our findings establish CPL2–PHD2/3 as a chromatin-responsive integrator that spans DNA methylation and Polycomb-associated repression, providing a unifying mechanism for epigenetic control of both TEs and genes across diverse chromatin landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Protein misfolding plays a central role in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), often driven by specific aggregation-prone segments such as A β 17–23 and A β 37–42 of amyloid- β 42 (A β 42), α -Syn 66–74 and α -Syn 71–82 of α -synuclein ( α -syn), hIAPP 22–27 of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), and TTR 105–115 of transthyretin (TTR). Capturing the atomic-level structural features of these transient and dynamically fluctuating regions remains challenging. Two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy provides rich vibrational fingerprints that are highly sensitive to protein conformational dynamics, but extracting atomic-resolution structural information from these complex signals is nontrivial. In this study, we present a machine learning framework that integrates 2DIR spectra with deep structural modeling to reconstruct the three-dimensional atomic structures of monomeric intrinsically disordered aggregation-prone segments of amyloidogenic proteins. Using this model, we were able to predict the conformational ensembles of aggregation-prone segments from amyloid- β 42, α -synuclein, human islet amyloid polypeptide, and transthyretin, as well as the structural evolution of A β 42 bound to a small-molecule inhibitor, directly from computationally derived 2DIR spectra. An attention module highlights the most informative spectral features associated with local structural variations, providing interpretable links between spectra and structure. This generalizable strategy paves the way for interpreting time-resolved spectroscopic studies and offers a promising computational framework for probing misfolding-related structural dynamics and therapeutic mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Multipotent progenitors (MPP) are the quantitative source of native hematopoiesis that have been thought to be replenished slowly by hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, recent fate mapping studies have revealed two developmentally distinct populations of MPP, HSC-derived MPP (hMPP), and HSC-independent, embryonic MPP (eMPP). These data raise fundamental questions on the distinctions and functions of these progenitors. Here, we mapped the clonal dynamics of the two independent MPP systems, using in situ barcoding, and barcode linkage (hMPP), or disconnect (eMPP), with HSC. The cumulative output of eMPP to hematopoiesis was 35%, and their output was enriched for lymphoid fates. Conversely, hMPP output was enriched for myeloid-restricted fates. Distinguishing HSC from eMPP outputs revealed that only ~15% of adult HSC clones underwent multilineage differentiation (lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid). To prospectively identify eMPP, we developed PolySMART for joint profiling of PolyloxExpress RNA barcodes, surface markers, and transcriptomes, and we found that the plasma cell marker CD138 enriches for eMPP. CD138 + MPP are primed for self-renewal and toward lymphoid fate, and become largely but not completely replaced by CD138 − MPP over time, which may contribute to the loss of lymphoid output with age. Taken together, adult hematopoiesis consists of two distinct lineage trees. The source of the “eMPP tree” substantially contributes to hematopoiesis before it declines, while the HSC-hMPP tree supplies hematopoiesis life-long. Our molecular determinants distinguishing the two MPP systems may open avenues to further explore these unexpected layers of hematopoiesis.",

In this work, we propose that magnons with intrinsic OAM can be induced by antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions with multiple topological charges ( Q ). The proposal is demonstrated in a tetragonal lattice frustrated AFM film, where magnetic anisotropy governs the formation of multiple- Q skyrmions. Out-of-plane polarized current induces ultrafast skyrmion helicity oscillation, which enables excitation of multipolar spin waves, with OAM quantum number identical to Q . The Q , and thus OAM, can be modulated by tuning magnetic anisotropy and temperature. In addition, we reveal an unexpected AFM skyrmion Hall effect driven by in-plane polarized current, and a nonlinear correction term in skyrmion dynamics induced by spin–orbit torque fluctuation. Our results reveal unique behaviors of AFM multiple- Q skyrmions and could extend their applications in information encoding and transmission.",

Lack of historical genomes, however, has made it difficult to disentangle the timing and drivers of these declines given complex and breed-specific demographic histories, artificial selection, and crossbreeding. Here, we sequenced genomes of nine 20th-century museum specimens (1906–1993) of pedigree German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) to directly assess the consequences of contemporary breeding practices on genomic diversity and health over time. The GSD breed offers an excellent case study, given the breed’s fluctuations in global popularity, differing selective regimes, and the GSD’s use in the establishment of other breeds, including wolfdogs. Genome-wide heterozygosity showed significant reductions after the Second World War (WWII), coincident with an increase in both the frequency of runs of homozygosity and load. We also detected repeated population bottlenecks linked to the use of popular sires throughout the 20th century. Finally, although hybridization with wolves has led to genome-wide increases in heterozygosity in wolfdog breeds derived from the GSD, nonadmixed ancestry blocks (dog or wolf) were severely depleted in diversity due to the limited number of founders involved in their establishment. Combined, our results indicate that declines in the genomic health of GSDs and related breeds occurred not at the onset of breed formation but throughout the last century, as a result of population bottlenecks associated with WWII and the repeated use of popular sires.",

The majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, with over 50% presenting with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown promise in targeting PC, its clinical efficacy remains limited due to several critical challenges. These include tumor antigen heterogeneity, antigen loss or escape mechanisms, functional exhaustion of CAR-T cells within the tumor microenvironment, as well as inherent limitations of autologous approaches such as high manufacturing costs, prolonged production timelines, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we developed allogeneic IL-15–enhanced, mesothelin-specific CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T ( Allo15 MCAR-NKT) cells through gene engineering of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using a clinically guided culture method. These Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells exhibited robust and multifaceted antitumor activity against PC, driven by both CAR and NK receptor–mediated cytotoxic mechanisms. In orthotopic and metastatic human PC xenograft models, Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells demonstrated superior tumor control, enhanced trafficking and infiltration into tumor sites, sustained effector and cytotoxic phenotypes, and reduced expression of exhaustion markers. Importantly, Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells demonstrated a favorable safety profile, characterized by the absence of graft-versus-host disease and minimal cytokine release syndrome. Collectively, these findings validate Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells as a promising next-generation, off-the-shelf immunotherapeutic approach for PC, with the potential to overcome critical challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance, especially in the context of metastatic disease.",

Two kinesin-2 motors—kinesin-II and OSM-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans —cooperate to transport cargo along cilia, with kinesin-II operating in the middle segment and OSM-3 taking over distally. However, how kinesin-II is spatially confined to prevent its invasion into distal regions remains unclear. Here, we identify Joubert syndrome 26 protein (JBTS-26) as a critical regulator of this motor handover. JBTS-26 localizes to axonemal doublet microtubules in the ciliary middle segment, where it competes with kinesin-II for binding to the IFT-B subunit OSM-5/IFT88. This competition displaces kinesin-II from IFT particles, enabling OSM-3 to assume distal transport. Loss of JBTS-26 allows kinesin-II to invade the distal cilium and slows down IFT. Conversely, JBTS-26 overexpression accelerates IFT by prematurely releasing kinesin-II. Our findings reveal a mechanism for compartmentalized motor regulation and link defective motor handover to ciliopathy pathogenesis.",

However, how to effectively use such extensive information to improve the mapping and prediction of complex traits, including those that respond to climate change, remains unresolved. Here, we apply a Bayesian framework to estimate a Functional-And-Evolutionary Multi-trait Importance (FAEMI) score that combines extensive functional annotations to predict the probability that a variable genomic site causes variation in 16 complex traits of 103 K cattle. The functional annotations include information from the transcriptome, epigenome, and metabolome of cattle as well as genome constraints across species from multiple genome annotation consortia, covering 2.13 million molecular phenotypes from 24 tissues/cell types of 8,446 cattle worldwide. FAEMI analyses quantify the phenotypic importance of functional assays to guide future annotation efforts and reveal significant correlations between molecular functionality and genotype-to-phenotype associations. In new data of 45 K cattle with heat tolerance phenotypes, the FAEMI score demonstrates significant advantages in improving genomic prediction and mapping. The FAEMI score improved genomic prediction accuracy of multiple heat tolerance phenotypes by ~11%. A cellular stress-related locus, stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member 2 ( SERP2 ), was identified as underlying heat tolerance, with the lead variant (rs383130643) associated with enhancer activity. Additionally, high FAEMI-ranking variants are significantly enriched in variants affecting beef cattle traits.

Realizing this potential, particularly for submegadalton complexes, is facilitated by fiducial-based labeling. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as powerful electron-dense labels for cryo-ET, but multiplexing using only conventional monomeric AuNPs is challenging, limiting their application in multitarget studies. Here, we describe functionalized dimeric AuNPs with a precisely defined size range applied to bioimaging, enabling multiplexed labeling by allowing reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs, thereby supporting identification of distinct molecular targets within the same cryotomogram. Each dimer consists of two covalently linked gold particles of approximately 2.6 nm diameter separated by a defined spacing of about 1.4 nm, with high structural homogeneity validated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy. The anti-GluN1 Fab, which targets the N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was site specifically conjugated to a dimeric AuNP. A deep learning classifier enabled reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs in tomograms. We confirmed that the dimeric AuNP–Fab conjugates bind robustly to recombinant GluN1/GluN2A receptors, validating their use for structural labeling. In situ cryo-ET of brain tissue further confirms that the dimeric labels reach NMDARs within the glutamatergic synaptic cleft. Combined with monomeric AuNPs, this dimeric AuNP platform establishes a generalizable approach for distinguishable labels optimized for cryo-ET. The compact size and structural uniformity of monomeric and dimeric AuNPs make them ideally suited for nanoscale molecular mapping in crowded cellular environments.",

          "abstract": "Liver abscesses caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) can lead to severe metastatic complications, with mortality rates ranging from 5 to 40%. Even in the absence of antibiotic resistance, hvKp liver abscesses often respond poorly to treatment, sometimes requiring surgical resection. The reason for these poor outcomes remains unknown. Here, we established an hvKp wound model in outbred immunocompetent mice, which progresses to systemic infection and hepatic abscesses that were intractable to antibiotic therapy. Using a combination of quantitative and infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry, we found that antibiotics fail to kill K. pneumoniae in liver abscesses, independently of resistance or spatial distribution of antibiotics. Our results show that antibiotic concentrations detected in the liver are sufficient to eradicate hvKp under standard in vitro conditions, but the continued presence of viable bacteria in vivo indicates that hvKp adopts an antibiotic-tolerant state within the liver. Notably, the inadequate antibiotic efficacy observed in our mouse studies mirrors clinical outcomes. These findings underscore the urgent need to elucidate the mechanism underlying hvKp tolerance, which could inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

Metamaterials usually achieve such superior functionality through hard-coded geometry, symmetry, and periodicity that cannot be altered postfabrication. While a great deal of research is dedicated to tunable metamaterials, the ability to tune metamaterials on-the-fly in a scalable manner remains an open challenge. Here, we introduce a real-time programmable, combinatorial metamaterial framework composed of asymmetric pillars that can manipulate acoustic waves based on the pillars’ angular orientation. First, we demonstrate the utility of our metamaterials with all pillars oriented in the same direction, exhibiting wave attenuation, localization, and topological insulation. Subsequently, we expand the unit-cells into multiple domains and supercells where the number of possible designs enlarges to exceed 10 100 . Our metamaterials offer real-time programmability at both the unit-cell level using individual motors for high versatility, and at a functional domain level using gears for simplicity. We also present a hybrid approach combining motors and gears in clusters providing a balance between versatility and simplicity. We expect our scalable, combinatorial approach with on-demand reprogrammability of acoustic properties to facilitate the development of advanced forms of acoustic devices.",

Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we find a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS 2 . The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21 to 46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron–phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order.",

In paired dorsal-anterior-lateral neurons—critical for aversive olfactory memory—Rrp1 knockdown impairs memory formation, whereas its overexpression enhances retention. Pharmacological inhibition of Rrp1 redox activity with E3330 suppresses Period and CaMKII expression, disrupting LTM formation. Notably, human APE1 redox activity rescues memory deficits in Rrp1-deficient flies, promotes de novo Period synthesis, and facilitates LTM formation. Moreover, Rrp1 is required for CREBA-mediated LTM acceleration, revealing a redox-dependent link between transcriptional regulation and memory persistence. These findings establish Rrp1 as a critical modulator of LTM in Drosophila and highlight redox regulation as a conserved mechanism underlying memory formation.",

Results from the aggregate were consistent with previous work that detected the five canonical nucleobases and 14 of the 20 α-amino acids utilized by life to synthesize proteins. However, our analytical approach tentatively uncovered trace signals of a fifteenth α-amino acid, tryptophan, which has not been detected previously in extraterrestrial materials. Further, we found that the distributions of insoluble and soluble-derived organics differ between distinct stones, suggesting heterogeneous geologic processing within Bennu’s parent body. The distributions of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons resemble those in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites and are consistent with an abiotic origin through aqueous reactions. Our findings expand the evidence that prebiotic organic molecules can form within primitive accreting planetary bodies and could have been delivered via impacts to the early Earth and other Solar System bodies, potentially contributing to the origins of life.",

This is because somatic tissues experience different mutagenic processes than germline tissues. Here, we use nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) to identify somatic mutations in Arabidopsis shoots with high sensitivity. We report a somatic mutation rate of 3.6 × 10 −8 mutations/bp, ~2 to 7× measured germline mutation rates. Somatic mutations displayed elevated signatures consistent with oxidative damage, UV damage, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Both somatic and germline mutations were enriched in transposable elements and depleted in genes, but this depletion was greater in germline mutations. Somatic mutation rate correlated with proximity to the centromere, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene/TE content, properties which were also largely true of germline mutations. We note that DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility have different predicted effects on mutation rate for genic and nongenic regions; DNA methylation associates with a greater increase in mutation rate when in nongenic regions, and accessible chromatin associates with a lower mutation rate in nongenic regions but a higher mutation rate in genic regions. Together, these results characterize key differences and similarities in the genomic distribution of somatic and germline mutations.",

          "abstract": "Cooperative regulation of biomolecular function is critical for the ability of all organisms to respond effectively to environmental changes. Such regulation is often manifested in a sigmoidal dependence of enzyme activity on ligand concentration. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie such sigmoidal behavior, but they are usually assumed to occur independently of one another. We hypothesized that coexistence of allosteric mechanisms can lead to complex kinetic behavior and higher or lower cooperativity than expected. A mathematical framework that analyses sigmoidal behavior as a function of two cooccurring mechanisms, hysteresis and homotropic binding cooperativity, was developed. The model shows, for example, that i) the observed cooperativity, as measured by the Hill coefficient, can decrease with increasing binding cooperativity, and that ii) unusually high values of the Hill coefficient can be observed. Our mathematical analysis is shown to be relevant for a mutant of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase with an unusually high value of a Hill coefficient for a dimer of about 1.9, in which hysteresis and binding cooperativity coexist. More generally, our findings imply that the repertoire of allosteric regulation is richer than anticipated and suggest that ultrasensitive control in natural or designed systems may arise even in low-order oligomers.",

          "abstract": "The marine biological carbon pump is driven by sinking particulate organic matter (POM). Sinking speed and remineralization rate determine flux attenuation in the mesopelagic. Since the fate of all marine organic matter is either complete remineralization or transformation to more stable products, diagenetic modifications impact carbon dioxide sequestration time from the atmosphere. To investigate particle transformation at the molecular level, we characterize the water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) fraction of sinking particles from dominant biogeochemical environments using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. We find distinct, inverse associations in molecular-level nitrogen content and degree of transformation (i.e., “stability”) of organic matter across a productivity gradient from coastal upwelling to oligotrophic conditions. Nitrogen enrichment and low stability were observed at the coastal upwelling site and persisted to depths &gt;400 m. Further, carbon flux is strongly correlated with the relative abundance of stable WEOM (“Island of Stability” molecular formulae) across productivity regimes and depth. This suggests emergent patterns in epi- and mesopelagic diagenesis, highlighting that the molecular composition of sinking organic matter exiting the euphotic zone varies more across regions than as a function of depth. This is attributed to highly variable sinking rates and the microbial diagenetic histories within the euphotic zone. The stability–flux relationship is considered a “diagenetic clock” relative to organic matter formation where the relative abundance of Island of Stability molecular formulae describes the degree of departure from the organic matter molecular-level composition at formation. This ubiquitous trajectory of the diagenetic clock further underpins a global ocean molecular signature of sinking POM.",

Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant t ̂ when the order parameter catches up with the posttransition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well, we analyze the Landau–Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry-breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.",

Despite ongoing efforts including the analysis of ancient dog and wolf genomes, many questions remain regarding the evolutionary processes that led to the diversity of breeds today. Although ancient genome sequences provide valuable information about these processes, their utility is hindered by low depths of coverage and postmortem damage, which inhibits confident genotype calling. In the present study, we assess how genotype imputation of ancient dog and wolf genomes, using a large reference panel, can increase the amount of information provided by ancient datasets. We evaluated imputation accuracy by down-sampling high-coverage dog and wolf genomes to 0.05 to 2× coverage and compared concordance between imputed and high-coverage genotypes. We measured the impact of imputation on principal component analyses and runs of homozygosity (ROH). Our findings show high (R 2 &gt; 0.9) imputation accuracy for dogs with coverage as low as 0.5× and for wolves as low as 1.0×. We then imputed a dataset of 90 ancient dog and wolf genomes to assess changes in inbreeding during the last 10,000 y of dog evolution. Ancient dog and wolf populations generally exhibit lower inbreeding levels than present-day individuals. Regions with low ROH density maintained across ancient and present-day dogs were significantly associated with genes related to immunity and chemosensory receptors. Our study indicates that imputing ancient canine genomes is a viable strategy that allows for the use of analytical methods previously limited to high-quality genetic data.",

We examined the effect of prenatal exposure to the Great Chinese Famine on risks for 11 notifiable infectious diseases in two consecutive generations through the analysis of &gt;4.4 million surveillance records in Sichuan Province, China. Using an approach combining cohort models with counterfactual effect imputation, we estimated the ratio of observed to expected incidence rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) in the absence of famine among both the directly affected birth cohort (F1) and their possible offspring (F2). We further examined whether there was a dose–response relationship between famine severity and infectious disease outcomes using meta-regression at the prefecture level. We found that the risk of acquiring any of the 11 infectious diseases studied increased significantly among both the F1 (IRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.21) and the F2 cohort (IRR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.15). IRRs for the F1 generation were higher in prefectures that experienced more severe famine, with one interquartile range increase in famine severity associated with a 3.95% (95% CI: 1.87 to 6.05%) increase in F1 IRR. Positive associations of varying magnitudes were estimated between increased risks in the F1 cohort and famine intensity for most individual diseases. Prenatal exposure to famine may have long-term and potential intergenerational impacts on the risk of a broad range of infectious diseases. Ensuring adequate prenatal nutrition may be crucial in reducing the burden of infectious diseases across generations.",

In plants, light not only initiates photomorphogenesis but also reshapes higher-order chromatin architecture. However, the limited resolution of current techniques impedes investigation of chromatin dynamics at the single-molecule level. Here, we applied Fiber-seq, a long-read, single-molecule chromatin profiling method, to construct near-nucleotide resolution maps of chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning, and cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. We observed that light exposure during photomorphogenesis led to significant, locus-specific changes in chromatin accessibility—both increases and decreases—especially in genes related to photosynthesis, hormone signaling, and development. Analysis of chromatin accessibility changes in cop1-6 , pifq , and hy5 hyh mutants revealed that classical light signaling pathways regulate chromatin accessibility. Additionally, using high-fidelity long-read sequencing, we profiled DNA methylation in previously inaccessible repetitive regions such as 5S rRNA gene clusters and CEN180 satellite repeats. These heterochromatic loci exhibited distinct light-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility that were undetectable using prior methods. In maize, we demonstrated that Fiber-seq identifies a broader range of biologically relevant open chromatin regions, enabling both high-accuracy de novo genome assembly and the detection of fine-scale structural variants. Collectively, Fiber-seq offers an integrated view of chromatin states across regulatory and repetitive elements, providing critical insights into how environmental signals reshape plant epigenomes.",

          "abstract": "The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana consists of 10 chromosomes. By inducing CRISPR-Cas–mediated breaks at subcentromeric and subtelomeric sequences, we fused entire chromosome arms, obtaining two eight-chromosome lines. In one line, both arms of chromosome 3 were fused to chromosome 1. In another line, the arms were transferred to chromosomes 1 and 5. Both chromosome number–reduced lines were fertile. Phenotypic and transcriptional analyses revealed no differences compared with wild-type plants. After crossing with the wild type, the progeny showed reduced fertility. The meiotic recombination patterns of the transferred chromosome arms were substantially changed. Directed chromosome number changes in plants may enable new breeding strategies, redefining linkage groups and establishing genetic barriers. Moreover, our data indicate that plants are highly robust to engineered karyotype changes.",

Earth and the Moon have indistinguishable mass-independent iron isotopic compositions; both define one end of the range measured in meteorites. Combining our results with those for other elements, we performed mass balance calculations for Theia and proto-Earth. We found that all of Theia and most of Earth’s other constituent materials originated from the inner Solar System.

Gas adsorption and structural, spectroscopic, and computational analyses support a mechanism in which binding of one CO molecule triggers a spin transition, followed by binding of a second CO molecule and migratory insertion of the first CO molecule into the cobalt–methyl bond to form an acetyl.

This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids. In contrast to monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, the archaeal Pyl code occurs sporadically, indicating that it arose independently in multiple lineages. We discovered that more than 1800 archaeal proteins contain Pyl, increasing the number of such proteins by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, five Pyl transfer RNA (tRNA) pyrrolysyl–tRNA synthetase pairs from Pyl-code archaea were used to introduce Pyl analogs into proteins in Escherichia coli .",

In tissue samples from individuals with UC, we found that macrophages were depleted from areas of the colon that did not yet exhibit overt epithelial inflammation. We hypothesized that toxins produced by bacteria could impair macrophages and that this could promote wider inflammation. We isolated a variant of Aeromonas genus from stool samples from UC patients, which we termed macrophage-toxic bacteria (MTB), because aerolysin secreted by MTB caused macrophage death. MTB colonized mice under pathogenic conditions and triggered colitis. Antibodies against aerolysin alleviated colitis induced by Aeromonas in mice.

In this work, we use this approach to realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model. Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively bound pairs and “hard rods.” By contrast, operating near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions.

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that face selective pressures from their hosts but also compete within the host cell for replication resources. While theory indicates that within-cell selection matters for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of these dynamics has remained elusive. Here, we measure within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterize their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time due to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends non-trivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

Here, we show that spontaneous calcium waves arise among non-neuronal support cells in the developing Drosophila eye to drive retinal morphogenesis. These waves are initiated by Cad96Ca receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, triggering phospholipase C–γ–mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A cell type–specific “innexin code” coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger myosin II–driven apical contraction at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing that is critical for precise optical architecture. Our findings reveal how synchronized calcium signaling among non-neuronal cells orchestrates tissue patterning in the developing nervous system.",

Pkdcc is an essential gene in the nervous system, and VLK is enriched at synapses and released from neurons in an activity- and soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE)–dependent manner to drive extracellular interactions.

We show that the cause of unrest was magmatic dike propagation, which we imaged with ~25,000 relocated earthquakes occurring over 2 months. The dike propagated horizontally ~30 kilometers as multiscale rebounding waves of dike opening, magma pressure, and breaking of barriers while triggering intense surrounding seismicity.

          "abstract": "Forager societies in southwest Texas and northern Mexico painted polychromatic Pecos River style murals in limestone rock shelters containing well-preserved archaeological assemblages. To establish the temporal context of the murals, we obtained 57 direct radiocarbon dates and 25 indirect oxalate dates for pictographs across 12 sites using plasma oxidation and accelerator mass spectrometry. Bayesian modeling estimates that Pecos River style began between 5760 and 5385 calibrated years before the present (cal B.P.) and probably ended in 1370 to 1035 cal B.P. Painting spanned a duration of 4095 to 4780 years (68.3%). Stratigraphic and iconographic analyses revealed that eight of the murals were created as compositions adhering to a set of rules and an established iconographic vocabulary. Results suggest consistent messaging throughout a period marked by changes in material culture, land use, and climate. We propose that Pecos River style paintings, embedded in a cultural keystone landscape, faithfully transmitted a sophisticated metaphysics that later informed the beliefs and symbolic expression of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.",

This study aimed to identify maternal metabolomic signatures associated with prenatal heat exposure and PTB. We conducted a prospective analysis of 215 participants in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort (2014 to 2020). Serum samples collected during early and late pregnancy underwent untargeted metabolomic profiling. Daily maximum ambient temperature was estimated at geocoded residential addresses and averaged over three exposure windows: conception to early pregnancy, early to late pregnancy, and conception to late pregnancy. Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for each exposure window and PTB, followed by a meet-in-the-middle analysis. We identified 23 metabolic pathways and four overlapping metabolites, including methionine, proline, citrulline, and pipecolate, associated with both temperature exposure and PTB. These metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress regulation. Findings highlight the potential of metabolomics to detect early biological alterations linked to environmental risk and adverse birth outcomes.",

We analyzed mortality data from 11 Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems across sub-Saharan Africa (2005 to 2015) to examine temporal changes in heat-related mortality risk. Contrary to global trends, our findings suggest that heat vulnerability is increasing across African populations. Nighttime heatwave mortality risk increased significantly between 2005 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015 [OR from 1.02 (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.13) to 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.23)], while daytime heatwaves showed no significant impact. Compound heatwaves transformed from nonsignificant to significant risk factors [OR = 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.22)]. Males showed increased risks across all heatwave types, females only for nighttime and compound heat. Children under 5 showed universal risk increases, while the elderly showed the highest increases for nighttime and compound heat. These findings suggest that physiological adaptation alone is insufficient to cope with increasingly frequent heatwaves without adequate socioeconomic resources. Heightened nighttime vulnerability underscores the need for context-specific adaptations reflecting Africa’s distinct conditions.",

          "abstract": "Risky behavior disproportionately contributes to death in the working-age (i.e., 15 to 64 years old) population. Men exhibit riskier behavior than do women. As a result, working-age men die more frequently than do working-age women. Despite these circumstances, surprisingly little research has attempted to estimate the gender-specific efficacy of societal restraint of risky behavior. This study provides such estimations by exploiting differences among the Nordic countries in the dose of forced restraint adopted to reduce mortality in the pre-vaccine COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that relatively great restraint reduced the likelihood of death among working-age men but not among working-age women. The findings suggest that debate over the wisdom of forced restraint of behavior as a strategy to reduce deaths should reflect the likely divergent effects of such interventions on working-age men and women.",

A fundamental challenge is that, because two people may differ in many ways, factors besides race might explain differences in treatment. Here, we propose a test for bias that circumvents the difficulty of comparing two people by instead assessing whether the same person is treated differently when their race is perceived differently. We apply our method to test for bias in police traffic stops, finding that the same driver is likelier to be searched or arrested by police when they are perceived as Hispanic than when they are perceived as white. Our test is broadly applicable to other datasets where race, gender, or other identity data are perceived rather than self-reported, and the same person is observed multiple times.",

We use data from the nationally representative (United States) High School and Beyond cohort, characterize fluoride exposure from drinking water across adolescence, adjust for confounders, and observe cognitive test performance in both secondary school and at age ~60. We find that children exposed to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water exhibit modestly better cognition in secondary school, an advantage that is smaller and no longer statistically significant at age ~60.",

These metals are currently sourced from declining terrestrial reserves, making deep-sea polymetallic nodules a promising alternative. However, current metal extraction methods are lengthy and energy and carbon intensive, emitting 45, 28, and 4 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of nickel, cobalt, and copper, respectively. We present a fossil-free hydrogen plasma–based reduction process, powered by green hydrogen and renewable energy, which condenses calcination, smelting, reduction, and refining into a single-step metal extraction, reducing direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 90% and improving energy efficiency by up to 18%. In addition, we demonstrate selective copper recovery via a heat treatment requiring no acids or reducing agents, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective pathway for critical metal extraction from polymetallic nodules.",

          "abstract": "Nonconventional epitaxial techniques, such as van der Waals epitaxy and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their capability to repeatedly produce high-quality freestanding films from a single mother wafer. Successful implementation of these techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform two-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However, the extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically above 1500°C) causes step bunching, forming nonuniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at low temperatures by metal-assisted graphitization. In contrast to previous reports, we found annealing conditions enabling SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, producing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the pristine surface morphology of the substrate. We successfully produce high-quality freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN and GaN) membranes on graphene/SiC via the 2D material–based layer transfer technique.",

The printed DLCE actuators exhibit reversible multidimensional shape morphing (e.g., bending, twisting, and complex curved surfaces) under electric fields, governed by regional stiffness gradients. An inverse design algorithm is also developed to convert target 3D surfaces into executable printing tasks. Submillimeter-scale fidelity in reconstructing complex geometries, such as a panda face, a biomimetic plant and the Yellow River’s landform, demonstrates capabilities applicable to soft robotics and adaptive systems.",

A promising candidate, UA2239, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with a guanine as nucleobase, demonstrates rapid and irreversible inhibitory effects on Plasmodium parasites. It blocks the active exit process, named egress, of merozoites and gametes from infected erythrocytes. UA2239 disrupts the essential cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)–dependent egress pathway by decreasing cGMP levels in the parasite, strongly suggesting Plasmodium falciparum guanylyl cyclase α as its primary target. We also uncovered remarkable molecular mechanisms of resistance developed by parasites after prolonged exposure to the drug, which involve mutating not the target itself, but downstream effectors. The unique mechanism of action of UA2239 makes it a valuable first-in-class candidate for further development. Its ability to inhibit both parasite growth and transmission highlights its therapeutic potential as a dual-stage antimalarial agent.",

The addition of chlorotrimethylsilane facilitated the in situ formation of an N -trimethylsilyl pyridinium salt, increasing the electron deficiency of the pyridine core and enabling it to preferentially undergo single-electron reduction over alkyl bromides, thereby enhancing both yield and regioselectivity. Furthermore, the C4-alkylated pyridines can undergo subsequent electroreductive C2 alkylation, allowing for the sequential installation of distinct alkyl groups, thereby providing a versatile approach to accessing structurally diverse di- and trifunctionalized pyridines.",

VHS 1256B, the most variable known planet-mass object, exhibits a near-infrared flux change of nearly 40%, with red color and silicate features revealed in recent JWST spectra, challenging current theories. Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B’s atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of dusty substellar atmospheres.",

However, current interventions such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation remain limited by insufficient safety and efficacy. To address this, we engineered commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) using miRNA-loaded biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance its proliferation and indole-3-carboxaldehyde production. By functionalizing bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) derived from LGG with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), we developed BEV-LNPs that exhibited enhanced targeting efficiency toward LGG compared to Escherichia coli . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that BEV-LNPs showed superior stability in simulated physiological fluids and gastrointestinal environments compared to conventional LNPs. When combined with 5-aminosalicylic acid, the BEV-LNP formulation notably improved outcomes in acute and chronic colitis models, reducing inflammation, restoring epithelial barrier integrity, and promoting microbial balance.

These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as ultraviolet irradiation, generate lower polarization and require cryogenic transport. We present ultrahigh–dose rate electron irradiation as an alternative for generating nonpersistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarization (17%) to trityl radicals used clinically (19%) through a previously unknown mechanism we believe to involve partial ordering and electron-electron interactions.

Their changeable nature poses a challenge for reliable signaling, because for signals to be reliable, they should be consistent. Glossy visual effects defy that principle, because the bright, directional pulse of light that dominates their appearance is highly variable across space and time. Here, we investigate how dynamic light reflections influence signal efficacy using bumblebees as a model of insect vision and plant-pollinator interactions. We show that glossy floral signals occur across Angiosperm lineages. Through behavioral experiments with artificial stimuli that mimic the spectral and spatial reflectance properties of glossy and matte floral surfaces, we demonstrate that glossiness enhances long-range detectability but compromises fine-scale color discrimination at close range. Glossiness thus poses an optical property by which organisms can attune their visual appearance independent of pigmentary properties, representing a functional trade-off between conspicuousness and signal reliability.",

We apply this technique to swelling and acid-catalyzed deconstruction of cross-linked and linear polymers to observe how structural heterogeneity evolves over time.

Extracellular vesicles derived from injured brain tissue (TBI-EVs) may mediate brain-kidney interactions. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TBI-EVs causes AKI by promoting pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. TBI-EVs markedly increased AKI markers and proportion of pro-inflammatory-polarized macrophages. Mechanistically, transcriptomics of TBI-EVs revealed high circUsp32 expression. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that circUsp32 competitively binds to the SH2 domain of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1), affecting interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF7) ubiquitination and promoting pro-inflammatory polarization. CircUsp32 knockdown reduced pro-inflammatory polarization and alleviated AKI in TBI mice. In addition, circUsp32 is homologous to hsa_circ_0044940, which may serve as a predicted biomarker of AKI after TBI. Notably, AKI following TBI may contribute to neuroinflammation via uremic toxins. Collectively, these findings suggest that circUsp32 mediates macrophage polarization through the Socs1/IRF7 axis and could be a potential biomarker for AKI following TBI.",

The correlations suggest a simple yet common mechanism of glass formation for the chain molecules, i.e., fast-relaxing chain ends alleviate the requirements of cooperativity for structural rearrangement, thus facilitating the cooperative motion that reduces T g and m as chain length is shortened.

Here, we identify that LMD-3, a LysM domain protein, is a critical regulator of proteostasis and reproductive capacity in C. elegans . Deficiency of lmd-3 leads to notable defects in oxidation resistance and constitutively high cellular stress responses. We demonstrate that LMD-3, localized to the lysosome, interacts with vitellogenin and a proton-pumping V-type ATPase via its TLDc domain to regulate lysosomal function and maintain yolk protein homeostasis. We also found that supplementing with vitamin B12 can restore fertility in lmd-3 mutants by reducing oxidative stress and improving lysosomal function.

Here, we report the observation of two-photon induced coherence without induced emission. Using a two-photon Fock state, we establish quantum coherence between pairs of two-photon spontaneous emission amplitudes, resulting in a doubling of interferometric phase modulation. Specifically, we show that a phase shift ϕ applied to undetected 1016-nanometer photons leads to a 2 ϕ modulation in the detection of 632-nanometer photons.

Here, we show potential-modulated orbital interaction mechanisms governing the selectivity in hetero-CoPc based on first-principles calculations with consideration of carbon support and electrochemical interfaces. Specifically, constant-potential orbital-resolved analyses reveal that electrons introduced by applied potentials initially occupy the semi-occupied Co-3d z 2 orbital, thus suppressing CO-5σ → Co-3d z 2 electron donation. This induces gradual weakening of *CO adsorption while establishing high *CO hydrogenation barriers (restricting the product to CO) over the medium potential range. With further decreasing potentials, a progressive electron population occurs in the Co-3d yz /d xz orbitals, promoting the Co-3d xz /d yz → CO-2π* back-donation. This facilitates the activation of the C─O bond of *CO, thereby reducing its hydrogenation barriers and enabling methanol production at more negative potentials. Similar analyses also rationalize experimental observations for other heterogenized metal phthalocyanines, showing the importance of potential-modulated orbital interactions for selectivity engineering.",

          "abstract": "A multilayered, thalamorecipient visual cortex emerged ~320 million years ago in stem amniotes. Despite its importance for understanding the evolution of cortical computation, its function remains unknown. We recorded visually evoked responses in the dorsal cortex of behaving turtles, considered a mammalian neocortex homolog. Using a spatial oddball paradigm, we found tuning to stimuli in deviant positions alongside adaptation to standard positions within the visual field. Eye tracking demonstrated that responses remained spatially selective despite gaze shifts altering retinal stimulus position. Thus, the turtle cortex encodes unexpected visual stimuli using computations invariant to retinal position, a property previously observed only in higher mammalian cortices. These results indicate that invariance computations preceded the evolution of local filtering computations in mammalian primary cortices, pointing to a previously unidentified function for ancestral cortices. They also challenge hierarchical models of invariance computations, which assume that invariance is built from low-level features across multiple processing steps.",

This catalyst enables the production of optically pure glyceric acid from a broad range of biomass sources including raw biomass with unprecedented yield (59 to 96%) and enantiomeric excess (97 to &gt;99%). Structural and mechanistic studies reveal that silver clusters, stabilized by surface oxygen vacancies, activate dioxygen through π-backbonding, while electron-deficient silver single atoms preferentially bind the chiral substrate via ionic interactions, increasing the energy barrier for mutarotation and preserving its stereochemical identity.

Here, we identified both Omicron BA.1–specific and ancestral (Wuhan)–conserved CD8 T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and evaluated them as carrier-protein fusion vaccines in mouse models. Subcutaneous immunizations with two CD8 epitope peptides substantially lowered lung viral load and conferred protection against low-dose viral challenge, but not against high-dose challenge. Notably, intranasal boosting—with or without adjuvant—enhanced lung resident memory T cell responses and conferred potent, durable protection against high-dose infection.

Here, we pioneer the use of state-of-the-art particle algorithms to model movements, integrate datasets, and assess MPA design, leveraging a case study of a Critically Endangered elasmobranch. Our algorithms led to 5-fold improvements in space-use maps and 30-fold improvements in residency estimates compared to prevailing methods.

However, the extent to which H2AK119ub functions independently of H3K27me3 to repress or potentiate gene expression, and the evolutionary conservation of these roles, remains unclear. Here, we address the interplay among Polycomb-deposited marks and chromatin states in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.

Unexpectedly, H2AK119ub is enriched at predicted enhancers with developmentally dynamic changes in accessibility, including in neurons. More than two-thirds of well-documented axon guidance genes and neuronal identity transcription factors are associated with H2AK119ub. Many of the genes differentially expressed in H2AK119ub-deficient animals are involved in neuronal differentiation and signaling and feature H2AK119ub-enriched promoters and enhancers, including a subset that is H3K27me3 repressed.

Interfacial voids between FA 1− x Cs x PbI 3 layer and hole-transport layers, caused by the limited annealing temperature for f -PSMs, severely disrupt the film structural continuity. A double-sided annealing strategy is used to address this challenge, which markedly reduces the voids at the buried interface and yields homogeneous perovskite films with enlarged grains. The double-sided annealing can flip the phase transition direction from traditional top-down to bottom-up, because of the much higher air temperature above perovskite films, allowing a quick dimethyl sulfoxide evaporation.

Understanding this would reveal regulatory mechanisms used to maintain critical bioenergetic gradients for cellular respiration, oxidative mitochondrial reactions, and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.

Dissipation of the ΔΨm or mutation of select residues in SLC25A51 led to equilibration of NAD + from the matrix.

This work demonstrates that x-ray diffractive imaging is capable of retrieving time-resolved structural information of large molecules reshaped by intense laser fields. Laser-driven fragmentation is a first step toward observing molecular processes modified by laser fields of increasing intensity.",

Here, we show that solar radio bursts (SRBs) can transfer entropy to solar energetic protons (SEPs), affecting their thermodynamics. In particular, our analysis (i) detects the statistically significant SEP density fluctuations, associated with SRB activity that triggers a systematic increase in the thermodynamic kappa; (ii) estimates the polytropic index of SEPs, which is anticorrelated with kappa, serving as an independent measure to validate the increase in kappa; (iii) derives the entropy transfer by using its theoretical relationship with kappa; and (iv) compares SRB wave intensity with the entropy transferring to SEPs to demonstrate their wave-particle coupling. We lastly expose the thermodynamic association between type III SRB wave intensity and SEP entropy transfer as well as their respective coupling, thus developing a paradigm for further systematic investigations among other types of wave activity and particle populations.",

Liquid biopsies, involving analysis of cell-free mtDNA, enable early cancer detection but suffer from low sensitivity due to scarce analytes. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated urinary biomarker, termed CasUber, for in vivo monitoring of tumor progression and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that CasUber can deliver a CRISPR detection system into tumor cell mitochondria, leverage the single-nucleotide variant recognition ability and trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a to convert tumor-specific mtDNA mutations into renal-clearable fluorescent biomarkers, and exocytosed along with the natural efflux pathway of damaged mtDNA. As a result, CasUber enables discrimination of ultrasmall tumor lesions (~1 cubic millimeter) and detection of lung tumor nodules earlier than bioluminescence imaging in a blood-lung metastasis model. This renal clearable nanosensor allows in situ recognition of specific gene mutation to generate amplified signals, overcoming the limitation of low mtDNA abundance and enabling noninvasive and ultrasensitive monitoring of tumor progression and metastasis via a simple urine test.",

Here, we investigate the regulatory roles of TOP2 paralogs using estrogen signaling, which triggers an acute transcriptional induction that involves extensive rewiring of genome organization, as a model system. Unexpectedly, we find that estrogen treatment strongly inhibits TOP2B catalytic activity—although not its binding—specifically at estrogen-responsive enhancers and promoters. This inhibition results in an accumulation of negative DNA supercoiling and promotes the formation of regulatory chromatin contacts. Estrogen-mediated inhibition of TOP2B activity depends on estrogen receptor α, a noncatalytic function of TOP2A, and, most importantly, the action of zinc finger protein associated with tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 and TOP2, an atypical small ubiquitin-like modifier ligase that directly inhibits TOP2 activity. This mechanism of transcriptional control, involving the fine-tuning of DNA supercoiling levels, highlights the role of DNA topoisomerases as central regulators of genome dynamics.",

Using an ESC–to–neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation model, we show that CTCF-ZF1 is crucial for maintaining cell type–specific chromatin loops. Expression of CTCF-∆ZF1 leads to disrupted loops and dysregulation of genes within these loops, particularly those involved in neuronal development and function. We identified NPC-specific, CTCF-ZF1 interacting RNAs. Truncation of two such coding RNAs, Podxl and Grb10 , disrupted chromatin loops in cis, similar to the disruption seen in CTCF-∆ZF1–expressing NPCs.

Here, using a genetic modifier screen, we identify the super elongation complex, a P-TEFb–containing elongation factor that releases promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II, as a genetic interactor of MECP2 . MeCP2 physically interacts with SEC subunits and directly binds AFF4, the scaffold of the SEC, via the transcriptional repression domain. Furthermore, MeCP2 facilitates the binding of AFF4 on a subset of genes in the mouse brain regulating synaptic plasticity and concordantly promotes the binding of RNA polymerase II on these genes. Last, while haploinsufficiency of Aff4 does not exhibit any behavioral deficits in mice, it exacerbates the impaired contextual learning behavior of Mecp2 hypomorphic mice.

The temperature dependence of the tunneling rate provides a clue to understanding the quantum effects. Important physics behind quantum tunneling involves the correlation with surrounding environment, such as phonons and electrons. However, this correlation is not yet well understood due to the difficulty of directly probing hydrogen hopping. Taking advantage of nuclear reaction analysis and resistance measurements, we successfully observed hydrogen hopping from tetrahedral to octahedral sites in palladium. The hydrogen hopping is observed even at low temperatures owing to the quantum tunneling. The tunneling rate reveals a slightly positive and negative temperature dependence above and below 20 kelvin, respectively. The former is explained by the phonon effects. The latter is attributed to the nonadiabatic effects of conduction electrons, whose coupling constant K was derived to be 0.41 ± 0.03 from its temperature ( T ) dependence described as T 2 K –1 .",

We present a physically based landscape evolution model that incorporates spatially variable erodibility, dynamic uplift histories, climate and sea level change, and evolving topography over geological timescales. This richer input data, combined with tighter calibration, enables quantification of preservation potential and marks a step beyond prior conceptual and time-static models. We apply the model to New Guinea’s geologically complex mountains and integrate it with machine learning–derived ore formation probabilities. The combined model predicts known porphyry endowment, identifies new targets, and constrains preservation likelihood, validating this open-source method as a flexible and affordable exploration tool in dynamic tectonic settings.",

We thereby propose a silica-confined strategy for electrocatalyst design to maintain high local alkalinity at both cathode and anode by the strong Lewis acid–base interaction between highly electrophilic silicon atom and hydroxide. The developed copper/silica cathode and cobalt/silica anode successfully promote cathodic multicarbon formation and anodic oxygen evolution, thereby improving the full cell energy efficiency. Even under high-rate electrolysis at 900 milliamperes per square centimeter, the selectivity and energy efficiency of multicarbon products remain above 80 and 30%.

We identify bimodal volcanism of the Columbia River Basalt Group as the dominant Miocene source, requiring that the early Miocene Continental Divide lay ~400 kilometers west of its present position.

          "abstract": "Nature has long inspired engineering innovations. Recent advances in biohybrid research have taken this inspiration further by directly integrating biotic materials into engineered systems. Here we report “3D necroprinting,” a biohybrid manufacturing technique that repurposes female mosquito proboscides as high-resolution 3D printing nozzles. The mosquito proboscis, with its unique geometry, structure, and mechanics, enables printed line widths as fine as 20 μm, surpassing commercially available 36-gauge dispense tips by ~100%. The mosquito proboscis dispense tip can withstand internal pressures of approximately 60 kPa, enabling effective fluid extrusion. Demonstrated applications include high-resolution printing of complex structures such as a honeycomb structure, a maple leaf, and bioscaffolds encapsulating cancer cells and red blood cells, showcasing the versatility and capacity of 3D necroprinting. By introducing biotic materials as viable substitutes to complex engineered components, this work paves the way for sustainable and innovative solutions in advanced manufacturing and microengineering.",

Here, we synthesize observations of deep SSEs in the Cascadia Subduction Zone and argue that rapid, cohesive fault strengthening may control the dynamics of deep SSEs. Cohesive strength is frequently ignored in constitutive laws used to describe fault rheology in numerical simulations of earthquakes and SSEs alike. To demonstrate its importance, we perform and analyze a suite of petrological experiments that simulate fault healing under representative pressure and temperature conditions. We show that significant cohesive strength recovery caused by dissolution-precipitation processes occurs on timescales of just a few hours. Together, our experimental and observational results support the idea that cohesion is a key component of fault strength under SSE conditions and highlight the need for its inclusion in both future experiments and numerical models of fault slip.",

Fluorescence-guided surgery techniques are being developed in an effort to improve margin detection and surgical resection outcomes, with several systemically administered imaging agents having gained clinical approval.

We hypothesized that “spray-on probes” with specificity for fibroblast activation protein alpha in peritumoral fibroblasts could improve fluorescence-guided surgery, detect smaller tumors, improve imaging accuracy, and reduce the amount of times a patient is hospitalized. We show that this strategy increases achievable tumor margin contrast by 5- to 10-fold and detects even microscopic cancer deposits.

To bridge this gap, we devised an artificial intelligence (AI)–enabled approach that pairs rapid compound triage with mechanistic target deconvolution. Our AI-driven screening highlighted melatonin (MLT) as a promising candidate. Serum profiling of 161 human individuals confirmed an age-related fall in circulating MLT level, while subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that MLT rescues cognition, suppresses neuroinflammation, and alleviates senescence phenotypes. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)–guided chemoproteomic deconvolution next pinpointed the histone acetyltransferase p300 as MLT’s target. Integrated Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics revealed that MLT-bound p300 cooperates with specificity protein 1 (SP1) at a brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 super-enhancer, elevating histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation and reengaging a circadian-epigenetic program that links redox resilience to neuroprotection. By combining AI-driven discovery with PROTAC-based target mapping and super-enhancer–centric mechanistic resolution, our study identifies MLT as a dual-action candidate and sets out a reproducible “AI-to-clinic” paradigm for multitarget drug innovation in aging-related neurodegeneration.",

This one-time intervention effectively prevented ADA formation in mice and rats, even after repeated challenges with UOX-Ery or free UOX protein, an outcome not achieved by CTX or UOX plus CTX. This tolerogenic effect relied on splenic uptake of UOX-Ery by myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, and was associated with the expansion of a distinct subset of effector regulatory T cells. Functionally, this immune tolerance enhanced the pharmacokinetics of UOX, sustained long-term control of serum uric acid levels, and attenuated local inflammation within tophus-like lesions. Together, these findings demonstrate that UOX-Ery, combined in a single dose with clinically used immunosuppressants, can effectively treat gout by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance.",

As users touch and move across surfaces, VoxeLite delivers high-resolution distributed forces via the nodes. Enabled by scalable microfabrication techniques, the display achieves actuator densities up to 110 nodes per square centimeter, produces stimuli up to 800 hertz, and remains transparent to real-world tactile input. We demonstrate its ability to render small-scale hapticons and virtual textures and transmit physical surfaces, validated through human psychophysics and biomimetic sensing.

Current therapeutic options are limited, and innovative treatments to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are needed. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) comprises a family of 12 isoforms. In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells revealed that AMPKβ1 isoform (AMPKα1β1γ1) predominates in the erythroid lineage. AMPKβ1 activators increased the expression of HbF in erythroid cells from SCD donors and decreased sickling in vitro through activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) but independently from direct Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) inhibition, by way of a noncanonical NRF2 pathway, as shown by phosphorylation of Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1). In vivo studies in Townes SCD mice treated with the selective AMPKβ1 activator PF-06409577 confirmed increased HbF in circulating erythrocytes, associated with decreased reactive oxygen species and reduced chronic inflammation markers. Collectively, these findings establish selective AMPKβ1 activation as a promising therapeutic approach to induce HbF in hemoglobinopathies.",

However, human preimplantation embryos often display an array of morphological defects associated with poor development and implantation. Here, we used live-embryo imaging and computational analysis to capture how these defects can be produced in real time. We record various forms of mitotic errors including lagging chromosomes producing micronuclei, multipolar spindles causing abnormal chromosome organization recapitulated by daughter cells, and uncontrolled scattering of condensed chromosomes. In addition, we capture abnormal cleavage furrow dynamics during cytokinesis producing binucleated and enucleated cells. Finally, we find cells with disrupted mitotic progression ultimately leading to blebbing and fragmentation. Thus, these results document specific aberrant cell behaviors producing morphological defects in real time, and indicate that errors during mitosis and cytokinesis represent a major cause of developmental failures in human embryos.",

Here, we identify the nonfibrillar collagen CLE-1, a member of the evolutionarily conserved multiplexin family, as a master determinant of synapse identity in Caenorhabditis elegans . C. elegans muscle cells are innervated by both cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons. The CLE-1B isoform is secreted by motoneurons and localizes to neuromuscular junctions. Loss of CLE-1B causes the relocalization of acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic synapses. We show that CLE-1B positions previously unidentified proteolytic fragments of the extracellular scaffold Punctin/MADD-4 to align acetylcholine receptors with cholinergic terminals and independently modulates receptor abundance. These findings reveal CLE-1 as a dual-function synaptic organizer that integrates spatial and quantitative control of postsynaptic receptor localization to maintain synapse identity.",

Single-molecule microscopy reveals the dynamics governed by hydrodynamic interactions, demonstrating that increasing histone H4 acetylation density enhances structural fluctuations and relaxation times. In vitro Hi-C reveals power-law decay of the nucleosome contacts consistent with the Gaussian chain, which is globally reduced by acetylation. We also observe that heterogeneous modification patterns alone are sufficient to create distinct structural domains reminiscent of higher-order chromatin organization.

PRV can establish latency in pigs, potentially leading to disease outbreaks upon reactivation. However, little is known about the PRV reactivation process, particularly in cases with other pathogens coinfection. We found that extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus suis , common zoonotic bacteria found in pigs, can trigger PRV reactivation, and bacteria up-regulated CXCL1 to enhance STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which triggers PRV reactivation by regulating the transcription of early viral genes. Effective booster immunization significantly reduced PRV reactivation among pigs.

Despite the extremeness of the event, our analysis shows that, under current climate conditions, we could have still seen up to 30% more heat-related deaths than the number observed. We show that between 11 and 15% of the observed human mortality was attributable to climate change during this event, depending on the conditioning of the atmospheric circulation. We also show that, had “the same event” occurred in the future, the mortality toll is nonlinear compared with the warming trend, and so the future attribution would be even more extreme, 16 to 31%.

This study investigates the primary environmental parameters inducing alteration in the oil binder and elucidates the associated degradation pathways through a multiscale analytical approach, including noninvasive spectroscopic techniques and synchrotron radiation–based x-ray methods. By combining results from a historical oil painting by James Ensor (1860 to 1949) and artificially aged paint mock-ups, we identified ultraviolet A–visible light and humidity (relative humidity ≥ 95%) as key driving factors, inducing a dual degradation pathway: Light promotes surface-stratified arsenic oxidation (As 3+  → As 5+ ) resulting in amorphous As 5+ -rich compounds, whereas a dark, high moisture environment favors arsenolite (As 2 O 3 ) crystallization.

In vitro assays reveal high biological efficacy, with engineered polymersomes supporting targeted cellular interactions. Functionalization with diverse ligands introduces specific biological functionalities, including mitochondrial targeting, cell migration stimulation, and enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis. This rapid, efficient, and user-friendly strategy for PEG surface functionalization heralds remarkable advances in nanomedicine and biomaterials.",

          "abstract": "Cultivating microorganisms in native-like conditions is vital for bioprospecting and accessing now unculturable species. However, there remains a gap in scalable tools that can both mimic native microenvironments and enable targeted recovery of microbes from complex settings. Such approaches are essential to advance our understanding of microbial ecology, predict community functions, and discover previously unidentified biotherapeutics. We present magnetic nanocultures—a high-throughput microsystem for isolating and growing environmental microbes under near-native conditions. These nanoliter-scale bioreactors are encapsulated in semipermeable membranes that form magnetic polymeric microcapsules using iron oxide nanoparticles within polydimethylsiloxane-based shells. This design offers mechanical stability and magnetic actuation, enabling efficient retrieval from soil-like environments. The nanocultures are optimized for optical and biological properties to support microbial encapsulation, growth, and sorting. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using magnetically responsive microenvironments to cultivate elusive microbes, offering a promising platform for bioprospecting previously uncultured or unknown microbial species.",

          "abstract": "Observations since the 1990s reveal widespread warming in the deep and bottom Arctic Ocean. It is historically attributed to geothermal heating, whereas the impacts of global and Arctic climate change on the deep and bottom Arctic Ocean warming remain unresolved. Our study demonstrates that during the recent decades, the Arctic Ocean deep water is warming at 0.020°C/decade in the Eurasian Basin between 2000 and 2600 m, exceeding what can be explained by geothermal heating. We find that the rapid warming in the deep Greenland Basin diminishes its cooling effect on the deep Eurasian Basin via the Fram Strait, leading to the warming in the deep Eurasian Basin. Meanwhile, the Lomonosov Ridge blocks this warming signal from reaching the deep Amerasian Basin, maintaining its relative slow warming rate of 0.003°C/decade. Our findings indicate that the deep Greenland Basin warming has already exerted obvious impacts on the deep Arctic Ocean.",

          "abstract": "The repeated evolution of avian obligate brood parasitism (OBP) across diverse lineages represents a major evolutionary puzzle. While host-parasite coevolution has been extensively studied, the initial conditions favoring OBP emergence remain unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical modeling, paleoclimate mapping, and phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify the key drivers underlying OBP evolution. Our model shows that rising parental care costs, particularly under environmental stress, may favor the emergence of OBP. However, its persistence requires additional life-history adaptations, including increases in fecundity (egg production). Paleoclimatic data support this framework: OBP origins often followed major climatic upheavals with fixations occurring during subsequently more stable periods. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that OBP is associated with high-mortality ecological traits, such as open-habitat use. We also find increased OBP likelihood in both smaller carnivorous and larger herbivorous/omnivorous species, indicating size-dependent trophic constraints. These results provide a unified framework explaining the recurrent evolution of OBP by linking environmental pressures and life-history trade-offs to this remarkable behavioral adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Bering Sea winter sea ice (BSWI), vital for regional climate, ecosystem, and livelihoods, is significantly influenced by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Here, we identify a shift in the ENSO-BSWI relationship. Pre–mid-1990s, traditional eastern Pacific ENSO dominated, driving a positive ENSO-BSWI linkage; post–mid-1990s, more frequent central Pacific (CP) ENSO events reversed this relationship to negative. Observations and model experiments show that CP El Niño coupled with positive-phase North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) redirects poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains, enhancing Bering Sea southerlies. This suppresses ice advection, intensifies warm air intrusion, and reduces BSWI. Strengthened CP ENSO-NPMM coupling and heightened NPMM variability amplify this teleconnection, increasing its influence on BSWI by 38.9% versus NPMM alone. Our findings underscore the growing role of subtropical and tropical Pacific climate interactions in subarctic sea ice variability and highlight the need for improved climate models that capture ENSO diversity, NPMM dynamics, and subtropical-subarctic teleconnections to enhance BSWI projections under climate change.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) sclerosis represents a prominent feature of fibrotic disorders; however, the macrophage response to changes in matrix stiffness and its impact on fibrotic diseases remain unclear. This study reveals a vicious circle of ECM-cell-ECM, where increased ECM hardness activates the STING pathway in macrophages, in turn activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thus enhancing ECM stiffness again and exacerbating liver fibrosis. To reverse liver fibrosis, an innovative carrier-free nanosystem capable of degrading ECM, specifically blocking the STING pathway in macrophages as well as remodeling matrix mechanical, is created. In mouse models, pharmacological STING inhibition via alkylation in macrophages, combined with ECM degradation via matrix metalloproteinases and metal ion–induced macrophage polarization, reduces stromal stiffness and reverses fibrosis. Our findings underscore the antifibrotic potential of matrix mechanical remodeling, demonstrating that concurrent reduction of matrix stiffness and inhibition of STING pathway in macrophages can synergistically promote fibrosis regression. This research establishes a previously unidentified paradigm for liver fibrosis reversal.",

          "abstract": "Quasi-solid polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) for flexible batteries face critical limitations in ion transport efficiency at high currents. We address this with a design of nanofluidic polyacrylamide hydrogel integrating aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as ion highways [SWCNT-embedded polyacrylamide(CPAM)]. Photo-polymerization ensures homogeneous SWCNT distribution, delivering a high ionic conductivity of 30.3 mS cm −1 while shielding polymer matrices from ion collision. Molecular dynamics simulations identify three ion transport modes, dominated by SWCNT-confined pathways. The CPAM-based Zn||Zn cell exhibits ultralong cycling (7000 hours), and Zn|CPAM|Zn 0.25 V 2 O 5 cells retain 80% capacity after 2000 cycles at 40 A g −1 (19.2 kW kg −1 ). Cryogenic operation (−15°C) and pouch cells further demonstrate the robust performance of CPAM. This work transcends conventional compromises of QSPEs, enabling wearables with ultrafast charging/discharging, cryogenic tolerance, and mechanical resilience.",
