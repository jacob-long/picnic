          "abstract": "Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’ 1–6 . This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 7–9 . However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains 10–12 . The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood 1–5 . Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",

          "authors": "Jiaxuan Qi, Drew C. Schreiner, Miles Martinez, John Pearson, Richard Mooney",
          "abstract": "Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours.",

          "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2,3,4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers.",

          "abstract": "Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery 1,2 . A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei . This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) 1,2 . Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) 3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres 3,5–8 or bulk waveguides 9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth 11,12 . We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide 13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics.",

Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC.",

          "abstract": "In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock 1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion 2 and systemic hyperinflammation 3 . The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5 ). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",

          "abstract": "Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning.",

However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2,3,4,5,6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales.",

          "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the principal energy currency of all living cells1,2. Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites.",

These prototypes exhibit a non-variational form of elasticity characterized by odd moduli8,12,17, whose magnitude we predict from microscopics using coarse-grained theories and which we validate experimentally. When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18,19,20,21,22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23,24,25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26,27,28,29,30.",

When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27,28,29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34.",

They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times 1,2 , quantum confinement 3 and topologically protected states 4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors 6 . Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended1. Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling and limited phylogenetic signal1. Here we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution on the basis of a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins that includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses of a 100 taxon × 93 protein dataset with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models and an extensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses show that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ‘Opimoda+’ and ‘Diphoda+’. This position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study sheds light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and provides a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.",

The available palaeoanthropological information from Western Europe is limited and confined to the Iberian Peninsula1,2. Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago. This fossil (ATE7-1) represents the earliest human face of Western Europe identified thus far. Most of the morphological features of the midface of this hominin are primitive for the Homo clade and they do not display the modern-like aspect exhibited by Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site, also in the Sierra de Atapuerca, and dated to between 900,000 and 800,000 years ago3. Furthermore, ATE7-1 is more derived in the nasoalveolar region than the Dmanisi and other roughly contemporaneous hominins. On the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assign the new human remains from TE7 level to Homo aff. erectus. From the archaeological, palaeontological and palaeoanthropological information obtained in the lower levels of the Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina sites4,5,6,7,8, we suggest a turnover in the human population in Europe at the end of the Early Pleistocene.",

Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding.",

The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean.",

These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3,4,5,6,7,8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9,10,11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest.",

However, their understanding has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic geometries and spin Hamiltonians primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups11,12, thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group13,14,15,16,17 theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1,421 collinear spin space groups into 4 types, constructing their band representations and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines and charge-4 octuple points. On the basis of the MAGNDATA database18, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which more than 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80 per cent are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that the spin space group serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets.",

Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front.

We show how our architecture allows us to maximize the use of quantum network hardware by multitasking different applications. Our architecture can be used to execute programs on any quantum processor platform corresponding to our system model, which we illustrate by demonstrating an extra driver for QNodeOS for a trapped-ion quantum network node based on a single 40Ca+ atom16.

The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures 2 . Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend.",

          "abstract": "Students walk across Columbia University’s campus in New York City.Credit: Luiz C. Ribeiro/New York Daily News/TNS/Alamy\n\nOn Tuesday morning this week, PhD student Daniella Fodera woke up at 7 a.m. to a call from the head of her research laboratory in Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, delivering devastating news. Her F31 fellowship, a research training grant that provides the majority of her annual income, had been terminated.\n\n“It was traumatic,” Fodera says. “I immediately just broke into tears.”\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\nFodera, who studies fibroids in the uterus — non-cancerous growths that affect 70–80% of women by the age of 50, and can cause severe pain and infertility — is just one of numerous scientists affected by the decision of US President Donald Trump’s administration to cancel US$400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia, located in New York City. Announced on 7 March, the move, Trump’s team said, stemmed from the university’s “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students” and that more cancellations “are expected to follow”.\n\nMost of those affected are researchers and students whose grants and fellowships come from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The agency announced on Monday that it was terminating more than $250 million in funding — including more than 400 research grants — to Columbia.\n\nSeveral university lab leaders, PhD students and postdocs have expressed concern to Nature about their future in science and their ability to support themselves and their families. Although a complete list of cancelled grants hasn’t been released, Nature’s reporting suggests that early-career scientists receiving NIH training grants such as F30, F31, R25 and T32 fellowships are heavily affected. Sources inside the NIH tell Nature that the lists of cancelled grants come from the agency’s Office of Extramural Research, which is in turn receiving them from the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the US Department of Government Efficiency. Action on the lists is required immediately, often within the hour.\n\nA spokesperson at Columbia told Nature that the university is in the process of reviewing termination notices and “cannot confirm how many grant cancellations have been received from federal agencies since March 7”. Still, she wrote, Columbia “pledges to work with the federal government to restore Columbia’s federal funding”.\n\nLosses for the public\n\nJamie Daw, a lab leader at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, was also taken by surprise when the grant-termination news arrived. Daw, who studies how policies affect the ability of women of reproductive age and pregnant people to access health services, got the e-mail on Monday night.\n\nUS universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts\n\nThe university stated that her grant — which supported around 20 people — had been cancelled with immediate effect, and that she needed to stop her work and notify collaborators both inside and outside Columbia.\n\n“It hurts,” Daw says. “We’re really trying to do work in the public interest — we’re working to improve the US maternal mortality crisis.” (Maternal mortality rates in the United States are high compared with in other high-income nations, particularly among Black women. )\n\nSome postdoctoral fellows at Columbia are protected from losing their positions despite a lack of funding because they are part of a union that has an agreement with the university. It is therefore the responsibility of university staff members such as lab leaders to try to find funding for those postdocs that have their grants terminated, says Sherida de Leeuw, a chair of the union.\n\n“If I did not have that protection, my last pay cheque would have been two weeks ago and I would be out on the streets now,” says Columbia postdoc Gordon Petty, who was notified on Tuesday morning that his T32 training grant to study schizophrenia was cancelled. “It is hard to know what the immediate fallout of this will be, but at this point I believe my academic career is effectively over,” he says.\n\nDemonstrators barricaded themselves in a Columbia University academic building during a pro-Palestinian protest in April 2024.Credit: Alex Kent/Getty\n\nColumbia’s woes have their roots in campus protests that broke out after Israel invaded Gaza following the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, an Islamist organization designated by some countries as a terrorist group. Twelve hundred people died in the Hamas attacks, and about 250 were taken hostage. Some students at Columbia and other universities across the United States have called Israel’s response disproportionate, pointing to more than 48,000 Palestinians who have died, according to Gaza’s health ministry. But some Jewish students have felt threatened by the protests.\n\nTrump, who has long said that he wants to rid the US education system of “left-wing indoctrination”, wrote on his social-media network Truth Social on 4 March that “All federal funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.”\n\nBy Monday, the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights had sent letters to 60 universities, including Columbia, warning them of potential enforcement actions if they do not “fulfill their obligations to protect Jewish students on campus”.\n\nColumbia, where protests were particularly intense and where New York City police were called in to break up demonstrations, is the first to be affected by the campaign.",

Much of the world’s biodiversity is found in forests, particularly those in the tropics2. Over the past three centuries, deforestation has occurred at alarming rates3. As forests are cleared, what remains is often broken into small fragments that are separated by non-forest land uses, such as agricultural lands, ranch lands and areas for human development. Does this fragmentation harm biodiversity beyond that of the loss of forests? Could fragmentation instead benefit biodiversity? These questions are at the heart of a long-standing and ongoing conservation debate4–7.

          "abstract": "With papers to write, grants to apply for and students to teach, cybersecurity can be a low priority for scientists. Until, that is, it all goes wrong.\n\n“Frankly, this is an awful time for science,” says Noam Ross, executive director of rOpenSci, a non-profit initiative in Berkeley, California, that provides open-source software tools for scientists. He should know. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ross, who is based in Brooklyn, New York, was working for the US non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to identify areas where human activity has increased the risk of disease spillover from animal sources. “EcoHealth became the subject of conspiracy theorists about the origin of COVID,” he says.\n\nThat made the organization — and anyone who worked for it — a target. “It could range from hate mail to death threats,” Ross says. “I had colleagues where some of that stuff was directed at their homes, not just the office.”\n\nAs political divides deepen, such threats are multiplying. In February, many people working for US federal health agencies found themselves ‘doxxed’ — their photograph and work information, as well as records of their political donations, were published on a website called DEI Watchlist. The site was created by the conservative, US non-profit organization American Accountability Foundation, with the purpose of “exposing the unelected career staff driving radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives”.\n\nSo … you’ve been hacked\n\nAriadna Gallo, a political scientist at Argentina’s national scientific and technical research council, CONICET, based in Buenos Aires, was doxxed in 2024 after being filmed at a public protest against cuts to academic funding in the country. A YouTuber featured her in a video and published her personal and academic details, triggering what Gallo calls a “torrent” of attacks in the video’s comments.\n\nAll scientists, regardless of their discipline or location, are potential targets, according to Matt Mitchell, chief executive of the Safety Sync Group in New York, which provides online and real-world advice and resources on security and safety. “This is where we are,” he says. “The problem is bigger than any one president, prime minister or leader of a totalitarian or authoritarian state.”\n\nBut there are things you can do to protect yourself, and resources that can help. Here are five steps to get started.\n\nGet help\n\nYour institution will have privacy policies and digital resources you can tap into, but there are also plenty available online. These include anti-doxxing tips from digital-rights non-profit group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in San Francisco, California; cybersecurity risk-assessment tools from the Ford Foundation’s Grantee Safety Program in New York City; and assorted resources from the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nCybersecurity for the travelling scientist\n\nWhatever you do, include your colleagues in the conversation. “This is absolutely vital,” says Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at the EFF in Los Angeles, California. “If everyone is not on board for the security steps you’re taking, it’s going to be less secure.”\n\nBouncing ideas around with colleagues outside your discipline can expose new problems and ways to fix them, he adds. “You might not think about the risk to a particular data set, or that your laptop might get stolen at a coffee shop, until you start having those conversations.”\n\nFurthermore, it’s always good to know people who will have your back if you start to garner unwanted attention online. “Find a trusted colleague, mentor or loved one that knows what your concerns might be,” says Samuel Mendez, a PhD candidate studying public-health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who created a digital safety kit for public-health workers. That person can then be “someone you can reach out to for support if you do need help screening messages or documenting interactions at some point”, they add.\n\nScrub your online profile\n\n“An immediate step you can take right now is to search for your own information,” Mendez suggests. That can be as simple as googling yourself in combination with names of former employers, schools, places of residence and so on, to see whether you can find any contact information that you don’t want to be public. “From there, you can manually request removal,” Mendez says. Success might vary, however — whereas residents of the European Union have relatively strong privacy protections, including the right to request that personal data be erased (the ‘right to be forgotten’), that is not true everywhere, including in the United States.\n\nCyberattacks are hitting research institutions — with devastating effects\n\nSome firms will scrape your data from the Internet and sell it on, and you should definitely include these in your scrubbing. “My general recommendation is to make a request to one of the big ones, and just see what you get,” Klosowski says. Companies that scrape such data almost always give you your data set free of charge, he says; then you can decide how much you need to worry.\n\nAlternatively, you can pay for a service that will remove the information for you, such as DeleteMe, Incogni or Kanary. In professions in which doxxing has been a problem, specialist services exist. Doximity’s DocDefender, for instance, will remove details from public sites as part of its package for physicians, who might be at risk from groups such as anti-abortion campaigners.\n\nInstitutions and professional bodies could make this process easier for researchers, says Greg Wilson, a cybersecurity educator in Toronto, Canada. Academic conferences, for instance, could include hour-long ‘bring your own device’ sessions during which people are walked through the process of securing their data and devices. Indeed, Mendez has run social events, such as a ‘digital safety disco’, where this goes on in an informal setting.\n\nPractise good cybersecurity hygiene\n\nThe basics of cybersecurity are straightforward, Klosowski says: use a password manager and two-factor authentication; make sure that no two sites or apps use the same password; and remove apps and delete accounts that you rarely use.",

          "abstract": "Anthony Gagliano (left) and Marie Launay complete the final step of their protocol, preparing a DNA library from material extracted from their fish species of interest.Credit: Denis Roy\n\nOn completing my first day of preparing genetic libraries in July 2024, my team and I were confronted with rubbish bins overflowing with plastic, single-use pipette tips, tubes and gloves. As a PhD student studying fish biology at the Natural Resources Department at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, it was hard to ignore the troubling mismatch between a widespread reliance on single-use plastic and working in a research field focused on conservation.\n\nAlthough data on this issue are scarce, in 2020, researchers at a small, seven-person microbiology laboratory in Edinburgh, UK, churned out a staggering 97 kilograms of biohazardous and plastic waste in just one month1. Plastic is now showing up in some of the most remote parts of the planet; in the Beaufort Sea, a section of the Arctic Ocean to the north of Canada and Alaska, an average of 7,570 microplastic particles were recorded per square kilometre over an 12-day period in 20222. Its impact is widespread, from littering the ocean floor to infiltrating the food web.\n\nTeaming up with Anthony Gagliano, a fellow master’s student dedicated to the conservation of freshwater fish, I embarked on a conservation project studying genetic diversity in different fish populations: the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in my case, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus x L. macrochirus) for Anthony. Although plastic pollution wasn’t the main focus of our research, safeguarding water bodies is essential to our work, and we knew we had to address the disconnect between our values and laboratory practices.\n\nResearchers have raised alarms about excessive plastic use in scientific laboratories in the past. However, few quantifiable data exist on the actual amount of plastic waste generated by common protocols. Filling that gap became our first goal.\n\nQuantifying the issue\n\nBetween June and August 2024, we extracted DNA from 518 fish and used it to produced genetic libraries for our species of interest. A genetic library consists of DNA fragments that have been cut into even smaller pieces, amplified and tagged with special labels, allowing the sequencing device to recognize and read them. By analysing the DNA sequences, we aimed to assess the adaptation potential of populations of different species, to inform conservation policies. The protocol required the use of disposable sterile materials to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nMarie Launay takes a piece of an Arctic Cod's fin ray to use in the DNA extraction process.Credit: Marie Launay\n\nTo quantify the waste produced, we set aside the plastic produced from the first batch of 96 libraries, which included items such as pipette tips, tubes, plates and packaging. Once processed, we found that our first batch had produced 7.57 kg of plastic waste, with library preparation alone accounting for around 3.85 kg.\n\nOur entire project would have produced close to 41 kg of plastic waste if we had continued with our course of action. Using this data as a baseline, it became painfully clear how big the issue was: some large-scale genetic labs process thousands of samples per year, which, if using similar procedures, would generate an astonishing amount of waste.\n\nAwareness to action\n\nSustainable practices can feel overwhelming for researchers because they require extra thought, time and funds to adopt. So, we decided to start small with practical, achievable adjustments.\n\nWe began by reusing consumables and making more-sustainable purchases. For example, we reused pipette tips by autoclaving them to clean them. By purchasing non-loaded tips with minimal packaging, and refilling the boxes ourselves, we reduced our plastic waste by almost 50%. This also saved on costs, because refill bags are more affordable than pre-loaded boxes.\n\nWe also developed a cleaning and decontamination protocol for the shearing tubes used to fragment DNA into smaller pieces for sequencing. Our protocol requires the use of ultraviolet light as well as a specialized cleaning solution to minimize contamination and allows the tubes to be safely reused.",

They analysed brain scans from 38,961 people in the UK Biobank database using a deep-learning model trained to estimate brain age. They calculated the difference between each person’s predicted brain age and their chronological age — known as the brain age gap (BAG) and used by researchers as a marker of brain ageing.\n\nThen the team performed analyses on a subset of 31,520 healthy participants who had genetic data available, to find out which genes drive their BAG differences.\n\nTo narrow down which of the BAG-linked genes are good targets for new or repurposed drugs, the authors combined their analyses with activity data for 2,682 genes in blood cells and 2,915 genes in brain tissue. This flagged 64 genes with supported links to BAG. Some of these genes are involved in blood clotting and cell death, and seven of them were shown through genetic testing to have strongest links with BAG.\n\nAnti-ageing compounds\n\nThe team also found 466 compounds, either approved as drugs or being tested in clinical studies, that target 29 of these genes and could help to reverse brain ageing. Thirteen of those compounds act on some of these 64 genes or their protein products, and have already been tested — or are being tested — in anti-ageing clinical trials.",

These words, supposedly whispered by Galileo Galilei at the end of his 1633 trial — held because he supported the Copernican ‘heresy’ that Earth moves around the Sun — have long been a byword for how scientists should behave in the face of ignorance, intolerance and ideological inerrancy. They come to mind now, during the all-out war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) happening in the United States.\n\nAt the end of his trial, Galileo was made to swear that he did not believe in Earth’s motion. He was confined to house arrest and forbidden to write any more about the movement of the planet. If he had had grant funding and a website, I am sure that the Roman Catholic Church would have suspended the former and scrubbed the latter.\n\nYet, far from acting in courageous defiance, many scientists and administrators now seem to think that the best response to the war on DEI is to keep their heads low and wait out four hard years.\n\nTrump 2.0: an assault on science anywhere is an assault on science everywhere\n\nThe American Society of Microbiology, NASA, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Transportation and many prominent universities are among those that have been removing references to DEI from their websites, grants, papers, biographies and even histories.\n\nMore scholars must push back. The idea that scientists can keep doing what they know must be done to incorporate DEI into their work while adjusting terms to fit the demands of bigoted autocrats bent on hobbling science is to whistle loudly past a graveyard of avoidable error, continued financial cuts and censorship. That diversity matters to science is a truth — albeit one that has only recently begun to be accepted and applied.\n\nFirst, clinical and social-science research requires diversity to be valid. Genomics has established that different groups of people respond differently to drugs and vaccines. The individuals recruited to and participating in clinical trials must be representative of those who will use those treatments in real life. Attention to DEI allows researchers to identify differences in safety and efficacy between groups early on in the testing process.\n\nLikewise, social scientists are well aware that understanding behaviour and implementing desired change requires studying populations besides white, Western, university psychology students — the group from which psychologists have mainly sourced participants for decades. This is the case whether researchers seek to overcome vaccine hesitancy, prevent self-harm, improve reading skills, change recycling habits or prevent obesity.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next",

The researchers say they are looking for opportunities in Europe, Australia and Asia.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has cut thousands of jobs at key public-health and science agencies, frozen biomedical research funding, slashed money to cover research-overhead costs and terminated grants that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. The effects of these changes have been felt by researchers across the United States and abroad.\n\n“I’ve been really, really passionate about my work, but the situation in the US is so stressful,” says a postdoctoral researcher who studies cancer and genomics at a prestigious US institution, and who requested anonymity because she did not have permission to speak to the media. The researcher is from South Asia but has spent the past four years in the United States, and is now talking to colleagues in Europe about opportunities. As someone who is not a US citizen, she is worried about media reports describing the Trump administration’s plans to introduce travel bans affecting specific countries.\n\nAre you a researcher in the United States who is contemplating leaving the country? Are you making plans? We want to hear from you.\n\nMadhukar Pai, a tuberculosis researcher at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, says that US colleagues have been in touch looking for work, or wanting to talk. “The distress is very palpable and sad to see,” he says.\n\nReady to go\n\nA prominent infectious-diseases researcher, who is a dual national of the United States and a European Union member state, intends to move back to Europe in the coming months. This is the first time in the decade and a half since he moved to the United States that he is seriously considering job offers from colleagues across the Atlantic. “There is the case to stay and fight”, but “I have to consider what is the best decision for myself, my family, my lab, my research and my mental health”, says the researcher, who wants to remain anonymous because his plans are not finalized and to protect his team.\n\nHe says his reasons for leaving include the Trump administration’s anti-science rhetoric and leadership changes at major government agencies. He also worries about the future of funding in his field of infectious diseases and virology.\n\nLeaving the United States will require compromises, he says. Salaries in Europe are generally lower than those for researchers with his experience in the United States, and the research environment in Europe can be less interdisciplinary, he says. Funding for science across Europe also remains stagnant. But having the option to leave puts him in an “extremely privileged position”, he adds.\n\nTough job market",

Meanwhile, the Baku agreement calls on “all actors” to scale up this total financing to at least $1.3 trillion annually.\n\nAlthough these headline numbers seem to be broadly similar to those that were proposed by climate-finance experts (including some of us1) before the COP29 meeting, in reality this fudged scattershot approach falls far short of what’s needed — in terms of timing and quality.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nIdeally, climate finance should be given in the form of public grants, or equivalents. That way, recipients don’t need to find money from elsewhere to repay loans, and the finance can be used as ‘catalytic capital’ to attract private finance that can be co-invested in renewables for LMICs. Grants can also be spent on ending the use of fossil fuels early. The broad mix of public and private, bilateral and multilateral sources allowed by COP29 is inefficient. To decarbonize the world in time, climate finance should be provided at full scale this year, instead of being delayed to 2035, specialists say (see go.nature.com/3r5dxfy).\n\nAnother big stumbling block in Baku was the requirement for unanimity among the parties. For example, the Arab Group of negotiators refused to accept any text that targeted specific sectors, including fossil fuels — even though these are the main source of emissions that climate finance is intended to abate.\n\nWithout access to climate finance at scale, LMICs cannot afford to decarbonize. And time is running out. To have even a 50% chance of holding to the Paris agreement’s 1.5 °C limit, the world has a remaining budget of only around 180 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (see go.nature.com/4bv5mme). This is projected to be depleted by 2035 (assuming a linear rate of decline starting from estimated annual emissions of about 40 Gt in 2025) or as soon as 2029 (assuming current emissions levels continue). Exceeding this limit makes crossing planetary tipping points more likely, including collapses of ice sheets, ocean currents, coral reefs and permafrost, threatening the lives and livelihoods of billions of people.\n\nSolar panels in Indonesia.

If these measures are conducted simultaneously and at scale to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and negative emissions thereafter, only then can global warming be limited to a 1.5 °C increase or remain close to it2. This year offers a unique chance to act, because countries are required to update their declared national emissions-reduction contributions to the Paris agreement during 2025.\n\nHere, we call on nations to find an immediate solution. Taking inspiration from the idea of ‘climate clubs’ — agreements among economically self-interested nations to cut emissions through aligned policies — we propose that coalitions of willing HICs form ‘climate finance clubs’ in their own self interests3. These clubs would finance decarbonization in LMICs, sidestepping the need for a global agreement, which inevitably results in a watered-down deal.\n\nBenefits for all\n\nWhy should countries want to pay others to act? It is in their own economic interests to reduce global emissions quickly — and, from the planet’s perspective, it doesn’t matter whether those emissions are emitted domestically or elsewhere.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nFor instance, in the past 6 months, climate-related damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States, floods in Valencia in Spain and wildfires in Los Angeles, California, are estimated to exceed $500 billion. That’s already more than the annual level of climate finance that HICs currently provide (around $100 billion a year) and more than they pledged at COP29 for 2035. Such costs will only escalate until global emissions are curbed.\n\nGroups of HICs must put in place the beginnings of a climate finance framework for LMICs this year. They should offer such countries grants that complement, not offset, their own rapid decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo avoid expensive and socially unacceptable climate impacts, the only thing that matters is that emissions are reduced extremely fast, globally. To be most effective, investments should be given with the highest priority to LMICs that commit in their 2025 Paris update to credible emission reductions — those that are consistent with keeping the world within 1.5 °C of pre-industrial average temperatures. Such countries can make bolder decarbonization pledges that are conditional on receiving climate finance. As recipients decarbonize their economies, they also benefit from lower exposure to domestic climate damages and air pollution, which in turn reduces their adaptation needs.\n\nAn offshore wind farm in Vietnam.Credit: Linh Pham/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThere are already coalitions of HICs willing to provide climate finance — even if the United States does not participate. For example, the European Union, along with other HICs and multilateral development banks, have offered climate finance through Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) to Indonesia ($20 billion) and Vietnam ($15 billion) — of which half was from private sources. Offers were also made to South Africa ($8.5 billion) and Senegal ($2.7 billion). Such deals can be expanded to other LMICs, especially ones that are large emitters, including Colombia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Mexico, Thailand and India, which together would quickly add up to a significant proportion of avoided emissions. But adjustments are needed to avoid shortcomings.\n\nSo far, JETPs have offered mainly loans instead of grants — in Indonesia, for example, only 2% of JETP funds were grants. Yet loans add to LMICs’ debts and don’t provide capital to catalyse private-sector investments in renewables, or give incentives for closing fossil-fuel infrastructures early. Plans to phase out coal in South Africa, for example, have stalled without sufficient grants and a clear strategy, raising concerns over energy security as well as slowing the transition.\n\nThe climate finance club needs to do things differently. First, it should offer larger sums than JETPs do now. It should give all the public funding in grant-equivalent form, and make receipt conditional on a credible implementation plan and on accountability of fossil-fuel phase-out and renewables phase-in.\n\nSolid returns\n\nTo illustrate how a climate finance club might work (focusing on phasing out and replacing fossil fuels), we have examined the economic case for a group of nations that have the financial capacity and the incentive to support LMIC decarbonization. The group excludes the United States but includes the other G7 countries as well as the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and South Korea (see Supplementary information). We also excluded China and high-income Gulf states as recipients, given their ability to finance their own transition. This reduced climate-finance needs to about $500 billion per year.",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has found possible hints of ancient life on Mars ― one of the strongest signs yet of Martian life, according to planetary scientists. Dark-rimmed ‘leopard spots’ in a rock studied by the rover last year could be the remains of Martian microbial activity, researchers said at a conference today.\n\nThe announcement comes loaded with caveats. Yes, the spots look a lot like those produced by microbes on Earth. But the spots might have formed without the help of living organisms, researchers say, even if they don’t entirely understand the chemical and physical processes on Mars that would have been at work in that case.\n\nFor now, the discovery remains a 1 on the scale of 1 to 7 for evaluating claims of extraterrestrial life1: 1 represents the detection of an intriguing signal, and 7 is a slam-dunk confirmation. Jim Green, the former chief scientist at NASA who developed the scale, says he would like researchers to make more confirming measurements to move it up another notch on the scale. Doing that would require bringing the leopard-spot rock back to Earth for analysis. A sample is sitting in Perseverance’s belly, awaiting a ride off Mars for precisely that purpose.\n\nRegardless of how things play out, the discovery is a significant entry in the history of searching for extraterrestrial life — and a test of researchers’ ability to evaluate potential biosignatures on other planets.\n\nLake-side real estate\n\nToday’s talks, given at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, were the first public presentation of a discovery that NASA teased in a July press release, which contained few scientific details. The agency’s caution comes from experience: decades ago, scientists claimed to have found signs of life in the Martian meteorite ALH84001, only for other researchers to find ways to explain the observations through geological, rather than biological, processes.\n\nThe data revealed today come from a rock in Jezero Crater, where the rover landed in 2021 to hunt for signs of Martian life. Aeons ago, the crater held a lake that could have been conducive to life. The rock formed in the channel of an ancient river that once flowed into the lake.\n\nMars rover makes epic climb to explore some of the oldest rocks in the Solar System\n\nThe rock contains dark peppery spots, which rover scientists nicknamed ‘poppy seeds’, and larger dark-rimmed blobs with lighter centres, dubbed ‘leopard spots’. Chemical analysis using the rovers’ instruments showed that the poppy seeds and the rims of the leopard spots are rich in iron and phosphorus. The centres of the leopard spots are rich in iron and sulfur, Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist at Stony Brook University in New York, told the conference.\n\nThese chemical enrichments suggest that the poppy seeds and leopard spots formed when carbon-containing ‘organic’ compounds in the rock reacted with iron and sulfate minerals. On Earth, such reactions are kicked off by microbes.",

          "abstract": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an activist against vaccination, now oversees the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public-health agencies.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nWith the epicentre of a deadly measles outbreak roughly 120 kilometres away, Katherine Wells is trying to shield her hometown from the highly contagious virus. So far, more than 250 people have fallen ill in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, and infected children who need critical care are often brought to the children’s hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where Wells is the director of public health. Each infected child brings with them the potential to spread the disease to the city’s residents.\n\nAs a result, Wells has been scrambling to expand the city’s vaccine clinics and to print flyers about measles for distribution at medical practices and day-care centres. “It’s measles 24–7,” she says. “I’m trying hard not to wear out our staff yet. This is going to be a long haul.”\n\nIt’s a scene that some US public-health researchers fear could become more common if reduced government support for vaccination leads to a surge in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases that doctors in the country now rarely see, such as measles, pertussis and rubella. An influential anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, now leads the US public-health system, which was already struggling to recoup lost trust and raise vaccination rates after the COVID-19 pandemic. If vaccination rates continue to drop, sporadic infections imported from abroad could spark a sustained domestic wildfire.\n\n“It’s pretty clear: once you back off from supporting vaccination, you’re going to have lower rates of it,” says Lauren Gardner, an engineer who models infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “It is so dangerous.”\n\nViral comeback\n\nMeasles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but sporadic outbreaks still occur when unvaccinated travellers bring the virus in from abroad. This year’s outbreak has proved deadly: in February, an unvaccinated and otherwise healthy six-year-old in Texas became the first person in a decade to die from measles in the United States. Officials are evaluating another possible measles death in New Mexico.\n\nAt least 95% of a population must be vaccinated against measles to achieve herd immunity, whereby enough of a population is immune that a disease will not spread. In the United States, the level dropped just below that, to 93% during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has yet to recover. Measles is one of the most infectious human diseases, meaning that even a slight dip in vaccine coverage can make a big difference, says Ashley Gromis, a social epidemiologist at the RAND Corporation, a think tank in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPublic-health researchers worry that officials in the administration of US President Donald Trump will dial back vaccination efforts in the country.Credit: Bob Daemmrich/ZUMA Press Wire/Alamy\n\nThe 95% vaccination goal also assumes that unvaccinated individuals are evenly distributed throughout the population, she says. In practice, that is rarely the case. In Texas, about 94% of children entering kindergarten are vaccinated against measles. But in the region where the current outbreak began, only 82% are. “These pockets in which you have lots of susceptible individuals helps disease start circulating,” says Gromis.\n\nSuch numbers mean the United States is now “dangerously close” to losing ‘elimination’ status for measles, says Margaret Doll, an epidemiologist at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York. Given that prospect, it is particularly important for public-health officials to promote vaccines, she says. “You would like that message to be supported by our leading health authorities.”\n\nSystem in chaos\n\nYet the opposite seems to be happening. During US President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office, his administration pledged to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization and to drastically cut the US Agency for International Development. Both moves will mean more cases of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases occurring around the world, says Amy Winter, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. “That rise in global cases will put increased pressure on the US vaccination system,” she says.\n\nAnd that system has already been weakened: the Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nation’s main public-health agency, and put a long-time opponent of vaccines in charge of the department that oversees it. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not alter current vaccine policy, but in the weeks since he took office on 13 February, the CDC has postponed a meeting of its vaccine advisers, and Kennedy has said that he will investigate the recommended childhood vaccination schedule.\n\nWhat Trump’s election win could mean for AI, climate and health\n\nThe CDC reportedly plans to investigate whether vaccines cause autism — an idea that has been widely discredited. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said: “The rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening.”\n\nKennedy’s response to the Texas measles outbreak also has some public-health experts on edge. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly said that he is not opposed to vaccination. And after initially downplaying the severity of the outbreak during a cabinet meeting, Kennedy issued a statement acknowledging the importance of vaccination in preventing measles.\n\nBut he also emphasized good nutrition and treatment with vitamin A as ways to reduce measles severity. In an interview on 4 March, he praised the benefits of cod liver oil.\n\nThis has fuelled confusion in Texas, where public-health officials are hearing stories of parents giving unvaccinated children vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses, rather than getting them vaccinated. “I personally am very concerned,” says Philip Huang, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. “These confusing messages are not helpful.” The US DHHS did not respond to a request for comment about Kennedy’s remarks on nutrition and vitamin A, or about worries of future outbreaks of disease.\n\nMixed messaging",

          "authors": "Niles Eldredge",
          "abstract": "Credit: Yale Univ.\n\nElisabeth Vrba’s meticulous studies of fossil and living mammals challenged the conventional view of evolution. Instead of a process of slow, continuous adaptive changes driven by natural selection, she linked episodes of rapid species extinction and formation to cataclysmic events in the environment. She is best known as a rigorous and creative contributor to the development of macroevolutionary theory — the origin and evolutionary fates of species and higher groups. She has died aged 82.\n\nVrba was born in Hamburg, Germany. After the death of her father, her family moved to a sheep farm in South West Africa (now Namibia) in 1944. She received her PhD in zoology and palaeontology at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in 1974, with her research focusing on fossil bovids. In 1969, she began working at the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria, rising to be its deputy director from 1977 to 1986.\n\nVrba exploded onto the scientific world stage at a macroevolution meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in 1980. Until then, she was mostly unknown to US palaeontologists. A draft of her provocative paper on how life evolved (E. S. Vrba S. Afr. J. Sci. 76, 61–84; 1980), which was sent to me and at least one other researcher in the United States, prompted me — as a co-organizer — to invite her to speak. As she put it, she was “armed with the brand of punctuated equilibria here espoused”.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibria had been proposed by me and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972. We argued that most species in the fossil record remain unchanged for long periods, with occasional branching events involving rapid change during which new species evolve.\n\nVrba found a way to squeeze insight from the barren lines of phylogenetic diagrams into our understanding of evolutionary processes. Focusing on fossil antelopes, she contrasted two evolutionary lineages. One, impalas, has had only two species in the past six million years, since the Miocene. The other, wildebeests, hartebeests and others, has contained at least 27 species in the same time span.\n\nEstella Bergere Leopold (1927–2024), passionate environmentalist who traced changing ecosystems\n\nImpalas exploit a wide range of ecological conditions, whereas the wildebeest lineage contains numerous grassland specialists. Vrba argued that the width of the niche that a species can occupy drives rates of both speciation and extinction, with the environment being the main force underlying this evolution. Her ‘effect hypothesis’ proposed that apparent directional trends in evolution are accumulations of increasing specialization inside lineages of narrow-niched species — a phenomenon she later referred to as species sorting — and are not necessarily manifestations of species selection.\n\nBy the time she addressed the macroevolution meeting, the conference had developed into a referendum on punctuated equilibria — and she quickly became the star of the show. The science writer Roger Lewin highlighted her work, including two figures from her 1980 paper, along with an image of Charles Darwin, as illustrative aids in his five-page review of the event in Science (R. Lewin Science 210, 883–887; 1980), which he described as “one of the most important conferences on evolutionary biology for more than 30 years”.\n\n‘Exaptation’ is another original Vrba concept. An exaptation is a trait that has been co-opted to serve an extra function unrelated to that for which it originally evolved. For example, the wings of the African black heron (Egretta ardesiaca) are used not only for flight, but also to form an umbrella, casting a shadow over shallow water, where fish tend to congregate and be easy prey. The concept has captured the imaginations of many evolutionary biologists.",

Using the model, machines can perform some tasks — such as ‘slam dunking’ a miniature basketball through a desktop hoop — despite never having watched another robot do the action, says the firm.\n\nThe company is among several working to harness the artificial intelligence (AI) advances that power chatbots to create general-purpose robots. The approach also comes with safety concerns, given such models’ propensity to generate wrong and harmful outputs.\n\nThe hope is to create machines that are intuitive to operate and can tackle a range of physical tasks, without relying on human supervision or being preprogrammed. By connecting to Gemini’s robotic models, a developer could enhance their robot so that it comprehends “natural language and now understands the physical world in a lot more detail than before,” says Carolina Parada, who leads the Google DeepMind robotics team and is based in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThe model known as Gemini Robotics — announced on 12 March in a blog post and technical paper — is “a small but tangible step” towards that goal, says Alexander Khazatsky, an AI researcher and co-founder of CollectedAI in Berkeley, California, which is focused on creating data sets to develop AI-powered robots.\n\nSpatial awareness\n\nA team at Google DeepMind, which is headquartered in London, started with Gemini 2.0, the firm’s most advanced vision and language model, trained by analysing patterns in huge volumes of data.\n\nThey created a specialized version of the model designed to excel at reasoning tasks involving 3D physical and spatial understanding — for example, predicting an object’s trajectory or identifying the same part of an object in images taken from different angles.\n\nFinally, they further trained the model on data from thousands of hours of real, remote-operated robot demonstrations. This allowed the robotic ‘brain’ to implement real actions, much in the way LLMs use their learned associations to generate the next word in a sentence.\n\nThe team tested Gemini Robotics on humanoid robots and robotic arms, on tasks that came up in training and on unfamiliar activities. According to the team, robots using the model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art rivals when tested on new tasks and familiar ones in which details had been changed.\n\nFolding origami",

Investigating this phenomenon could provide us with crucial knowledge about the evolution of the Solar System.\n\nThe discoveries bring Saturn’s total moon count to 274, nearly triple Jupiter’s and more than the total number of known moons around the other planets.\n\n“Saturn is the king of the moons,” says Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, whose observations provided a starting point for the finding.\n\nThe discovery is “fascinating”, says Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada, who also contributed observations that led to the finding but did not contribute to the forthcoming paper about them. “It just shows how much is out there.”\n\nMany moons\n\nThe moons, which were officially recognized this week by the International Astronomical Union, will be described in a paper led by astronomer Edward Ashton at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taipei, Taiwan. The study will be published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. Unlike our own Moon, which is 3,475 kilometres wide, these small rocks are just a few kilometres across in size. They swing around Saturn in chaotic, distant orbits, often moving in reverse relative to the planet’s major moons, such as Titan and Rhea.\n\nThe moon that made Saturn a pushover\n\nMost of the moons are new discoveries, but observations by Sheppard two decades ago hinted at their existence. From 2004 to 2007, he used the 8.2-metre Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii to examine patches of space near Saturn and detected faint light from these small, irregular moons. However, many couldn’t be confirmed as moons because their orbits could not be definitively tracked.\n\nAshton was able to revisit those findings thanks to advancements in discovery techniques and the allocation of more telescope time. From 2019 to 2021, using the 3.6-metre Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Ashton confirmed 62 new moons of Saturn by stitching together the telescope’s images to more easily see the faint moons. In 2023, he had more time on the telescope, leading to the latest 128-moon haul.\n\nSaturn’s movements also helped: from our perspective on Earth, the planet has moved out of alignment with the dense star field near the centre of the Milky Way, reducing the number of background stars in our line of sight that could masquerade as moons.\n\nClusters of satellites",

          "title": "Fresh ‘quantum advantage’ claim made by computing firm D-Wave",
          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "A ‘quantum processor’ has solved a physics problem on the behaviour of magnetism in certain solids that would take the largest conventional supercomputers hundreds of thousands of years to calculate. The result is the latest claim of a machine showing ‘quantum advantage’ over classical computers.\n\nAlthough Google, headquartered in Mountain View, California, and others have claimed to have achieved quantum advantage — most recently with the Sycamore chip that Google unveiled in December — researchers at D-Wave, a company in Palo Alto, California, say that their result, published in Science1, is the first that solves an actual physics question. “We believe it’s the first time anyone has done it on a problem of scientific interest,” says D-Wave physicist Andrew King.\n\nThe team did great work — but classical computing should not be counted out quite yet, says Miles Stoudenmire, a researcher at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York City. “We’re still in the race.”\n\nThe result also validates the approach that the company has taken to quantum computing, King says. Rather than building a ‘universal’ quantum computer — one that could run any quantum algorithm — D-Wave has limited its approach to performing certain calculations, which is easier to scale.\n\nAn early pioneer in the quantum field, D-Wave machines have long led the industry in terms of number of qubits, the quantum equivalent of classical bits of information. The latest processor has thousands of qubits. “These are results of 25 years of hardware development and research at D-Wave,” says Mohammad Amin, a physicist at the company.\n\nMagnetic problem\n\nThe problem solved by D-Wave concerns the theory of magnetism, a large field of theoretical physics. The electron spins of each atom act like magnetic needles, and the way they orient themselves inside a solid in response to their neighbours’ orientations has long provided a prototype for the study of complex systems.\n\nIn a typical permanent magnet, the spins all align in the same direction. But in general materials, neighbouring spins have conflicting influences on each other, and stable arrangements either don’t exist or are extremely difficult to predict. Quantum effects add complications.\n\nKing, Amin and their collaborators at D-Wave and several academic laboratories used the latest D-Wave machine, called Advantage2, to simulate the arrangements of spins in several 3D crystal structures. They studied a specific problem in which the temperature of the material starts at absolute zero, and quantum fluctuations let it transition from one state to another. They estimate that their machine achieved the result exponentially faster than any classical calculation could.\n\nAdvantage claims challenged\n\nThe result follows several claims of quantum advantage. Google made the first claim of a quantum advantage in a paper that caused a sensation in 20192. It used a fully programmable, or universal, quantum computer with superconducting qubits to perform a calculation that was designed to test for quantum advantage but had no practical application. Soon, IBM, headquartered in Armonk, New York, and other companies showed that by improving classical techniques, they could still run the same calculations on ordinary computers.\n\nIBM then achieved3a quantum advantage on a useful application in 2023. But last year, that claim suffered a similar fate to Google’s4: Stoudenmire and his collaborators showed their classical algorithms could solve the problem as quickly.",

          "title": "Four ways COVID changed virology: lessons from the most sequenced virus of all time",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "Kei Sato was looking for his next big challenge five years ago when it smacked him — and the world — in the face. The virologist had recently started an independent group at the University of Tokyo and was trying to carve out a niche in the crowded field of HIV research. “I thought, ‘What can I do for the next 20 or 30 years?’”\n\nHe found an answer in SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, that was rapidly spreading around the world. In March 2020, as rumours swirled that Tokyo might face a lockdown that would stop research activities, Sato and five students decamped to a former adviser’s laboratory in Kyoto. There, they began studying a viral protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to quell the body’s earliest immune responses. Sato soon established a consortium of researchers that would go on to publish at least 50 studies on the virus.\n\nIn just five years, SARS-CoV-2 became one of the most closely examined viruses on the planet. Researchers have published about 150,000 research articles about it, according to the citation database Scopus. That’s roughly three times the number of papers published on HIV in the same period. Scientists have also generated more than 17 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences so far, more than for any other organism. This has given an unparalleled view into the ways in which the virus changed as infections spread. “There was an opportunity to see a pandemic in real time in much higher resolution than has ever been achievable before,” says Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute, near Woking, UK.\n\nNow, with the emergency phase of the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, virologists are taking stock of what can be learnt about a virus in such a short amount of time, including its evolution and its interactions with human hosts. Here are four lessons from the pandemic that some say could empower the global response to future pandemics — but only if scientific and public-health institutions are in place to use them.\n\nViral sequences tell stories\n\nOn 11 January 2020, Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney, Australia, shared what most scientists consider to be the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence to a virology discussion board; he had received the data from virologist Zhang Yongzhen in China.\n\nBy the year’s end, scientists had submitted more than 300,000 sequences to a repository known as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The rate of data collection only got faster from there as troubling variants of the virus took hold. Some countries ploughed enormous resources into sequencing SARS-CoV-2: between them, the United Kingdom and the United States contributed more than 8.5 million (see ‘Viral genome rally’). Meanwhile, scientists in other countries, including South Africa, India and Brazil, showed that efficient surveillance can spot worrying variants in lower-resource settings.\n\nSource: GISAID\n\nIn earlier epidemics, such as the 2013–16 West African Ebola outbreak, sequencing data came in too slowly to track how the virus was changing as infections spread. But it quickly became clear that SARS-CoV-2 sequences would arrive at an unprecedented volume and pace, says Emma Hodcroft, a genomic epidemiologist at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel. She works on an effort called Nextstrain, which uses genome data to track viruses, such as influenza, to better understand their spread. “We had developed so many of these methods that, in theory, could have been very useful,” Hodcroft says. “And all of a sudden, in 2020, we had an opportunity to put up and show up.”\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nInitially, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data were used to trace the spread of the virus at its epicentre in Wuhan, China, and then globally. This answered key early questions — such as whether the virus spread largely between people or from the same animal sources to humans. The data revealed the geographical routes through which the virus travelled, and showed them much more quickly than could conventional epidemiological investigations. Later, faster-transmitting variants of the virus started appearing, and sent sequencing labs into hyperdrive. A global collective of scientists and amateur variant trackers trawled through the sequence data constantly in search of worrying viral changes.\n\n“It became possible to track the evolution of this virus in tremendous detail to see exactly what was changing,” says Jesse Bloom, a viral evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. With millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hand, researchers can now go back and study them to understand the constraints on the virus’s evolution. “That’s something we’ve never been able to do before,” says Hodcroft.\n\nViruses change more than expected\n\nBecause no one had ever studied SARS-CoV-2 before, scientists came with their own assumptions about how it would adapt. Many were guided by experiences with another RNA virus that causes respiratory infections: influenza. “We just didn’t have much information about other respiratory viruses that could cause pandemics,” says Hodcroft.\n\nInfluenza spreads mainly through the acquisition of mutations that allow it to evade people’s immunity. Because no one had ever been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before 2019, many scientists didn’t expect to see much viral change until after there was substantial pressure placed on it by people’s immune systems, either through infections or better yet, vaccination.\n\nThe emergence of faster-transmitting, deadlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Alpha and Delta, obliterated some early assumptions. Even by early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had picked up a single amino-acid change that substantially boosted its spread. Many others would follow.\n\nWhat sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs\n\n“What I got wrong and didn’t anticipate was quite how much it would change phenotypically,” says Holmes. “You saw this amazing acceleration in transmissibility and virulence.” This suggested that SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t especially well adapted to spreading between people when it emerged in Wuhan, a city of millions. It could very well have fizzled out in a less densely populated setting, he adds.\n\nHolmes wonders, also, whether the breakneck pace of observed change was merely a product of how closely SARS-CoV-2 was tracked. Would researchers see the same rate if they watched the emergence of an influenza strain that was new to the population, at the same resolution? That remains to be determined.\n\nThe initial giant leaps that SARS-CoV-2 took came with one saving grace: they didn’t drastically affect the protective immunity delivered by vaccines and previous infections. But that changed with the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, which was laden with changes to its ‘spike’ protein that helped it to dodge antibody responses (the spike protein allows the virus to enter host cells). Scientists such as Bloom have been taken aback at how rapidly these changes appeared in successive post-Omicron variants.\n\nHow months-long COVID infections could seed dangerous new variants\n\nAnd that wasn’t even the most surprising aspect of Omicron, says Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Shortly after the variant emerged, his team1 and others noticed that, unlike previous SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Delta that favoured the lower-airway cells of the lung, Omicron preferred to infect the upper airways. “To document that a virus shifted its biological behaviour during the course of a pandemic was unprecedented,” says Gupta.\n\nOmicron’s preference for upper airways probably contributed to its clinical mildness — its relatively low virulence — compared with previous iterations. But that shift is hard to disentangle from the fact that Omicron struck after much of the world had begun to establish some immunity, says Bloom, and there is evidence2 that Omicron was just as nasty as the version of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan.\n\nAnd although Omicron and its offshoots were milder than Alpha, Beta and Delta, those had all proved more virulent than the lineage they replaced, toppling the idea that the virus would evolve to be less deadly. “The idea that there’s some law of nature that says that a virus is going to rapidly lose its virulence when it jumps into a new host is incorrect,” Bloom says. It’s an idea that never had much buy-in with virologists anyway.\n\nOne of Sato’s big fears is that a drastically different SARS-CoV-2 variant will emerge and overcome the immunity that stops most people becoming severely ill. He worries that the result could be disastrous.\n\nChronic cases could reveal insights\n\nBefore Gupta turned his attention to SARS-CoV-2, his focus was HIV, which is ordinarily a lifelong infection. As a clinician, he had treated the second person ever cured of HIV through a blood stem-cell transplant. But his research group studied how antiretroviral drug resistance evolves over the course of months and years in people.\n\nMost scientists presumed that, unlike HIV or other long-term infections, respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 were acute, and those who survived their infections cleared the virus in a matter of days. Longer-term infections occur in influenza, but they seem to be an evolutionary dead end. The virus adapts to survive in the host, not to spread to others.\n\nScientists in New Delhi prepare coronavirus samples for sequencing.Credit: T. Narayan/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBut in late 2020, Gupta characterized a 102-day SARS-CoV-2 infection in a man in his 70s with a compromised immune system. The infection was ultimately fatal3. In the man’s body, the virus developed a high number of spike-protein changes. Many of these would also be observed in worrying variants, including the Alpha variant that sent case counts rocketing and prompted another wave of lockdowns in late 2020 and early 2021.\n\nThe man’s case didn’t give rise to any widespread variant, but it gave Gupta, with his HIV evolution background, the idea that chronic infections could be a source of the drastic evolutionary leaps that characterized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. “We didn’t have the preconceptions the flu field had of what respiratory viruses do,” he says.\n\nAlex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, had a similar idea when another variant, called Beta, was identified in his country. South Africa has a high rate of HIV infections — many of which go untreated — and Sigal wondered whether it was more than a coincidence that Beta seemed to have emerged where there were high numbers of people who were immunocompromised.",

          "authors": "Nikki Forrester",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI’m a scientist based in the United Kingdom. A few years ago, I was verbally encouraged to organize an international conference by staff at a university. At the time, I wasn’t employed at the university or elsewhere in a full-time position, but I’d like to work there in the future. I agreed to the request because the staff suggested it would raise their group’s profile and also help to set me apart in future job applications. I asked repeatedly to be compensated for my conference efforts, and had to wait a long time for the institution’s ambiguous responses. I also could not easily pull out of my commitment to host the event, because it would have negatively affected the attendees and required me to pay a significant cancellation fee.\n\nMy request for compensation was eventually declined, but only after I had delivered the conference. I calculate my efforts to be the equivalent of nearly two years of full-time work. I feel embarrassed, pained and stuck. How can an institution be made to pay? And how can I prevent this situation from happening again? — A distressed scientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s Careers team reached out to two researchers and an employment lawyer for advice.\n\n“This story has all the hallmarks of uncompensated labour done by faculty” members, says Hava Rachel Gordon, a sociologist at the University of Denver in Colorado. “It happens all the time, whether they belong to an institution or are doing work for another institution.”\n\nGordon notes that academics often view themselves as passionate scholars, scientists and teachers. “We don’t often think of ourselves as workers,” she says. “And the problem is, then we are easily taken advantage of.”\n\nAll the sources noted that one of the challenges of working in academia is defining what the job itself entails. Along with research, teaching and service, many faculty members engage in mentorship, public outreach, administrative work and other tasks. Some of this work is paid, but compensation for other labour, such as reviewing grant proposals or giving conference presentations, might take the form of increased stature in the field or enhanced job prospects.\n\nHowever, there is also uncompensated or invisible labour, which is neither rewarded nor recognized in merit reviews1.\n\nStudies have found that women and faculty members of colour spend more time on campus service, diversity-related service, student advising and teaching than do their male and white peers, and this can delay career progression by taking time away from research2,3.\n\nThe time tax put on scientists of colour\n\n“A lot of these requests are done informally without contracts, sometimes without even a paper trail. We call it a hallway ask,” says Gordon, referring to a 2018 article by KerryAnn O’Meara, a higher-education researcher at Columbia University in New York City, describing how the most agreeable and productive faculty members are often stopped in corridors and asked to take on various service tasks.\n\nGordon emphasizes that she understands why the distressed scientist agreed to organize this conference, but notes that it’s difficult to demand payment without a contract in place.\n\n“I think the real problem here is that the parties didn’t make an arrangement ahead of time,” says David Belfort, founding partner of the employment-law firm Bennett & Belfort in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The scientist needs to put their foot down and tell the institution that they’re willing to do the work, but that it needs to be compensated, because they can’t work for free for two years with the expectation that they’re going to get a job offer out of it.”\n\nBelfort acknowledges that the situation is tricky, given that conference organizing is often voluntary, ancillary work conducted by individuals who are paid, full-time employees at universities. “The odd thing here is that if they had received an offer of a position at this institution, they likely would be content. However, there is no quid pro quo — the institution is not required to offer any role going forward — but they may be entitled to back pay for their work.” For instance, if the distressed scientist had carried out this work in certain US jurisdictions, Belfort says, they could claim a violation of state-minimum-wage laws.",

Ornithologists at Tel Aviv University in Israel have continued to meet online with their counterparts in Jordan, the Palestinian territories and European countries to study the potential for barn owls (Tyto alba) to reduce pesticide use in agriculture.\n\nThe project enlists the owls to devour crop-eating rodents instead of relying on farmers using toxic rodenticides to control populations. In January, shortly after a ceasefire was signed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, researchers from 13 countries gathered in Greece. Their mission was both to discuss how to expand the use of barn owls for biological control and to promote the project as an example of research collaboration to promote peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe ceasefire’s first 42-day phase ended officially on 1 March. Talks between various parties have resumed in Doha, Qatar, but huge uncertainty hovers over what will happen next, including whether the ceasefire will endure. Despite opposition from many countries, Israel’s government is currently blocking food and fuel from entering Gaza. It has also stopped supplying electricity to Gaza’s main desalination plant, aiming to pressure Hamas into extending the ceasefire’s first phase.\n\nOrnithologist Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University says he is committed to pursuing collaborations.Credit: Menaham Kahana/AFP/Getty\n\n“I’m not naive,” says Yossi Leshem, the project’s founder and an ornithologist at Tel Aviv University. “The ceasefire is very fragile. I hope [it] will continue permanently, but the situation is still very sensitive.”\n\nLeshem and other Israeli scientists tell Nature that they are committed to continuing their research and pursuing collaborations. Among them is David Lehrer, director of the Center for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, based in Ketura in the south of Israel.\n\nLehrer is coordinating an effort with the Palestinian non-profit organization Damour for Community Development, which has offices in both Gaza and the West Bank. In January, 60 Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli experts met in Athens to discuss how to solve the Middle East’s water, energy, food-security and overall environmental problems. Last week, the group announced further studies into seven project ideas. One is to create an artificial structure from the rubble of destroyed buildings. The structure would house solar energy or water desalination infrastructure.\n\n“Seventy per cent of the buildings in Gaza and almost all infrastructure has been destroyed due to the war,” Lehrer says. As of now, “the rubble constitutes a major environmental and humanitarian threat, due to chemicals released as buildings were destroyed and the large amount of unexploded ordinance mixed in with the rubble”, he adds.\n\nAny project to reconstitute it “will require major coordination between Israel and Palestine and can only be achieved if all sides, including the international community, are fully on board”.\n\nCoexistence amid boycotts\n\nAfter the 7 October 2023 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, the country conducted intense, deadly air strikes on Gaza’s populated areas for 15 months. For most of that time Israel was also at war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nSome universities in Europe have suspended institution-level ties with universities in Israel. For example, the Council of Rectors of French-speaking universities of Belgium, said in a statement in January that it commits to suspending institutional collaborations with organizations, regardless of their origin, that repeatedly support or are directly involved in violations of international law and human rights.\n\n“People in the Middle East have common issues,” says Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel.Credit: Medhat Zioud\n\nIn an open letter published last May, some 185 researchers and university administrators from Gaza wrote: “We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the national and international institutions that have stood in solidarity with us, providing support and assistance during these challenging times. However, we stress the importance of coordinating these efforts to effectively reopen Palestinian universities in Gaza.”\n\nNeurobiologist Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel, opposes boycotts of Israel’s universities. “Academia is an opportunity to share knowledge and do research in complete freedom,” says Maroun who is an Arab–Israeli citizen. “People in the Middle East have common issues, more than factors that can differentiate and discriminate between us.”\n\nTamir Sheafer, rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, agrees. “Israeli academia is independent of the government,” he says. “At the Hebrew University, 20% of our students are Arab–Palestinian, including thousands of students from East Jerusalem. We maintained our coexistence here on campus during the whole war.”\n\nIn February, Israel’s Association of University Heads issued a report that recorded almost 500 complaints by Israeli researchers of boycotts by overseas institutions and professional academic associations. Researchers reported rejection of papers, disruption to lectures, avoidance of peer review, difficulties in obtaining funding and “a demand from Israelis to declare anti-Israeli intentions as a condition for continued participation in a conference”.\n\nSome international academics are refusing peer-review requests from Israeli researchers because of the war, according to the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), the country’s main research-funding agency, although such refusals are relatively uncommon, says Tamar Jaffe-Mittwoch, the director-general of the ISF, based in Jerusalem.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nIn 2024, the ISF approached around 22,000 mostly international researchers for 6,600 grant-reviewer positions. “We were very concerned,” says physicist Daniel Zajfman, who chairs the ISF’s academic board. “We thought, ‘no one wants to look at Israeli science’,” he adds. Of these, around 170 potential reviewers declined to review applications, explicitly citing political reasons — some doing so politely, says Zajfman, and some not so politely, says Jaffe-Mittwoch.\n\nScholarship goes on\n\nAlthough military service in Israel is compulsory for most adult citizens, the war has not reduced the country’s scientific output, according to ISF data. In 2024, grant applications increased by 10% from the roughly 2,500 applications received annually in previous years. Zajfman thinks that this increase can partly be attributed to the determination of scientists to continue with their scholarship. “The feeling is we cannot allow these events, this war, to affect what we are doing now,” he says.\n\nResearchers in these regions hope that collaborative efforts will continue.Credit: Christophe Gateau/dpa/Alamy",

Press (2025)\n\nI had the privilege of hearing climate scientist Mike Berners-Lee talk about his latest book before it was published. To a packed lecture theatre, he laid out his thesis: an increase in truthfulness is more important than technological advances as a solution to climate change and the related threats facing humanity.\n\nI could not stop thinking about this proposition. Was it really that simple, or was the author being unforgivably naive? What would the book have to say about the strange times we currently live in, variously described as post-truth1 and the age of misinformation2? I went out of my way to get my hands on an advance copy — it was a compelling read.\n\nHow scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope\n\nThe first chapter lays out a clear-eyed and data-rich description of the polycrisis we find ourselves in. Berners-Lee takes us through the interlinked issues of climate, energy, population, food, biodiversity, pollution and disease. He sugar-coats nothing.\n\nThe book firmly pushes back on those who argue that we are making progress on climate change. It presents what science tells us we can expect with the temperature rises that are already baked in: collapsing crop yields, worsening fires and more floods. With emissions continuing to increase year on year, we are still accelerating into the problem rather than putting on the brakes.\n\nTechnology isn’t enough\n\nHow can this view of climate change be reconciled with the techno-optimist view that innovation is delivering sustained improvements for most people on our shared planet, and will solve our environmental problems, too?\n\nBerners-Lee refers to techno-optimism as “the new face of climate denial”. He argues that, although we have the technical advances needed to tackle the polycrisis, these alone will never be enough. A good example is how efficiency gains tend to increase, rather than reduce, consumption. This well-understood ‘rebound effect’ is also known as Jevons paradox, after a nineteenth-century industrialist who noticed that more-efficient use of coal led to increased demand. A green transition requires that renewable energy replace fossil fuels rather than supplementing them. This is not happening.\n\nWildfires are expected to increase in severity and frequency owing to climate change.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty\n\nDespite Berners-Lee’s rhetoric, he shares a lot of ground with data scientist Hannah Ritchie, whose excellent book Not the End of the World (2024) takes a techno-optimist position. They both think that a sufficiently high global carbon price is crucial for incentivizing a reduction in fossil-fuel use. And they both agree that we need a mechanism, such as cap and trade, to ensure that the poorest are not disadvantaged. Berners-Lee puts more emphasis on how to get there.\n\nHigh price of deceit\n\nHis book peels back the outer layer of the polycrisis to discuss the drastic changes needed in equality, education, the media, politics, the economy and law. The argument is that living well in the Anthropocene — in which the physical limits to growth are undeniable — demands drastic changes to how society operates, but that the decisions needed will be made only if voters’ understanding isn’t obscured by deceit.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the polycrisis. Berners-Lee highlights three intersecting values needed for humanity to thrive in the Anthropocene: respect for the environment, respect for others and respect for the truth. The final few chapters focus on the most crucial lever: truth.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nThe book presents a typology of deception. Outright lies are just the tip of the iceberg, with more-hidden forms such as misdirection, burying bad news and false impressions potentially doing just as much damage. He talks about how “enticing bullshit” propagates: sometimes owing to self-interested cynicism, but often owing to simply to wishful or uncritical thinking.",

          "abstract": "Stone Age people might have crossed the Mediterranean on wooden canoes, navigating from island to island by sight.Credit: Sheila Terry/Science Photo Library\n\nThousands of years before Odysseus crossed the ‘wine-dark sea’ in Homer’s epic poem The Odyssey, hunter-gatherers might have island-hopped their way to Africa across the Mediterranean.\n\nThe first genomic study of ancient people from the eastern Maghreb region — present-day Tunisia and northeastern Algeria — shows that Stone Age populations who lived there more than 8,000 years ago were descended, in part, from European hunter-gatherers.\n\nThe discovery, reported on 12 March in Nature1, is the first direct evidence of trans-Mediterranean sea voyaging during this time, although archaeological finds have hinted at cultural exchange between European and North African hunter-gatherers.\n\nUsing ancient genomes, researchers have mapped the emergence of agriculture in the Middle East 12,000 years ago and its spread to Europe, but the southern Mediterranean has been largely neglected.\n\n“There’s not been much of a North African story,” says David Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who co-led the study. “It was a huge hole.”\n\nCrossing from Europe\n\nWorking with researchers in Algeria and Tunisia, as well as Europe, Reich’s team sequenced DNA from the bones or teeth of 9 individuals from eastern Maghreb archaeological sites, who lived between 6,000 and more than 10,000 years ago.\n\nAn archaeological dig site at Doukanet el Khoutifa, Tunisia, in the eastern Maghreb region.Credit: Giulio Lucarini\n\nAll carried local hunter-gatherer ancestry, similar to that of ancient people from what is now Morocco, identified in earlier studies2,3. But unlike those western Maghreb hunter-gatherers — whose ancestry was largely replaced by European farmers probably arriving through the Strait of Gibraltar — local ancestry persisted in Tunisia and Algeria long after the arrival of farmers from Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThis fits with evidence that people in the eastern Maghreb continued to hunt local animals such as land snails and forage wild plants, even while farming imported sheep, goats and cattle. Agriculture didn’t take off in the region until much later. Maybe, says Reich, the resilience of local ancestry is related to resistance to farming practices.\n\nThe genome of a man from a Tunisian site called Djebba held a major surprise: about 6% of his DNA could be traced back to European hunter-gatherers. The researchers estimate that his Maghrebi ancestors mixed with European hunter-gatherers around 8,500 years ago. There are weaker signs of these encounters in a woman from the site.\n\nCanoe voyages",

          "abstract": "Credit: OsakaWayne Studios/Getty\n\nA website has become a requirement for research laboratories and their principal investigators. Beyond just listing research outputs, they give us the opportunity to explain the scope and mission of our work, offer prospective lab members a sense of what the culture is like and showcase the career paths of former members. These websites are also used by journals to identify potential reviewers, authors and conference speakers.\n\nIn 2023, I began my career as a biologist at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland. After a year of acclimatizing to my new role and the courses I would be teaching, I started up my research lab. We study the roles of microRNAs in regulating cell differentiation, development and disease.\n\nBecause I work at a mainly undergraduate institution, all of the researchers in my lab are full-time students. Although this presents unique challenges, it is an incredibly rewarding opportunity: I get to mentor and guide aspiring scientists at the beginning of their careers. While I was building my lab’s website, I sought to not only publicize our research, but also create a resource for students and trainees both inside and outside the lab.\n\nThere are many wonderful resources with tips and examples for crafting a website that creates a great first impression. Below are a few examples of resources I have built into my lab’s website. Although these can no doubt be found elsewhere, I’ve curated those that are most relevant to our research and the career stage of our lab members.\n\nFunding\n\nFinding a funding agency or opportunity that aligns with your research can be challenging, especially for early-career researchers. To make this process easier, I’ve compiled a list of relevant funding sources that students and trainees can apply for. Because the members of my lab are fee-paying students, the opportunities on the list also include sources of financial aid.\n\nI also plan to include the names of lab members who have successfully applied for specific opportunities, so future lab members can reach out to them directly for advice.\n\nConferences\n\nScientific conferences are perhaps as numerous as funding opportunities. However, just as with funding, not every conference is a good fit for your field or career interests.\n\nI’ve compiled a list of conferences that I have attended or heard about that I feel the members of my lab would find valuable. The list includes relevant funding opportunities, such as travel awards. These conferences might focus on a topic that our research is aligned with, or be designed for the professional development of trainees at earlier career stages.\n\nProfessional societies\n\nProfessional societies are an incredible way to network and form relationships with people with similar scientific and career interests. Over time, I have developed a sense of which societies are most aligned with the goals and interests of my lab.\n\nA research building at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland.Credit: Mount St. Mary’s University\n\nFor example, our work studying RNA biology, with a previous focus in neuroscience, fits well with the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) in Rockville, Maryland; the RNA Society in Raleigh, North Carolina; and the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) in Washington DC, which have been incredibly useful for my own training and professional development. Compiling a list of these societies helps my current and future lab members know how to get involved with the broader scientific community outside the lab.\n\nIf local branches exist for these professional societies (such as the student chapter of ASBMB on our campus and the DC Metro Area chapter of SfN), I include their information, because this can be a great way for students and trainees to gain leadership experience.\n\nEducation and professional-development resources\n\nOver the course of my career, I have discovered many useful professional-development resources. Rather than trying to remember each one, or saving them on my own computer where nobody else can access them, I have added my favourite resources and advice to the website. Because computational biology is a large component of our lab’s work, many of the resources are related to data analysis and programming languages, such as free courses and textbooks. I also include my own examples, such as my CV, posters or slide decks from past talks, and educational materials (including a podcast).",

          "abstract": "Pictured (left to right) Rafiou Agoro, Justin Hounkpevi, Tchilabalo Parobali, Dzifa AhiatrogahCredit: Rafiou Agoro\n\nIn April 2018, during my second year of a postdoctoral fellowship at New York University, I and my colleagues submitted an abstract to the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), which was holding its annual meeting that September in Montreal, Canada.\n\nAs a citizen of Togo with limited experience of international conference travel, I saw the chance to attend this three-day meeting as an important career-development opportunity, enabling me to share scientific discoveries, learn from others and get updates on emerging technologies.\n\nBut unlike my colleagues from Europe, and despite us all having similar professional titles and immigration statuses in the United States, I needed a Canadian visa to attend. That’s because documentation requirements were more stringent for citizens of African countries than for applicants from elsewhere.\n\nI identified a private company that provided visa services for the Canadian government, and six weeks before the conference I took a half-day’s leave to attend an appointment and paid Can$185 (then the equivalent of about US$140) to secure a passport stamp. A month later, I was given a second appointment, during which I received my passport and visa. The delay meant that registration, hotel reservations and airfares had increased in price.\n\nHow African scientists can give back to their home continent\n\nBecause most of the international meetings that welcome scientists from all over the world are held in the United States and Europe, scientists based outside these territories can find attendance particularly challenging, often requiring — as it did for me — months of paperwork to prepare.\n\nThis is especially the case for PhD students in Africa who have never travelled overseas before for work.\n\nWith this in mind, and informed by my own experiences, I partnered with Mohamed Cisse, a mathematician and computer scientist based in Guinea, to launch a travel-fellowship and mentoring programme. (Mohamed and I had already worked together to found the African Diaspora Scientists Federation (ADSF), a network of scientists who have developed their careers outside the continent.)\n\nWe approached the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in 2023 with the aim of helping an interdisciplinary group of students to attend the following year’s Cell Bio meeting, an annual event held jointly with the European Molecular Biology Organization.\n\nWe wanted to create an ADSF–ASCB fellowship programme that would enable PhD students based in Africa to present their research in-person at the four-day Cell Bio meeting in San Diego, California, in December 2024.\n\nCareer resources for African scientists\n\nWe launched the call for fellowship applications in May and received more than 50 applications in a month, choosing four applicants for the pilot programme.\n\nThey were Tchilabalo Parobali, a biosecurity engineer at the University of Lomé in Togo; poultry scientist Justin Hounkpevi, also based there; Dzifa Ahiatrogah, a biomedical scientist at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana; and Gerard Quarcoo, an aquatic microbiologist at the Water Research Institute in Tamale, Ghana.\n\nIn June, we sent letters of invitation and all the paperwork for visa applications. It then took around four months before the applicants had their visa appointments at the US embassies in their countries.\n\nSadly, Gerard’s application was unsuccessful. But by mid-November, we were able to buy plane tickets for the other three. Because travel was the following month, the $1,200 round-trip ticket was twice as expensive as it would have been if purchased months in advance. The fellowship also covered hotel charges, the cost of airport–hotel transfers and ACSB membership for 2025.\n\nCamaraderie\n\nTo create a climate of pre-meeting camaraderie, the three fellows travelled together from Accra to the US west coast, a two-day journey with stopovers in Europe and the US east coast. I was in touch throughout their travels and met them before their poster sessions to offer advice, in between my own conference preparation and attendance at sessions.\n\nI loved the practical aspects of their science, which I categorize as applied biology. Tchilabalo’s work, for example, uses a new dietary formula to increase poultry mass, which has societal benefits.\n\nListening to the three students reminded me of the importance of asking myself about the translational aspect of my own fundamental research, in which I use preclinical mouse models to pinpoint molecular mechanisms that improve the healthspan and lifespan of people with sickle-cell and kidney diseases.\n\nI met the students each day for breakfast and lunch, using the time to review their plans for the day and provide advice if needed. We also took some evening walks together, and the fellows attended two receptions at which they networked with other scientists.",

The end product was a bioplastic called poly(ester amide), or PEA, that consisted mainly of polyester with a few nylon-like amide bonds.\n\nNylon is a 100% amide-bond containing polymer, so there is still some way to go before bacteria can properly mimic this type of plastic, says Yup Lee.\n\nTesting revealed that one type of PEA had physical, thermal and mechanical properties comparable to those of polyethylene, one of the most widely used commercial plastics.\n\nBut Seiichi Taguchi, a bioproduction engineer at Kobe University in Japan, says it is unlikely the plastic would be as strong as polyethylene because of the low frequency at which the amino acids were incorporated into the polymers. And adding an amino acid to a polymer often leads to the termination of the chain, creating stunted polymers with low molecular weights, he says.\n\nCommercial potential?",

The device is used as a stopgap for people with heart failure who are waiting for a donor heart, and previous recipients of this type of artificial heart had remained in US hospitals while it was in place.\n\nThe man lived with the device for more than three months until he underwent surgery to receive a donated human heart. The man is recovering well, according to a statement from St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney in Australia, where the operations were conducted.\n\nThe Australian is the sixth person globally to receive the device, known as BiVACOR, but the first to live with it for more than a month.\n\n“This is certainly an important development in the field,” says Julian Smith, a cardiac surgeon at the Victorian Heart Institute at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n“It is incredibly innovative,” says Sarah Aitken, a vascular surgeon at the University of Sydney, but she adds that there are still many unanswered questions about the level of function that people with it can achieve and the ultimate cost of the device. “This kind of research is really challenging to do because it is very expensive” and the surgery involved is very high-risk, says Aitken.\n\nThe latest success will help researchers to understand how people cope with this device in the real world, says Joseph Rogers, a heart-failure cardiologist and president of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. “They weren’t being constantly monitored by medical teams,” says Rogers, who led the first trial of the device in the United States last year.\n\nIn all cases, the BiVACOR was used as a temporary measure until a donor heart became available. Some cardiologists say that it could become a permanent option for people not eligible for transplants because of their age or other health conditions, although the idea still needs to be tested in trials. In the United States, close to 7 million adults live with heart failure, but only about 4,500 heart transplants were performed in 2023, in part because of a shortage of donors.\n\nSuspended rotor\n\nBiVACOR was invented by biomedical engineer Daniel Timms, who founded a company named after the device, with offices in Huntington Beach, California, and Southport, Australia.\n\nThe device is a total heart replacement and works as a continuous pump in which a magnetically suspended rotor propels blood in regular pulses throughout the body. A cord tunnelled under the skin connects the device to an external, portable controller that runs on batteries by day and can be plugged into the mains at night.\n\nMany mechanical heart devices support the left side of the heart, and typically work by pooling blood in a sack, which flexes some 35 million times a year to pump blood. But these devices have many parts and often fail. BiVACOR, which only has one moving part, will in theory experience fewer problems of mechanical wear, says Rogers.\n\nUS trials",

          "abstract": "Researchers have found a way of consistently making sheets of metal that are just atoms thick.Credit: Getty\n\nTaking inspiration from ancient techniques, researchers have forged relatively large sheets of metal that are just atoms thick, enabling them to more readily study the weird properties of these materials in the laboratory. The method can be applied to any metal with a low melting point, and the team has used it to make 2D sheets of bismuth, gallium, indium, lead and tin. The feat was reported today in Nature1.\n\nJavier Sanchez-Yamagishi, a physicist who studies 2D materials at the University of California, Irvine, likens the accomplishment to the creation of graphene, an atomically thin layer of carbon. “This is just a starting point,” he says. “Now, other people can step in and start studying” the metal sheets’ properties.\n\nThe tiniest metal forge\n\nThe properties of 2D materials are very different from those of chunks of material with the same chemical formula. For example, graphene is mechanically tougher and more conductive of heat and electricity than is the graphite in pencil tips. Since the first studies of graphene, in 20042, researchers have made many atomically thin materials. However, most of them, including graphene, are generated by peeling sheets from layered crystalline materials. “Like a book, you can pick a single page up and make a 2D sheet,” says Guangyu Zhang, who studies nanomaterials at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\n\nMeet ‘goldene’: this gilded cousin of graphene is also one atom thick\n\nMetals don’t have this peelable layered structure, and most have been unstable when scientists have tried to shape them into ultrathin sheets. However, researchers have created small swathes of atoms-thick metals. Last year, for instance, a team reported a method3that produces flakes of gold, called ‘goldene’, that are hundreds of nanometres wide. Other methods involve depositing vaporized metal atoms onto a surface to form thin sheets4. But studying these materials has been challenging because metal atoms bind tightly to whatever they are placed on, making it difficult to isolate their properties from those of the surface material. Two-dimensional metal sheets are also unstable: metal atoms tend to clump into nanoparticles, and when exposed to air, the ultrathin sheets oxidize, so researchers have only been able to study them inside vacuum chambers using a limited set of techniques.\n\nZhang was inspired to develop the latest technique by a video of copper forging. To make sheets of copper, the metal is heated in a furnace, then hammered and squeezed on a large anvil.\n\nIt took his team seven years to adapt the concept to work at the nanoscale. The biggest challenge was finding a sufficiently flat anvil to squeeze the metal layers. The researchers eventually selected sapphire, which is very hard, and they coated it in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which is atomically flat.\n\nSource: Adapted from Figure 1a of ref. 1.\n\nTo make an ultrathin metal sheet, the team heated a droplet of the metal between two sapphire anvils, which were pressed together as the metal cooled (see ‘Putting the squeeze on’). Because MoS2 interacts more strongly with metal than with sapphire, the researchers could pry the resulting sandwich of MoS2–metal–MoS2 sheets out of the apparatus like a panini from a press.",

          "abstract": "Sámi reindeer herders of northern Sweden adapt the animals’ grazing areas depending on the changing environment.Credit: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/Getty\n\nThe Madagascar periwinkle packs a lot of healing power into its delicate pink flowers. Although native to the African island after which it is named, for centuries it has been cultivated and used in medicinal practices around the world — including Chinese, Ayurvedic, European and African traditions — commonly as a treatment for diabetes, but also for malaria, asthma, toothache and other maladies.\n\nExtracts from the flower are used as a remedy for eye infections in the Caribbean, where Damian Cohall, a Jamaican-born ethnopharmacologist at the University of the West Indies in Cave Hill, Barbados, learnt of it through interviews with elder members of local communities. Research in his laboratory identified compounds in the plant that inhibit an enzyme that regulates insulin levels and could lead to treatments for type 2 diabetes (see go.nature.com/3djmhyr). “The fact that these anti-diabetic properties are known in traditional practices validates the Indigenous science that existed well before Western knowledge systems,” Cohall says.\n\nHow to support Indigenous Peoples on biodiversity: be rigorous with data\n\nThe case of the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) not only demonstrates the value of knowledge held by Indigenous and local communities, but also illustrates how this expertise has often been exploited. In the 1950s, Western researchers intrigued by the plant’s widespread use discovered that the vinca alkaloids that it contained could treat cancer. Drugs derived from these compounds are still sold worldwide today for huge profits, which Cohall says have not been shared equitably with the local communities where the knowledge originated.\n\nSimilar dynamics have played out repeatedly over the past 500 years or more, as Western science has become imposed as the dominant knowledge system around most of the globe. In the process, many alternative ways of understanding the world have been marginalized. “There has been for a long time, and there is still, a distrust of Indigenous knowledge among scientists,” says Marie Roué, an environmental anthropologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. She says that Indigenous knowledge is often dismissed because it incorporates religious or spiritual elements. It also tends to be passed on orally and through cultural traditions, making it hard to formalize in the manner prized by the Western empirical method.\n\nHowever, Indigenous and local communities hold unique insights that can enhance people’s shared understanding of the natural world and inform attempts to protect it. Recognizing this, scientists such as Cohall and Roué are working in partnership with Indigenous and local groups to preserve and amplify these insights, integrate them into their own research and co-produce fresh knowledge with these communities.\n\nDocumenting and validating traditional medicine\n\nCohall has also identified anti-cancer compounds in the sarsaparilla plant (Smilax regelii). Currently, his lab is investigating the wound-healing properties of the Christmas candle plant (Senna alata), “inspired by information from a traditional healer in Ghana”, Cohall says.\n\nThe sweet violet (Viola odorata) and pink Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) have a long history of use for a range of maladies.Credit: Historic Illustrations/Alamy\n\nResearchers who incorporate local traditions and Indigenous knowledge into their work need to be sensitive to a range of social and cultural factors, especially in the Caribbean. “It’s science,” Cohall says, “but at the same time it’s history, it’s globalization, it’s migration.”\n\nThroughout history, various communities have settled, or been forced to settle, in the Caribbean. Each of these groups brought their traditions and culture and produced unique insights through their interactions with the natural environment. Sometimes the groups brought medicinal plants with them, which Cohall says might have happened with the periwinkle. But this knowledge has since been dismissed or suppressed. “A lot of those traditional Indigenous practices were pushed to the side because they were considered to be more primitive or not advanced or sophisticated, which led to a major loss of information,” Cohall says.\n\nWeaving Indigenous knowledge into the scientific method\n\nThis loss continues today, in part because of the modern Westernized education system; “it might not directly suggest that you should not focus on Indigenous traditional practices,” Cohall says, “but it definitely emphasizes a different way of knowledge acquisition.” He also explains that urbanization has led more people to move to cities, away from the rural areas where they can experience nature and apply traditional practices. Although the Caribbean’s history is unique, these forces of suppression and cultural imposition are common threats to Indigenous and local knowledge around the globe.\n\nContextual understanding\n\nCohall says that he can investigate the efficacy of traditional medicine using Westernized lab methods because the basic aim of any medicine is the same: to treat illness safely and effectively. However, other forms of Indigenous and local knowledge fit less easily into different epistemological systems. Often, ways of understanding the environment are formed through direct experience of nature and can be altered by when, where and in whom the knowledge exists.\n\n“In our Western world, nature and culture are separated, and science pretends to be capable of giving knowledge without taking into account culture. Indigenous knowledge is more holistic,” says Roué. She has spent decades working with the Sámi reindeer herders of northern Sweden and notes that these less tangible ways of knowing can be seen in the Sámi’s understanding of the lands that their reindeer graze on.\n\nDuring winter, the Sámi’s reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground and is then covered by thick snow. This is dependent on a confluence of environmental factors, including the climate, soil and vegetation. If there’s no snow, the lichen is left exposed and is destroyed by the cold temperature and wind; if it rains, then a layer of ice can freeze on top of the lichen and prevent the reindeer from getting to it.\n\nReindeer in northern Sweden feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground.Credit: Vasilisa Gagarina/Getty\n\nThe locations of good grazing areas therefore change constantly, which the Sámi have become sensitive to. This dynamic understanding of their environment is reflected in the Sámi word guohtun, which is most often translated as ‘pasture’. “They use ‘pasture’ because that’s the word in the other languages, but in their own language guohtun also encompasses how available the lichen is to the reindeer given the conditions today of the snow and wind,” says Roué. “They don’t speak about pasture like a botanist does -— as a permanent mix that is more or less good for an animal — they speak through their experience of ever-changing conditions.”\n\nFrom exploitation to empowerment: how researchers can protect Indigenous peoples’ rights to own and control their data\n\nAttempts to integrate this experiential and contextual local knowledge into scientific frameworks that prioritize stable truths can cause friction. For example, forestry companies have, with good intentions, attempted to work with the Sámi to map where reindeer graze and enable a productive dialogue between land users. But Roué says that the Sámi’s input has largely been ignored because the changeable concept of guohtun cannot be represented easily on maps. “That permanency doesn’t exist,” she says, “When you ask the Sámi, ‘What is the best place?’ or ‘When are you going to do the migration this year?’, they tend to tell you, ‘I don’t know, it depends,’ and Western people think the Sámi know nothing.”\n\nSuch thinking is, to some, infuriating. “I think that there’s an extraordinary arrogance that runs through many Euro-American knowledge systems,” says Luci Attala, a UK-based anthropologist and chair of the Tairona Heritage Trust, in Swansea, UK, which works to amplify the voices of the Indigenous Kogi people of northern Colombia. To her, researchers in the mainstream scientific establishment are culpable for the marginalization of Indigenous and local knowledge. “They’re part of the problem,” she says. “They’re part of the world that has spent years discounting other ways of being and assuming that their methodology is the one and only route to truth.”\n\nThe power of co-production\n\nTo tackle the issues that come with bridging distinct knowledge systems, Roué advocates scientists working with Indigenous and local groups to co-produce knowledge. For instance, the research of eco-anthropologist Samuel Roturier, who has worked with the Sámi for more than 15 years, shows how co-production can empower local communities and enrich conservation strategies.\n\nRoturier, who works at AgroParisTech (part of Paris-Saclay University), has researched ways to increase forest biodiversity and lichen availability, especially through artificial lichen dispersal. The Sámi have to ensure that there are diverse habitats for their reindeer, so that there are always areas where the animals can graze during fluctuations in the weather, which are becoming more volatile because of climate change. But Roturier explains that the biodiversity of the forest is steadily decreasing “because of commercial forestry and the introduction of modern forest-management practices”.\n\nControlled burning is commonly used to manage forests around the world, but is not widely used by Swedish forestry companies. Although there is no evidence to suggest that the Sámi have traditionally used the technique, the idea that fire can benefit biodiversity is conserved in the Indigenous language. “There is a Sámi word, roavve, that means ‘a forest that has burnt in the past’ but also ‘a forest that is rich in lichen’,” says Roturier.\n\nPharmacologist Damian Cohall researches medicinal plants.Credit: Brian Elcock\n\nLars Nutti, a Sámi reindeer herder from the Sirges community, recognized the significance of this linguistic artefact. “Roavve is a description of an old sparse forest with good grazing for reindeer,” he says, “but recreating such forests is largely impossible with today’s policies.” After an expanse of forest burnt down near where Nutti lives, he approached Roturier with the idea of running a research project to investigate whether dispersing lichen in this area would result in healthier pastures. “And the results actually showed that it worked very well, beyond our expectations,” says Roturier.\n\nNutti has since co-authored 2 papers, the latest reporting on 11 years of the project1, and the findings offer insights that can inform forest conservation strategies. Discussions with forestry companies about further projects are under way, but Nutti is sceptical as to whether they will result in tangible progress. “We will probably have to continue to wait for some breakthrough with the forest companies to make large-scale attempts to restore lichen,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York sparked outrage among Democrats in his party last week when he helped to pass a Republican-led spending bill.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe US government averted a shutdown late last week after President Donald Trump signed into law a spending agreement that likely locks in modest cuts to science funding this year. But a larger crisis for science still looms as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress continue to seek massive cuts to the federal budget for 2025 and beyond.\n\nTrump team orders huge government lay-offs: how science could fare\n\nAssuming that federal spending follows current trends, the 15 March ‘continuing resolution’ agreement means that overall funding for research and development during the current fiscal year, which ends on 30 September, will probably ring in around US$193 billion — representing a relatively modest 3.5% cut compared with fiscal 2024, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Part of that cut comes from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The spending agreement calls for a 67% reduction in funding for the agency through the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes investments in the 2016 Cancer Moonshot programme and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative; total funding under the Cures Act will drop by $280 million, to $127 million.\n\nThe spending bill, drafted exclusively by Republicans in Congress, does not include many of the usual line-item details directing agencies precisely where to put their money. This gives the Trump administration leeway in directing where the money goes — one of the reasons why many Democrats in Congress threatened to shut down the government rather than vote for the bill. Late last week, however, a small group of Democratic senators, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, went against the rest of the party and advanced it to keep the government’s doors open.\n\nWhether or not the Trump administration will actually spend the money laid out in the continuing resolution remains to be seen. Over the past two months since Trump took office, his team has ignored previous spending laws passed by Congress by freezing and terminating federal grants, including those from the NIH, that the administration does not support. The latest spending agreement is unlikely to change that dynamic, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “We are in a different era right now where nothing is normal”.\n\nNothing normal\n\nPolicy specialists say that the Trump team might still try to slash 2025 budgets with a separate legislative package of ‘rescissions’ — a process separate from the appropriations one used to fund the government. This would be the easy — and legal — way for the White House to push through many of the funding cuts for this year that it is seeking, policy watchers say.\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts",

Here, by using online surveys, laboratory cognitive tasks and natural language processing in diverse modern cultures across the world (n = 20,427) and ancient cultures spanning 3,000 years of history, we examined universality and cultural variability in the ways that people conceptualize relationships. We discovered a universal representational space for relationship concepts, comprising five principal dimensions (formality, activeness, valence, exchange and equality) and three core categories (hostile, public and private relationships).

Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, parietal and somatosensory cortex, and increases in connectivity to lateral prefrontal cortex.

Yet, previous studies have shown that cooperation quickly declines when sanctioning mechanisms are removed. We test whether explicitly expressing trust in players’ capability to maintain cooperation after the removal of sanctions, i.e., vertical communication of trust, has the potential to alleviate this drop in compliance. Four incentivized public-goods experiments ( N = 2,823) find that the vertical communication of trust maintains cooperation upon the removal of centralized (Study 1), third-party (Study 2a, 2b), and peer punishment (Study 3), and this effect extends beyond single interactions (Study 4). In all studies, vertical trust communication increases mutual trust among players, providing support to the idea that vertically communicating trust can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, they suggest that authorities should carefully consider how they communicate the lifting of rules and sanctions.",

Our study uncovered empirical evidence of the PAR program’s impact on forest quality. Through a multiperiod difference-in-differences analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we found that the PAR program significantly curbed deforestation in the participating counties and reduced forest-clearing activities among the resettled households, even those relocating to rural villages. Mechanism analysis revealed that the program discouraged deforestation by enhancing market accessibility, fostering nonfarm employment opportunities, and elevating income levels. The study underscores that altering livelihood strategies and lifestyles is essential for resettlement programs to effectively mitigate ecological degradation.",

          "abstract": "Central emotion theories assume that during threatening and dangerous events the human face signals a prototypical, distinct, and universally recognized expression of fear which can be accurately decoded by conspecific perceivers. Due to the importance of fear expressions, an unusually large body of research has been dedicated to exploring their evolutionary origins, neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical significance. However, these studies typically utilize highly recognizable posed actor portrayals presumed to closely resemble the diagnostic physical appearance of real-life fearful faces. Here, we challenge this diagnosticity assumption. Following context-dependent frameworks (Barrett, 2017), we hypothesized that extrafacial context (e.g., situational information, body posture, etc.) plays a far greater role in fear communication than the signal of the isolated face. In 12 preregistered experiments (N = 4,180), we examined the perception of authentic, real-life videos documenting a diverse range of intense fear-inducing situations (e.g., height jumping, physical attacks, exposure to phobia triggers). Participants viewed the face alone, the context with no face, or the full video while various response methods of emotion perception were tested (forced choice, open-ended, multiple emotion scales, valence-arousal ratings). Across experiments, videos of the faces alone failed to communicate fear in a reliable manner. In sharp contrast, context with no faces, and faces with context were clearly and robustly perceived as fearful, with medium to large effect sizes. These findings suggest that despite the undisputed importance of perceiving fear reactions, facial expressions alone bear minimal diagnostic value, while context plays a critical role in real-life fear perception.",

          "abstract": "The origin of birds represents a pivotal transition in vertebrate evolution, marked by significant changes in both brain size and feeding biomechanics. The evolution of the avian skull involved dramatic modifications, such as a segmented palate and the development of powered cranial kinesis in neognath birds. Powered kinesis, the ability to move parts of the skull independently, is considered a key innovation behind the dietary diversity and evolutionary success of birds. However, the processes driving the emergence of avian kinesis have remained unclear until recently. By analyzing data from Mesozoic birds, including reinterpretations of palate homology, 3D jaw muscle biomechanics, and linkage analysis, researchers have quantified changes in muscle forces and their effects on palate mechanics during the transition from theropods to birds. As the neurocranium expanded in non-avian theropods, temporal muscles shifted to more rostrocaudal positions in birds, aiding in the segmentation of the pterygoid. This musculoskeletal transformation increased fore-aft muscle force in neognaths, enabling powered cranial kinesis. A critical change was the separation of the epipterygoid ossification from the braincase, leading to the breakdown of primitive kinematic linkages and the development of a new basicranial joint, which allowed for greater cranial flexibility. These findings shed light on how the neurosensory and feeding systems coevolved during bird origins and offer new methods for identifying cranial kinesis in extinct vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation, pannus formation, and progressive joint destruction. The inflammatory milieu in RA drives endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus facilitating leukocyte infiltration into the synovium. Reelin, a circulating glycoprotein previously implicated in endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in diseases such as atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis, has emerged as a potential upstream regulator of these processes. However, its role in RA pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin levels are markedly elevated in the plasma of both RA patients and mouse models of arthritis, with higher concentrations correlating with greater disease severity. Genetic deletion of the Reelin receptor Apoer2 conferred significant protection against serum transfer arthritis (STA), underscoring the relevance of this pathway in disease progression. Furthermore, therapeutic inhibition of Reelin using the CR-50 antibody yielded robust anti-inflammatory effects in multiple preclinical arthritis models, including STA, K/BxN, and collagen-induced arthritis. Notably, CR-50 treatment not only reduced leukocyte infiltration and synovial inflammation but also mitigated pannus formation. Importantly, these benefits were achieved without the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac. Our findings position Reelin as a proinflammatory endothelial biomarker and therapeutic target in RA. By modulating endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment, anti-Reelin strategies offer an alternative approach to attenuate synovial inflammation and joint damage. These results provide a compelling rationale for further exploration of Reelin-targeted therapies as alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive treatments in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

In primates, however, the dynamics of the DA signals remain unknown since conventional methods are not necessarily appropriate in terms of the spatiotemporal resolution or chemical specificity sufficient for detecting the DA signals. In our study, fiber photometry with a fluorescent DA sensor was employed to identify reward-related DA transients in the monkey striatum. This technique, which directly monitors local DA release, reveals a reward prediction error signal in the anterior putamen originating from midbrain DA neurons. Further, DA transients in the head of the caudate nucleus exhibit a value-based response to reward-predicting stimuli. These signals have been found to arise from two separate groups of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The present results demonstrate that fluorescence DA monitoring is applicable to detect DA signals in the primate striatum for investigating their roles.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic processes involving biomolecules are essential for the function of the cell. Here, we introduce an integrative method for computing models of these processes based on multiple heterogeneous sources of information, including time-resolved experimental data and physical models of dynamic processes. First, for each time point, a set of coarse models of compositional and structural heterogeneity is computed (heterogeneity models). Second, for each heterogeneity model, a set of static integrative structure models is computed (a snapshot model). Finally, these snapshot models are selected and connected into a series of trajectories that optimize the likelihood of both the snapshot models and transitions between them (a trajectory model). The method is demonstrated by application to the assembly process of the human nuclear pore complex in the context of the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division, based on live-cell correlated electron tomography, bulk fluorescence correlation spectroscopy–calibrated quantitative live imaging, and a structural model of the fully assembled nuclear pore complex. Modeling of the assembly process improves the model precision over static integrative structure modeling alone. The method is applicable to a wide range of time-dependent systems in cell biology and is available to the broader scientific community through an implementation in the open source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software.",

However, the causation and mechanism of liver fibrosis triggered by chronic HEV infection remain poorly understood. Here, we found that the viral multiple-domain replicase (ORF1) undergoes unique ubiquitin–proteasomal processing leading to formation of the H EV- D erived S MAD A ctivator (HDSA), a viral polypeptide lacking putative helicase and RNA polymerase domains. The HDSA is stable, non-HSP90-bound, localizes to the nucleus, and is abundant in G3 HEV-infected hepatocytes of various origins. Markedly, the HDSA in hepatocytes potentiates the fibrogenic TGF-β/SMAD pathway by forming compact complexes with SMAD3 to facilitate its promoter binding and coactivator recruitment, leading to significant fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils. Virus infection–induced liver fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils could be prevented by mutating the residues P989C, A990C, and A991C (PAA-3C) within ORF1, which are required for proteasomal processing. Thus, we have identified a viral protein derived from host proteasomal processing, defined its notable role in liver fibrosis and highlighted the nature of an unanticipated host–HEV interaction that facilitates hepatitis E pathogenesis.",

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this condition remain unclear. Transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), a TRP channel that is activated by downstream of the Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) axis, is expressed in the somatosensory system. Therefore, the present study investigated its pathophysiological role in neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Here, partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) elicited mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in wild-type mice, which was suppressed in TRPC3-KO mice. In situ hybridization revealed that TRPC3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, spinal dorsal horn neuron-specific downregulation using miRNA attenuated pSNL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Spinal TRPC3 activation elicited acute mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, its genetic ablation reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by spinal NK 1 R or PLC activation. These findings demonstrate that TRPC3 in spinal dorsal horn neurons facilitates the development of neuropathic pain. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-species plantations are increasingly recognized for their potential to maintain forest biodiversity and soil health; however, a comprehensive assessment of their global effectiveness is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 7,045 paired observations between mixed-species and monoculture plantations, derived from 311 studies across diverse forest ecosystems worldwide. Our results show that mixed-species plantations significantly increased understory plant biomass, cover, and species richness by 32.6%, 55.4%, and 32.2%, respectively, compared to monocultures. Furthermore, the Shannon and Pielou diversity indices increased by 28.2% and 8.6%, respectively, and the Simpson index increased by 9.6%. When understory shrub and herbaceous species were considered separately, species mixing had significantly positive effects on shrub diversity but had no effect on herbaceous diversity. Moreover, mixed-species plantations markedly improved soil physical and chemical properties compared to monocultures. These improvements include increases in soil nutrient content (9.6 to 17.8%) and nutrient availability (14.7 to 33.5%), soil microbial biomass (17.2 to 28.8%), and soil carbon sequestration (7.2 to 19.9%). These enhancements were particularly pronounced in plantations that included legumes. Our findings reveal that the benefits of species mixing are influenced by climatic conditions, geographic location, and stand age, with the most substantial effects observed in temperate regions and mature stands. This study underscores the critical role of mixed-species plantations in promoting sustainable forest management and mitigating the ecological limitations of monocultures.",

Our analysis reveals that forested wetlands can significantly attenuate storm waves (35% over 3 wavelengths) except in rare near-submerged cases. Notably, 19 of the 20 existing formulations for vegetation drag coefficient, a key parameter for wave attenuation modeling, are inapplicable in storm conditions. Hence, we introduce an new approach to reliably predict wave attenuation during storms, without the need for drag coefficient determination nor modeling expertise.

          "abstract": "Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production, accounting for a substantial portion of water withdrawals worldwide. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for water in agriculture, leading to alterations in regional water–energy balances. We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water–energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water–energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes—temperate, snowy, and others—from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ρ = − 0.75 ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ρ = − 0.42 ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ρ = 0.51 ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ρ = − 0.45 ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water–energy balance to secure future water supplies.",

Photoexcited carrier transfer from QDs to microbes is driven by complex interactions, with emerging insights into the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The heterogeneities of both microbes and QD ensembles pose significant challenges in mechanistic understanding, which is critical for designing advanced nano–bio hybrids. We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to analyze charge transfer between a CdSe QD film and Shewanella oneidensis microbes. We correlated the spatiotemporal fluorescence data with an analytical model. Our analysis revealed two distinct distributions of QD de-excitation pathways. The characteristics of these distributions: 1) a faster transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 1 = 1.5   10 9   s - 1 ), with a lower acceptor number ( N ¯ a 1 = 0.03 ) and 2) a slower transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 2 = 4.1   10 8   s - 1 ) with a higher acceptor number ( N ¯ a 2 = 0.18 ). We assign these distributions to the indirect and direct electron transfer mechanisms, respectively.

While ventral CA1 (vCA1) shows direct and reciprocal connections with mPFC, dorsal CA1 (dCA1) forms indirect pathways to mPFC, notably via the thalamic reuniens nucleus (Re). Neuroanatomical tracing has documented structural connectivity of this indirect pathway through Re however, its functional operation is largely unexplored. Here, we used in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology along with optogenetics to address this question. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse brain slices revealed both monosynaptic excitatory responses and disynaptic feedforward inhibition at Re–mPFC synapses. However, we also identified a prolonged excitation of mPFC by Re. These early monosynaptic and late recurrent components are in marked contrast to the primarily feedforward inhibition characteristic of thalamic inputs to the neocortex. Local field potential recordings in mPFC brain slices revealed prolonged synaptic activity throughout all cortical lamina upon Re activation, with the late excitation enhanced by blockade of parvalbumin neurons and GABA A Rs. In vivo Neuropixels recordings in head-fixed awake mice revealed a similar prolonged excitation of mPFC units by Re activation. In summary, Re output produces recurrent feedforward excitation within mPFC suggesting a potent amplification system in the Re–mPFC network. This may facilitate amplification of dCA1-&gt;mPFC signals for which Re acts as the primary conduit, as there is little direct connectivity. In addition, the capacity of mPFC neurons to fire bursts of action potentials in response to Re input suggests that these synapses have a high gain.",

          "abstract": "The problem of combining P -values is an old and fundamental one, and the classic assumption of independence is often violated or unverifiable in many applications. There are many well-known rules that can combine a set of arbitrarily dependent P -values (for the same hypothesis) into a single P -value. We show that essentially all these existing rules can be strictly improved when the P -values are exchangeable, or when external randomization is allowed (or both). For example, we derive randomized and/or exchangeable improvements of well-known rules like “twice the median” and “twice the average,” as well as geometric and harmonic means. Exchangeable P -values are often produced one at a time (for example, under repeated tests involving data splitting), and our rules can combine them sequentially as they are produced, stopping when the combined P -values stabilize. Our work also improves rules for combining arbitrarily dependent P -values, since the latter becomes exchangeable if they are presented to the analyst in a random order. The main technical advance is to show that all existing combination rules can be obtained by calibrating the P -values to e-values (using an α -dependent calibrator), averaging those e-values, converting to a level- α test using Markov’s inequality, and finally obtaining P -values by combining this family of tests; the improvements are delivered via recent randomized and exchangeable variants of Markov’s inequality.",

Contrary to the rapid lethality caused by SOS1 genetic ablation in SOS2 KO mice, SOS1 pharmacological inhibition by its specific inhibitor BI-3406 did not significantly affect animal weight/viability nor cause noteworthy systemic toxicity. Allograft assays using different KRAS mut cell lines showed that treatment with BI-3406 impaired RAS activation and RAS downstream signaling and decreased tumor burden and disease progression as a result of both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic effects of the drug. Consistent with prior genetic evidence and the KRAS mut allografts assays in immunocompromised mice, our analyses using an in vivo model of KRAS G12D -driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in immunocompetent mice showed that single, systemic BI-3406 treatment impaired tumor growth and downmodulated protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment comparably to SOS1 genetic ablation or to treatment with the specific KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133.

Our data confirm SOS1 as an actionable therapy target in RAS-dependent cancers and suggest that BI-3406 treatment may yield clinical benefit both as monotherapy or as a potential combination partner for multiple RAS-targeting strategies.",

In Eukaryotes, it largely consists of the protein actin, that forms a double-stranded linear filamentous structure in the presence of ATP and disassemble upon ATP hydrolysis. Bacteria also possess actin homologs, that drive fundamental cellular processes, including cell division, shape maintenance, and DNA segregation. Like eukaryotic actin, bacterial actins assemble into dynamic polymers upon ATP binding, however variation in interactions between strands gives rise to striking diversity of filament architectures. Here, we report a family of bacterial actins of unknown function, conserved among the Verrucomicrobiota phylum, which assembles into a unique tubular structure in the presence of ATP. A cryo-EM structure of the filaments reveals that it consists of three strands, unlike other described bacterial actin structures. This architecture provides further insights into the organization of actin-like filaments and has implications for understanding the diversity and evolution of the bacterial cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Recent findings show that stereotyped movement sequences (habits) need the cortex in the learning phase, but after learning, the cortex can be inactivated, and the movement still be performed flawlessly. The motor program is dependent on the sensorimotor part of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and on synaptic plasticity in the thalamostriatal synapses. New findings from several laboratories have revealed a highly precise spatially interactive organization within the basal ganglia [DLS, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the thalamostriatal parafascicular nucleus (PF)] and with precise input from the cortex. The DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop is subdivided into many parallel loops. I now propose that these parallel loops can act to reinforce the activity of the different striatal projection neurons in the DLS that take part and that the synaptic transmission in DLS becomes potentiated each time the motor sequence is performed successfully, if rewarded through a dopamine burst. It is argued that after learning the DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop can operate in isolation.",

          "abstract": "Low-energy excitations play a key role in all condensed-matter systems, yet there is limited understanding of their nature in glasses, where they correspond to local rearrangements of groups of particles. Here, we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Second, we show that the excitations’ energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e., the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a primary field whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material’s stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.",

However, the immunological properties of iPSCs in an allogeneic setting are not well understood. We previously established a mouse transplantation model of MHC-compatible/minor antigen-mismatched combinations, assuming a hypoimmunogenic iPSC-setting. Here, we found that iPSCs subcutaneously inoculated into MHC-compatible allogeneic host mice resisted rejection and formed teratomas without immunosuppressant administration. Notably, when skin grafts were transplanted onto hosts more than 40 d after the initial iPSCs inoculation, only the skin of the same strain as the initial iPSCs was engrafted. Therefore, donor-specific immune tolerance was induced by a single iPSC inoculation. Diverse analyses, including single-cell RNA-sequencing after transplantation, revealed an increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) population, particularly CD25 + CD103 + effector Tregs within the teratoma and skin grafts. The removal of CD25 + or Foxp3 + cells suppressed the increase in effector Tregs and disrupted graft acceptance, indicating the importance of these cells in the establishment of immune tolerance. Within the teratoma, we observed an increase in TGF-β2 levels, suggesting an association with the increase in effector Tregs.

Their identification and prediction are gaining attention, but the fundamental physicochemical basis for fold switching remains poorly understood. In this Perspective article, we address this problem by surveying the landscape of well-characterized metamorphic proteins and noting that a significant fraction of them display temperature sensitivity. We then make the case that the dependence on temperature, in particular cold-denaturation effects, is likely to be an underlying property of many metamorphic proteins regardless of their ultimate triggering mechanisms, especially those with a single domain. The argument is supported by rigorous analysis of hydrophobic effects in each well-characterized metamorphic protein pair and a description of how these parameters relate to temperature. The conclusion discusses the relevance of these insights to a better understanding of prediction, evolution, and de novo design strategies for metamorphic proteins.",

Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a nonlinear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the λ -test—a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.",

Species radiations established by long-distance, and especially transoceanic, dispersal can cause substantial shifts in regional biodiversity. Here, we investigate the occurrence and timing of the greatest known long-distance oceanic dispersal event in the history of terrestrial vertebrates—the rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji. Iguanas are large-bodied herbivores that are well-known overwater dispersers, including species that colonized the Caribbean and the Galápagos islands. However, the origin of Fijian iguanas had not been comprehensively tested. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary timescale of the iguanid lizard radiation using genome-wide exons and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Those data indicate that the closest living relative of extant Fijian iguanas is the North American desert iguana and that the two taxa likely diverged during the late Paleogene near or after the onset of volcanism that produced the Fijian archipelago. Biogeographic models estimate North America as the most probable ancestral range of Fijian iguanas. Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America, and which spanned a fifth of the earth’s circumference (&gt;8,000 km). Overwater rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji strengthens the importance of founder-event speciation in the diversification of iguanids and elucidates the scope of long-distance dispersal across terrestrial vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 . These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives.",

We apply this model to Posidonia oceanica meadows, where positive and negative feedbacks are well documented, and there is empirical evidence of the role of sulfide accumulation, toxic for the plant, in driving complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We describe a progressive transition from homogeneous meadows to extinction through dynamical regimes that allow the ecosystem to avoid the typical ecological tipping points of homogeneous vegetation covers. A predictable sequence of distinct dynamical regimes is observed as mortality is continuously increased: turbulent regimes, formation of spirals and wave trains, and isolated traveling pulses or expanding rings, the latter being a harbinger of ecosystem collapse, however far beyond the tipping point of the homogeneous cover. The model used in this paper is general, and the results can be applied to other plant–soil spatially extended systems, regardless of the mechanisms behind negative and positive feedbacks.",

The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models.

Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator—a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning–assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.",

However, its role in shaping behavior remains unclear. Recent evidence shows that resting-state spatial patterns not only align with task-evoked topographies but also encode distinct visual (e.g., lines, contours, faces, places) and motor (e.g., hand postures) features, suggesting mechanisms for long-term storage and predictive coding. While prior research focused on static, time-averaged task activations, we examine whether dynamic, time-varying motor states seen during active hand movements are also present at rest. Three distinct motor activation states, engaging the motor cortex alongside sensory and association areas, were identified. These states appeared both at rest and during task execution but underwent temporal reorganization from rest to task. Thus, resting-state dynamics serve as strong spatiotemporal priors for task-based activation. Critically, resting-state patterns more closely resembled those associated with frequent ecological hand movements than with an unfamiliar movement, indicating a structured repertoire of movement patterns that is replayed at rest and reorganized during action. This suggests that spontaneous neural activity provides priors for future movements and contributes to long-term memory storage, reinforcing the functional interplay between resting and task-driven brain activity.",

As a result, calibrating mammalian evolution has been largely restricted to the semicircular application of paleomagnetic inferences combined with temporally ill-constrained and geographically remote biochronological deductions. For example, fossils from three Greek localities and one Anatolian locality assigned to the primate genus Ouranopithecus lack datable samples, leaving its ages poorly constrained.

          "abstract": "Why are jellyfish round? Animals get their shapes as they develop. After development, however, how animals keep their shapes is less understood. Moon jellies respond to perturbations to body shape, such as being halved or quartered, by reorganizing existing body parts and regaining radial symmetry, i.e., their round shape. The robust recovery of radial symmetry led us to investigate, in this study, how being round is encoded. We tested perturbing shape by grafting body sections in varying configurations. Testing these perturbations confirms the moon jellies’ ability to recover their round shape from many perturbations. However, in response to some perturbations, the jellies can also adopt other stable body shapes, such as oval, quadrilateral, and triangular. Thus, although the jellies are characterized by a radially symmetrical body plan, perturbations can lead to them recovering to bilateral shapes. Employing mathematical modeling, we find that interactions between forces from muscle contractions and viscoelastic tissues can explain the recovery to different shapes. A stable body shape is achieved when the mechanical forces are locally balanced, regardless of symmetry. Consistent with the model prediction that stable shape is the outcome of balancing mechanical forces, modulating the mechanical parameter in the system, i.e., the muscle contraction rate, can produce shape-shifting. Maintaining shapes dynamically as the balance of mechanical forces may enable the animals to readily adapt to changing physical environments.",

Here, we present results from a Lagrangian metatranscriptomic time series survey in the Sargasso Sea and demonstrate temporally partitioned phosphorus uptake in this phosphorus-limited environment. In the Sargasso, heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria express genes for phosphorus assimilation during the morning, day, and dusk, respectively.

Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have identified a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well’s radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.",

The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette–dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of &gt;20 marketed/development-stage antibodies. Biodistribution experiments in mice bearing EGFR-expressing tumors correctly identified the two pool members recognizing EGFR, while organ analysis registered liver accumulation of an antibody targeting glucagon receptor, a protein profoundly expressed in that organ. In analogy to an early-phase drug development campaign, we performed biophysical and PK analysis for a cassette of 80 unique bispecific DARPin-sybody molecules.

However, controlling the anchoring condition at the interface at will is rarely achieved. Here, we present an emulsion system in which silicone oil droplets in a nematic liquid crystal spontaneously induce conic surface anchoring, forming elastic hexadecapoles without any surfactant. The conic degenerate surface anchoring shows continuous reversible anchoring transition to tangential and homeotropic below and above the ambient temperature, respectively. We introduce a physical design principle and in situ control to achieve three-phase compound droplets with diverse morphologies and topologies by fusing elastic hexadecapoles of oil droplets with elastic dipoles of glycerol droplets. The surrounding director field and the resulting defect structure of the compound droplets are analyzed by numerical simulations. Our approach to forming compound droplets will allow the on-demand design of building blocks for engineered emulsions for reconfigurable composite materials.",

          "authors": "Armen Bagdasarov, Sarah Markert, Michael S. Gaffrey",
          "abstract": "As infants grow, they develop greater attentional control during interactions with others, shifting from patterns of attention primarily driven by caregivers (exogenous) to those that are also self-directed (endogenous). The ability to endogenously control attention during infancy is thought to reflect ongoing brain development and is influenced by patterns of joint attention between infant and caregiver. However, whether measures of infant attentional control and caregiver behavior during infant–caregiver interactions relate to patterns of infant brain activity is unknown and key for informing developmental models of attentional control. Using data from 43 infant–caregiver dyads, we quantified patterns of visual attention with dyadic, head-mounted eye tracking during infant–caregiver play and associated them with the duration of infant EEG microstate D/4 measured during rest. Importantly, microstate D/4 is a scalp potential topography thought to reflect the organization and function of attention-related brain networks. We found that microstate D/4 associated positively with infant-led joint attention rate but did not associate with caregiver-led joint attention rate, suggesting that infant-led coordination of joint attention during play may be critical for the neurobiological development of attentional control, or vice versa. Further, we found that microstate D/4 associated negatively with infant attention shift rate and positively with infant sustained attention duration, suggesting that increased stability of microstate D/4 may reflect maturation of attentional control and its underlying neural substrates. Together, our findings provide insights into how infant attentional control abilities and infant–caregiver visual behavior during play are associated with the spatial and temporal dynamics of infant brain activity.",

          "abstract": "The importance of macrophages in kidney diseases has been well established; however, the mechanisms underlying the infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys are not well understood. RGMb is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family. RGMb can be expressed on the cell surface but a large portion of RGMb is localized intracellularly. Among various immune cell types, macrophages express the highest levels of RGMb, but the biological functions of RGMb in macrophages remain largely unknown. We find that RGMb promoted macrophage migration in vitro and that in vivo, RGMb enhanced infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys and aggravated kidney inflammation and injury in mice. Mechanistically, RGMb bound to TAB1 inside the cell and facilitated the interaction between TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAB1, thereby promoting TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1, followed by increased αTAT1 phosphorylation and α-tubulin acetylation. The resulting changes in the cytoskeleton promoted macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Rgmb in macrophages markedly reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, αTAT1 phosphorylation, and α-tubulin acetylation and attenuated macrophage infiltration, renal inflammation, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis during kidney injury. Our results suggest that macrophage RGMb promotes kidney disease by increasing macrophage infiltration via the TRAF6-TAB1-TAK1/αTAT1/α-tubulin cascade.",

However, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of m 6 A in IAV RNA. In the present study, we identified the m 6 A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m 6 A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m 6 A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m 6 A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m 6 A reader proteins. Together, our findings reveal an important role for m 6 A on viral RNAs in facilitating the activity of the polymerase complex and the replication and pathogenicity of IAV, which provides insights for the development of novel anti-influenza strategies.",

          "abstract": "Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that establishes a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis within root nodules of legumes. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes a drastic cellular change leading to a terminally differentiated form, called bacteroid, characterized by genome endoreduplication, increased cell size, and high membrane permeability. Bacterial cell cycle (mis)regulation is at the heart of this differentiation process. In free-living cells, the master regulator CtrA ensures the progression of cell cycle by activating cell division (controlled by FtsZ) and inhibiting DNA replication, while on the other hand the so far poorly unknown downregulation of CtrA and FtsZ is essential for bacteroid differentiation. Here, we combine cell biology, biochemistry, and bacterial genetics to understand the functions of FcrX, a factor that controls both CtrA and FtsZ in free-living growth and in symbiosis. Depletion of the essential gene fcrX led to abnormally high levels of FtsZ and CtrA and minicell formation. Using multiple complementary techniques, we showed that FcrX may interact with FtsZ and CtrA. Moreover, fcrX transcription is directly controlled by CtrA itself and the FcrX protein displays a cell cycle-dependent pattern. We showed further that FcrX also binds the degradosome complex ClpXP and its adaptors CpdR1 and RcdA, and that CtrA degradation efficiency depends on FcrX. We further showed that, despite weak homology with FliJ-like proteins, only FcrX proteins from closely related species are able to complement S. meliloti fcrX function. Finally, deregulation of FcrX showed abnormal symbiotic behaviors in plants suggesting a putative role of this factor during bacteroid differentiation.",

Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady state can be obtained numerically for 100s to 1,000s of sites. We study the nonequilibrium phase diagram and phase transitions, which qualitatively matches the equilibrium phase diagram, agreeing with the intuition that increasing the intensity of the light is equivalent to changing the bosonic chemical potential.

          "abstract": "At the end of their growth phase, Drosophila larvae remodel their bodies, glue themselves to a substrate, and harden their cuticle in preparation for metamorphosis. This process—termed pupariation—is triggered by a surge in the hormone ecdysone. Substrate attachment is achieved by a pupariation subprogram called glue expulsion and spreading behavior (GSB). An epidermis-to-CNS Dilp8-Lgr3 relaxin signaling event that occurs downstream of ecdysone is critical for unlocking progression of the pupariation motor program toward GSB, but the factors and circuits acting downstream of Lgr3 signaling remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific RNA interference and behavioral monitoring, we identify Myoinhibiting peptide (Mip) as a neuromodulator of multiple GSB action components, such as tetanic contraction, peristaltic contraction alternation, and head-waving. Mip is required in a pair of brain descending neurons, which act temporally downstream of Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling. Mip modulates GSB via ventral nerve cord neurons expressing its conserved receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR). Silencing of Mip descending neurons by hyperpolarization completely abrogates GSB, while their optogenetic activation at a restricted competence time window triggers GSB-like behavior. Hence, Mip descending neurons have at least two functions: to act as GSB command neurons and to secrete Mip to modulate GSB action components. Our results provide insight into conserved aspects of Mip-SPR signaling in animals, reveal the complexity of GSB control, and contribute to the understanding of how multistep innate behaviors are coordinated in time and with other developmental processes through command neurons and neuropeptidergic signaling.",

However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little response to diverse nonlinguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and programming languages. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n = 19 speakers) and four fictional conlangs [Klingon (n = 10), Na’vi (n = 9), High Valyrian (n = 3), and Dothraki (n = 3)]. These findings suggest that conlangs and natural languages share critical features that allow them to draw on the same representations and computations, implemented in the left-lateralized network of brain areas. The features of conlangs that differentiate them from natural languages—including recent creation by a single individual, often for an esoteric purpose, the small number of speakers, and the fact that these languages are typically learned in adulthood—appear to not be consequential for the reliance on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. We argue that the critical shared feature of conlangs and natural languages is that they are symbolic systems capable of expressing an open-ended range of meanings about our outer and inner worlds.",

Here we study by experiment and theory a model system: a coculture of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , an obligate aerobe that is chemotactic to oxygen, and a nonmotile mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , which photosynthetically produces oxygen when illuminated. Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that area. We propose that this effect arises from advection by the inhomogeneous bacterial concentration. The resulting generalization of Fick’s law has been proposed in the context of chemotaxis and is mathematically related to the “turbulent pumping” in magnetohydrodynamics.",

While trophoblast-specific cis-regulatory elements impacting HLA-G transcription have been described, the identity of trans-acting factors controlling HLA-G expression in EVT remains poorly understood. Utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we find that the WNT signaling pathway negatively regulates HLA-G expression in EVT. In addition, we identified two trophoblast-specific transcription factors, TEAD1 and TEAD3, required for HLA-G transcription in EVT in a Yes-associated protein-independent manner. Altogether, we systematically elucidated essential genes and pathways underlying HLA-G expression in EVT, shedding light on the mechanisms of maternal–fetal tolerance and potentially providing insights into controlling HLA-G expression beyond EVT to protect allogeneic cells from immune rejection.",

However, achieving this goal has long been challenging due to the diffraction of low-frequency (long-wavelength) audio waves in linear acoustics. Here, we introduce an approach for creating remote audio spots, dubbed audible enclaves, by harnessing the local nonlinear interaction of two self-bending ultrasonic beams with distinct spectra. The self-bending ultrasonic beams created by acoustic metasurfaces, though inaudible, can bypass obstacles such as human heads. At their intersection behind obstacles, highly localized audible enclaves are formed due to the local nonlinear interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the ultrabroadband capabilities of our metasurface-based implementation both numerically and experimentally, spanning from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (6 octave bands), covering the majority of the audible frequency range. The practicality of our proposed technique is underscored by its compact implementation size (0.16 m, equivalent to 0.06 wavelengths at 125 Hz), as well as its robust performance under wideband transient audio signal excitation and in a common room with reverberations. Our proposed audible enclaves hold significant potential for various applications in advanced audio engineering, including private speech communications, immersive spatial audio reproduction, and high-resolution sound/quiet zone control.",

Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell–cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5 , BMP7 , SEMA3A , PDGFC , and FGF7 . This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.",

          "abstract": "Muscle contraction is driven by myosin motors from the thick filaments pulling on the actin-containing thin filaments of the sarcomere, and it is regulated by structural changes in both filaments. Thin filaments are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2+ ] i and by myosin binding to actin. Thick filaments are activated by direct sensing of the filament load. However, these mechanisms cannot explain muscle relaxation when [Ca 2+ ] i decreases at high load and myosin motors are attached to actin. There is, therefore, a fundamental gap in our understanding of muscle relaxation, despite its importance for muscle function in vivo, for example, for rapid eye movements or, on slower timescales, for the efficient control of posture. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) to determine how muscle thin and thick filaments switch OFF in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mouse in response to decreases in either [Ca 2+ ] i or muscle load and to describe the distribution of muscle sarcomere lengths (SLs) during relaxation. We show that reducing load at high [Ca 2+ ] i is more effective in switching OFF both the thick and thin filaments than reducing [Ca 2+ ] i at high load in normal relaxation. In the latter case, the thick filaments initially remain fully ON, although the number of myosin motors bound to actin decreases and the force per attached motor increases. That initial slow phase of relaxation is abruptly terminated by yielding of one population of sarcomeres, triggering a redistribution of SLs that leads to the rapid completion of mechanical relaxation.",

          "abstract": "A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched δ 15 N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant Sus scrofa suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH. We further show selection signatures, associated with coat color and behavior, in Neolithic herds despite recurrent wild gene flow. Altogether, our results show distinct husbandry practices through space and time in Neolithic Europe, with heavy reliance on boar recruitment via the commensal pathway in northwest Europe.",

          "abstract": "Ceramides play a central role in human health and disease, yet their role as systemic signaling molecules remain poorly understood. In this work, we identify FPR2 as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14-C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis via G i -cyclic AMP signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.",

We determined a 3.1-Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of dimeric human PINK1 stabilized at an endogenous array of mitochondrial TOM and VDAC complexes. Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22. Our structure explains how human PINK1 is stabilized at the TOM complex and regulated by oxidation, uncovers a previously unknown TOM-VDAC assembly, and reveals how a physiological substrate traverses TOM40 during translocation.",

However, fundamental mechanical properties, such as the ice flow law and viscosity structure, remain under debate. In this work, by leveraging remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning, we provide evidence over several ice shelves that the flow law follows a grain size–sensitive composite rheology in the compression zone. In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts. Both are essential for predicting the future mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.",

Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters. Although previously overlooked, this process may contribute considerably to global N 2 O emissions through its occurrence in fresh and marine surface waters.",

We captured axonemal dynein motors in their pre–power stroke state. Comparing atomic models between pre– and post–power strokes defined how dynein structural changes drive sliding of adjacent DMTs during flagellar beating.

Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality. Our results suggest that the melanosome variation and color expansion seen in extant mammals may have occurred during their rapid radiation and diversification after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.",

By inverting these data, we mapped the extinction curve parameter R ( V ) within the Milky Way in three dimensions and within the Magellanic Clouds in two dimensions. These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions. Star-forming regions have high R ( V ) values, indicating either preferential destruction of small dust grains or additional supply of large dust grains in those regions.",

TNTLs extended from cardiomyocytes (CMs) to contact endocardial cells (ECs) directly.

          "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.",

Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.",

The liver resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, form the hepatic firewall to clear many encapsulated bacteria in the blood circulation but fail to control certain high-virulence capsule types. Here we report that the spleen is the backup immune organ to clear the liver-resistant serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading human pathogen. Asplenic mice failed to control the growth of the liver-resistant pneumococci in the blood circulation. Immunologic and genetic analyses identified splenic red pulp (RP) macrophages as the major phagocytes for bacterial clearance. Furthermore, the plasma natural antibodies against the cell wall phosphocholine and the complement system were necessary for RP macrophage–mediated immunity. These findings have provided a conceptual framework for the innate defense against blood bacterial infections, a mechanistic explanation for the hyper-susceptibility of asplenic individuals to S. pneumoniae , and a proof of concept for developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against encapsulated pathogens.",

However, most experimental systems either ignore gradients or fail to capture gradients in mechanically relevant contexts. Here, we use microfluidic experiments and biophysical simulations to explore how host-relevant shear flow affects antimicrobial gradients across communities of the highly resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.",

This study uses an in vitro human cerebral organoid model with multiomic analysis, integrating advanced microscopies and single-cell RNA sequencing, to monitor tissue oxygen tension during neural development. Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids. The timed oxygen tension elevation can be suppressed by hypoxia treatment or silencing of neuroglobin gene. This study provides insights into the role of oxygen in early neurogenesis from functional, genotypic, phenotypic, and proteomic aspects. These findings highlight the significance of the timed tissue oxygen tension elevation in neurogenesis and provide insights into the role of neuroglobin in neural development, with potential implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic strategies.",

This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.",

Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) aberrantly activate to myofibroblasts during AVS, driving the fibrotic valve phenotype in females. Myofibroblasts further differentiate into osteoblast-like cells and produce calcium nanoparticles, driving valve calcification in males. We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells. We found that UTY modulates the osteoblast-like cell phenotype in response to nanoscale cues uniquely in male VICs. Overall, we reveal a previously unidentified role of UTY in the regulation of calcification processes in males during AVS progression.",

          "abstract": "Lipid homeostasis is critical to neuronal survival. ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis. Although chromatin intratumoral heterogeneity is a characteristic feature of GBM, most current studies are conducted at a single tumor site. To investigate the GBM-specific 3D genome organization and its heterogeneity, we conducted Hi-C experiments in 21 GBM samples from nine patients, along with three normal brain samples. We identified genome subcompartmentalization and chromatin interactions specific to GBM, as well as extensive intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity at these levels. We identified copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) and demonstrated how they disrupted 3D genome structures. SVs could not only induce enhancer hijacking but also cause the loss of enhancers to the same gene, both of which contributed to gene dysregulation. Our findings provide insights into the GBM-specific 3D genome organization and the intratumoral heterogeneity of this organization and open avenues for understanding this devastating disease.",

The ability to measure and monitor the dynamic progression of tissue stiffness is important for generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. Methods to measure tissue properties in vivo have been emerging but present challenges with spatial and temporal resolution especially in 3D, by their reliance on highly specialized equipment, and/or due to their invasive nature. Here, we introduce light sheet elastography, a noninvasive method that couples low-frequency shear waves with light sheet fluorescence microscopy by adapting commercially available instruments. With this method, we achieved in toto stiffness mapping of organ-stage mouse and zebrafish embryos at cellular resolution. Versatility of the method enabled time-lapse stiffness mapping during tissue remodeling and of the beating embryonic heart. This method expands the spectrum of tools available to biologists and presents opportunities for uncovering the mechanical basis of morphogenesis.",

This record expands our understanding, derived from instrumental monitoring (73 years), historical documentations (173 years), and paleotempestological records (2000 years), to the past 5700 years. A total of 694 event layers were identified. They display a distinct regional trend of increasing storminess in the southwestern Caribbean, which follows an orbitally driven shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Superimposed short-term variations match Holocene climate intervals and originate from solar irradiance–controlled sea-surface temperature anomalies and climate phenomena modes.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.",

The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis. Together, our results reveal that NPY/NPY1R signaling is a previously unidentified antimetastatic target in PC.",

Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.",

Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4. Last, mechanistic studies show that Z24 inhibits thiamine biosynthesis by binding to Bcthi4 and induces up-regulation of alternative splicing [alternative 5′ splice site (A5SS)] of the Bcthi4 gene.

Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.",

Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids.

WUI fires have notable impacts on key air pollutants [e.g., carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), and ozone (O 3 )]. The health impact of WUI fire emission is disproportionately large compared to wildland fires primarily because WUI fires are closer to human settlement.

          "abstract": "Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) show an excellent application perspective in semiconductor optoelectronic devices. However, problems of ligand loss during the growth, purification, film formation, and storage process always induce the aggregation and ripening of QDs, adversely affecting QDs’ and QD-based devices’ performance. Here, we use a bidentate molecule to control ripening toward a notable performance boost in CsPbI 3 QDs. The strong interaction between QDs and the bidentate molecules maintains stable surface states of QDs, inhibiting QDs’ undesirable ripening and generation of defects. We fabricate QD-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.0% at 686 nm and an operating half-life of 10,587 hours at an initial radiance of 190 mW sr −1 m −2 (equivalent to a luminance of 100 cd m −2 for green perovskite LEDs). Benefiting from the high storability of the target QDs, the as-fabricated devices based on the QD solution storing for 1 month show a maximum EQE of 21.7% (20.3% for 3 months).",

In this work, the cause of coloring in the STRAP-recycled polyethylene (PE) resins from postindustrial printed films was identified as decomposed diarylide pigments. Two different approaches are needed to completely remove the dissolved colorants during the STRAP process including (i) adding an activated carbon (AC) adsorbent to the solvent after polymer dissolution and (ii) proper mechanical filtration of the polymer-solvent cake to remove as much solvent from the cake as possible. Colorless recycled PE can be produced by a combination of the proposed approaches (choosing the proper solvent, adding an AC adsorbent, and doing proper mechanical filtration) with minimal accumulation of colorants in the recycled STRAP solvents. This study demonstrated that high-quality STRAP low-density PE can be obtained from printed plastic films, enhancing the potential circularity of these packaging materials.",

Herein, this work proposes the use of therapeutic vaccines to selectively target and eliminate harmful bacteria within tumors. A multivalent vaccine encapsulating both insoluble and soluble bacterial antigens was developed, addressing the shortcomings of traditional antibacterial vaccines by balancing broad antigen coverage with effective immune activation. This vaccine induces robust downstream immune responses to eliminate F. nucleatum , S. sanguis , E. faecalis , and S. xylosus , demonstrating notable therapeutic and preventive efficacy in bacteria-induced cancer metastasis models. Unexpectedly, vaccinated infected mice showed even slower tumor metastasis than uninfected mice. Overall, this study validates the potential of nanovaccines in modulating the intratumoral microbiome for tumor therapy and highlights tumor-associated bacterial infections as potential promising antitumor targets.",

This study focuses on the fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.",

Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100.

The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O 2 and H 2 O, efficiently generating H 2 O 2 . The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H 2 O 2 /Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death. Thus, the porous titanium scaffold, engineered with a piezoelectric nanoreactor, demonstrates superior antibacterial efficacy under ultrasound and facilitates osteogenesis via piezoelectric immunomodulation–activated therapy.",

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics.",

          "abstract": "Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and Max-like protein X (MLX) form a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that couples intracellular sugar levels to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",

We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.",

The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein.

We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem.

Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic.",

The choice of counterions and the assembly temperature influence the isothermal assembly of several DNA motifs and designed three-dimensional DNA crystals. Molecular dynamics simulations show more fluctuations of the DNA structure in select monovalent ions (Na + and K + ) compared to divalent ions (Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ). A key highlight is the successful assembly of DNA motifs in nickel-containing buffer at temperatures below 40°C, otherwise unachievable at higher temperatures or using an annealing protocol. DNA nanostructures isothermally assembled in different ions do not affect the viability of fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myotubes or the immune response in myoblasts. The use of ions other than the typically used magnesium holds key potential in biological and materials science applications that require minimal amounts of magnesium.",

          "abstract": "Stretched-exponential protein refolding kinetics, first observed decades ago, were attributed to a nonnative ensemble of structures with parallel, non-interconverting folding pathways. However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.",

          "abstract": "Lead halide perovskites hold great promise for photovoltaics and optoelectronics, yet ion migration continues to challenge their long-term stability. Here, combining first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics, we unravel the interplay between perovskite octahedral lattice dynamics and energy barrier associated with ion migration. Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties. These findings highlight B-site engineering as an effective microstructural strategy for controlling ion migration, with important implications for stable and lead-reduced perovskite devices.",

The hydrogen bonds shorter than 2.5 angstrom are expected to accelerate the ion transport. However, short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) can hardly form naturally because of the electron-withdrawing capability of O atom, which impedes its applications in water-mediated ion transport. This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs.",

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes.",

The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.",

Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic.

We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density.

This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates.
