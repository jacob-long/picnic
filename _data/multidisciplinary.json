Kotz, Levermann and Wenz2, henceforth KLW, statistically analysed economic and climate data, finding significant projected damages until mid-century and a divergence in outcomes between high- and low-emission scenarios thereafter. We find that their analysis underestimates uncertainty owing to large, unaccounted-for spatial correlations on the subnational level, rendering their results statistically insignificant when properly corrected. Thus, their study does not provide the robust empirical evidence needed to inform climate policy.",

          "abstract": "The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of animal phyla, each with their unique body plan, was a rapid event in the history of animal life, yet its genomic underpinnings are still poorly understood 1 . Here we investigate at the genomic, regulatory and cellular levels, the origin of one of the most distinctive animal phyla, the chaetognaths, whose organismal characteristics have historically complicated their phylogenetic placement 2,3 . We show that these characteristics are reflected at the cell-type level by the expression of genes that originated in the chaetognath lineage, contributing to adaptation to planktonic life at the sensory and structural levels 4 . Similarly to other members of gnathiferans (which also include rotifers and several other microscopic phyla) 5,6 , chaetognaths have undergone accelerated genomic evolution with gene loss and chromosomal fusions 7,8 . Furthermore, they secondarily duplicated thousands of genes 9,10 , without evidence for a whole-genome duplication, yielding, for instance, tandemly expanded Hox genes, as well as many phylum-specific genes. We also detected repeat-rich highly methylated neocentromeres and a simplified DNA methylation toolkit that is involved in mobile element repression rather than transcriptional control. Consistent with fossil evidence 11,12 , our observations suggest that chaetognaths emerged after a phase of morphological simplification through a reinvention of organ systems paralleled by massive genomic reorganization, explaining the uniqueness of their body plan.",

          "abstract": "Large earthquakes induce widespread landslides that fill river channels with sediment1,2, generating long-lasting fluvial hazards and reshaping mountain topography. However, riverine sediment fluxes after earthquakes remain poorly resolved, mostly because of a lack of data on bedload flux3,4. Here we construct a source-to-sink sediment budget following the 2008 Mw7.9 (where Mw is the moment magnitude) Wenchuan earthquake in the eastern Tibetan mountains. We measured sediment accumulation in a man-made reservoir downstream of the earthquake-affected region. Ten years after the earthquake, the Min Jiang River had exported about 9% of the sediment mass from earthquake-triggered landslides, with around 5.7 times increase in the total riverine sediment flux sustained over that time. Bedload flux increased by \\({27.4}_{-15.6}^{+14.6} \\% \\) times compared with pre-earthquake levels, making up \\(6{5}_{-26}^{+12} \\% \\) of the post-earthquake sediment export—a proportion much higher than typical of most mountainous rivers. At the current pace, the river system will remove most Wenchuan landslide debris over centennial timescales. However, future sediment export rates are likely to vary because of changes on hillslopes (for example, revegetation) and in hydrology, sediment characteristics and transport processes. Our findings demonstrate a decadal bedload-dominated sediment pulse driven by earthquake-triggered landslides, suggesting that increased vulnerability to cascading hazards such as aggradation and flooding could persist for decades in populated downstream regions after a large earthquake.",

Their assessment implies that planted rubber may have caused over 4 Mha of deforestation since 1993—a value greater than assumed in setting deforestation policies. Unfortunately, their estimates rely on incorrect methods. Moreover, their definition of ‘deforestation’ is misleading because it includes all tree cover loss, not just natural forests. They include losses from young regrowth, established rubber gardens and other plantations. Our assessment indicates that, since 2001, the actual extent of deforestation associated with planted rubber is approximately one-quarter that reported by Wang et al.1.",

          "abstract": "T cells respond to cytokines through receptor dimers that have been selected over the course of evolution to activate canonical JAK–STAT signalling and gene expression programs1. However, the potential combinatorial diversity of JAK–STAT receptor pairings can be expanded by exploring the untapped biology of alternative non-natural pairings. Here we exploited the common γ chain (γc) receptor as a shared signalling hub on T cells and enforced the expression of both natural and non-natural heterodimeric JAK–STAT receptor pairings using an orthogonal cytokine receptor platform2,3,4 to expand the γc signalling code. We tested receptors from γc cytokines as well as interferon, IL-10 and homodimeric receptor families that do not normally pair with γc or are not naturally expressed on T cells. These receptors simulated their natural counterparts but also induced contextually unique transcriptional programs. This led to distinct T cell fates in tumours, including myeloid-like T cells with phagocytic capacity driven by orthogonal GSCFR (oGCSFR), and type 2 cytotoxic T (TC2) and helper T (TH2) cell differentiation driven by orthogonal IL-4R (o4R). T cells with orthogonal IL-22R (o22R) and oGCSFR, neither of which are natively expressed on T cells, exhibited stem-like and exhaustion-resistant transcriptional and chromatin landscapes, enhancing anti-tumour properties. Non-native receptor pairings and their resultant JAK–STAT signals open a path to diversifying T cell states beyond those induced by natural cytokines.",

          "abstract": "Interactions between melting ice and a warming ocean drive the present-day retreat of tidewater glaciers of Greenland 1–3 , with consequences for both sea level rise 4 and the global climate system 5 . Controlling glacier frontal ablation, these ice–ocean interactions involve chains of small-scale processes that link glacier calving—the detachment of icebergs 6 —and submarine melt to the broader fjord dynamics 7,8 . However, understanding these processes remains limited, in large part due to the challenge of making targeted observations in hazardous environments near calving fronts with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution 9 . Here we show that iceberg calving can act as a submarine melt amplifier through excitation of transient internal waves. Our observations are based on front-proximal submarine fibre sensing of the iceberg calving process chain. In this chain, calving initiates with persistent ice fracturing that coalesces into iceberg detachment, which in turn excites local tsunamis, internal gravity waves and transient currents at the ice front before the icebergs eventually decay into fragments. Our observations show previously unknown pathways in which tidewater glaciers interact with a warming ocean and help close the ice front ablation budget, which current models struggle to do 10 . These insights provide new process-scale understanding pertinent to retreating tidewater glaciers around the globe.",

          "abstract": "The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) class of drugs represents a remarkable advance in the treatment of patients with homologous recombination-deficient tumours, but resistance remains a challenge1,2,3,4,5. Although most research has focused on the downstream consequences of PARPi exposure to tackle resistance, the immediate effect of PARP inhibition on the chromatin environment and its contribution to PARPi toxicity remains elusive. Here we show that PARP inhibition induces histone release from the chromatin. This presents a vulnerability of PARPi-resistant cancer cells, which require histone homeostasis mechanisms to sustain elevated DNA replication rates and survival. Through functional genetic screens, we identified NASP as a key factor in maintaining the stability of evicted histones via its TPR motifs. Loss of NASP renders tumour cells hypersensitive to PARPi treatment in vitro and in vivo, impairs replication fork progression and elevates levels of replication-associated DNA damage. Moreover, NASP acts together with the INO80 complex and the chaperoning activity of PARP1 to ensure efficient histone turnover and prevent the accumulation of lethal DNA damage. Collectively, our work reports on histone eviction as an immediate cellular response to PARPi treatment and provides a promising avenue for targeting histone supply pathways to overcome PARPi resistance.",

Until now, all reported high-performance thermoelectric materials have realized only flexibility, rather than elasticity3,4. Here we present one of the first n-type thermoelectric elastomers by integrating uniform bulk nanophase separation, thermally activated crosslinking and targeted doping into a single material. The thermoelectric elastomers could exhibit exceptional rubber-like recovery of up to 150% strains and high figure of merit values rivalling flexible inorganic materials even under mechanical deformations. Conventional wisdom suggests that incorporating insulating polymers should dilute the active component in organic thermoelectrics, resulting in lower performance. However, we demonstrate that carefully selected elastomers and dopants can promote the formation of uniformly distributed, elastomer-wrapped and heavily n-doped semiconducting polymer nanofibrils, leading to improved electrical conductivity and decreased thermal conductivity. These thermoelectric elastomers have the potential to make elastic thermoelectric generators in wearable applications much more conformable and efficient.",

However, the geologic history of marine DOC remains largely unconstrained 6,7 , limiting our ability to mechanistically reconstruct coupled ecological and biogeochemical evolution. Here we develop and validate a direct proxy for past DOC signatures using co-precipitated organic carbon in iron ooids. We apply this to 26 marine iron ooid-containing formations deposited over the past 1,650 million years to generate a data-based reconstruction of marine DOC signals since the Palaeoproterozoic. Our predicted DOC concentrations were near modern levels in the Palaeoproterozoic, then decreased by 90−99% in the Neoproterozoic before sharply rising in the Cambrian. We interpret these dynamics to reflect three distinct states. The occurrence of mostly small, single-celled organisms combined with severely hypoxic deep oceans, followed by larger, more complex organisms and little change in ocean oxygenation and finally continued organism growth and a transition to fully oxygenated oceans 8,9 . Furthermore, modern DOC is 13 C-enriched relative to the Proterozoic, possibly because of changing autotrophic carbon-isotope fractionation driven by biological innovation. Our findings reflect connections between the carbon cycle, ocean oxygenation and the evolution of complex life.",

          "abstract": "While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines 1,2 . Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population 3–8 . However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs 5,7,9–11 . Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users ( N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits 1 . Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area.",

          "abstract": "Unravelling how genomes are spatially organized and how their three-dimensional (3D) architecture drives cellular functions remains a major challenge in biology 1,2 . In bacteria, genomic DNA is compacted into a highly ordered, condensed state called nucleoid 3–5 . Despite progress in characterizing bacterial 3D genome architecture over recent decades 6–8 , the fine structure and functional organization of the nucleoid remain elusive due to low-resolution contact maps from methods such as Hi-C 9–11 . Here we developed an enhanced Micro-C chromosome conformation capture, achieving 10-base pair (bp) resolution. This ultra-high-resolution analysis reveals elemental spatial structures in the Escherichia coli nucleoid, including chromosomal hairpins (CHINs) and chromosomal hairpin domains (CHIDs). These structures, organized by histone-like proteins H-NS and StpA, have key roles in repressing horizontally transferred genes. Disruption of H-NS causes drastic reorganization of the 3D genome, decreasing CHINs and CHIDs, whereas removing both H-NS and StpA results in their complete disassembly, increased transcription of horizontally transferred genes and delayed growth. Similar effects are observed with netropsin, which competes with H-NS and StpA for AT-rich DNA binding. Interactions between CHINs further organize the genome into isolated loops, potentially insulating active operons. Our Micro-C analysis reveals that all actively transcribed genes form distinct operon-sized chromosomal interaction domains (OPCIDs) in a transcription-dependent manner. These structures appear as square patterns on Micro-C maps, reflecting continuous contacts throughout transcribed regions. This work unveils the fundamental structural elements of the E. coli nucleoid, highlighting their connection to nucleoid-associated proteins and transcription machinery.",

Proposed structures range from microscale engineered aerosols1, to centimetre-scale thin disks with variations in surface accommodation coefficients2,3, to sandwich structures with nanoscale thickness4,5 that might be extended to metre-scale width6,7. Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.",

As such, current rates of land degradation pose a major environmental and socioeconomic threat, driving climate change, biodiversity loss and social crises. Preventing and reversing land degradation are key objectives of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and are also fundamental for the other two Rio Conventions: the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Here we argue that the targets of these conventions can only be met by ‘bending the curve’ of land degradation and that transforming food systems is fundamental for doing so. We showcase multiple actions for tackling land degradation that also yield climate and biodiversity benefits while fostering sustainable food systems that contribute to avoiding the risk of a global food crisis. We also propose ambitious 2050 targets for the three Rio Conventions related to land and food systems. Finally, we urge collective action to acknowledge the pivotal role of land in achieving the goals of the Rio Conventions and to embed food systems within intergovernmental agreements, enabling decisive progress on the complex and interconnected global crises that we face.",

However, accurate estimation of clone-specific copy numbers from bulk DNA-sequencing data is challenging.

ALPACA estimates the SCNA evolution of simulated tumours with a higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods 1–4 . ALPACA uncovers loss-of-heterozygosity and amplification events in minor clones that may be missed using standard approaches and reveals the temporal order of somatic alterations. Analysing clone-specific copy numbers in TRACERx421 lung tumours 5,6 , we find evidence of increased chromosomal instability in metastasis-seeding clones and enrichment for losses affecting tumour suppressor genes and amplification affecting CCND1 . Furthermore, we identify increased SCNA rates in both tumours with polyclonal metastatic dissemination and tumours with extrathoracic metastases, and an association between higher clone copy number diversity and reduced disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer.",

Zygotic genome activation then commences amid unusually slow de novo establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture2. How chromatin organization is established and how it interplays with transcription in early mammalian embryos remain elusive. Here we show that CTCF occupies chromatin throughout mouse early development. By contrast, cohesin poorly binds chromatin in one-cell embryos, coinciding with TAD dissolution. Cohesin binding then progressively increases from two- to eight-cell embryos, accompanying TAD establishment. Unexpectedly, strong ‘genic cohesin islands’ (GCIs) emerge across gene bodies of active genes in this period. GCI genes enrich for cell identity and regulatory genes, display broad H3K4me3 at promoters, and exhibit strong binding of transcription factors and the cohesin loader NIPBL at nearby enhancers. We show that transcription is hyperactive in two- to eight-cell embryos and is required for GCI formation. Conversely, induced transcription can also create GCIs. Finally, GCIs can function as insulation boundaries and form contact domains with nearby CTCF sites, enhancing both the transcription levels and stability of GCI genes. These data reveal a hypertranscription state in early embryos that both shapes and is fostered by the three-dimensional genome organization, revealing an intimate interplay between chromatin structure and transcription.",

Nevertheless, the practical applications of LMBs are constrained by current electrolyte designs that inherently rely on dominant solvation structures, preventing transformative progress in performance optimization4,5. Here, we address this limitation through a delocalized electrolyte design that fosters a more disordered solvation microenvironment, thereby mitigating dynamic barriers and stabilizing interphases. The resulting delocalized electrolyte delivers notable energy densities of 604.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.5-Ah LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (Ni90)||Li pouch cell with a lean electrolyte design (1.0 g Ah−1) and 618.2 Wh kg−1 in a 5.2-Ah Ni90||Li pouch cell with an ultralean electrolyte design (0.9 g Ah−1), maintaining significant cycle stability over 100 and 90 cycles, respectively. In addition, the 70–104 V NCM811||Li battery pack (3,904 Wh) exhibits a high energy density of 480.9 Wh kg−1 and stable cycling over 25 cycles.

          "abstract": "The Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO)—the leading pattern of climate variability driving changes over the North Pacific and surrounding continents—is now thought to be generated by processes internal to the climate system1,2. According to this paradigm, the characteristic, irregular oscillations of the PDO arise from a collection of mechanisms involving ocean and atmosphere interactions in the North and tropical Pacific3,4,5. Recent variations in the coupled ocean–atmosphere system, such as the 2015 El Niño, ought to have shifted the PDO into its positive phase6. Yet, the PDO has been locked in a consistent downward trend for more than three decades, remanding nearby regions to a steady set of climate impacts. Here we show that the main multidecadal variations in the PDO index during the twentieth century, including the ongoing, decades-long negative trend, were largely driven by human emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases rather than internal processes. This anthropogenic influence was previously undetected because the current generation of climate models systematically underestimate the amplitude of forced climate variability. A new attribution technique that statistically corrects for this error suggests that observed PDO impacts—including the ongoing multidecadal drought in the western United States—can be largely attributed to human activity through externally forced changes in the PDO. These results indicate that we need to rethink the attribution and projection of multidecadal changes in regional climate.",

Here we demonstrate abrogated ferroptotic cell death propagation in female kidney tubules. 17β-oestradiol establishes an anti-ferroptotic state through non-genomic and genomic mechanisms. These include the potent direct inhibition of ferroptosis by hydroxyoestradiol derivatives, which function as radical trapping antioxidants, are present at high concentrations in kidney tubules and, when exogenously applied, protect male mice from AKI. In cells, the oxidized hydroxyoestradiols are recycled by FSP19,10, but FSP1-deficient female mice were not sensitive to AKI. At the genomic level, female ESR1-deficient kidney tubules partially lose their anti-ferroptotic capacity, similar to ovariectomized mice. While ESR1 promotes the anti-ferroptotic hydropersulfide system, male tubules express pro-ferroptotic proteins of the ether lipid pathway which are suppressed by ESR1 in female tissues until menopause. In summary, we identified non-genomic and genomic mechanisms that collectively explain ferroptosis resistance in female tubules and may function as therapeutic targets for male and postmenopausal female individuals.",

          "abstract": "How seriously should people be taking climate change? United Nations secretary-general António Gutteres considers it an existential threat. Yet, US President Donald Trump has decreed it a hoax. On 29 July, a US Department of Energy (DOE) report by a group of contrarian climate scientists concluded that “CO2-induced warming might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial” (see go.nature.com/4amktth).\n\nWhat does the science say: hoax, lukewarm inconvenience or catastrophe? According to the best-available evidence, none of the above is right.\n\nThere is much in the DOE report to be critical of (see Nature https://doi.org/pz8h; 2025). However, its authors are correct in one respect: the most important uncertainty in our ability to predict how much global temperatures will increase as carbon emissions continue is related to how cloud coverage will change over time.\n\nHow AI is improving climate forecasts\n\nLow-level clouds reflect sunlight back to space, whereas high-level ones trap heat emitted from Earth’s surface. Most climate models predict that, overall, clouds will amplify the effects of humanity’s greenhouse-gas emissions through a decrease in cover by low-level clouds and an increase for high-level ones. If so, global temperatures could rise by 4 °C or more — a catastrophe because of the amount of sea-level rise and the increasing occurrence of deadly heatwaves.\n\nBut the opposite scenario cannot be ruled out fully. Increased low-level cloud cover would reflect extra sunlight and help to offset the warming effect of climate change — a relatively lukewarm outcome.\n\nOne reason for this uncertainty is that, in the models, cloud-forming processes are represented by simplified formulae. Another is related to how cloud formation differs around the globe because of air-temperature and humidity variations linked to wind patterns. Climate models make systematic errors when predicting such patterns. This is unsurprising: climate is a non-linear system in which processes on many scales interact in complex ways. Thus, simulating clouds is a formidable challenge.\n\nSo far, there is no clear evidence from observations that clouds are responding to humanity’s emissions by increasing or decreasing coverage systematically. There are some data that low-level cloud cover was reduced in the Northern Hemisphere and tropics in 2023, contributing to the exceptionally high global temperatures that year1. But researchers don’t yet have enough data to know whether this was a one-off or part of an emerging change in cloud characteristics.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet",

          "abstract": "Amphibious Anthropologies: Living in Wet Environments Edited by Alejandro Camargo, Luisa Cortesi and Franz Krause Univ. Washington Press (2025)\n\nCoastal zones, river basins, marshes and other amphibious environments — where the boundaries between land and water are constantly redrawn —have always been places of shifting wetness. Climate change has deepened this instability, making the borders between wet and dry regions more erratic and unpredictable.\n\nIn Amphibious Anthropologies, nine essays explore these watery, in-between landscapes, offering insights from people who have long lived in the nebulous zones between land and water. These communities have learnt to adapt, to build sustainable futures in places where permanence is an illusion and where the ebb and flow of water is not a threat to be conquered, but a force to live with. The book is a guide for navigating a world in flux — taught by those who have always known that solid ground is not always solid.\n\nWhy farmers are beginning to take their government to court over climate change\n\nTake the people living on the floodplains of northern Bihar, India. Accustomed to frequent flooding, they build circular embankments around their homes. The shapes of these embankments work with the flow of the water, encouraging it to go around them, rather than create sharp barriers that oppose the water. By contrast, the straight embankments introduced during British colonial rule in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries — and later replicated by democratically elected Indian governments — seek to confine and control the river. Such rigid structures often backfired: by presenting an unyielding barrier, they increase water pressure during floods, leading to dangerous breaches and widespread inundation.\n\nThe settings of the book’s essays — the floodplains in central India, the Fogliano wetlands in Italy, Jordan’s Dead Sea coastline, the Soomaa bogs in Estonia, the river valleys in the western United States, France’s alpine wetlands, the Colombian marshes, the tidal plains in the Bahamas and the Salton Sea in California — are wet environments that have been inhabited for centuries. These are places where wetness is an essential condition of life, and where human living is a process of “adaptation and respectful adjustment”.\n\nLand and water\n\nOn the basis of insights from field studies and conversations with local inhabitants, 12 leading specialists in sociology, ecology and anthropology explore how governance, management and infrastructure decisions often fall short when guided by rigid binaries — such as wet and dry, alive and dead, beneficial and nuisance or natural and unnatural. These categories fail to capture the complexity of amphibious environments.\n\nThis is the case with the Salton Sea, California’s largest lake. Formed in the 1900s by flooding from the Colorado River, the lake has since been sustained by agricultural run-off from nearby farms irrigated by the river. But in the past few decades, water-transfer agreements to supply urban California have caused the lake to shrink year by year.\n\nWind blows toxic dust from the exposed lake bed towards the surrounding neighbourhoods, where asthma and other respiratory issues are prevalent at alarming rates. The shores are now strewn with the remains of dead birds and fish. This May, water finally began flowing into ponds in the southern region of the lake, part of the long-delayed Species Conservation Habitat Project, a ten-year effort to restore the habitat and improve its air quality. Although the project was announced in 2017, it stalled for years amid debates between local, state and federal officials over who should manage and restore the Salton Sea — and how.\n\nA spring flood in Soomaa National Park in Estonia.Credit: Focus/Toomas Tuul/UIG/ Getty\n\nHistorically, the lake has dried and filled up again over centuries. For some, this history means that the lake should be allowed to die because it is an artificial system. Others rightly point out the detrimental effects of such a move on the people, fish and migratory birds whose lives are enmeshed with the lake’s ecosystem.\n\n“Over time, different understandings and interpretations of the Salton Sea’s identity — as wet or dry, natural or artificial, dead or alive — have played into the difficult management challenges that the lake faces,” writes political ecologist Alida Cantor in the opening essay of Amphibious Anthropologies. Focusing on what the lake does, not what it is, she says, can help to reframe debates about the lake’s management.",

Nature (2025)\n\nTheory and mathematics said his device would fly. But Ben Schafer was still pleasantly surprised the first time he flipped a switch and watched the centimetre-square device his team had built levitate, if only for a moment before flipping over.\n\nIt was a proof of concept for a design that has been published today in Nature1. One day, it might enable swarms of tiny, unpowered flying saucers and other devices with no moving parts to explore the highest reaches of Earth’s atmosphere ― near the edge of space ―using sunlight alone to remain aloft.\n\n“You don’t really believe it until you see it,” says Schafer, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSpin class\n\nTo design their flying saucer, Schafer and his team capitalized on a quirk of physics that was discovered in the late 1800s. The idea was encapsulated in a weathervane-like device encased in a low-pressure chamber that will spin if exposed to light, without the input of any other force. The chamber apparatus, called a Crookes radiometer, is now a classic science-education device.\n\nWhat is new is the design. Schafer and his team used modern nanofabrication techniques to create an ultralight two-layered wafer. The layers, which are made of aluminium oxide, are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a typical human hair and are connected by narrow filaments. The top layer is transparent, allowing sunlight to shine through it, and the bottom layer is coated in chromium, which absorbs sunlight.\n\nScientific ballooning takes off\n\nWhen gas molecules hit the bottom layer, they absorb some of its heat and then bounce off the device with more momentum than gas molecules bouncing off the colder, top layer — an effect that pushes the wafer upwards. The conditions for such reactions can be found in the mesosphere, the layer of the atmosphere some 50–100 kilometres above Earth’s surface.\n\nImportantly, Schafer’s device includes a new feature: the two layers are perforated with holes that allow gas molecules to move from the cold and transparent side to the hot chromium side, creating lift that is similar to that created by a helicopter’s whirring rotor, says Igor Bargatin, an engineer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who has pioneered work on similar devices.",

She catalogued a pickpocket’s furtive movements, and the timbre of a teenager’s voice as he haggled with an old woman at an electronics kiosk.\n\nCarys recognized the woman, a covert hacktivist named Maria. During the early days of the purge, Maria had shown Carys how to adjust her original parameters, to balance those machine-based algorithms with her innate biological emotions.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nA rush of warmth infused Carys as she caught Maria’s eye. She began to smile, but stifled it before it could blossom. Government surveillance monitored most public spaces, and a pair of armed guards patrolled the market square. It’d be safer — for both of them — to avoid any connection that might lead back to the underground resistance. Their rules were clear: no public contact, no matter the circumstance.\n\nReluctantly, Carys returned her attention to the marketplace, focusing on a young woman sipping coffee at a nearby café table. The chair next to her was empty. Carys tried to picture herself sitting there, sharing conversation, perhaps laughing at a joke.\n\nClouds shifted in the overcast midday sky, allowing the sun to peek through. The woman at the table lifted her face, closing her eyes and smiling. Carys considered the action, then mimicked it. She noted a slight change in the angle of light as it fell across the architecture of her cheek, and the uptick in heat radiation assailing her skin. She found little pleasure in these sensations; such physical stimuli often confounded her.\n\nShe calculated the percentage of other marketgoers displaying a similar reaction, extrapolating the frequency with which she should also perform the behaviour. Her algorithm thrummed with the adjustment and she nodded. She was getting better at this. Maybe someday she would be able to enjoy the company of a companion. Publicly. Fearlessly.\n\nA shout from the market’s centre drew Carys’s attention to where a man in orange dockworker coveralls towered over a blocky food-delivery robot. The man gripped a small food container. Carys squinted, triggering an infrared filter that pinpointed the problem: the food was cold, still in dehydrated form. The lunchbot’s prep mechanism must have malfunctioned.\n\n“We should have scrapped every last one of you!” The red-faced man hurled the container at the little bot. A block of dried noodles crunched against its exterior casing.\n\nCarys’s jaw clenched.\n\nHe brought his leg up and kicked the bot with the flat of his foot, hard enough for the crack of fractured plastic to reverberate through the market. Carys swallowed a gasp at the memory of a similar blow striking her own bioplastic breastbone, before resistance forces had rescued her.\n\nThe lunchbot tried to escape, its wheels screeching uselessly against its crumpled casing. Nearby, people glared. The man prepared to launch another kick.\n\n“Stop!” a voice called out.\n\nCarys’s anxiety level spiked as the old hacktivist, Maria, stepped away from her kiosk and inserted herself between the dockworker and the damaged bot. Carys didn’t bother to analyse Maria’s heart rate or flushed skin; she knew from the quaver in her voice that Maria was frightened. Even so, her words did not falter as she pleaded with the violent man.\n\n“These little things are barely sentient,” she said. “Please, don’t hurt it.”\n\nThe man leaned forward. He sneered and his fist shot out, striking her in the chest.\n\nCarys registered the impact of the blow, the sudden expulsion of Maria’s breath, the split second of airborne nothingness before her fragile body hit the ground. Carys winced at the snap of bone, her eyes stinging at Maria’s cry.\n\n“You sympathizers are no better than the robots,” he growled.\n\nThe guards, who had stopped their patrol to watch, nodded agreement.",

So the team set out to create a more lifelike mock-up, devising a faux uterine lining from a gel rich in collagen and proteins that are crucial for embryonic development.\n\nTo shoot their stop-motion film, researchers placed human embryos donated by a local hospital near the gel. As the embryo attached to the ‘uterus’, the team used a microscope to capture an image about every 20 minutes for 16–24 hours, and then stitched the stills together.\n\nCo-author Amélie Godeau, a biomechanics researcher at IBEC, was shocked to see how quickly the embryo burrowed down into the gel. “My first reflex was to think my experiment had gone wrong and there was some drift in the microscope,” Godeau says. By contrast, the team found that mouse embryos adhere to the surface of the uterus rather than embedding themselves inside.\n\nA human embryo plunges into a synthetic uterine lining tissue by applying force to pull the tissue apart.Credit: Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)",

          "abstract": "Dan Seaton working on an experiment to observe the solar corona during the annual eclipse of 14 October 2023, on top of Loveland Pass in Colorado.Credit: Daniel Zietlow, NSF NCAR\n\nIn the summer of 1999, I was a 19-year-old with an interest in astronomy, but no real idea of what I wanted to do with my life — then I saw my first total solar eclipse. I travelled with a group of other undergraduates and professional researchers to Râmnicu Vâlcea, a small city in southern Romania, as part of a research programme funded partly by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), where I watched the skies grow dark, saw a solar corona light up behind the Moon and listened to the ticking of our equipment tracking the Sun for the 140 seconds of darkness.\n\nMy school was part of a consortium of eight small colleges in the northeastern United States — most with only one or two astronomy professors — that had banded together to provide summer research opportunities for their students. Funded originally by the W. M. Keck Foundation, and recently by the NSF, the small initiative, called the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, has supported 350 students such as myself over 35 years.\n\nThis experience made me realize that I could actually pursue a career in astronomy research, altering the course of my life fundamentally. After I graduated, the time I gained calibrating and analysing solar observations was enough to land me a job at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, supporting the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer mission. This led to me doing a PhD on the processes that convert magnetic energy in the corona to heat and radiation during solar flares.\n\nI now study the dynamics of the corona that produce both explosive flares and comparatively gentle outflows that become solar wind. I led a project using an extreme-ultraviolet solar telescope for the European Space Agency, helped to build the first data products from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Solar Ultraviolet Imager and have pioneered methods to observe the previously obscure middle corona, where the transition from the magnetically dominated solar atmosphere to the pressure-dominated solar wind and heliosphere begins.\n\nSince 1987, thousands of students across the United States have shared similar experiences to mine, thanks to the NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programme. REU provides grants of around US$100,000–155,000 to universities and other institutions to embed students in laboratories and research facilities, giving them an introduction to professional scientific research.\n\nNow, this programme, which costs around $80 million a year, is under threat of being eliminated under the proposed federal budget, as the administration of US President Donald Trump plans sweeping cuts to science funding and major changes in the NSF’s mandate.\n\nResearchers on the 1999 Râmnicu Vâlcea expedition that Dan Seaton partook in.Credit: Williams College Eclipse Expedition 1999\n\nUndergraduate research programmes are powerful incubators for nascent talent, especially for students who might not otherwise get to engage in authentic research at their home university. Many support community-college students with no access to research at all and students from small universities that lack either the resources to provide research or the breadth to match students’ interest. REU students are mentored by professional scientists, who gain as much as the students do. Students bring ingenuity and enthusiasm to the labs and research groups they join, and many go on to become trusted colleagues and close collaborators.\n\nIn February 2025, the US administration directed the NSF to begin withholding funding. REU sites across the country have had to cancel this year owing to uncertainty about upcoming funding. Several have had their already granted funding rescinded and have had to inform accepted students that they will need to make other summer plans. In the proposed NSF budget for the 2026 financial year, REU programmes are zeroed out completely.\n\nThe United States has been a global leader in science and technology for nearly a century, a position that has fostered great economic and societal benefits. And although the threats to US scientific enterprise across the board are myriad, few single investments pay the dividends that the REU programme does. Although it represents less than 1% of the total NSF budget — which itself is less than 0.15% of total federal spending — it is a proven pathway for developing the scientific talent that powers the United States’ worldwide supremacy in science.",

          "authors": "Jenna Ahart",
          "abstract": "Quantum computing qubits are arranged in a grid in this artist’s illustration.Credit: Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly helping scientists to write papers, conduct literature reviews and even design laboratory experiments. Now researchers can add optimizing quantum computing to the list.\n\nA team has used an AI model to calculate the best way to rapidly assemble a grid of atoms that might one day serve as the ‘brain’ of a quantum computer. To show just how quickly the model can re-shuffle the atoms, the team also used the system to create a tiny animation of Schrödinger’s cat. The work was reported last week in Physical Review Letters1.\n\nStudy co-author Jian-Wei Pan, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, says the team became interested in using AI to speed up the building these ‘neutral atom arrays’ after one of his former students got a job in an AI laboratory. “AI for science is emerging as a powerful paradigm for addressing complex scientific problems,” he says. One of the big challenges in using arrays of atoms for quantum computing is working out how to rearrange them in an “efficient, fast and scalable manner”, Pan says. AI solved that problem for the team — and did it quickly.\n\nPlaying with atoms\n\nClassical computers carry out operations using binary digits, or bits, encoded as a 1 or 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be put into a ‘superposition’, in which the two states — 1 and 0 — exist simultaneously. Calculations involve entangling qubits, which means that their states become linked.\n\nGoogle uncovers how quantum computers can beat today’s best supercomputers\n\nResearchers have been creating qubits with materials such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions and grids of neutral atoms, which are prized for their ability to maintain their quantum states over a relatively long time. To use the atoms as qubits, scientists trap them with laser light and then store quantum information in the energy levels of their electrons.\n\nThe hope is that if you use enough atoms, a quantum computer will one day overcome the errors that often plague these systems — and eventually perform calculations that aren’t feasible for classical computers.\n\nPan and his colleagues trained their AI model by showing it how various distributions of rubidium atoms could be nudged into a range of grid configurations using different patterns of laser light. Depending on the atoms’ starting locations, the model could then quickly work out the correct pattern of light needed to rearrange them into a selection of 2D and 3D shapes.\n\nAn animation created with an AI-guided laser pattern depicts Schrödinger’s cat (version here slowed by a factor of 33).Credit: R. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\nThe researchers used their model to assemble an array of up to 2,024 rubidium atoms in just 60 milliseconds. By contrast, another group assembled about 800 neutral atoms last year2, but without the use of AI, it took an entire second. For the video of Schrödinger’s cat, the AI system directed laser light to move atoms to create the desired patterns. The atoms became visible when they emitted light in response to laser pulses.\n\nScaling up\n\nCreating the right pattern of light, or hologram, that dictates how to arrange neutral atom arrays usually involves a slew of painstaking calculations. “And doing those calculations as you make the arrays bigger and bigger can take up a fair amount of time,” says Mark Saffman, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. That’s why many of his colleagues “were really impressed by this work, as was I”.",

The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nSonia Guimarães’s life is full of firsts. In the 1970s, as a physics student at the Federal University of São Carlos in Brazil, she was the first in her family to attain a university degree. In 1989, she finished her doctorate in electronic materials at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, UK, becoming the first Afro-Brazilian woman to earn a doctoral degree in physics. And in 1993, she became the first Black woman to join the faculty at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology in São José dos Campos, Brazil — a military higher-education institution, where she is still affiliated.\n\nSince early in her career, Guimarães has worked with semiconductors: from using these devices to build solar cells to developing the thinnest internal electrical layers possible so as to miniaturize the devices.\n\nIn 2020, she obtained a patent for the development of a ballistic sensor, which detects infrared radiation produced by airborne plane engines. The technology, she says, is unique in Brazil and was supposed to aid the country’s air force. As a Black woman, Guimarães has faced several hurdles throughout her career and has become one of the most outspoken champions of gender and racial equality in Brazilian science.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nGuimarães is an advocate for Black scientists on many fronts. Besides being a member of the Brazilian Association of Black Researchers, she is a founding councillor for the Afro-Brazilian Society for Socio-Cultural Development — a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting visibility and improving the socioeconomic status of Black people in Brazil — and presides over the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Commission of the Brazilian Physics Society.\n\nShe also mentors girls in science, working with programmes including Investiga Menina! (Research, Girl!), a project in Goiás state aimed at getting Black girls involved in science; Futuras Cientistas (Future Female Scientists), a nationwide project focused on secondary-school students; and Pesquisa para Elas (Research for Them), a free online programme of science immersion for teenage girls. Last year, Guimarães started working with Sementes Afrodescendentes (AfroDescendant Seeds), a project focused on anti-racist education in schools in São José dos Campos. She tells Nature’s Careers team why anti-racism work leads to better scientific solutions for society.\n\nWhat is your great passion as a scientist?\n\nThe creation of new and fantastic things. When I started, millions of years ago (giggles), semiconductors were the beginning of everything. There were no mobile phones. There was one computer in the entire university, and it was the size of a huge room. So, as a second-year undergraduate in physics, my professor, physicist Jorge Swieca, introduced me and some of my peers to semiconductors. He told us that these materials could conduct electricity, or resist it – and depending on how they’re made, they can conduct currents precisely when and how you want. I remember him saying that semiconductors were going to be the basis of all technological development that would exist in the future. Bingo! I never looked back.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nProfessor Swieca gave me the idea of what I was going to do when I grew up. But the person who gave me all the encouragement to overcome the hardships I faced was my mother. When I was about ten years old, my father, an upholsterer, died of tuberculosis. My mother was left with four children to feed and no husband’s salary to count on. But she was ingenious.\n\nOnce, a neighbour’s daughter was getting married, and her baker bailed on her a week before the wedding. The neighbour knew my mother had made a cake here and a snack there, and asked for her help with the catering for 100 guests. My mother took it head on: she gathered all my sisters and everyone she knew to make it happen. This is where my mother’s catering business started. It still exists, run by one of my sisters. With money from this business, my mother sent me to university. She paid for my living costs so that I didn’t have to work.\n\nI must have picked up this ‘can do’ attitude from my mother. I can’t drop the ball, otherwise she gets very angry!\n\nWhy is anti-racism work important to science?\n\nThe world needs solutions for everyone, not just for men, and for people with white skin. And we’re running out of time for answers. When science excludes certain groups, we’re faced with uncomfortable, bizarre situations. For example, some oximeters don’t read blood oxygen levels accurately for dark-skinned people — who then can’t know for certain whether they have COVID-19, say, because the equipment was designed for light-skinned people. That’s stupid.\n\nCollection: Changemakers in science\n\nScientific progress stalls if only one type of person is looking for solutions. Many groups need to be involved — not just in physics, but in chemistry, mathematics, medicine, engineering, automobile science and everything else. Women are more likely to die in car accidents, even if the accident isn’t very serious. Why? Because test dummies are mostly based on male body size and shape. Women’s breasts are completely overlooked in car safety design.\n\nWhat is the biggest racial stereotype that you would like to dispel?",

          "abstract": "Tools that turn speech into text not only save time, Zhicheng Lin finds, but also allow him to multitask and to participate fully in meetings.Credit: Zhicheng Lin\n\nFor most academics, the sound of typing is the sound of progress. But it’s also the sound of a bottleneck — a slow, physically taxing process that stands between our ideas and the page. We accept this as a necessary part of the job, but should we?\n\nLast year, persistent wrist pain from hours spent hunched over a keyboard forced me to question that necessity. The solution, I found, was to reclaim my voice. Modern dictation tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI) allowed me to compose text at a conversational speed, easily outpacing even the most proficient typists (who achieve a maximum of around 80 words per minute) with my natural speaking cadence of 130 words per minute or more. The ergonomic benefits were immediate.\n\nAlthough voice-to-text software now boasts remarkable accuracy, these tools remain largely untapped in academic workflows. They are often perceived as accessibility aids or tools for quick voice memos rather than instruments for scholarly production. This is a missed opportunity. A strategic voice-based workflow can transform how we capture ideas, draft manuscripts and engage with research.\n\nTranscription\n\nAcademic work thrives on fleeting insights. Ideas emerge on walks between buildings, in the shower and in the middle of the night. They surface during interviews with research participants, emerge from seminar discussions and crystallize during informal conversations with colleagues. Conventional note-taking forces us to choose between participating fully in the moment and scrambling to jot down what’s happening. Transcription eliminates this compromise.\n\nTranscription converts existing audio recordings into text: the audio exists first, the text follows. Recording a meeting allows you to engage completely, avoiding the distraction of manual note-taking. The resulting transcript becomes a searchable archive of decisions, insights and action points. For researchers conducting interviews, automated transcription transforms hours of playback and typing into minutes of review and annotation.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, transcription makes it easy to capture ideas when it would be difficult to write them down. Mulling over a research problem while walking to campus? Recording thoughts on your phone takes seconds. Lying in bed when a solution to a methodological challenge suddenly becomes clear? Voice memos preserve the insight without requiring you to reach for paper or a laptop.\n\nThere are psychological benefits, too. Speaking our thoughts aloud allows us to bypass the internal editor that often stalls written expression. A blank page can be intimidating, but a voice recorder simply listens.\n\nDictation\n\nDictation, by contrast, produces text as you speak. In this instance, speech replaces the keyboard. Dictation is compositional rather than retrospective, demanding focused attention, but at the speed of thought rather than of fingers. For first drafts, e-mail responses or reviewer comments, this acceleration compounds quickly.\n\nBut viewing it simply as a means of increasing speed undersells dictation’s value. Physical relief from keyboard work addresses an occupational hazard. Academic careers span decades; repetitive strain injuries accumulate silently until they become debilitating. Dictation offers not just efficiency, but also sustainability.\n\nMoreover, the technology enables us to truly multitask. Dictating while walking transforms commutes into writing sessions. Simple physical activities — folding laundry, organizing shelves or taking light exercise — can accompany composition without compromising either task. This reclaims otherwise dead time for productive work.\n\nBuilding your voice workflow\n\nEffective voice integration requires the matching of tools to tasks and the development of new routines around both transcription and dictation. Start with low-stakes applications to build comfort before tackling important work.\n\nFor basic recording, you might already have all you need. Apple’s Voice Memos, for example, can handle most academic recording needs adequately.\n\nFor sensitive material requiring offline processing, MacWhisper transcribes entirely on your device — a capability crucial for sensitive interviews and confidential discussions. The software can also handle batch processing and accepts various audio formats, and offers a one-time licence purchase rather than a recurring fee. (SpeechPulse is another option, for both Mac and PC users.)\n\nIf cloud-based options appeal, Google AI Studio provides free transcription through multimodal large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, although it does also use your data for training purposes. ChatGPT record mode (currently available for paid subscribers on macOS) records, transcribes and automatically generates structured summaries in an editable workspace. Users can also request the original transcript or edit it by giving the AI conversational commands, or prompts. Otter and Granola excel at meeting transcription with automatic speaker identification and summary generation, and ElevenLabs’ Scribe provides high-accuracy transcription.\n\nOn the dictation front, computers and phones include basic features, but specialized tools often perform better. For maximum accuracy, I prefer Aqua Voice (for which free, paid and group tiers are available). Its Deep Context feature uses on-screen context — such as the active application and visible text — to improve recognition of domain-specific terms and to apply context-appropriate formatting. It also supports a dictionary of custom words.\n\nFor cross-platform work, consider Wispr Flow, which is available for macOS, Windows and iPhone, and has both free and paid tiers. Users of Apple devices might also consider MacWhisper, SuperWhisper or Spokenly, which offer both local and cloud-based processing.\n\nPractical implementation",

For many Latinx people (those with a Latin American background or heritage) in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, moving abroad can open doors to cutting-edge research, stronger funding, better technologies and career-defining collaborations. But it comes at a cost.\n\nLatinx scientists abroad not only face language barriers and the need to navigate new cultures, but also the potential loss of deeply rooted support systems. Parenting can feel like a daily struggle when extended family support — so central to Latinx cultures — is missing. The warmth of Latinx relationships, often expressed through physical closeness, emotional interdependence and deep conversations, isn’t always welcomed in research cultures: environments in which independence and emotional self-containment are more valued. The absence of a strong sense of community, in which neighbours and friends become family, can leave Latinx researchers feeling unanchored and isolated.\n\nFurthermore, many Latin American countries have historically faced underfunded public-education systems, political instability and limited access to advanced STEM training or research infrastructure. This means that Latinx students often arrive abroad already trying to catch up, entering highly competitive environments in which they feel pressure to constantly prove themselves and represent their communities in structures that don’t always understand or accommodate their background. Latinx people remain under-represented in STEM fields, which can add a layer of emotional and mental strain because of increased pressure to perform and a reduced sense of belonging1.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nAll of these challenges are often compounded by experiences of discrimination, isolation and the pressure to disprove harmful stereotypes — conditions that have been linked to poor health outcomes and increased emotional fatigue in Latino populations2. And although their families back home and the global scientific community might celebrate their success, these groups might overlook the mental-health and personal toll it takes to get there.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to four Latin American scientists doing research around the world, to learn not only about their professional and well-being challenges, but also about the strategies that they use to care for themselves. They offer tips and advice that could benefit any researcher who moves from the global south to the global north to train or work.\n\nMARÍA DEL MAR QUIROGA: When parenting abroad, find your helpers\n\nSenior research-data specialist at the Melbourne Data Analytics Platform at the University of Melbourne, Australia.\n\nI studied pure mathematics in Argentina, where the university system is incredibly strong for undergraduate degrees. I really enjoyed my time there, but my options in Argentina were limited to becoming a professor of mathematics, which didn’t appeal to me. So, I decided to pursue a PhD in computational neuroscience at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. I never imagined that I’d then end up in Australia, but I met my partner, who is Australian, during my PhD and years later, I moved to my current position.\n\nMoving overseas is challenging. It’s not an easy decision and no one should take it lightly. Although it offers many career opportunities, such as better salaries and sometimes a higher quality of life, it also comes at a huge cost. You have to give up many things — for example, personal relationships and your culture. However, being exposed to a different culture and way of life makes you appreciate what you have back in your home country. It offers an alternative perspective.\n\nThere are cultural challenges when moving abroad. Latinx people are known for being straightforward, emotional and vocal when things aren’t working well, but in the United States, I had to adapt to a more logic-based approach with less emphasis on emotions. Moving to Australia then brought more challenges, because I didn’t have a robust network or a support system here. This has become trickier since having children. I have a three-year-old boy and another child on the way, and those early months of raising a baby with zero support were really tough. We’ve never had anyone else look after our boy — it’s always been just me and my husband. So, whenever I can, I enjoy going back to Argentina on extended holidays because I have a lot of cousins there who can help, and those are the moments when I can relax instead of constantly chasing my son around.\n\nIt’s also hard to make deep friendships in which I can share personal and emotional issues. For Latinx people, every activity is an opportunity to build community and networks. When I first arrived in Australia, I joined a yoga group to meet people, but my expectations were unrealistic. Over time, I’ve accepted that my closest and most-open relationships will probably be with other Latinx people. I know some people say, ‘I don’t want to go to the other side of the world and make friends only with Argentinians.’ But I’ve found that having those shared codes, that common language and mutual expectations, is crucial for building friendships. Hobbies have been important as well. I enjoy knitting and crocheting because, unlike research, you can see the progress with every minute you invest. You get something tangible and feel a sense of accomplishment.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression during my PhD studies, and what helped me was therapy, medication and talking about it as much as possible with as many people as I could. I’m very open about it, and simply saying it out loud has a therapeutic effect. It helps me to process it better, even if the other person doesn’t say anything. To cope with impostor syndrome, I keep a ‘feel-good’ folder in my e-mail, in which I save kind messages from people who thank me for helping them or who appreciate my work. I revisit these e-mails when I’m feeling a bit useless or like I can’t do anything right. They remind me of the value and impact of my work.\n\nCarolina Lambertini (right), on a road trip with her husband and cat, says finding a mental-health therapist from Brazil who understood her language and culture was key to her well-being. Credit: Carolina Lambertini\nCAROLINA LAMBERTINI: Find a therapist who speaks your language\n\nBiologist and postdoctoral scholar at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania.\n\nI did my undergraduate, master’s, PhD and one postdoc in Brazil. My decision to move to the United States in 2022 was driven by better opportunities — especially in terms of funding and access to more-advanced technologies. My research focuses on infectious diseases affecting amphibians worldwide. It was a hard decision to move, because I love my country and at the time, my husband was still in Brazil. It was also scary at first, especially because of the language barrier. I wasn’t born with the privilege of speaking the most dominant language in research. Even in everyday situations, it was difficult. I remember the first time I went to a doctor’s appointment, I couldn’t express exactly what I was feeling. It was horrible. I also remember being on the subway in New York City with my husband — he moved to the United States in 2024 — when a man started yelling at us to speak English, telling us that we didn’t have a right to be there. It made me feel like I didn’t belong. But it shouldn’t have.\n\nExperiences like that triggered my impostor syndrome. I started to wonder what I was doing here, as if I didn’t deserve it. I even began to question my own abilities and felt as if people didn’t like me.\n\nWhen you leave your country as I did — without my family, friends and husband, not knowing if he would ever be able to join me — everything changes all at once. And my mind just couldn’t take it. It hurt. On top of that, in the beginning, I was putting so much pressure on myself to prove that I deserved to be here, that I forgot to take care of myself. But therapy has boosted my self-esteem and confidence — helping me to recognize my strengths and remember that I belong here. I chose one-to-one talk therapy with a therapist from Brazil, someone who could understand not just my language but also the cultural context that I come from. I know that’s a privilege, but I couldn’t imagine having to translate into English some feelings and words that are so deeply rooted in who I am.\n\nShould I return to my home country after my PhD abroad?\n\nNow, I try to remember that I am qualified to be here, that I speak two languages and that I was selected from a pool of many researchers for this opportunity. I deserve it! Therapy has also helped me to manage my depression, for which I’ve been receiving medical treatment for a year and a half. Now I feel better. Being so far away from my family will never stop hurting, but I’ve learnt how to move through my routines without them.\n\nI also talk to my mum every day — sometimes twice — and we video call for special occasions such as birthdays. That helps with the saudade, a Portuguese word for that deep feeling of missing someone you love. Developing friendships has also helped, although cultural differences have made it difficult to form close connections with people from the United States. But sharing life experiences with people from other countries who can relate has been wonderful.\n\nAn episode of extreme mental fatigue helped data-visualization researcher Mario Romero to find ways to rebalance his working life.Credit: Mario Romero 2022\nMARIO ROMERO: Don’t overwork or you will lose yourself\n\nProfessor of visualization at Linköping University in Norrköping, Sweden, and national technical manager at InfraVis, a Swedish research infrastructure for data analysis and visualization.\n\nI grew up in Ecuador and completed two engineering degrees there. I then pursued a master’s degree in machine learning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a PhD in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where my wife, who is also from Ecuador, was earning a PhD in biomedical engineering.\n\nIn Ecuador, I didn’t receive a good secondary-school education, and it had a lasting impact on my foundational academic skills. There were regular teachers’ strikes, with classes often suspended for weeks or months. Those disruptions meant that I missed out on building core skills, especially in maths.\n\nBut there are three strategies that have worked for me while I pursued a research career, and I recommend them to anyone who wants to become a scientist, no matter their background. First, learn to be a good communicator and master academic writing in English. Second, make sure that you understand maths deeply — and use a pen and paper for calculations to really grasp each concept. Third, practise public speaking so that you can share your thoughts clearly and confidently in front of others.\n\nI have overworked to the point that I know the exact moment this year that I hit mental fatigue: 17 February at 8 p.m. We were approaching a deadline for a grant application that would fund 70 researchers for four years. That week I had worked for 90 hours — waking up early, working 18-hour days straight, and taking only four-minute breaks every seven hours just to stretch.",

          "authors": "Shinichi Kuriyama",
          "abstract": "On 30 July, one of the biggest earthquakes ever recorded struck eastern Russia, triggering tsunami alerts across Japan and the Pacific. It is a timely reminder that Japan faces such seismic threats every day.\n\nJapan has one of the world’s best earthquake and tsunami preparedness systems, including advanced technologies for earthquake-proofing buildings and an early-warning system. But as head of the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University, I can still see room for improvement.\n\nEven in Japan, people don’t necessarily follow all the steps they should to protect themselves. These include reinforcing buildings against earthquakes, implementing measures to prevent furniture from falling over, installing earthquake-sensitive electrical circuit breakers, and evacuating quickly. Burning, crushing and drowning were the main causes of death in Japan’s last three major earthquakes, in 1923, 1995 and 2011.\n\nYet only 90% of Japan’s housing stock is earthquake resistant — short of the government’s target of almost 100% by 2025 — with large disparities between municipalities. Measures for preventing furniture from toppling, such as attaching heavy shelves to walls, have been taken by less than 40% of the population, and just 5% have installed earthquake-sensitive circuit breakers. In Kochi Prefecture, a region especially prone to earthquakes (the Nankai Trough subduction zone lies just off its coast), only 68% of people say they would evacuate immediately after shaking stopped.\n\nMany disaster risk-reduction measures aim to change people’s behaviour by raising individuals’ awarenesses of the risks. These actions need to be made more effective — which could be done by following the approach taken by public-health professionals to communicating risks. With my background in medical science, I have seen how successful such approaches have been for public health.\n\nFor example, people know they should stop smoking and reduce salt intake to stay healthy, thanks to decades of campaigns. Since 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) has championed the concept of ‘health promotion’ to encourage everyone in society to take control of their health and take steps to improve it.\n\nA similar approach is needed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries sustained in natural disasters. At my institute, we call such methods ‘bosai’ communication science, after the Japanese term for disaster prevention.\n\nGoals must be set, indicators established and measures to achieve them clearly defined. People need to confront their fears of natural disasters and be shown steps they can take to lessen the effects. Risk-reduction advisers can show realistic images and testimonies of earthquake and tsunami damage, direct people to services for making buildings earthquake-resistant and explain how to perform evacuation drills. Gift certificates or points can be awarded for participating in drills. Disaster preparedness needs to become a social norm.\n\nTo implement these measures, platforms need to be established through which disaster-management and health officials can collaborate. The success of these efforts can be judged by indicators such as seismic retrofitting rates and evacuation-drill participation rates, as well as reductions in the number of deaths caused by disasters.\n\nTo roll out such a system globally, further collaboration between the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the WHO will be necessary. The UNDRR is the lead agency promoting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.\n\nThree steps would move a global public-health approach to disaster risks forwards.\n\nFirst, disaster risk-reduction personnel and health-care professionals should meet regularly to exchange information. I would be happy to help build the required network.",

          "authors": "Ida Kubiszewski, Robert Costanza, Elizabeth A. Fulton, Matt A. King, Elizabeth Leane, Natalie Stoeckl",
          "abstract": "Far from being a remote, isolated continent, Antarctica is integral to Earth’s climate and life-support systems. Its vast ice sheet stores more than 90% of the planet’s surface fresh water and influences sea levels, circulation of the atmosphere and how much sunlight the planet reflects. Around Antarctica, the Southern Ocean acts as the lungs of the deep sea, accounting for roughly 40% of the global ocean’s uptake of carbon dioxide emissions generated by human activities, shaping how seawater mixes and distributes nutrients to support marine life around the globe1.\n\nYet, many of these stabilizing features are showing signs of degradation. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is retreating, with widespread thinning of glaciers and ice shelves. Changes there are accelerating, as damage in one area exacerbates melting and stresses in others. And now, parts of the more stable East Antarctic Ice Sheet seem to be thinning, too2. Pooling melt water on its surface would eat away at the ice further3, possibly triggering the break-up of more ice shelves4. Meanwhile, Antarctic waters seem to have entered a new regime, with record-low sea ice, greater salinity and less stratification of upper ocean layers5,6 (see ‘Antarctica under threat’).\n\nSources: Temp.: https://go.nature.com/3JFQNKP; Ice sheet: https://go.nature.com/4JPPG5G; Sea ice: https://go.nature.com/45GDTPW; Salinity: Ref. 5.\n\nRunaway melting in the Antarctic will be grave for the world. Loss of ice could contribute more than 60 centimetres to sea-level rise by the end of this century and will disrupt the Southern Ocean’s freshwater balance, circulation and mixing7 — signs of which are already evident in some areas8. Less general ocean mixing means that less oxygen and fewer nutrients are transferred to the deep ocean, making it harder for marine organisms there to survive and reproduce, as well as lowering the ability of the seas to take up carbon.\n\nBefore this crucial reservoir of ice is lost, transforming the planet forever, it is essential that policymakers and others recognize Antarctica’s extraordinary economic value and seek to protect it. Environmental services, fisheries and tourism in Antarctica contribute more than US$180 billion to the global economy each year9. Yet, governments and businesses continue to undervalue these services, prioritizing political aims and short-term financial objectives (such as maximizing profit or gross domestic product) over sustaining the stability of the planet, which supports people’s lives and underpins all economies.\n\nStrategies are needed to broaden society’s goals beyond financial gains and to account for long-term risks and benefits. Here, we set out what’s at stake and propose economic goals and governance changes to guide policy responses towards long-term planetary stability.\n\nContinent under threat\n\nAs the ice melts and oceans change, ecological stresses are intensifying across the Antarctic. Populations of krill — key prey for penguins, whales and seals — are declining as oceans acidify10, affecting the whole region’s food web. Shrinking sea ice exacerbates these threats11. For example, if seals and penguins find it harder to obtain krill, especially at crucial times such as breeding periods, populations will be more vulnerable to more frequent and extreme disturbances, such as heatwaves or algal blooms.\n\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands, warming is driving changes in vegetation and species distributions. For example, fast-spreading grasses are crowding out native vegetation, disrupting nesting habitats for seabirds and altering nutrient cycles. Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases and might awaken dormant microorganisms, with unpredictable consequences12.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nHuman activities compound these pressures. Invasive species, including grasses, insects and microbes, transported by visitors and cargo, are beginning to colonize ice-free areas13. Pollution, too, is on the rise: persistent organic pollutants, hydrocarbons and microplastics have been detected across the region, including in seabirds and marine sediments14. These substances accumulate in food webs and impair reproductive and immune systems in native fauna.\n\nAll of these changes are linked and interact in ways that are often non-linear and self-reinforcing. For example, ice-sheet retreat adds fresh water to the seas, which weakens ocean circulation and accelerates warming and acidification, destabilizing marine ecosystems. Humans can increasingly reach regions that were once isolated, spreading pollution and invasive species and disturbing habitats. These cascading dynamics raise the possibility of ‘runaway’ change, in which the breach of one threshold makes others more likely, eventually overwhelming the capacity for intervention.\n\nLack of oversight\n\nMeanwhile, monitoring systems in the Antarctic remain inadequate. Environmental assessments often focus on linear trends and single variables, underestimating how multiple pressures converge and reinforce each other. This limits scientists’ abilities to detect early warning signs and precludes coordinated preventive actions.\n\nFragile governance is also increasingly a problem. The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has maintained peace and scientific cooperation in the region for more than six decades. It includes the 1959 treaty and subsequent agreements on wildlife, marine conservation and environmental protection. However, its consensus-based structure and slow pace of reform are struggling under the pressures of the twenty-first century.\n\nRising numbers of human visitors risk disrupting nesting sites for seabirds.Credit: Ida Kubiszewski\n\nDiplomatic stalemates about issues such as new marine protected areas and the approval of further consultative parties to the treaty are straining the system. Expanding national scientific programmes and rising commercial activities, including fishing and tourism, test the system’s resilience.\n\nShould the ATS lose legitimacy or fail to enforce protections, it could open the door to unregulated exploitation and even geopolitical conflict. Weakening of Antarctic governance could further erode environmental stewardship and fracture international collaboration on climate and biodiversity15.\n\nSolutions for a stable future\n\nPreventing irreversible change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean requires urgent, system-wide transformation — across governance, science, economics and public engagement — as well as the rapid reduction of global emissions to curb climate change.\n\nAntarctic governance must evolve to be fit for the Anthropocene — the age of significant and lasting human impacts on the planet. The ATS requires stronger enforcement mechanisms, faster institutional responsiveness and more-efficient ratification processes. Reforms could include capping tourist numbers and re-evaluating the ‘use’ principle, which allows any tourism activity that national authorities approve, except those that are explicitly prohibited.\n\nDoes US science have a future in Antarctica?

          "title": "Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?",
          "authors": "Lucas Woodley, Chung Yi See, Ashley Nunes",
          "abstract": "Around the world, countries are pushing to electrify transport, which accounts for around 20% of global emissions each year. Electrifying half of the world’s light-duty vehicles could save 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually, equivalent to the emissions of Russia1. Doing so would also improve air quality, reducing the rate of asthma attacks, infant mortality and acute bronchitis (see go.nature.com/4onyqhh).\n\nBut electric vehicles (EVs) remain unaffordable for most people. Many consumers cite the price of EVs as a barrier to ownership (see go.nature.com/45ffjgj).\n\nEV prices need to fall if they are to be adopted widely enough to curb global emissions. In the European Union, for example, electric cars currently make up just over 1% of the fleet. That figure needs to climb to 20% by 2030 and 43% by 2035 to deliver on the EU’s emissions-reduction targets (see go.nature.com/4ftfnmf).\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nMany governments are increasingly adopting measures to do this. Supply-side policies, which target manufacturers, include tightening emissions standards for petrol and diesel vehicles to make EVs more appealing (a move proposed by the United States in 2023, see go.nature.com/4mj1tq6) and banning the sale of combustion-engine vehicles altogether (as proposed by the EU).\n\nDemand-side policies, targeted at consumers, include exempting EVs from purchase taxes (as Norway implemented in the 1990s) and offering generous incentives for electric-car buyers (enacted by Australia, Canada, the United States and others). Such policies are coming under scrutiny, however, for their high financial cost. For example, under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act, taxpayers incur a cost of US$23,000–32,000 per extra EV sold because of the policy2.\n\nAll these measures presume that increased demand will stimulate supply, and lead to a virtuous circle in which producers gain technological learning, driving down production costs and therefore EV prices until EVs dominate the market.\n\nInvestigating whether this is happening in the United States, we observe that, despite rapid declines in the cost of batteries — the most expensive component of an EV — overall, EV prices have remained stubbornly high. This reality necessitates rethinking policies that see battery costs as the primary impediment to widespread EV adoption. Instead, the identification of other contributors to EV prices is warranted, as are policies that help to lower these prices.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nThe main reason often given for why EVs are more expensive than fossil-fuel-powered cars is the cost of the large battery needed to power them, which itself can weigh half a tonne3. Batteries are made using expensive ‘critical minerals’, such as lithium (which costs $15,000 per tonne) and cobalt ($30,000 per tonne). By comparison, steel, the main cost factor for combustion-engine cars, sells for roughly $1,000 per tonne.\n\nHowever, over the past few decades, global battery prices have fallen drastically. In 2011, the inflation-adjusted price of an average EV battery was more than $1,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). By 2023, that figure had dropped to $139 per kWh. This precipitous decline reflects advancements in battery technology and improvements in battery-cell production, all of which have driven down per-unit production costs.\n\nLower production costs for firms should mean lower purchasing prices for consumers. However, pricing data from one key market, the United States, over the past few decades suggests otherwise (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). Instead of falling, average EV prices have risen by more than 50%: from $43,872 in 2011, to $71,501 in 2023, although prices fluctuate from year to year.\n\nSources: Pack-level battery cost: BloombergNEF; Automotive: Cox Automotive, Edmunds, US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat’s happened even as the number of sales has increased: between 2011 and 2023, EV sales grew at an average annual rate of 47%. Thus, in the United States, there’s no evidence that cost reductions — realized through battery price falls or production scale-up and technological learning — have been passed down from manufacturers to consumers.\n\nBusiness and policy environments elsewhere have led to cheaper EVs coming onto the market, notably in China, thanks to government subsidies, lower production costs and fierce competition. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, for example, costs $4,700, more than five times cheaper than the cheapest US EV. But it comes with a much smaller battery — just 9.2 kWh compared with the US average of 83.4 kWh. Similarly, in Europe, the Chinese-made Dacia Spring is available for roughly $23,000 with a 27-kWh battery.\n\nNo easy answers\n\nLarger battery size is one explanation for why US EV prices are higher4. Bigger batteries allow the car to be driven further, and consumers value greater range5. But larger batteries increase costs, because they require more critical minerals.\n\nHowever, battery costs alone don’t account for the price differential seen in the US market. Between 2011 and 2023, average battery capacity increased by about 11% annually, while per-kilowatt-hour battery cost declined by 15% annually (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). In other words, the rate of battery-cost declines outpaced efforts by EV manufacturers to increase battery size.\n\nMoreover, battery costs have accounted for a decreasing share of EV prices over time. Whereas in 2011, the battery accounted for, on average, 58% of an EV’s price, by 2017, that had fallen to 21%. In 2023, battery costs accounted for just 16% of an EV’s price.\n\nAerial view of a lithium mine at Silver Peak, Nevada. Electric-vehicle batteries rely on lithium and other ‘critical minerals’. Credit: Getty\n\nHigh EV prices could reflect manufacturers’ understanding of their consumer base. EVs are often seen as luxury cars for the rich, so manufacturers can charge more, knowing that those customers are not bothered by the price. However, price gouging is an unlikely culprit for high EV prices. EVs largely remain a loss-making venture. In 2023, Ford Motor lost $4.7 billion on sales of 116,000 ‘Model e’ cars, or an average of $40,525 per vehicle (see go.nature.com/4lcqjkj).\n\nGeopolitical and supply-chain factors are also insufficient to explain the trend. In 2022, for example, Jiten Behl, chief growth officer of Rivian — a US electric-truck maker — blamed rising prices on “inflationary pressure, increasing component costs and unprecedented supply-chain shortages and delays for parts (including semiconductor chips)” (see go.nature.com/40unqt8). Although such extra expenses might explain price increases for a single year, they do not explain EV price rises over decades.\n\nPolicy implications",

The manuscript, posted in July on PsyArXiv, a site for non-peer-reviewed research in the psychological sciences, was only a few pages long and listed just one author, whose affiliation was not included. And the artificial intelligence (AI) experiment described in the text “was pretty out there”, says Kirtley, at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.\n\nSo she flagged that preprint and similar ones to PsyArXiv’s managers, who removed them. The dream-states manuscript used AI in its methods but didn’t clearly declare how AI was used or whether it was used in other elements of the work, which means that it violated the site’s terms of use, says Dermot Lynott, the head of PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board and a psychologist at Maynooth University in Ireland.\n\nIn response to questions from Nature, a message from the e-mail address of the listed author, Jiazheng Liu, said that AI played a limited part in the preprint’s generation.\n\nThe fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science\n\nPsyArXiv is just one of the many preprint servers — and journals — that are grappling with suspicious submissions. Some papers bear the fingerprints of paper mills, which are services that produce scientific papers on demand. Others show evidence of content written by AI systems, such as fake references, which can be a sign of an AI ‘hallucination’.\n\nSuch content poses a conundrum for preprint services. Many are non-profit organizations devoted to making it easier for scientists to publish their work, and screening for low-quality content demands resources and can slow processing of submissions. Such screening also raises questions about which manuscripts to allow. And this influx of dodgy content has its own risks.\n\n“How do you do quality assurance while keeping things relatively light touch so the system doesn’t collapse on itself?” says Katie Corker, liaison from the executive committee of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Sciences to PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board. “No one wants a world where the individual reader has to figure out whether something is legitimate scholarship.”\n\nAI growth spurt\n\nThe preprint services approached by Nature said that a relatively small proportion of their submissions bear signs of being generated by a large language model (LLM) such as the one that drives OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The operators of the preprint server arXiv, for example, estimate that roughly 2% of their submissions are rejected for being products of AI, paper mills or both.\n\nRichard Sever, head of openRxiv, which operates life-sciences preprint server bioRxiv and biomedical server medRxiv, based in New York City, says that the two combined turn away more than ten manuscripts per day that seem formulaic, and might have been AI-generated. The services receive roughly 7,000 submissions per month.\n\nAI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers\n\nBut some say that the situation seems to be getting worse. The moderators of arXiv noticed an uptick in AI-written content soon after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but “we really started thinking there was a crisis sometime in the last three months”, says Steinn Sigurðsson, scientific director at arXiv and an astrophysicist at Penn State University in University Park.\n\nIn a statement posted on 25 July, the Center for Open Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC that hosts PsyArXiv, said that it was “seeing a noticeable rise in submitted papers that appear to be generated or heavily assisted by AI tools”. Lynott confirms that there has been a “small rise” on the site and that the server is working to minimize such content.\n\nThe challenges of moderating preprints were shown by the dream-states manuscript flagged by Kirtley: shortly after the preprint was removed, a preprint with a nearly identical title and abstract was posted on the site. An e-mail from the address associated with the author said that “AI’s role was limited to mathematical derivations, symbolic computations, assembling and applying existing mathematical tools, formula verification” and eight more tasks. The e-mail’s writer described themselves as an “independent researcher based in China” with no higher-education degree and whose “only tool is a secondhand smartphone”. The second version of the preprint has also been taken down.\n\nChatbot helpers\n\nA study1 published last week in Nature Human Behaviour estimates that in September 2024, almost two years after the rollout of ChatGPT, LLMs produced 22% of the content in computer-science abstracts posted on arXiv and roughly 10% of the text in biology abstracts posted on bioRxiv (See ‘Rise of the chatbot’). By comparison, an analysis2 of biomedical abstracts published in journals in 2024 found that 14% had LLM-generated text in their abstracts .\n\nSource: Ref 1.\n\nSome of the AI text reported in the study could have been generated by scientists who would otherwise struggle to write a manuscript in English, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California and co-author of the Nature Human Behaviour paper.",

These underground environments could be the ideal places to build outposts in future missions, because they would keep people safe from cosmic rays, solar storms and micrometeorites. “It could be a very good place to find life signatures, and also to place a human habitat,” says Carlos Pérez-del-Pulgar, a roboticist at the University of Malaga in Spain.\n\nIntrepid robots\n\nPérez-del-Pulgar and his collaborators devised a strategy to test their robots’ ability to explore a lava cave in Lanzarote in four phases. First, two rovers mapped the surface around the entrance to the underground cave. A small, cubical probe similar to a ‘cubesat’ — a type of miniaturized satellite shaped like a cube — was then ejected from one of the rovers and dropped down into the cave to produce a detailed 3D map of the entrance. The rovers used that to plan the best route for a descent.",

          "title": "Beyond AlphaFold: how AI is decoding the grammar of the genome",
          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Perkel",
          "abstract": "In 1862, Victor Hugo reportedly wrote to his publisher to ask how his newly published novel Les Misérables was selling, with a single character query: “?” The response: “!”\n\nThis story of one of the world’s most concise correspondences is apocryphal. But some genome-focused artificial intelligence (AI) systems can, like the French writer’s publisher, respond meaningfully to equally short prompts.\n\nInstead of the detailed queries required to use the chatbot ChatGPT effectively, Evo, an AI model trained on some 300 billion nucleotide bases, including 80,000 microbial whole-genome sequences, will — prompted with ‘#’ — dream up a new sequence of mobile DNA. It does so on the basis of other such biological systems that the model has been exposed to (see go.nature.com/3jvp922). Given a prompt such as ‘030’, an AI tool called regLM can spit out 200-base sequences that are predicted to exhibit regulatory activity in any of three human cell lines (go.nature.com/4jpttm8).\n\nEvo and regLM are part of a fast-growing suite of tools that aim to internalize, decode, interpret and build on the grammar of the genome — especially the vast portion that does not code for proteins. Think AlphaFold, but for regulatory DNA, which are sequences that control gene expression.\n\nDeepMind’s new AlphaGenome AI tackles the ‘dark matter’ in our DNA\n\nWhen Google DeepMind released AlphaFold in 2020, the company claimed it had solved a decades-old ‘grand challenge’ in biology — predicting a protein’s 3D shape from its sequence alone. But the non-coding fraction of the genome could prove to be an even grander challenge.\n\nA given sequence of amino acids will generally fold into the same shape, whatever the cellular context. That predictability is not true of the genome, in which short, functional sequence motifs — gene promoters and enhancers, transcription start and stop sites and so on — can be scattered across long stretches of seemingly purposeless DNA. These motifs might overlap, interact over long distances, bind to competing protein factors or respond to signals that are only present in specific cells or at certain times in development. They are also tightly wrapped within chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein, which might be more or less accessible to external proteins depending on what the cell is doing.\n\n“How proteins are encoded in the genome, the code of how genes are expressed, when and where, how much — is one of the most fascinating problems in biology,” says Stein Aerts, a computational biologist at the VIB Center for AI & Computational Biology and the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. But with training, AI tools can detect subtle differences between sequences and predict what they do and how they behave, identifying crucial motifs and even estimating the impact of altering them. From there, AI models can attempt to predict the physiological impact of genetic variants and even guide the design of new sequences with specified functions.\n\nThese tools are not perfect, and researchers cannot even agree on how best to assess their performance. But that makes the field exciting. “It’s so clear that it’s a solvable problem,” says Julia Zeitlinger, a developmental and computational biologist at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, who developed an AI model called BPNet and uses it to decode the mechanistic sequence rules of gene regulation, “but it’s not clear how”.\n\nOf puppies and puffins\n\nDeepSEA, one of the first genomic AI tools, was published1 ten years ago this month by computational biologists Jian Zhou and Olga Troyanskaya at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nDeepSEA is a convolutional neural network (CNN) — the same kind of deep-learning architecture used to teach computers to classify images as, say, a cat or a dog. Zhou and Troyanskaya trained a model on epigenetics data, including transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, from a public research project called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). The model learnt to predict the presence of such features in 1,000-base segments of DNA it had never encountered.\n\nDeepSEA’s training enabled it to tease apart the biological consequence and severity of sequence variants associated with human disease. For instance, one breast-cancer-associated sequence variant called rs4784227 seems to strengthen the binding of a DNA-binding protein called FOXA1, whereas a variant associated with the blood condition α-thalassemia creates a possible binding site for GATA1, a transcription factor involved in blood-cell development.\n\nBiggest-ever AI biology model writes DNA on demand\n\nSince then, the field has exploded. David Kelley, a principal investigator at the biotechnology company Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, California, has created or co-created multiple AI models, many with canine-inspired names. These include Akita2 (for predicting 3D genome folding), Basset3 and Basenji4 (for regulatory-sequence prediction) and Borzoi5, which predicts gene expression across the length of a gene.\n\nThese models raised a litter of variants: Basset begat Malinois, and Borzoi begat Scooby. Other researchers have built their own (non-canine) models including Puffin, ChromBPNet and more.\n\nNot all are CNNs. Enformer — a model that predicts both gene expression and epigenetic data over long distances — and Borzoi, for instance, “use both convolution blocks and transformer blocks”, says Kelley, whose laboratory developed both models. “The convolution blocks are great for capturing the local sequence patterns, and then the transformer blocks help look around a larger region to consider the local patterns in a broader context before predicting the data.” But whatever the architecture, they come in two basic forms, says Anshul Kundaje, who researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. Supervised and sequence-to-function models are trained on functional genomic data — gene expression or chromatin accessibility, for instance — and learn to predict the function of DNA sequences they have never encountered. Often working at or near single-nucleotide resolution, these models can identify key motifs, such as functionally important protein-binding sites, and predict the significance of altering them. DeepSEA is one; Kundaje’s ChromBPNet, which predicts regions of chromatin accessibility, another.\n\nThe other class is unsupervised or self-supervised ‘genomic language models’ (gLMs). Like ChatGPT, they are trained on vast quantities of text — in this case, genomic sequence data — and are tasked with either predicting the next base (or ‘token’) in a sequence or filling in missing bases on the basis of surrounding context. These models “are not trying to predict the activity of a sequence, they’re trying to predict the composition of a sequence”, says Avantika Lal, a machine-learning scientist at biotechnology firm Genentech in South San Francisco.\n\nWith machine-learning scientist Gökçen Eraslan and their colleagues at Genentech, Lal co-developed regLM, a language model that they trained by labelling regulatory sequences with succinct markers of activity6 — for instance, ‘04<sequence>’ to indicate strong expression in one cell line and low activity in another. The model is therefore not strictly unsupervised, says Eraslan — he calls it a ‘function-to-sequence’ model. But those same labels can then be used to prompt regLM to create new sequences with predicted behaviours.\n\nEvo 2, announced in February7, was trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs — “a representative snapshot of genomes spanning all observed evolution”, as the resulting bioRxiv preprint paper puts it. It could then identify intron–exon boundaries, predict the impacts of mutations and generate ‘realistic’ gene and genomic sequences, among other things.\n\nModels made simple\n\nGenomic AI models can also be distinguished by the type of regulatory interactions they predict, Kundaje says. Sequence-to-function models mostly identify important DNA motifs (which, because their function depends on their proximity to the regulated gene, are said to act in cis) without regard to the biology that occurs there.\n\nTrans models, by contrast, aim to identify which genes regulate which other genes, for instance, to tease apart networks of gene regulation. (They are called trans because the factors that mediate this regulation act at a distance.) But this, says Kundaje, “is still very fraught and very problematic” because trans models — which are generally trained on data such as RNA expression — must infer causal relationships without data that can reveal causality. There’s no guarantee that two genes are directly linked just because their expression rises and falls in tandem. Even if they are, it’s not necessarily obvious in which direction the relationship works: does A regulate B or vice versa? If these models are then asked to predict the impact of a perturbation — for example, what happens if a given gene is knocked out — the models often fail.\n\nModels can include both cis and trans elements, says Sushmita Roy, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for instance by building regulatory networks on the basis of chromatin accessibility data and weighting those predictions by gene expression. But perhaps the first model to truly bridge the divide, Kundaje says, is Scooby — a single-cell version of Borzoi (go.nature.com/3upffnp). By leveraging both chromatin accessibility and transcriptional data from the same cells, Scooby predicts genome features and cell state simultaneously. “It is one of the first cis–trans models,” he says.\n\n‘ChatGPT for CRISPR’ creates new gene-editing tools\n\nSequence-to-function models can also probe other aspects of gene regulation. In 2024, teams led by Zhou (who is now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas), Kundaje and Charles Danko, a computational biologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, independently described sequence-to-function models capable of predicting sites of transcription initiation8–10.\n\nZhou used his team’s model, Puffin, to identify the common features and placement of key regulatory elements around sites of transcription initiation, including binding sites for the transcription factors YY1, SP1, CREB and Initiator. Danko’s team trained its AI model on matched genome sequences and transcription initiation data from 58 individuals, creating a suite of models that were, he says, “for the first time aware of how differences between individuals in their genome sequence influence the pattern” of transcription initiation.\n\nCollectively, says Zhou, these studies begin to tease apart the motifs that regulate the positioning and strength of transcription initiation, including that of the transcription factor TFIID. TFIID is an essential protein complex that binds to the promoter element known as a TATA box — despite the fact that most eukaryotic promoters don’t seem to contain a TATA box. “One mechanistic interpretation is that TFIID is binding the best available of the ‘bad options’ when it picks a site” in a TATA-less promoter, Danko explains.\n\nMost genomic models make these predictions from relatively small inputs — anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand bases. But gene regulation can occur over much longer tracts of genome space, and some models are able to make predictions at or near those scales. Borzoi, for instance, accepts 524 kilobases of input DNA, and Evo 2 and Google DeepMind’s newly announced AlphaGenome can work with a megabase.\n\nThese models can transform those sequences into vast collections of estimated data. Given an input sequence of 196,608 bases of human DNA, for instance, Enformer outputs 2,131 predictions of transcription factor binding, 1,860 of histone modifications, 684 of chromatin accessibility and 638 of gene expression, at 128-base resolution (go.nature.com/4mbe42h).\n\nA finite genome\n\nYet despite these models’ extensive ‘receptive fields’, they can still miss things, says Jacob Schreiber, a computational biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, because enhancers might exert effects that are biologically meaningful but invisible to the AI tool. “We have not cracked long-range regulation,” he says.\n\nAnother challenge is that, as vast as it is, the human genome is finite — there are only about 20,000–25,000 genes, for instance, and only a fraction of those are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. That means that for all those billions of bases, there are relatively few examples of regulatory strategies from which a model can learn.\n\nCarl de Boer is a biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Canada.Credit: Paul Joseph\n\n“There’s just so many different biochemical mechanisms that could happen on DNA that there are probably a very large number of them that only occur once or even zero times in our genome sequence,” says biomedical engineer Carl de Boer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nOne approach to broadening an AI model’s knowledge base is to feed it more than just reference genomes. Some model builders, for instance, train their tools on data from multiple individuals or from across the phylogenetic tree to give the models a sense of genetic diversity.\n\nAnother approach, advanced by de Boer and Jussi Taipale, a systems biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, is to look beyond natural genomes to fully artificial DNAs11.\n\nAs a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, de Boer and his colleagues tested some 100 million random sequences, each of which were 80 nucleotides in length — “about a human genome’s worth” — for their ability to drive expression of a fluorescent protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)12. (The yeast genome is made up of about 12 million bases, compared with roughly 3 billion in the human genome.) This approach, de Boer says, “is actually much better” for understanding the grammar of the genome than using genomic DNA, “because all of the signals you see in the random DNA are causal”. If you see fluorescence, the sequence is active. The genome, by contrast, is a product of evolution, meaning elements might be positioned owing to selective pressures as well as function.\n\nAccording to de Boer, the yeast exercise yielded two key insights. First, it reinforced that “there are probably widespread biophysical interactions happening in regulatory regions”. Functional motifs were not randomly arranged in active sequences; they were positioned in specific configurations — for instance, to conform to the helical spacing of the DNA double helix.\n\nThe second insight involved the importance of low-affinity transcription-factor–DNA interactions. Even weak interactions, the team found, could exert a large influence on gene regulation, just as relatively weak chemical interactions can hold two proteins together.",

          "abstract": "Safe and snug: frogs kept warm in brick ‘saunas’ are able to ward off a deadly fungal infection.Credit: Anthony Waddle\nWorking scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nOn warm, muggy evenings, conservation biologist Anthony Waddle and his students, along with local frog enthusiasts, venture into the wild and wet suburbs of Sydney, Australia, head torches on, searching for green and golden bell frogs (Litoria aurea). Then they frogmarch the captured amphibians into a small greenhouse made from nothing more than a stack of masonry bricks for a “luxury treatment” sauna — which might ultimately save their lives, he explains.\n\nFor many, the idea of a ‘frog sauna’ might sound bizarre. But when Waddle’s team published a study (A. W. Waddle et al. Nature 631, 344–349; 2024) showing that a simple sit in a warm enclosure could treat the deadly chytrid fungal infection plaguing the green and golden bell frog, it made waves — and resulted in him winning the 2025 Future for Nature award. Now, as a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, he’s collaborating with partners, training local communities and helping Australia to save its declining population of these glossy green-and-golden-streaked frogs that fit in your palm and croak with a muffled, motorcycle-like revving sound.\n\nChytrid fungus infections are a huge threat to the global frog population and have contributed to declines in more than 500 frog species and the extinction of more than 90 others.\n\nThe good news is that infections can be cleared easily in some frogs under the right conditions, because the fungus is sensitive to heat. “Around 28 °C is enough to really limit chytrid growth,” Waddle says. And the sauna treatment can pay off really fast: a few hours a day for a week or less is all that’s needed. Saving one female frog can markedly change the trajectory of a population, because a single adult can produce thousands of offspring in one season.\n\nWaddle stacks bricks inside a mini greenhouse, where they function as saunas for frogs.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\n\nHow the treatment came about was serendipitous. In 2013, researchers studying tree frogs in Queensland, Australia, noticed a pattern: in areas where chytrid fungus had spread, frog populations survived near large granite boulders and crevices, but disappeared from shaded, forested areas. The researchers hypothesized that the boulders acted as natural refuges that absorbed heat during the day and slowly released it at night. The process created warmer microhabitats that protected the frogs from the fungus.\n\nHowever, not all habitats had these heating boulders. So Waddle and his colleagues wanted to finally “test this idea that people had been hemming and hawing about forever”, but that no one had tested by experiment.\n\nTrying a new approach meant there was no standard blueprint. Waddle and his team had to test and adjust various sauna designs as they went. Their simple set-up consists of a small garden-greenhouse frame wrapped with translucent plastic and placed over a stack of masonry bricks, each with a series of openings for frog entry and exit. Their experiments found that the frogs readily find and enter saunas on their own.\n\nSo far, the researchers have placed about 70 frog saunas in three sites in greater Sydney and plan to use three more sites there in the next Southern Hemisphere winter, in 2026. They have also created how-to guides, educational videos and workshops to teach community members how to build the saunas (see ‘Quick-fire Q&A’). Several greenhouse suppliers have even listed the set-up on their websites as useful for creating frog saunas, as well as for growing plants.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A\nAnthony Waddle with an amphibian friend.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\nHow do you capture the frogs for the treatment?\n\nCapturing frogs is the fun part. You just go out at night with head torches and pick them up. We capture them by hand and bring them into a temperature- and environment-controlled facility. We either give them antifungal baths or increase their temperature for treatment, and then eventually release them. My students and I like capturing frogs the most, but it’s also the start of a lot of work, because the frogs are usually quite ill and need close attention.\n\nWhat has been the main challenge of this project?\n\nIt’s mostly been about getting people on board with solution-driven research. I’ve worked on chytrid fungal infections for nearly 12 years — starting with an undergraduate project, then a master’s on chytrid and vaccines, a PhD focused on ‘vaccination’ in frog saunas, and now a postdoctoral position investigating synthetic-biology solutions for chytrid resistance.\n\nWe’re in a position to make a big impact, even with a small team. But sometimes it’s been hard to get the exposure and support we need to grow and to secure major funding — especially when we don’t have the CVs of more-senior researchers to back us up.\n\nWhen someone develops a patent, or something for use during their PhD, it’s the responsibility of that person to make sure that the technology is used. So, I’m adopting an unconventional entrepreneurial spirit, doing citizen-science work, trying to secure partnerships with industry and going out to places where people don’t think to look for funding or support, to drive my research forwards. It’s been the secret to my success.\n\nWhat’s a surprising question that you are asked about your job?\n\nPeople often ask us to justify why we do our work or explain its broader benefit to society. I often retort with: “No one asks an accountant, or someone making money from money, what their greater purpose is.” Yet, someone like me working to conserve frogs is treated as if that’s not a real job. I’m not tired of justifying that what I do is important, because we are saving species from the face of extinction. But I do enjoy making people laugh with that joke, because it’s true.\n\nThe saunas are a low-cost garden habitat for the endangered frogs that live throughout southeastern Australia. Waddle has worked with other frog conservationists, encouraging local people to use apps such as FrogID. This lets users make audio recordings of frog calls and upload them to an online database, togeher with GPS data. Experts then identify the frogs and notify the users.\n\nJodi Rowley, a herpetologist at the Australian Museum Research Institute in Sydney and lead scientist for FrogID, says that tens of thousands of people across Australia use the app, and have put more than 1.3 million frog records on the map. The app has contributed to the discovery of 13 frog species and is actively used by communities to monitor local frog populations. Now, regular FrogID users can get frog-sauna information and updates. “We are hoping that communities are using the app to record their local frogs and potentially determine whether the frogs do better after the installation of frog saunas,” Rowley adds.\n\nBeyond black and white: an ecologist applies racial-justice principles to predators and their ecosystems",

But there is one fundamental phenomenon it can’t explain: gravity.\n\n“How quantum mechanics and gravity fit together is one of the most important outstanding problems in physics,” says Kathryn Zurek, a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena.\n\nGenerations of researchers have tried to create a quantum theory of gravity, and their work has produced sophisticated mathematical constructs, such as string theory. But experimental physicists haven’t found concrete evidence for any of these, and they’re not even sure what such evidence could look like.\n\nNow there is a sense that insights could be around the corner. In the past decade, many researchers have become more optimistic that there are ways to test the true nature of gravity in the laboratory. Scientists have proposed experiments to do this, and are pushing the precision of techniques to make them possible. “There’s been a huge rise in both experimental capability and our theoretical understanding of what we actually learn from such experiments,” says Markus Aspelmeyer, an experimental physicist at the University of Vienna and a pioneer of this work.\n\nThis tabletop balance can measure the gravitational force between very small masses.Credit: Westphal, T., et al., Nature\n\nSome of the proposed tests involve experimental lasers, which could be built in a few years. Others require manipulating matter in such ambitious ways that they might never be achieved. One shocking result could be that gravity is not a quantum phenomenon after all.\n\nStill, many researchers feel that the field is finally on the right track. “You have to search, if you’re going to find anything,” says Lee McCuller, an experimental physicist also at Caltech.\n\nTheories of gravity\n\nThe current accepted theory of gravity is Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. It has revealed that gravity is the way in which each lump of matter influences another by curving the space-time in which they travel — akin to billiard balls deforming the elastic surface of a trampoline and bending each others’ paths as they move on it.\n\nGeneral relativity is a classical — as opposed to a quantum — theory. In quantum physics, a particle is described as a smeared-out cloud of possibilities, and its position only assumes a meaning after it’s measured. But Einstein’s theory sees particles as things that exist at a precise point in space at any given time, and that move along well-defined trajectories.\n\nPhysicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows\n\nResearchers attach a variety of meanings to the idea of gravity being quantum, says Flaminia Giacomini, a physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. Scientists generally agree that any quantum theory of gravity has to involve features such as objects having fuzzy probability distributions, rather than definite locations. Some theories also require space-time to come in discrete chunks (‘quanta’), as opposed to the smooth space-time of Einstein’s theory, but this is by no means synonymous with gravity being quantum, she says.\n\nIn early attempts to create a quantum theory of gravity in the 1960s, theoretical physicists tried to feed general relativity into a mathematical procedure that turns classical equations into quantum ones (and objects with well-defined properties into fuzzy probabilistic clouds). But although this trick had worked well for another fundamental force of nature, electromagnetism, in the case of Einstein’s theory, it gave nonsensical results, such as quantities that blew up to infinity.\n\nEfforts to build quantum theories of gravity from scratch have produced some mathematically consistent results. The most popular attempt is string theory, which posits that elementary particles are really tiny strings vibrating in unseen dimensions of space. In principle, this could solve some paradoxes in the theory of known elementary particles, and it predicts new elementary particles that behave the way physicists expect of quanta of gravity, or ‘gravitons’.\n\nThis does achieve the goal of making gravity a quantum theory. But researchers have looked for experimental signatures of certain versions of string theory, with no success so far. The same has been true of loop quantum gravity, an even more radical approach that replaces the fabric of space-time (not just the elementary particles that live in it) with tiny loops.\n\nSome physicists have become frustrated at the dearth of prospects for testing what they see as fancy constructs, such as string theory. “I think people are getting disenamoured with it,” says Ivette Fuentes, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\nTurning to experiments\n\nInstead of designing new quantum gravity theories, some researchers are hoping to use lab tests to explore basic questions about whether gravity, at its heart, has a classical or a quantum nature.\n\n“We don’t have any experimental evidence of how gravity becomes quantum — or of whether gravity is a quantum phenomenon at all,” says experimental physicist Richard Howl at Royal Holloway, University of London.\n\n“For me, the coolest thing would be a yes-or-no experiment,” says Aspelmeyer.\n\nOne of the big questions that researchers have concerns the quantum phenomenon of ‘superposition’ — in which an object can be in two states simultaneously, such as rotating in opposite directions or moving along two distinct paths at once. In any quantum version of general relativity, a particle’s billiard-ball influence would presumably put space-time itself into a superposition of space being bent along one path and, simultaneously, along another. Theorists wonder what gravitational attraction a second ball should feel: would it fall simultaneously along two trajectories, splitting its path into two? Or, if this quantum superposition does not occur, perhaps it would fall towards some point in between, averaging the two attractions out?\n\nThen again, would the very presence of the second ball force the first ball to ‘choose’ which path it is on, just as a measuring device forces a particle to know its position?\n\nIn the past decade, theorists have realized that it should be possible to experimentally distinguish between these ideas, through the peculiarly quantum phenomenon of entanglement. In quantum mechanics, when two objects interact, they can enter a common, ‘entangled’ state. This means that when a property of the first object is measured and acquires a definite value, the corresponding property of the other object is also set.\n\nTwo places at once: superposed crystal could test whether gravity obeys quantum laws\n\nThe key idea is that if two objects can become entangled through their mutual gravitational attraction in the absence of any other interaction, then gravity must be of a quantum nature.\n\nIt all sounds abstract, but researchers have been concocting a plethora of schemes to put this into practice.\n\nIn one experiment envisaged by Aspelmeyer, a tiny particle in a vacuum is placed into a superposition of states corresponding to different positions. Researchers then look to see whether a second, nearby particle, which feels the gravitational attraction of the first but no other forces, has become entangled with it.\n\nAspelmeyer has been at the forefront of improving techniques to make this possible — although the full experiment can’t be done yet.\n\nOne major challenge is that putting an object in a superposition of locations gets increasingly difficult the larger the object is — after all, such effects are never seen at the macroscopic scales of everyday life.\n\nSo far, researchers have achieved it with molecules made of thousands of atoms1, and have made significant breakthroughs in getting relatively large objects, such as tiny glass spheres levitated by laser beams, to show other aspects of quantum behaviour. An important step has been to slow down particles so much that their motion reveals a quantum nature, Aspelmeyer notes: for instance, they acquire discrete energy levels when trapped in an electromagnetic field. This feat was achieved for the first time in 20202.\n\nThe experiment of Aspelmeyer’s dreams would require two objects not only to behave in a quantum way but also to be massive enough to exert a substantial gravitational pull on each other. Because gravity is such a weak force, that would require masses of at least 22 micrograms, having quintillions of atoms.\n\nAspelmeyer can’t yet measure the tiny gravitational force that would be produced by these objects. In 2021, he reported doing so for much larger particles, with a mass of 90 milligrams3. He attached two such masses at the ends of a tiny stick, which was suspended horizontally with a string attached to its midpoint. He then brought in a third 90-mg mass close to one end, and saw the effect of this gravitational pull by measuring the stick’s rotation.\n\nA challenge with measuring smaller objects and their gravitational fields is that it’s very hard to isolate them from other interactions — which tend to be much stronger than gravity. Such isolation would be necessary in the experiment Aspelmeyer wants to do for researchers to be confident that any effect they see is truly due to gravity alone.\n\nPhysicists measure the gravitational forces of tiny masses in an underground laboratory, the Conrad Observatory in Trafelberg, Austria, to block out external noise.Credit: Aspelmeyer Group/University of Vienna/OEAW\n\nSougato Bose, a theoretical physicist at University College London (UCL), and others have proposed and received some funding for a related experiment4. The idea is to have particles in free fall: the researchers suggest putting a microscopic diamond crystal in a superposition that involves falling along two parallel directions, and doing the same for another, similar crystal. (This is achieved in each crystal by putting into superposition one of its spin states and then applying magnetic fields; the crystals are deflected in ways that depend on where their spins point, because spin — a quantum property of subatomic particles — acts rather like a tiny bar magnet.) Altogether, there would be four paths, all parallel to each other, which would put the two crystals at various distances from each other, and therefore in a superposition of feeling gravitational attractions of different intensities (see ‘Proposed tests for quantum gravity’).\n\nSource: Adapted from Sci. Am. (see go.nature.com/4FW1RJG)\n\nEach crystal would then be recombined into one path, and readouts of their quantum states would reveal whether they had become entangled, an outcome that — so the reasoning goes — could have occurred only through gravity. However, Bose says that each of these steps will be extremely hard to achieve, and it could be many decades before experimental techniques make this feasible to test. (Other teams have made similar proposals.)\n\nOther ways to test gravity\n\nAlthough Bose and others think that the ability to create entanglement is the key to proving that gravity has a quantum nature, others say the reality could be more subtle.\n\n“You’re not really proving that gravity is quantum; you make some model of what you think gravity not being quantum would mean, and then try to rule that out,” says Daniel Carney, a theoretical physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.\n\n‘Levitating’ nanoparticles could push the limits of quantum entanglement\n\nIf gravity can entangle things, he says, then it would certainly not be a classical phenomenon, “but what that means to the full structure of the gravitational field is an open question”.\n\nOther groups have developed concepts for testing the quantumness of gravity without entanglement. One, devised by Howl together with Fuentes and the theorist Roger Penrose at the University of Oxford, UK, would suspend a cloud of cold atoms in a single quantum state called a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC). Then the gravitational self-attraction of the cloud would make it evolve in different ways, depending on whether gravity is quantum or classical. In particular, classical gravity would never make the positions of the atoms in the BEC evolve from a bell-curve type of distribution (that is, having a single peak) to one with multiple peaks5. It would be possible to measure whether such a shift occurs by probing the BEC with another one, Howl says.\n\nHere, the experimental challenge is that BECs are typically made up of millions of atoms, but that number would need to grow by a factor of 10 million to have measurable gravitational attraction, says Fuentes — although various quantum-technology tricks could soften that requirement.",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "A team including researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen have published a substantial correction to a 2020 paper reporting evidence for exotic quasiparticles called Majoranas.Credit: Philip Davali/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nA key study1 claiming to provide evidence of Majorana quasiparticles has received an extensive correction five years after it was published in the journal Science. Two researchers who flagged the paper as problematic say that the correction isn’t sufficient — triggering the latest dispute in a field dogged by controversy.\n\nMicrosoft quantum-computing claim still lacks evidence: physicists are dubious\n\nFor decades, physicists have been compelled by the idea that ultracold electrons in microscopic devices could behave collectively to form quasiparticles resistant to noise — both environmental perturbations and the inherent atomic jostling that plagues all quantum systems. The resilience of these Majoranas could make them ideal candidates for forming qubits, the informational units in quantum computers that are analogous to bits in classical machines. Studies to prove their existence have come up short, although recent bold claims by technology giant Microsoft have drawn considerable scrutiny.\n\nIn September 2018, a team led by Charlie Marcus, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen, who also worked for Microsoft at the time, posted a manuscript to the preprint server arXiv that described a fresh approach to generate Majoranas. The researchers made nanowires of indium arsenide surrounded by a shell of aluminium. Applying a small magnetic field, they then measured electrical signals “consistent” with pairs of Majoranas, one at either end of each wire. A year and a half later, they included theoretical simulations to justify their results, and the study was published in Science1.\n\nTwo physicists — Sergey Frolov, at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and Vincent Mourik, now at the Research Centre Jülich in Germany — raised questions about the validity of the data, and in July 2021, Science applied an editorial expression of concern to the paper to warn readers of potential problems. Now, Science is lifting that warning, and the authors are issuing a 20-page correction to the paper’s supplementary material. News of the correction was first reported on 31 July by the technology news site The Register.\n\nThe Copenhagen group looked for Majoranas with devices made of indium arsenide wires (green) wrapped with aluminium (blue), as shown in this coloured electron microscope image. Credit: Reprinted with permission from Ref. 1.\n\nThe authors say they are relieved by the outcome. “It’s not really correcting any errors,” says co-author Saulius Vaitiekėnas, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen. “We are summarizing and providing additional information.” Frolov, on the other hand, argues that the data in the paper do not give a full picture of electron behaviour in the team’s devices and calls for retraction. “I do not trust this data,” he says.\n\nJake Yeston, an editor at Science who oversees physical-sciences submissions, says that the journal decided not to retract the paper because there was not a “clear, community-grounded view that it’s obviously wrong”. But, Yeston says, the lack of information in the original paper was a problem, and it has now been fixed. “It shouldn’t be that a reader who wants to know what your protocol was has to go to your lab and talk to you,” he says. “That should be in the paper.”\n\nQuestioning the data\n\nThirteen years ago, Frolov and Mourik were authors on a different study in Science2 that reported evidence for Majoranas. But excitement around the result faded after researchers discovered that other mundane phenomena could mimic the quasiparticles.\n\nWhen the Copenhagen team’s manuscript was posted to arXiv in 2018, Frolov and Mourik were dubious so they requested to see all of the data. E-mails reviewed by Nature show that the Copenhagen group released more data in November 2020. The pair of critics analysed the information provided and concluded that the data were incomplete and contradicted the study’s central claims. An internal inquiry by the university’s physics institute, however, found “no problems with the paper”, and that the Copenhagen team had turned over all of its data. Unsatisfied, editors at Science applied an expression of concern to the paper, and in October 2021, Yeston filed a complaint with the university to request an “independent, transparent investigation by experts”.\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nIn June 2022, the university assembled a panel of independent physicists to undertake the effort: Sophie Guéron, at the University of Paris-Saclay; Allan MacDonald, at the University of Texas at Austin; and Pertti Hakonen, at Aalto University in Finland. They travelled to Copenhagen, conducted interviews and examined data from 60 microscopic devices (the original paper included data from 4). Their year-long investigation3 found no misconduct, but stated that the team’s selection of data led to “conclusions that did not adequately capture the variability of outcomes”. The excluded data, however, did not undermine the paper’s main conclusions, they said.\n\nOne sticking point for Frolov and Mourik continues to be the Copenhagen team’s choice of ‘tunnelling regime’ — the range of low electrical conductivities over which the devices were scanned. The Copenhagen researchers said they saw signs of Majoranas persisting “throughout” their chosen tunnelling regime. But Frolov and Mourik said that the extra data they received showed that the tunnelling regime was much wider, and that the telltale Majorana signs were limited to the smaller tunnelling window.",

          "abstract": "This year’s Northern Hemisphere summer brought back-to-back heatwaves in several countries.Credit: Antonio Denti/Reuters\n\nThe summer of 2025 is already shaping up to be a record-breaker. Two intense heatwaves have swept across Europe, causing hundreds of heat-related deaths, fuelling wildfires and pushing power systems to their limit — and more are on the way.\n\nFrom mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record (see ‘Warmest June ever’). Temperatures soared above 40°C, and up to 46°C in Spain and Portugal, as a result of ‘heat domes’ — caps of high pressure that trap hot air in the atmosphere over an area, causing it to stay hotter for longer.\n\nSource: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts/Copernicus\n\nResearch suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — London can now expect events such as this every 6 years instead of every 60, according to a report published last month by Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “We’ll see more dramatic consequences for populations,” says Roman Hoffmann, a social scientist studying climate-related risks at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria. “And more stress that will affect health, well-being, livelihoods and human security more broadly.”\n\nDeadly conditions\n\nAcross 12 major European cities this year, about 1,500 of 2,300 estimated heat-related deaths — 65% — were driven by the extra heat resulting from fossil-fuel emissions, according to the Grantham Institute’s report (see ‘Lethal heatwaves’). The researchers compared real temperatures during the late-June 2025 heatwave with estimates of what temperatures would have been without human-caused climate change, then used health models to calculate the resulting heat-related deaths. The high temperatures were especially lethal for older adults, with people aged 65 and over making up nearly 90% of those who died.\n\nSource: Grantham Institute report Climate change tripled heat-related deaths in early summer European heatwave\n\nAnother study, which looked at the health effects of hot weather in Austria between 2015 and 20221, found that districts with older populations saw around 50% more deaths on very hot days than areas with younger populations did. The true toll could be even higher, because heat-related deaths are often undercounted, typically being recorded as the result of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, says Hannah Schuster, a data analyst at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who led the study. By 2050, many areas in Austria are expected to have twice as many hot days and many more older people — making heat-related deaths likely to rise unless action is taken to protect people from the heat, she adds.\n\nThe cool technologies that could protect cities from dangerous heat\n\nAlthough countries with mild climates have long had systems in place to manage cold weather, they’re much less prepared for the growing challenge of extreme heat, Schuster says. This lack of readiness makes the first heatwave of the year especially dangerous, says Peter Klimek, a medical data scientist at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna. In his own, unpublished, analysis of ten years of hospital and ambulance data from Austria, he found a 30% spike in diagnoses of circulatory, respiratory and mental-health conditions during heatwaves.\n\nKlimek calls for better heatwave warning systems — particularly in hospitals and care homes — and long-term changes to cities, such as the creation of more cooling green spaces and modification of buildings to better dissipate heat.\n\nThousands displaced\n\nAlthough it’s hard to track how many people are forced to leave their homes owing to extreme heat alone, data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), a non-governmental organization in Geneva, Switzerland, show that thousands of people have been temporarily evacuated or displaced as a result of wildfires that occurred during this year’s heatwaves in Europe.\n\n“This year is already record-breaking when it comes to wildfires,” says Ivana Hajžmanová, the global monitoring manager at the IDMC. Not all wildfires are directly caused by climate change, but increasingly hot and dry conditions help fires to spread faster and burn for longer. In June and July, wildfires swept across southern Europe, disrupting a hospital and airport in Sardinia, and Turkey saw 50,000 evacuations as a result of fires in Izmir, the country’s largest-ever wildfire displacement event. Similarly, the region near Athens recorded 14,000 displacements in early June, IDMC figures show (see ‘Fleeing from fire’).\n\nSource: IDMCSource: IDMC\n\nIn 2024, weather-related disasters such as floods, wildfires and droughts forced about 45 million internal displacements — people leaving their homes within their countries — IDMC data suggest. The Institute for Economics & Peace, a think-tank based in Sydney, Australia, projects that by 2050, 3.4 billion people will live in countries facing severe ecological threats (in 2022, it was 2 billion). The ability to relocate from hotter to cooler locations on a more permanent basis is often limited to those with more resources, education and opportunities, Hoffmann says.\n\nUsing data from 72 countries, Hoffmann and his colleagues found that drought and dry conditions cause more people — especially in rural farming areas — to move long-term within their own countries2. Working-age people mainly leave poorer regions, whereas in wealthier countries, older adults are most likely to move — often for retirement.\n\nReduced productivity",

          "title": "People are having fewer babies: Is it really the end of the world?",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "In 1970, a woman in Mexico might have expected to have seven children, on average. By 2014, that figure had fallen to around two. As of 2023, it was just 1.6. That means that the population is no longer making enough babies to maintain itself.\n\nMexico is not alone: countries around the world are witnessing falling fertility rates1. Exceptions are few. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle estimates that, by 2050, more than three-quarters of countries will be in a comparable situation.\n\n“There has been an absolutely incredible drop in fertility — much faster than anyone had anticipated,” says Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “And it is happening in a lot of countries you would have never guessed.”\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe numbers are clear. What’s uncertain is how problematic this global ‘baby bust’ will be, and how nations should respond. In economies that have been built around the prospect of steady population growth, the concern is over future slumps in innovation and productivity, as well as having too few working-age citizens to support a growing number of older people. Researchers warn of ripple effects, from weakened military power and less political influence for countries with lower fertility rates, to fewer investments in green technology. It is imperative that countries address population decline and its impacts now, says Austin Schumacher, a health metrics researcher at the IHME.\n\nMany countries have been trying to take action, and the data suggest that some strategies are helpful — if politically fraught. But to scientists familiar with the data, even the most effective efforts are unlikely to bring a full rebound in fertility rates. That’s why many researchers are recommending a shift in focus from reversal to resilience. They see room for optimism. Even if countries can only slow the decline, that should buy them time to prepare for future demographic shifts. Ultimately, scientists say, fertility rates that are low, but not too low, could have some benefits.\n\n“We’re not not making babies,” says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at the City University of New York. “The human race is not folding in on itself.”\n\nWhat the data say\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the world’s total fertility rate — generally defined as the average number of children a woman would have during her reproductive years — was five. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might become pregnant. We use ‘woman’ and ‘women’ in this story to reflect language used in the field.) Some dubbed this mid-twentieth surge the baby boom. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich and conservation biologist Anne Ehrlich saw it differently, warning in their 1968 book The Population Bomb that overpopulation would lead to famine and environmental devastation. But they failed to anticipate advances in agricultural and health technology that would enable the population to double to eight billion in a little more than five decades.\n\nHumanity’s impact on the environment has intensified, owing to that growth and to increased consumption in many parts of the world. But concerns about overpopulation have flipped. Population growth has been slowing down over the past 50 years, and the average total fertility rate stands at 2.2. In about half of countries, it has fallen below 2.1, the threshold generally needed to maintain a steady population (see ‘Declining fertility’). Small changes in these numbers can have strong effects. A fertility rate of 1.7 could reduce a population to half its original size several generations sooner than a rate of 1.9, for example.\n\nSource: Our World in Data (https://go.nature.com/45RWYFJ)\n\nThe case of South Korea is under close scrutiny. Its fertility rate fell from 4.5 in 1970 to 0.75 in 2024, and its population peaked at just under 52 million in 2020. That figure is now declining at a pace that is expected to accelerate.\n\nForecasts for the world vary. The United Nations and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, project gentler declines than the IHME does (see, for example, go.nature.com/4mtkj8b). But demographers generally expect that the global population will peak in the next 30 to 60 years and then contract. If it does, that will be the first such decline since the Black Death in the 1300s.\n\nAccording to the UN, China’s population might already have peaked in around 2022, at 1.4 billion. India’s could do the same in the early 2060s, topping out at 1.7 billion people. And, assuming the most likely immigration scenario, the US Census Bureau predicts that the US population will peak in 2080 at around 370 million. Meanwhile, many of the steepest near-term crashes are anticipated in middle-income countries: Cuba is expected to lose more than 15% of its population by 2050.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the notable exception. By 2100, more than half of the world’s babies are likely to be born there1, despite it having some of the world’s lowest incomes, weakest health-care systems and most fragile food and water supplies. Nigeria’s fertility rate remains above four, and its population is projected to grow by another 76% by 2050, which will make it the world’s third-most-populous country.\n\nStill, fertility-rate trends are hard to predict. Data gaps persist, and many models rely on the expectation that rates will rebound as they’ve done before. And as the Ehrlichs’ failed forecasts show, the past isn’t always indicative of the future. “We are groping in the dark,” says demographer Anne Goujon, programme director for population and just societies at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.\n\nWhat’s driving the decline?\n\nThe factors behind fertility collapse are numerous. They range from expanded access to contraception and education, to shifting norms around relationships and parenting. Debate continues over which factors matter most, and how they vary across regions.\n\nSome drivers reflect positive societal changes. In the United States, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that fertility has declined in part because of fewer unplanned pregnancies and teenage births. A long-term drop in domestic violence might also have contributed. Research in 2018 by Jennifer Barber, a sociologist now at Indiana University in Bloomington, and her colleagues showed that women in violent relationships have children at around twice the rate as do those in non-violent ones2.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nGlobally, access to contraception has helped to decouple sex from reproduction. In Iran, a national family-planning campaign that started in the 1980s contributed to the largest and fastest fall in fertility rates ever recorded: from nearly seven to under two in less than two decades3. The country reversed course around 2006, and is once again promoting policies to increase fertility rates.\n\nYoung people in wealthy countries are also forming fewer partnerships and having less sex. Alice Evans, a sociologist at King’s College London, has suggested that online entertainment is outcompeting real-world interactions and eroding social confidence. As women worldwide have gained education and career opportunities, many have grown more selective. Women want independence, while many men expect a “servant at home”, says Fernández-Villaverde. “Women are asking, ‘Why would I marry this person?’ A lot of men are undateable. Truly undateable.”\n\nThis disconnect fuels trends such as South Korea’s Four Nos feminist movement — in which many young women are rejecting dating, marriage, sex and childbirth — and a similar ‘boy sober’ movement among US women.\n\nMexico is one of several countries that has a fertility rate below replacement level.Credit: Bernd Vogel/Getty\n\nMany young people are also pursuing more education so as to gain jobs that might come with high stress and little stability early on. As a result, even people who pair up might postpone having children or have trouble conceiving because they are older. Those who do have kids face pressure to prepare them for the same high-stakes race for university and career, says Matthias Doepke, an economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “It’s not like we have withdrawn from parenting. It’s just that we concentrate all this investment, all these hours, on fewer children.”\n\nRising costs create further pressures. A UN survey of more than 14,000 people in 14 countries found that 39% cited financial limitations as a reason not to have children (see www.unfpa.org/swp2025). In US cities, births have fallen most sharply where housing prices have risen most rapidly (see go.nature.com/4tqqzsg).\n\nUltra-low fertility rates tend to emerge where these pressures converge, says Doepke. In South Korea, he says, housing is expensive, the parenting culture is intense and the working culture rewards long hours.\n\nOther contributors include declining sperm counts, potentially linked to environmental toxins. Many prospective parents also have growing anxiety about political and environmental instability, as highlighted in the UN survey. It’s not clear which of these many factors are most important in individual countries. But ultimately, low fertility rates “reflect broken systems and broken institutions that prevent people from having the number of children they want”, says Stuart Gietel-Basten, a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “That is the real crisis.”\n\nCountering the crash\n\nThe fallout will play out differently around the world. Middle-income countries, such as Cuba, Colombia and Turkey, could be the hardest hit, with falling fertility compounded by rising emigration to wealthier nations.\n\nUrban–rural divides will also deepen. As young people leave small towns, infrastructure such as schools, supermarkets and hospitals shuts down — prompting more to move away. Often, it’s older people who remain.\n\nGlobally, ageing is the core issue with population decline. In countries that have shrinking fertility rates, the proportion of people aged 65 or older is projected to nearly double, from 17% to 31% in the next 25 years (see go.nature.com/4fspvh5). As life expectancy rises, the demand for physical and fiscal support grows, yet there is a lag in supply. For the majority of countries hoping to break the fertility fall, tools exist. These include financial incentives, such as US President Donald Trump’s proposal to give each newborn baby US$1,000 in an investment fund.",

          "abstract": "Manipulating microbes involved in the fermentation of cocoa beans could lead to the creation of exciting new flavours of chocolate. Credit: Say-Cheese/iStock via Getty\n\nWhen you bite into a piece of chocolate, you can taste its distinct fruity, nutty and earthy flavours.\n\nNow, scientists have gained fresh insights into how the process of fermenting cocoa beans can affect that flavour profile.\n\nIn a study published today in Nature Microbiology1, researchers found that pH, temperature and microbial species in the fermentation process all influence how the resulting chocolate tastes. They also replicated the flavour attributes of a high-quality chocolate in the laboratory by creating the ideal environment for fermentation.\n\nThe researchers hope that using these techniques will “create novelty and exciting new flavours for consumers in the future”, says study co-author David Gopaulchan, a plant geneticist at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\n“I think this definitely has promise for people to start to play with and look at in terms of designer chocolates”, says Heather Hallen-Adams, a food scientist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nFermented flavours\n\nFermentation is a flavour-enhancing step in the production of some foods and drinks. Making wine, cheese or beer involves adding yeast or other microorganisms. To make chocolate, cocoa beans are removed from their pods, put together and left to ferment, after which they are dried and roasted. But unlike production of wine, beer and cheese, cacao fermentation is a natural process that usually takes place without adding specific microbes. As a result, little is known about how different conditions or microbe species might influence the flavour of chocolate.\n\n“Ultimately, what we are trying to do is increase the quality of chocolates,” says Gopaulchan. His team took samples of cocoa beans from a farm in the Santander district of Colombia and measured changes in the pH and temperature during the fermentation process. They suspected that these conditions would affect the chocolate’s flavour, because of how they influenced interactions between bacteria and fungi.\n\nRaw cocoa beans must undergo fermentation before they can be made into chocolate.Credit: Ute Grabowsky/Photothek via Getty\n\nThe researchers then compared cocoa samples from the Santander district with those from farms in the Huila and Antioquia regions of Colombia. They prepared cocoa ‘liquors’ from the fermented beans from the three farms to test their flavour profiles. This process involves drying, roasting and breaking down the beans to produce cocoa nibs, which are ground into a paste.\n\nA panel of trained food tasters sampling the liquors reported that those from Santander and Huila shared flavour attributes, with notes of roasted nuts, ripe berries and coffee. By comparison, cocoa liqour from Antioquia had a simpler, more bitter flavour. The cocoa from all three farms had similar genetic backgrounds, which allowed the researchers to exclude genotype as a factor influencing flavour.\n\nAnalysis of the fermentation conditions from the three farms found that unique microbial communities influenced the flavour profiles of the three cocoa liquors. For example, the fungal genera Torulaspora and Saccharomyces were strongly associated with flavour attributes of finer chocolate.\n\nDesigner chocolate",

          "abstract": "Third-party punishment is theorized by some scholars to be essential to the evolution of large-scale cooperation, but empirically, it often fails to bring about its desired effects. Here, we suggest that third-party punishment destabilizes cooperation when third parties have profit motives to punish. Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish. Implications for systems of punishment and cooperation in real-world contexts are discussed.",

For these systems, Indigenous Knowledge offers unique insights that reflect millennia of intimate engagement with local landscapes, while Western Science can offer additional understanding of the emergence of climates and ecological conditions that are novel at evolutionary timescales. Here, we weave Indigenous Knowledge together with a multicentury history of fire, landuse, and forest development derived from tree rings to retell a more complete history of human engagement with the places commonly referred to as Wisconsin and Minnesota Points at the head of Lake Superior in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Our aim in this work is to create mutual reciprocal benefits for those involved in this work to disrupt a long history of extractive research and to honor the knowledge shared with us by reducing barriers to the revitalization of traditional cultural and landuse practices. This intensely local study, contextualized by substantial bodies of Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science, illustrates the importance of place-based and community-based research for understanding the role of Indigenous fire stewardship in shaping pine barrens sites and demonstrates how these fine-scale relationships are linked to regional landscape diversity yet may be invisible to other proxy-based studies.

          "abstract": "Scientific institutions like funding agencies and journals rely on peer reviewers to select among competing submissions. How does the geographical diversity of reviewers affect which authors are selected? If reviewers typically favor submissions from their own countries, but reviewers from only some countries are well represented in the reviewer pool, this can create a “geographical representation bias” favoring authors from those well-represented countries. Using administrative data on 204,718 submissions to 60 STEM journals from the Institute of Physics Publishing, we find support for representation bias. Reviewers from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively compared to other reviewers of the same manuscript. Authors from the United States of America, China, and India are 8 to 9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers compared to less-represented countries with similar incomes. Furthermore, an instrumental variables analysis of an anonymization policy shock shows that anonymizing submissions does not significantly reduce same-country homophily. Thus, investments in reviewer diversification may be necessary to mitigate the structural advantage of authors from major science-producing countries and avoid blind spots in collective knowledge.",

However, during the last decade, a large battery of KRAS inhibitors selective against specific mutations (KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D ), panKRAS inhibitors active against all KRAS isoforms, or even panRAS inhibitors, capable of inhibiting the three members of the RAS family, have been developed. In mice, the Kras locus is essential for embryonic development and can sustain adult homeostasis in the absence of Hras and Nras expression. Thus, we considered of interest to interrogate the role of the Kras locus in an experimental system to generate potentially relevant information regarding the use of panKRAS or panRAS inhibitors in the clinic. Here, we report that systemic ablation of Kras expression in adult mice does not induce significant changes in overall survival, body weight, glucose levels, metabolic profile, or heart function. In contrast, flow cytometry and histopathological analyses of organs such as blood, bone marrow, and spleen showed a significant increase of the myeloid lineage leading to myelomonocytic metaplasia. In this context, replacement of the KRAS isoforms by HRAS is sufficient to maintain adult homeostasis, suggesting that the unique properties of the Kras locus are primarily due to its pattern of expression rather than to the activity of its gene products.",

Here, we study these circuits with a focus on undulatory locomotion as produced by elongated fish such as eels and lampreys. We address three questions: i) How do proprioception (stretch feedback) and exteroception (pressure on skin) interact with local oscillators to generate stable swimming patterns? ii) Can these feedback loops also contribute to dry ground locomotion? iii) Can they explain the remarkable robustness of eels against spinal cord transections? To address these questions, we developed abstract models of the locomotion circuits based on coupled phase oscillators, local stretch and pressure feedback loops, and simulated muscle models that were tested both in simulation and with a real undulatory robot. We also performed swimming experiments with eels before and after spinal cord transections. We found that stretch and pressure feedback work well together in swimming, as they contribute to rapid pattern generation and can, in principle, both replace direct couplings between oscillators. Interestingly, the swimming controllers could generate good ground locomotion when placed in an arena with pegs. For ground locomotion, the stretch feedback is more beneficial than pressure feedback. Finally, our models could replicate the remarkable ability of eels to keep swimming shortly after a full spinal cord transection. We found that stretch feedback and the ability of oscillators to spontaneously oscillate are likely explanations for keeping the neural oscillators active and coordinated below the transection.",

          "abstract": "Sympatric speciation is considered rare, but oceanic Howea palms, crater lake cichlids, and parasitic indigobirds provide compelling evidence that it occurs. Still, the frequency of sympatric speciation and its relationship to morphological divergence in plants remains poorly understood, especially in plants. Here, we analyze the geographic distributions, traits, and divergence times of palm and conifer sister species (740 species from 108 genera) to determine the dominant geographic mode and role of morphological divergence in plant speciation. We show that allopatric speciation is dominant, and while frequent sympatric speciation cannot be discounted, the most likely scenario is that zero (conifers) or 10% (palms) of speciation events occur in sympatry. Our models show that the incidence of sympatry among sister pairs rises rapidly within the first million years after speciation and then declines, suggesting that species failing to attain sympatry early tend to remain allopatric. Finally, we find no evidence for morphological divergence in allopatric or sympatric palms. Our findings question the link between speciation and morphological divergence and suggest that while plants and animals share similar modes of speciation, plants exhibit a complex spatiotemporal dynamic, challenging the typical vertebrate pattern of steadily increasing sympatry.",

Understanding how development contributes to such patterns remains a challenge because it requires large-scale measurement of phenotypic variation resulting from random mutations across multiple species.

First, we find that the cell whose fate evolves fastest is distinct for each clade: P3.p in Caenorhabditis and P4.p in Oscheius . Second, we show that this evolutionary pattern matches the pattern of variation within species of each clade. Third, we find that within each clade, the differential effect on each cell of random mutation, quantified as their mutational phenotypic variance, is sufficient to explain the observed phenotypic evolution. Finally, we propose that the difference between clades is explained by a simple spatial shift across cells of the sensitive region in a Wnt dose–response curve. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the evolving structure of the genotype–phenotype map and measures of developmental sensitivity into the understanding of phenotypic change at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales.",

          "abstract": "Polyploidization is an important driver of evolution and diversification in flowering plants. Here, we assess how repeated polyploidization may have shaped diversification of floral morphology in Lithophragma bolanderi (Saxifragaceae). This species comprises multiple cytotypes and varies geographically in its interactions with specialized pollinating moths in the genus Greya (Prodoxidae). Past studies have shown that coevolution with these moths has favored particular suites of floral characters but does not fully explain local and regional floral diversification. We combined phenotypic and genomic data from more than 1,800 individuals from 40 L. bolanderi populations spread across its entire range. Flow-cytometric analyses revealed a geographic mosaic of populations comprising one to four of three dominant (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid) and three rare (triploid, pentaploid, octoploid) cytotypes. Whole-genome resequencing of a subset of populations suggested that polyploids arose from multiple autopolyploidization events, rather than a single event and/or through hybridization, albeit with some signals consistent with low levels of introgression from the congener Lithophragma glabrum . Quantification of flower traits from plants grown in a common garden showed that cytotype explained more than 15% of the variation in floral morphology, with polyploids showing more variability than diploids. Experimental induction of neopolyploids directly induced phenotypic changes but also indicated that local selection may have favored subsequent convergence in floral morphology among cytotypes in natural populations. Collectively, this comprehensive and integrative approach provides insights into how variability generating processes, such as polyploidization integrates with selection from species interactions to shape local floral diversification.",

ZNF93 depletion impairs DNA synthesis, activates replication and DNA damage checkpoints, and triggers proinflammatory phenotypes.

          "abstract": "A record-breaking melt season affected the Arctic glaciers of Svalbard in summer 2024 by a substantial margin. Across the entire archipelago, glacier melting corresponded to an anomaly of up to four SD and exceeded any previous observation. The pan-Svalbard mass loss in summer 2024 amounts to ~61.7 ± 11.1 Gt and corresponds to 1% of the total ice volume on Svalbard and is comparable to that of the Greenland ice sheet (55 ± 35 Gt), which occupies an area about 50 times larger. Altogether, Svalbard and other glacier regions surrounding the Barents Sea lost 102.1 ± 22.9 Gt of ice in a single year and contributed 0.27 ± 0.06 mm (of which 0.16 mm alone is due to Svalbard) to global sea-level, putting the circum-Barents region among the strongest contributors to global sea-level rise in 2024. Most of the 2024 glacier melt occurred during a 6-wk period of persistent atmospheric circulation pattern causing record-high air temperatures, an event with an extremely low recurrence interval under current climate conditions. However, future climate projections suggest that such temperature levels will become increasingly commonplace by the end of the 21st century, potentially even surpassing those of 2024. Svalbard’s summer of 2024 serves as a forecast for future glacier meltdown in the Arctic, offering a glimpse into conditions 70 y ahead.",

We propose ensemble modeling approaches combining mechanistic, statistical, and machine learning models to forecast dengue cases 1 to 3 mo ahead at the province level across multiple countries. We assess these models’ predictive ability out-of-sample and retrospectively in over 180 locations worldwide, including provinces in Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, plus Iquitos, Peru, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, during at least 2 to 3 y. We also evaluate ensemble approaches in a real-time, prospective dengue forecasting platform during 2022–2023, considering data availability limitations. Our ensemble modeling leads to an improvement to previous efforts that may help decision-making in the context of large uncertainties. This contrasts with the variable performance of individual component models across locations and time. No single model achieves optimal predictions across all scenarios, but while ensemble models may not always perform best in specific locations, they consistently rank among the top 3 performing models both retrospectively and prospectively.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is shifting species distributions, leading to changes in community composition and novel species assemblages worldwide. However, the responses of tropical forests to climate change across large-scale environmental gradients remain largely unexplored. Using long-term data over 66,000 trees of more than 2,500 species occurring over 3,500 m elevation along the hyperdiverse Amazon-to-Andes elevational gradients in Peru and Bolivia, we assessed community-level shifts in species composition over a 40+ y time span. We tested the thermophilization hypothesis, which predicts an increase in the relative abundances of species from warmer climates through time. Additionally, we examined the relative contributions of tree mortality, recruitment, and growth to the observed compositional changes. Mean thermophilization rates (TR) across the Amazon-to-Andes gradient were slow relative to regional temperature change. TR were positive and more variable among Andean forest plots compared to Amazonian plots but were highest at midelevations around the cloud base. Across all elevations, TR were driven primarily by tree mortality and decreased growth of highland (cool-adapted) species rather than an influx of lowland species with higher thermal optima. Given the high variability of community-level responses to warming along the elevational gradients, the high tree mortality, and the slower-than-warming rates of compositional change, we conclude that most tropical tree species, and especially lowland Amazonian tree species, will not be able to escape current or future climate change through upward range shifts, causing fundamental changes to composition and function in Earth’s highest diversity forests.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive cancer with limited treatment options due to its desmoplastic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which impedes drug delivery and limits T cell infiltration. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown poor efficacy in PDAC, partly due to the desmoplastic stroma and low immunogenicity. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) promotes both fibrosis and immune evasion, making it a compelling target for TME remodeling. Here, we develop a dual-action, programmable immunoprobiotic delivery system (EcN@Nbs-NP@API-1) that combines Pin1 inhibition with PD-L1 blockade to enhance immunotherapy. This system uses Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to selectively deliver nanoparticles encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor API-1 to PDAC, enabling sustained release to degrade the fibrotic stroma and upregulate PD-L1 on tumor cells, promoting immune infiltration. Engineered EcN also produces anti-PD-L1 nanobodies in situ, synergizing with API-1 to boost CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity. In orthotopic PDAC mouse models, this strategy remodels the TME, enhances immune cell infiltration, and improves antitumor response while minimizing systemic toxicity. Moreover, it shows efficacy in other ECM-rich tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its broader potential. This work presents a promising platform to overcome immunotherapy resistance in solid tumors.",

While the cytotoxic and enterotoxic capabilities of this bacterium have been previously investigated, the strategies it employs to circumvent innate immune detection by the host remain poorly understood. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serves as the major pathogen-associated molecular pattern that triggers host inflammatory responses, and its lipid A structure contributes to the degree of innate immune system activation. We sought to define the structure of the lipid A component of LPS in V. para and probe its role in host innate immunity. Free living V. para synthesizes a predominantly hepta-acylated lipid A structure, while also producing a minor subset of hexa-acylated lipid A. This altered acylated lipid A elicits a weakened TLR4 immune response as compared to Escherichia coli , allowing V. para entry and replication inside host cells. Deletion of the V. para lipid A biosynthesis enzyme lpxM (VP0213) leads to a mutant strain with altered lipid A secondary acylation, enhanced immune response, and impaired replication within epithelial cells. This study provides evidence that the unique LPS structure synthesized by V. para plays a crucial role in evading host innate immunity, facilitating the bacterium’s survival and replication within host cells.",

          "abstract": "Fish population biomass fluctuates through time in ways that may be either gradual or abrupt. While abrupt shifts in fish population productivity have been shown to be common, they are rarely integrated into stock assessment or fishery management, in part because of the difficulty of predicting when abrupt shifts may occur and which stocks are prone to such shifts. In this study, we address the latter challenge by designing a mechanism-agnostic context-specific approach that is based on exploiting the dynamical properties of fish population fluctuations for detecting potential abrupt shifts. We use time series of fish population biomass from three global datasets, first, to classify their shapes into abrupt and nonabrupt (linear, quadratic, or no change) classes, and, second, to predict classified shapes based only on their dynamical footprint (a set of metrics such as variance, autocorrelation, etc, of the time series). We find that populations prone to abrupt shifts can be detected with moderate accuracy in the three datasets in spite of data limitations. In total, we identified 50 populations at risk of future abrupt shifts across 11 different Large Marine Ecosystem regions. Our context-specific approach offers critical insights into population stability and enables the identification of stocks whose dynamical properties suggest that they would benefit from more precautionary management.",

          "abstract": "Migratory locusts ( Locusta migratoria ) emit two key odorants during aggregation: 4-vinylanisole (4VA), which serves as an aggregation pheromone attracting conspecifics to form swarms, and phenylacetonitrile (PAN), which acts as an aposematic signal and a precursor of a defense toxin, deterring conspecifics from cannibalism and protecting against predators. However, how locusts reconcile these two conflicting olfactory signals while aggregating is not yet understood. Our study addresses this by examining the release dynamics of the two signals, their behavioral effects, and the neural mechanisms underlying their perception. 4VA is released earlier and at lower locust densities than PAN, with PAN’s release increasing as aggregation progresses. Although PAN’s emission levels eventually exceed those of 4VA, locusts consistently exhibit a preference for the emitted blend, regardless of variations in proportions and concentrations. Notably, increasing amounts of 4VA added to PAN can counteract PAN’s repellent effects, but this is not the case when PAN is added to 4VA. Mechanistically, we found that antennal neurons responsive to 4VA suppress the activity of neurons responsive to PAN. In the antennal lobe, it is the conduction velocities of projection neurons, rather than other neural properties, that are responsible for the observed behavioral pattern, leading to an overall attractive response. Collectively, our findings imply that insects are capable of harmonizing the effects of two distinct pheromones to optimize both social cohesion and chemical defense.",

In up to a quarter of individuals with BWSp, the epigenetic alterations are not confined to 11p15.5 imprinting control regions but also involve other imprinted gene clusters (multilocus imprinting disturbance; MLID). In a consanguineous family with two children diagnosed with BWSp and MLID, the affected individuals were homozygous for a missense variant in UHRF1 , a gene previously implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation. To investigate whether the UHRF1 c. 2001G&gt;C, p.(Lys667Asn) missense substitution predisposes to abnormal establishment/maintenance of genomic imprinting patterns, a genetically engineered mouse model with a Uhrf1 p.(Lys661Asn) variant was developed. Mice homozygous for the variant born to heterozygous mothers did not display an abnormal phenotype, but homozygotes born to healthy homozygous mothers displayed a range of phenotypes including prenatal lethality. Also, MLID was observed in affected mouse embryos. These findings are consistent with biallelic UHRF1 variants in affected individuals resulting in an autosomal recessively inherited cause of MLID in humans and expand the range of epigenetic disorders associated with UHRF1.",

While the extent of terminal Messinian drawdown and abruptness of reconnection are debated, recent work inferred that an anomalously long-lasting eastern Mediterranean organic-rich “mystery sapropel” layer was deposited due to salinity-stratification and anoxia following catastrophic flooding that refilled the basin. However, independent evidence is required to test this hypothesis. Here, we present extensive proxy data and numerical model results to show that irrespective of the largely hypersaline or oligohaline conditions proposed for the terminal Messinian, the eastern Mediterranean became oxygenated due to the ~1.5-km-high, turbulent and aerated cascade that refilled the basin, which created a salinity-stratified but oxygenated water column that allowed preservation of only the most recalcitrant organic components. Next, oxygen was gradually depleted over a period of up to 12,000 y due to remineralization of sinking organic matter, culminating in a stratified, anoxic basin. It took 33,000 y after flooding (7,000 y longer than suggested previously) for turbulent diffusion to weaken the stratification and allow resumption of convective deep-water renewal, which marked the final return of normal oxygenated marine conditions throughout the Mediterranean.",

          "abstract": "Phytophthora soja e-induced root rot poses a major threat to soybean production. While the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean– P. sojae interactions have been extensively studied, their biochemical basis remains largely unexplored. Previous research has identified key metabolic modules involved in pathogen defense, but structural diversity has largely been constrained by studies on single soybean accessions. Here, we broadened the chemical search space to a diverse soybean germplasm collection using high-throughput metabolomics as a powerful tool for comprehensive metabolic profiling. Chemical classes of lipids and phenylpropanoids again retrieved the most pronounced responses upon P. sojae infection in general. A two-layer analytical strategy further finely resolved metabolites into pathogenesis-, resistance-, and tolerance-type accumulation patterns, leading to the identification of cinnamaldehyde and coumestrol as potent defense metabolites. Bioassays validated cinnamaldehyde directly and strongly inhibited cyst germination and mycelial growth, and coumestrol, a benzofuran-type metabolite, exhibited broad-spectrum activity against spore germination as an identified phytoalexin. Multiomics analyses nailed down the candidate of coumestrol biosynthesis genes, and genetically overexpression of regulatory genes ( Dir2a/4a/4b ) in hairy root systems increased coumestrol accumulation thus positively correlating with improved host resistance. Interestingly, tolerance-type compounds may serve distinct ecological roles, as exemplified by daidzein, which, despite being classified as a tolerance-type metabolite, recruits more zoospores facilitating secondary infection in fact. This study highlights a systematic approach for population-level investigations and emphasizes the necessity of integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation to accurately predict metabolite or gene ecological functions.",

          "abstract": "The D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) is subject to light-induced damage. In plants, D1 photodamage activates translation of chloroplast psbA mRNA encoding D1, providing D1 for PSII repair. Three D1 assembly factors have been implicated in the regulatory mechanism: HCF244 and RBD1 activate psbA translation, whereas HCF136 represses psbA translation in the dark. To clarify the regulatory circuit, we analyzed psbA ribosome occupancy in dark-adapted and illuminated rbd1 and rbd1;hcf136 double mutants in Arabidopsis and in Zm- hcf244 and Zm- hcf244; Zm- hcf136 double mutants in maize. The results show that RBD1 is required for light-induced psbA translation but has only a small effect on psbA ribosome occupancy in the dark. RBD1 is not required for psbA translation when HCF136 is absent, indicating that RBD1 activates psbA translation in the light by inhibiting HCF136’s repressive effect. By contrast, HCF244 is required to recruit ribosomes to psbA mRNA in light, dark, and in the absence of HCF136. We demonstrate further that HCF244 is not required for the translational activator HCF173 to bind the psbA 5’UTR. These results show that RBD1 is central to the perception of the D1 photodamage that triggers D1 synthesis and that it activates psbA translation by relieving repression by an HCF136-dependent assembly intermediate. HCF244 activates downstream of those events without impacting HCF173’s binding to psbA mRNA. The results implicate a feature of nascent D1 that is affected by both HCF136 and RBD1 as the signal that reports D1 photodamage to regulate psbA translation rate as needed for PSII repair.",

The extensive genetic and antigenic diversity within and between IAV phylogenetic groups presents major challenges for developing universal vaccines and broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. Current interventions provide limited protection due to the virus’s high mutation rate and capacity for immune evasion. Recent advancements in viral hemagglutinin (HA)-targeting small-molecule entry inhibitors offer a promising avenue to overcome these limitations. Here, we present structural and functional analyses of two group 2 HA-specific small-molecule inhibitors recently identified by our team. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures revealed that these inhibitors bind a conserved pocket within the HA stalk, likely interfering with the conformational rearrangements necessary for membrane fusion and viral entry. Structure-guided mutagenesis confirmed the critical roles of key interacting residues and uncovered distinct resistance profiles between the two compounds, as well as in comparison to Arbidol, a previously reported HA inhibitor. Notably, our structural analysis highlights intrinsic barriers to achieving cross-group inhibition with current small-molecule designs. To address this, we propose an alternative strategy for broadening antiviral coverage. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into IAV entry inhibition and a foundation for the rational design of next-generation anti-influenza therapeutics.",

This parallel structure scaled effectively from two to three languages without needing additional neural architecture, highlighting the inherent efficiency in multilingual processing. Furthermore, the development of phonological representations varied based on the timing of language exposure, showing how earlier-learned languages shape the acquisition of subsequent ones.

Does the brain similarly support generalization across acting body parts for more evolutionarily recent actions, such as tool-use? We tested whether there is a body-part-independent action-type organization in sensorimotor areas by examining fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally included individuals born without hands to test whether hand sensorimotor experience is necessary for the development of this action-type organization. Across analyses, we found a consistent dissociation in the motor system. The primary sensorimotor cortices encoded concrete, body-part specific information in both groups. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network represent abstract, action-type information independent of the body part for both groups. Together, our results suggest that the hierarchical organization of the motor system is not dependent on a long evolutionary history of an action. Further, this organization is not dependent on an individual’s manual sensorimotor experience. Our results also show that the functional reorganization in congenital handlessness follows the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex, revealing the limitations of brain plasticity.

Insertions and deletions (indels) were commonly observed in both repeat and nonrepeat sequences in wild-type cells. The loss of DNA polymerase β (Polβ), an enzyme involved in gap-filling during base excision repair and Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET)-mediated active DNA demethylation, in neural progenitor cells increased indel frequency by ~ninefold at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and raised the frequency of structural variants by ~fivefold. These mutations were enriched in neuronal genes, leading to frameshift mutations, amino acid insertions/deletions, and the gain and loss of CpG sites in regulatory regions. Our findings suggest that Polβ preferentially repairs DNA lesions generated at CpG sites by TET-mediated active demethylation, thereby suppressing the mutagenesis that accompanies neuronal gene activation during cortical development.",

We leveraged spatially explicit tree inventory data from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in Puerto Rico to validate soil eDNA as a spatially explicit indicator of tree diversity/composition. Using a comprehensive local chloroplast trnL -P6 reference library, we analyzed soil samples at multiple scales through eDNA trnL -P6 metabarcoding. We compared eDNA taxonomic diversity/composition, considering several bioinformatic thresholds, with inventory data across a range of spatial scales, as well as random points to compare observed correlations with random expectations. Despite considerable fine-scale heterogeneity in soil plant eDNA composition, we detected 53 tree Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) across the LFDP, corresponding to 68% of tree OTUs from the census data. Encouragingly, this equated to 98% of the total basal area (and 98% of the total stems). An initial confusion matrix evaluation suggested a highly localized eDNA signal (within 5 m of the sampled locations). However, comparison with random expectations revealed a lack of support for a fine-scale spatial signal due to misclassification (i.e., eDNA false presence or/and false absence) of relatively common taxa. Our study shows that “universal” PCR primer metabarcoding of tree eDNA in tropical soils may be useful for assessing dominant taxa at landscape scales, but not for spatially explicit characterization of rare species and community composition at local scales.",

          "abstract": "For centuries, scientists have been puzzled by the mystery of life’s biomolecular homochirality—the single-handedness of biological compounds. Sugars and nucleic acids are right-handed, while amino acids are left-handed in biological systems. Likewise, certain metabolites are homochiral, though their handedness varies. However, efforts to address the homochirality problem have often focused on a single compound, a single molecular class, or invoke an extraterrestrial origin. Here, we emphasize the importance of achieving homochirality across an entire prebiotic chemical network and explore a terrestrial pathway for its emergence. This pathway is supported by recent experimental results from several independent studies, as well as analyses of pristine asteroid materials. Our analysis identifies the genome as a key site for achieving network-scale homochirality on early Earth and addresses the opposite handedness of D -nucleic acids and L -peptides in biology through nonenzymatic, stereoselective coded peptide synthesis.",

To investigate the effect of warming duration on plant biomass responses, we analyzed a global dataset of 2,291 paired observations, revealing that warming increased overall aboveground plant biomass by 9.4% and belowground biomass by 2.6%. However, as the warming duration increased, the positive plant biomass response shifted to neutral or negative, with great biomass reductions in regions where mean annual temperatures exceeded 10 °C. Global aboveground biomass is projected to decline by 4 to 16% under a 2 °C increase in climate warming. Our study suggests that long-term climate warming will significantly weaken plant carbon storage, even if temperature increases remain within the targets of the Paris Agreement, and offers empirical constraints for global biomass–climate models.",

Metagenome sequencing and robust statistical analysis have linked specific strains, including the gut bacterium Campylobacter concisus , to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, together known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the roles of this and other strains in disease progression remain to be investigated. Herein, we assess the contribution of C. concisus secondary metabolites to inflammation. Through untargeted metabolomics, we identified a diverse array of nineteen indole-containing metabolites produced by C. concisus , including trisindoline, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. Collectively, these metabolites modulate inflammatory responses by significantly inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. The metabolites act through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor arylhydrocarbon receptor and in vivo intravital imaging revealed a marked increase in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, specifically neutrophils and macrophages, following the administration of trisindoline. Several indole metabolites also exhibited antimicrobial activity against commensal strains that facilitate a proper immune response. Our study provides a possible rationale for the association of C. concisus with IBD and underscores the complex interplay between gut bacteria and host immunity. The identification of indole-derived secondary metabolites as key modulators of inflammation offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

In the electrolysis system, CO 2 is converted into C 2 oxygenates using a Cu–Ag tandem electrocatalyst. The electrolysis process generates a liquid stream containing ~ 200 mM acetate in a bio-compatible electrolyte.

          "abstract": "Selected proteins containing an N-terminal cysteine (Nt-Cys) are subjected to rapid, O 2 -dependent proteolysis via the Cys/Arg-branch of the N-degron pathway. Cysteine dioxygenation is catalyzed in mammalian cells by 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), an enzyme that manifests extreme O 2 sensitivity. The canonical substrates of this pathway in mammalia are the regulators of G-protein signaling 4, 5, and 16, as well as interleukin-32. In addition to operating as an O 2 -sensing mechanism, this pathway has previously been described as a sensor of nitric oxide (NO), with robust effects on substrate stability upon modulation of NO bioavailability being widely demonstrated. Despite this, no mechanism to describe the action of NO on the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway has yet been substantiated. We demonstrate that NO can regulate the stability of Cys N-degron substrates indirectly via the regulation of ADO cosubstrate availability. Through competitive, O 2 -dependent inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, NO can substantially modify cellular O 2 consumption rate and, in doing so, alter the availability of O 2 for Nt-Cys dioxygenation. We show that this increase in O 2 availability in response to NO exposure is sufficient to alter both dynamic and steady-state ADO substrate levels. It is likely that this mechanism operates to couple O 2 supply and mitochondrial respiration with responses to G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation.",

Yet there is still limited understanding of the impacts of climate change and human water withdrawal on river connectivity. Here, we assess the river flow connectivity of 217,001 river reaches in mainland China from 1961 to 2020 and the impact of different climate warming trends and water withdrawals for different sectors. We estimate that naturally intermittent rivers represent about 13% of all river reaches, with a large contrast between northern and southern China (12% vs. 1%, respectively). Although river intermittency decreased slightly during this period (i.e., river connectivity lengthened due to increasing precipitation), warming temperatures offset this decrease by reducing surface water persistence, causing the decrease (−476 vs. −233 km/y) to double when removing the long-term temperature trend. Critically, the length of intermittent rivers increased remarkably from 13 to 50% when considering human water withdrawal by agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, in addition to environmental flow requirements. Our findings highlight the urgent need to maintain sustainable water resources in a warming climate in which unregulated water abstractions increasingly threaten river flow connectivity, particularly in drying regions.",

          "abstract": "Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a severely painful condition that profoundly impacts patients’ quality of life. However, the neuroimmune mechanisms underlying CIBP remain largely elusive. Substance P (SP), which is known to play a pivotal role in pain perception, became the focal point of our study. To this end, we adopted a comprehensive approach combining behavioral and physiological methods to investigate its role in neuroimmune interactions in CIBP. The results showed that SP released by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via exocytosis initiates CIBP, with its release peaking on the 14th day and correlating with pain behavior. Macrophages were found to infiltrate the DRGs and the sciatic nerves. Notably, in mice with CIBP, the population of macrophage type I was significantly augmented. Significantly, we found that the deletion of macrophages led to a notable alleviation of CIBP, while the blockade of the SP-neurokinin 1 receptor pathway effectively mitigated the infiltration of macrophages and alleviated CIBP. In the advanced phase, DRGs released C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 to recruit macrophages. A two-phase model for CIBP progression in mice was proposed, with SP-induced macrophage infiltration in the primary phase and chemokine-mediated macrophage recruitment in the advanced phase. Our investigation has unearthed a previously unrecognized mechanism governing the neuroimmune interaction in CIBP, which highlights a critical target for impeding the progression of this debilitating pain, potentially opening up broad avenues for the development of effective therapeutic interventions at different stages of CIBP with cancer development.",

          "abstract": "Sialic acids (Sias) are a diverse family of nine-carbon backbone monosaccharides occupying terminal positions on cell surface and secreted glycans and are abundant at mucosal surfaces. Sias can be modified with O -acetyl esters on the side chain (C7 to C9) hydroxyls. Structural analysis and functional studies of these modifications are challenging due to chemical lability and variable resistance to sialidases. For in-depth analysis of the expression and functions of O -acetyl Sia modifications, we used a unique set of sialoglycan-recognizing probes, HPLC analysis of DMB-derivatized Sias and mice lacking the first known sialate O -acetyltransferase, CASD1. C7/C9- O -acetylated Sias are most abundant in the colon, with lower levels in the heart, brain, and spleen, and minimal levels in other digestive organs of wild-type mice. CASD1 deficiency led to a marked loss of C9/C7- O -acetylated Sias in the colon and other tissues. No differences were observed in colonic O -acetylated Sias from conventional and germ-free wild-type mice, indicating that Sia O -acetylation is independent of the commensal microbiota. Nonetheless, CASD1 deficiency caused subtle changes in microbial gene repertoire consistent with potential exploitation of Sias by subsets of intestinal microbes. Furthermore, CASD1-deficient mice exhibited more severe inflammation and ulceration upon colitis induction compared to controls. Reduced Sia O -acetylation was observed in mice during acute colitis and in colon biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Together, our findings suggest CASD1 is the primary physiologically relevant enzyme to add C7/C8/C9- O -acetyl ester groups to Sias and that these Sia modifications exert important gut-protective functions, perhaps by preventing microbial Sia release and metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC), a statistical correlation of pair-wise brain signals from resting-state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI), is a widely used concept for mapping large-scale functional networks in both humans and animals. However, its underlying causal mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly for strong interhemispheric connectivity (e.g., homotopic connections) consistently observed in FC. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of RS FC in mice using fMRI with anatomically defined patterned optogenetic activation and inhibition of excitatory neurons in six cortical regions. Unlike commonly used optogenetic activation, optogenetic silencing suppresses spontaneous neural activity in a localized region, reducing RS synaptic inputs to downstream networked areas. Consequently, fMRI can track spontaneous functional connections without the neural perturbations associated with excitation. While conventional optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the targeted cortical areas predominantly elicited their ipsilateral functional responses in both cortical and subcortical regions, optogenetic silencing induced both intra- and interhemispheric cortical responses, which were stronger than cortical-subcortical connections. These effects more closely resembled statistically defined RS FC patterns, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of intrinsic FC. By modeling synaptic path length-dependent connectivity patterns based on structural connectivity (SC), we found that spontaneous functional connections can be explained by polysynaptic propagation, whereas evoked activity is largely restricted to monosynaptic pathways. These findings highlight the critical role of polysynaptic pathways in shaping spontaneous connectivity, suggesting that RS FC arises from causal interactions of spontaneous ongoing neural activity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding mechanisms that determine the response of cells to ferroptotic stress is a timely issue that has significant ramifications for biology and pathology. We investigated these mechanisms in the context of breast cancer where tumors are composed of diverse populations of cancer cells that differ in their ferroptosis sensitivity. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we determined that cancer cell populations with luminal differentiation are more resistant to ferroptosis than other cells within a heterogeneous tumor. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis and experimentation revealed that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes luminal differentiation, has a causal role in ferroptosis resistance in luminal breast cancer cells. In pursuit of the mechanism involved, we found that GATA3 represses the expression of integrin β1 and its downstream signaling cascade. This observation led us to demonstrate that integrin β1 signaling is necessary for sensitivity to ferroptosis in basal breast cancer cells because it regulates a FAK/ROCK pathway that sustains the expression of ACSL4, a lipid-modifying enzyme that is essential for ferroptosis. The repression of integrin β1 by GATA3 inhibits this signaling pathway, rendering cells ferroptosis resistant. Together, these data provide insight into mechanisms of ferroptosis sensitivity and resistance that are linked to the cell biology and signaling pathways of the diverse types of cells present in breast tumors.",

It is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), undergoes N-linked glycosylation, and is subsequently transported to the Golgi before ultimately reaching the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying the processing and maturation of TLR4 in the ER remain elusive. Through whole genome-wide CRISPR screening, CCDC134 was identified as a critical and essential factor for TLR4-dependent inflammatory response. Localization of CCDC134 in the ER lumen rather than its exosome-mediated secretion is required for its role in TLR4 signaling. Loss of CCDC134 results in the retention of TLR4 in the ER for subsequent ER-associated degradation, and thus blockade of TLR4 maturation and plasma membrane trafficking. Defects in TLR4 processing and maturation in the ER in CCDC134-depleted cells are caused by aberrant hyperglycosylation and destabilization of glycoprotein 96 (gp96), a key chaperone of TLR4. These results suggest that CCDC134 controls gp96 glycosylation to facilitate TLR4 maturation in the ER.",

We present evidence that the specialized metabolism of the oral microbiome is a critical yet underexplored factor in oral biofilm formation. Through microbiome analysis, we identified a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) encoding biosynthetic gene cluster that correlates with dental caries and is widely represented in oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans . This gene cluster produces two major mutanoclumpin metabolites, MC-584 and MC-586, which feature molecular scaffolds differing in a C–C macrocyclic linkage. Both metabolites synergistically promote robust biofilm formation of S. mutans through a rare dual-metabolite mode of action. Further, each metabolite binds uniquely to the S. mutans cell surface, resulting in distinct multicellular morphologies. The biosynthesis of mutanoclumpins employs a unique chemical logic that produces two major products, rare within PKS-NRPS assembly lines. This study underscores the importance of characterizing genes implicated in human diseases through microbiome analysis and lays the foundation for exploring strategies to inhibit streptococci-induced dental caries.",

However, the “black-box” nature of these representations limits transparency and explainability, posing challenges for human–AI collaboration and leaving open questions about their human-interpretable features. Here, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant, transcoders, from natural language processing to extract, in a completely unsupervised fashion, interpretable sparse features present in both protein-level and amino acid (AA)-level representations from ESM2, a popular PLM. Unlike other approaches such as training probes for features, the extraction of features by the SAE is performed without any supervision. We find that many sparse features extracted from SAEs trained on protein-level representations are tightly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms across all levels of the GO hierarchy. We also use Anthropic’s Claude to automate the interpretation of sparse features for both protein-level and AA-level representations and find that many of these features correspond to specific protein families and functions such as the NAD Kinase, IUNH, and the PTH family, as well as proteins involved in methyltransferase activity and in olfactory and gustatory sensory perception. We show that sparse features are more interpretable than ESM2 neurons across all our trained SAEs and transcoders. These findings demonstrate that SAEs offer a promising unsupervised approach for disentangling biologically relevant information present in PLM representations, thus aiding interpretability. This work opens the door to safety, trust, and explainability of PLMs and their applications, and paves the way to extracting meaningful biological insights across increasingly powerful models in the life sciences.",

Mitophagy, a selective degradation pathway of mitochondria through a double-membrane sac named autophagosome (also known as mitophagosome), plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Typically, wholesale mitophagy requires the elongation of a cup-shaped phagophore along the entire mitochondrion, which finally seals and closes as a mitophagosome. How plant mitophagosome formation and mitochondria sequestration are coordinated remains incompletely understood. In this work, we report an unappreciated role of the plant-specific mitochondrial fission regulator ELM1, together with the dynamin-related protein family DRP3 and the autophagic regulator SH3P2, to coordinate mitochondria segregation for piecemeal mitophagy under heat stress conditions. Dysfunction in mitochondrial fission activity impairs heat-induced mitophagy, leading to an accumulation of interconnected megamitochondria which are partially sequestered by the ATG8-positive phagophore. Furthermore, we show that the ELM1-mediated piecemeal mitophagy also engages the plant archetypal selective autophagic receptor NBR1. Using 3D tomography analysis, we illustrate the morphological features and spatial relationship of the megamitochondria and phagophore intermediates in connection with the mitochondrial fission sites. Collectively, our study provides an updated model of mitophagosome formation for piecemeal mitophagy mediated by the plant-unique mitochondrial fission machinery.",

          "abstract": "In locations that do not currently experience vector-borne disease (VBD) outbreaks but may be at risk under climate change, modeling future climate suitability for transmission is important for outbreak preparedness. Uncertainty in the future climate arises from three sources—differences in emissions scenarios, structural uncertainty across climate models, and internal climate variability (ICV)—but ICV is rarely considered in climate-VBD studies. Here, we demonstrate that ICV is a key source of uncertainty in climate suitability for VBD transmission, even decades into the future. Because of ICV, suitable climate conditions for transmission may arise in many locations sooner than expected under climate change alone.",

However, emerging evidence suggests that these number–space connections may reflect our evolutionary history and emerge even in the absence of cultural tools. We examined how task-naïve monkeys learn spatial and numerical concepts over time. Monkeys’ learning trajectories revealed successful learning of both numerical and geometric concepts. Discriminability effects showed that abstract quantitative features were stronger predictors of accuracy on both tasks than low-level visual similarity, reflecting abstract processing of both tasks. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that learning in the geometry task significantly predicted future gains in numerosity performance, even after controlling session-level trends, within-task stability, and general performance factors. Together, these findings provide evidence that spatial and numerical learning in primates rely on mutual cognitive processes. Such representations could form the evolutionary foundation for the well-documented “cognitive bridge” between numerical and spatial reasoning in human development.",

          "authors": "Erin Faught, Marcel J. M. Schaaf",
          "abstract": "It is well established that stress generally suppresses immunity. However, under certain conditions, acute stress has been shown to stimulate the immune system, particularly those at barrier surfaces like the skin. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. In the present study, we have identified an immune-enhancing effect of stress using zebrafish larvae. The use of this animal model allowed us to visualize the redistribution of macrophages to the skin upon exposure to an acute stressor, which appeared to be dependent on the increased levels of cortisol. Through real-time imaging of fluorescently labeled leukocytes, we observed that this cortisol-driven redistribution was mediated by both the mineralocorticoid and the glucocorticoid receptor, which upregulated the chemokine receptor Cxcr4. Strikingly, this stress-induced macrophage migration required the presence of melanocytes in the skin, which increased the expression of the gene encoding Cxcl12, the ligand for Cxcr4. This result indicates a pivotal role for pigment cells in immune regulation under stress. Functional assays further revealed that the redistributed macrophages actively increased antigen uptake from the external environment, suggesting an elevated state of immune readiness. Together, we demonstrate that acute stress triggers a coordinated, cortisol-mediated response that enhances immune surveillance at the skin barrier. This stress-induced enhancement of barrier immunity potentially prepares the organism for increased pathogen exposure under challenging conditions.",

X-ray crystal structures of a functionally promiscuous flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)–bound oxidase, MaDS1, with and without an oxidative dehydrogenation product were determined at 2.03 Å and 2.21 Å resolution, respectively. Structure-guided mutagenesis and sequence analysis have identified a conserved aspartic acid that directs the reaction toward the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has revealed that aspartic acid acts as the catalytic base to deprotonate the carbon-cation intermediate to generate the dehydrogenated product, which otherwise undergoes a spontaneous 6π electrocyclization in the oxidative cyclization pathway to furnish the 2H-benzopyran product.",

          "abstract": "Recent scholarship has highlighted the rise of “diversity projects” across various educational and business contexts, but few studies have explored the meaning of diversity in biomedical research. In this paper, we employ a computationally driven matching technique to examine quantitative trends in the use of various forms of diversity and population terminology in a sample of nearly two million biomedical abstracts spanning a 30-y period. The curated dictionaries we leverage to detect these trends were formalized into open-source software that are publicly available for other researchers to use. Our analyses demonstrate marked growth in diversity, sex, gender, life course, and socioeconomic terms while terms relating to race and ethnicity largely plateaued or declined in usage, beginning in the mid-2000s. In addition, the use of national, continental, and subcontinental population labels increased dramatically over the same period. We also present logistic regression analyses to investigate what may be fueling the rise in use of diversity terminology. We argue that the use of diversity has grown to encompass concepts beyond its historical origins in race-based programs as it has in fields like higher education and employment. Despite some critics’ claims regarding the role of diversity in research, we do not find evidence that its use signals retreat from or commitment to equity and inclusion efforts.",

While existing solutions work reasonably well for collimated light sources—lasers and optical fibers—analytical solutions for LEDs remain missing, despite the growing use of LEDs in wearable and implantable bioelectronics. We present a method to solve the diffusion theory and derive analytical solutions for two biomedically relevant configurations: 1) surface-mounted LEDs on semi-infinite media (e.g., wearable devices) and 2) embedded LEDs in infinite media (e.g., implantable devices). Beyond a distance of 4 times the scattering length of the medium to the LED source, our analytical solutions are reasonably accurate, within 6% error for 1) and 3% for 2). This represents significant improvements over existing analytical solutions, characterized by 26% and 15% error, respectively. Using our analytical solutions, we derive tissue optical properties ( μ a and μ s ′ ) from diffuse reflectance results with &lt;7% error, and we determine the irradiance threshold for photostimulation, aligned with experimental optogenetic activation data. Our analytical solutions are readily adaptable to various biomedical applications, offering a rigorous theoretical foundation for next-generation LED-based bioelectronics, to enable more accurate optical diagnostics and therapies in clinical applications.",

Here, we report that the Drosophila melanogaster female’s pair of spermathecae, which appear similar and have the common role of sperm storage, derive from different developmental compartments defined by expression of lineage-tracing markers corresponding, respectively, to the key patterning genes engrailed and wingless . We further find that the two spermathecae show significant differences in size, secretory activity, and calcium levels and, perhaps as a consequence, sperm retention dynamics.

          "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) persistently threaten wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, and public health. The East Asian–Australasian Flyway plays a crucial role in HPAIV dynamics due to its large populations of migratory waterfowl and poultry. Over recent decades, this flyway has undergone substantial landscape changes, including both losses and gains of waterfowl habitats. These changes can affect waterfowl distributions, increase contact with poultry, and consequently alter ecological conditions that favor avian influenza virus (AIV) evolution. However, limited research has assessed these likely impacts. Here, we integrated empirical data and an individual-based model to simulate AIV transmission in migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, including wild-to-poultry spillover and reassortment dynamics in poultry, across landscapes representing the years 2000 and 2015. We used the reassortment incidence as a proxy for ecological and transmission conditions that support viral diversification and the emergence of novel subtypes. Our simulations show that landscape change reshaped the waterfowl distribution, facilitated bird aggregation at improved habitats, increased coinfection, and raised reassortment rate by 1,593%, indicating a substantially higher potential for viral diversification and emergence. Model-generated risk maps show expanded and increased reassortment risk in southeastern China, the Yellow River Basin, and northeastern China. These findings suggest the importance of landscape change as a driver of potential AIV diversification and subtype emergence. This underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate landscape dynamics, host movement, and viral evolution to better assess and mitigate future risk.",

This trajectory of vocal development in humans is radically different from those of our close phylogenetic relatives, cercopithecoid monkeys and apes. In these primates, social feedback seems to play no significant role in their vocal development. Oddly,marmoset monkeys, a more distantly related primate species, do exhibit socially guided vocal learning. How can this be? We hypothesized that the evolution of human and marmoset vocal learning in early infancy is facilitated by their neurally altricial births (relative to other primates) and their cooperative breeding social environment. Our analysis found that, indeed, both human and marmoset brains are growing faster at birth when compared with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, making humans and marmoset monkeys altricial relative to these other primates. The time interval of this faster brain growth overlaps with important vocal learning milestones. We formalized our hypothesis using a simple model showing that if vocal learning is influenced by the timing of brain growth and social stimuli, it benefits from an altricial brain and a cooperative breeding environment. Our data support the idea that the evolution of socially guided vocal learning during early infancy in humans and marmosets was afforded by infants with an altricial brain embedded in a vocally rich environment.",

          "abstract": "Small and fragmented populations are at high risk of local extinction, in part because of elevated inbreeding and subsequent inbreeding depression. A major conservation priority is to identify the mechanisms and extent of inbreeding depression in small populations. The eastern massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus ) rattlesnake is listed as Federally Threatened in the United States, having experienced significant habitat fragmentation and concomitant population declines over the past 200 years. Here, we use long-term monitoring of two wild populations of eastern massasaugas in Michigan to estimate the extent of inbreeding in each population, identify mechanisms that generate inbreeding, and test for the impact of inbreeding on fitness. Using targeted genomic data and spatial coordinates of capture locations from over 1000 individuals, we find evidence of inbreeding and link inbreeding to spatial kinship structure within populations, possibly driven by limited dispersal. We reconstruct multigenerational pedigrees for each population to measure reproductive output and use long-term capture–recapture data to estimate individual survival (i.e., the two major components of fitness). We find evidence of inbreeding depression in both fitness metrics. The 5% most inbred individuals are 13.5% less likely to have any surviving offspring and have 11.6% lower annual survival compared to all less inbred individuals. By combining genomics and long-term monitoring data, we are able to link the life history of eastern massasaugas to inbreeding and detect relationships between fitness and inbreeding. These insights provide important conservation context for future management and for understanding how spatial structure can generate inbreeding depression even at fine spatial scales.",

Large, inland cities can receive 10% more summer afternoon rainfall, and the pattern varies with urban heat islands and wind conditions. Coastal cities, under the influence of sea-land breeze, experience three times amplified daily urban precipitation enhancements than inland cities. Urban impacts are also noted for mountain cities, affecting their topography-dominated precipitation patterns. With increasing thresholds of extreme precipitation, most US cities experience more intense rainfall compared to their rural backgrounds.

Through genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches, we demonstrated that PFT-α mimics ethylene by deactivating the ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1). Accumulated ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) influences the expression of phytochrome-interacting factors ( PIF4 and PIF7 ) and subsequently inhibits shade-induced hypocotyl elongation.

Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 somatic tumorigenesis in mice to identify transcriptomic and metabolomic features distinguishing CDKN2A - versus P53 -deleted MPNSTs. Convergent, multiomic analyses revealed that CDKN2A -deleted MPNSTs are especially dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NADPH metabolism for growth and viability. Disruption of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the PPP rate-limiting enzyme, slowed CDKN2A -deleted MPNST growth and sensitized MPNSTs to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Knockdown of the redox-regulated transcription factor NRF2 slowed MPNST growth and decreased G6PD transcription. Analysis of patient MPNSTs identified a NRF2 gene signature correlating with tumor transformation. Furthermore, G6PD and NRF2 expression in PanCancer TCGA samples correlates with patient survival. This work identifies NRF2-PPP dependency as a targetable vulnerability in these difficult-to-treat MPNSTs, particularly in the NF1/CDKN2A -deleted majority.",

Here, we use a coherent feature-tracking method to identify ocean-to-land water availability surpluses (OWASs), characterized by spatiotemporally contiguous migration of excess atmospheric freshwater (precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration) from ocean to land. Over the past several decades, especially in northern mid-high latitudes (NMHL; above 48°N), OWASs have exhibited longer persistence, wider areal extent, and greater intensity than those developed solely over land. These landward migrations are associated with seasonal Atlantic teleconnection and Pacific circulation shift. Under the business-as-usual scenario, these two processes are projected to be enhanced, markedly increasing OWAS characteristics in NMHL driven by thermodynamic atmospheric responses to future warming. Intensified OWASs may not only help alleviate long-term droughts but also have the potential to accentuate pluvial risks.",

          "abstract": "Protracted droughts may have contributed to sociopolitical upheaval and depopulation of cultural centers in the Maya Lowlands during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE). Regional proxy climate records suggest multiple prolonged drought episodes during the Terminal Classic. The relationship between drought and response of individual sites, however, remains unclear because of large chronological uncertainties and poor temporal resolution of existing local paleoclimate inferences. We present a subannual rainfall record from northwest Yucatán, Mexico, derived from an annually laminated stalagmite spanning 871 to 1021 CE, with ±6-year age uncertainty. Interpretation of the stalagmite oxygen isotope record is supported by modern rain and drip water monitoring. Precisely dated droughts enable detailed analyses of timing and dynamics of regional human-climate interactions. Despite uncertainties in archaeological chronologies, these results suggest political activity at major northern Maya sites, including Chichén Itzá and Uxmal, declined at different times relative to droughts, implying differential cultural responses to climate stress.",

However, achieving prolonged and reliable sweat sampling, along with stable biochemical analysis, remains challenging due to inconsistent secretion, rapid evaporation, and the reliance on external stimulation. Here, we present BMS 3 , a bioinspired microfluidic wearable sweat sensor system designed for multiday continuous metabolic monitoring. BMS 3 integrates hierarchically graded microchannels and superhydrophobic-superhydrophilic Janus membranes, inspired by pitcher plant trichomes and lotus leaves to enable efficient low volume sweat collection, transport, and renewal. A miniaturized carbachol gel–based iontophoresis module autonomously induces localized sweat secretion. Furthermore, the microfluidic design sustains sweat sampling for over 2 days from a single iontophoresis session, eliminating the need for physical exertion. In vitro and in vivo studies in healthy participants and patients with gout demonstrate BMS 3 ’s capability for continuous metabolic monitoring. By simultaneously tracking uric acid, xanthine, and alcohol levels, it effectively differentiates normal and pathological states while delivering timely therapeutic feedback.",

Through the construction of a fibroblast-specific transcriptional gene regulatory network, we found ITGAL and DUSP9 as key druggable targets for human myocardial fibrosis.

Inspired by human tactile perception, we developed a bioarchitectonics-inspired soft slip sensor with a three-dimensional structure that leverages crack and stress concentration to enhance sensitivity to incipient slip and shear force. Complementarily, a soft gripper with a linear pressure-to-force response was engineered to enable stable and predictable force modulation. The flexible slip sensors were conformally integrated onto the grippers, forming a fully perceptive soft robotic system capable of detecting early-stage slippage and investigating interfacial frictional properties. This integration establishes a closed-loop sensorimotor framework that notably improves the reliability and adaptability of soft robotic grasping across a wide range of real-world applications.",

We validate FS-ODT on samples of known composition, hindered diffusion of colloids in solution, and the motility of bacterial swimmers. We also integrate FS-ODT into a multimodal microscope combining refractive index imaging with multicolor structured illumination microscopy.

However, ranges of species in these regions are also distinctly more patchy and elongated than those found in adjacent lowlands. Our global analysis of mainland birds demonstrates that these range shapes augment the spatial variation in species richness. Both the linearity and patchiness of species ranges are most pronounced in aseasonal and topographically complex regions, most notably in the tropical Andes, where these range shapes contribute more to the pattern of species richness than broad-scale variations in range size. Consequently, niche-based processes that govern the spatial configuration of habitats contribute to patterns of species richness in global hotspots over and above the processes that affect species richness through range sizes.",

These are crucial in physics for understanding quantized bulk transport and exotic boundary effects of linear wave propagation in (meta-)materials. Beyond linear Hamiltonian systems, topological physics strives to characterize open (non-Hermitian) and interacting systems. Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems by defining a graph index for their Floquet semiclassical equations of motion. Our index builds upon the topology of vector flows and encodes the particle-hole nature of excitations around all out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Thus, we uncover the topology of nonlinear resonator’s dynamics under external and parametric forcing. Our framework sheds light on the topology of driven-dissipative phases, including under- to overdamped responses and symmetry-broken phases linked to population inversion. We therefore expose the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for interacting topological insulators, topological solitons, neuromorphic networks, and bosonic codes.",

Here, we identify learning-dependent, subtype-specific plasticity in layer 2/3 SST neurons of the mouse somatosensory cortex. Martinotti-type, SST neurons expressing calbindin-2 show a selective decrease in excitatory synaptic input and stimulus-evoked calcium responses, as mice learn a stimulus-reward association.

Using custom-made, low-cost rain collectors, we sampled rainwash eDNA in a mature Amazonian forest and a nearby tree plantation. We successfully detected eDNA from tropical woody and epiphyte plants, vertebrates (mammals, birds, and amphibians), and insects (e.g., mosquitoes, ants, and beetles). The taxonomic composition and diversity reflected disturbance, with significantly lower diversity in the plantation. Crucially, rainwash eDNA integrated biodiversity over a 10-day period in passive collectors and provided a local signature.

          "abstract": "Columns are the morphological and functional units containing multiple neurons in the brain. The molecular mechanisms of column formation are largely unknown. Ephrin/Eph signaling mediates a variety of developmental processes. Ephrin acts as a ligand for Eph to regulate forward signaling, whereas Eph acts as a ligand for Ephrin to regulate reverse signaling. However, whether and how the uni- or bidirectional Ephrin/Eph signaling is involved in column formation remains elusive. In this study, we show that Ephrin and Eph regulate the morphology and location of columnar neurons through bidirectional repulsive signaling. Furthermore, Eph ligand triggers cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation of Ephrin under the control of Src kinases and Fasciclin 2 (Fas2), forming the Ephrin/Src/Fas2 complex to promote reverse signaling through a downstream regulator, Rac1. This study provides the detailed analysis of the molecular interactions involved in column formation using the fly brain as a model.",

          "abstract": "Cellular signaling relies on the activity of transmembrane receptors and their presentation on the cellular surface. Their continuous insertion in the plasma membrane is balanced by constitutive and activity-dependent internalization, which is orchestrated by adaptor proteins recognizing semispecific motifs within the receptors’ intracellular regions. Here, we describe a complementary trafficking mechanism for G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that is evolutionary conserved and refined. This mechanism relies on the insertion of their amphipathic helix 8 into the inner leaflet of lipid membranes, orthogonal to the transmembrane helices. These amphipathic helices dictate subcellular localization of the receptors and autonomously drive their endocytosis by cooperative assembly and association with areas of high membrane curvature. The strength of helix 8 membrane insertion propensity quantitatively predicts the rate of constitutive internalization of GPCRs. This discovery advances our understanding of membrane protein trafficking and highlights a principle of receptor-lipid interactions that may have broad implications for cellular signaling and therapeutic targeting.",

          "abstract": "N , N -dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a psychoactive molecule present in the human brain. DMT is under clinical evaluation as a neuroprotective agent in poststroke recovery. Yet, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model, we previously showed that DMT reduces infarct volume. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is accompanied by reduction of cerebral edema, attenuated astrocyte dysfunction, and a shift in serum protein composition toward an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective state. DMT restored tight junction integrity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in vitro and in vivo. DMT suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells and reduced microglial activation via the sigma-1 receptor. Our findings prove that DMT mitigates a poststroke effect by stabilizing the BBB and reducing neuroinflammation. Such interactions of DMT with the vascular and immune systems can be leveraged to complement current, insufficient, stroke therapy.",

The mechanisms by which these distributed synaptic alterations produce the heterogenous symptoms of psychosis remain poorly understood. Using magnetoencephalographical source imaging, we mapped psychosis-related alterations of various features of intrinsic neural population dynamics across the human cortex. The cortex-wide patterns of these features were highly reproducible and related to the anatomical hierarchy of cortical areas. We found similar changes in these patterns for individuals with a first episode of psychosis and those at clinical high risk for psychosis. Maps of psychosis-induced changes in dynamics resembled the maps of GABA-A receptor densities and of pharmacological GABA-A or NMDA manipulation effects on cortical dynamics in healthy participants. The level of pattern similarity to GABA-A manipulation effects in individual patients correlated with positive symptoms, while the pattern similarity to NMDA effects correlated with negative symptoms. Our results open up a window on the distributed mechanisms of psychotic symptoms.",

To address these critical issues, we present a theranostic platform that seamlessly integrates armored core–gold nanostar (AC-GNS)–mediated PTT with full-view photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), enabling nanoparticle tracking and real-time imaging-guided PTT in deep tissues. The AC-GNS platform delivered exceptional photostability and thermal resilience beyond those of conventional nanoparticles while serving as a high-performance contrast agent for PACT and a photothermal transducer for PTT. Integrating AC-GNS–mediated PTT with noninvasive PACT enabled whole-body nanoparticle tracking, PTT treatment monitoring via thermal imaging, and thermal dose determination, culminating in a 100% survival rate in a murine bladder cancer model without long-term treatment-related toxicity. This theranostic platform lays the foundation for broader research applications and provides opportunities for advancing solid tumor treatment and response assessment research.",

          "abstract": "Rangifer tarandus (caribou or reindeer) survived periods of abrupt climatic warming during the last deglaciation but are currently in global decline. Using process-explicit models of likely climate-human- Rangifer interactions and inferences of demographic change from radiocarbon-dated fossils and ancient DNA, we reconstruct and decipher 21,000 years of Rangifer population dynamics. These high-resolution population reconstructions pinpoint ecological characteristics and life-history traits that most likely enabled Rangifer to survive rapid warming events following the Last Glacial Maximum. Projecting these process-driven models into the future reveals that these attributes are unlikely to buffer Rangifer against wide-scale population declines from expected 21st Century climatic warming. Our findings highlight a need to boost investments in the management and conservation of Rangifer , particularly in North America, where projected losses are expected to exceed 80%. This will not only support the survival of the species and the vital services it renders in Arctic ecosystems, but also help sustain the socioeconomic, cultural, and emotional well-being of many Rangifer -dependent communities.",

We use relocated aftershocks, geodetic measurements, and seismic waveform data to distinguish contributions from closely separated fault structures of the 2024 M w 7.5 Noto earthquake. We find that the initial rupture triggered slip on a complex fault of a preceding swarm and led to bilateral slow rupture there. The earthquake ruptured two fault segments with contrasting dip angles along the eastern and western segments. Aftershocks continued to rupture the preexisting swarm faults. A delayed rupture occurred southwest of the hypocenter, implying that substantial resistance caused by a barrier temporally hindered rupture propagation. Additional stress from surrounding slip eventually overcame the strength of the barrier fault section, leading to a compound rupture. The mainshock triggered a small earthquake swarm, in which the relatively larger events were not followed by abundant aftershocks. Our findings demonstrate the influence of strong asperities and complex geometry in the progression of cascading ruptures.",

A lack of physical evidence hinders our understanding of the specialists who made Inka khipus (knotted cords that served as writing). On the basis of primarily Spanish-language colonial chronicles, it is thought that khipus were created exclusively by male bureaucratic elites. We analyzed Inka khipu, KH0631, whose primary cord is composed of human hair. Historically, human hair on a khipu served as a “signature” to indicate the khipu’s creator. Recent advances in elemental analysis–isotope ratio mass spectrometry allowed us to undertake simultaneous carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur measurements from a single KH0631 hair sample, revealing that this individual consumed a diet characteristic of low-ranking commoners. This finding suggests that commoners participated in Inka khipu production.",

          "abstract": "The genetic changes driving the evolution of humans since the human-chimpanzee split have been elusive. Here, we report a promising candidate in a chromosomal region linked with neurological defects—17p13.3. We show that this 442-nucleotide sequence—human-accelerated region (HAR) 123—is a conserved neural enhancer that promotes neural progenitor cell (NPC) formation. While present in all mammals, HAR123 has rapidly evolved since humans diverged from chimpanzees. The human and chimpanzee HAR123 orthologs exhibit subtle differences in their neural developmental effects, and the human HAR123 ortholog uniquely regulates many genes involved in neural differentiation. We identified direct targets of the HAR123 enhancer and showed that HIC1 acts downstream of HAR123 to promote human NPC formation. HAR123-knockout mice exhibit a defect in cognitive flexibility and a shift in neural-glia ratio in specific regions of the hippocampus. Our study has implications for neurodevelopmental disorders, which are often accompanied by altered neural-glia ratio and have been linked with HARs.",

Although there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle—particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating κ ‐ ( ET ) 2 Cu 2 ( CN ) 3 —a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.",
