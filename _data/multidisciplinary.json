          "title": "Integrated lithium niobate photonics for sub-ångström snapshot spectroscopy",
          "authors": "Zhiyang Yao, Shuyang Liu, Yingce Wang, Xiaoyun Yuan, Lu Fang",
          "abstract": "Spectroscopy is a pivotal tool for determining the physical structures and chemical compositions of materials and environments, and it is commonly used across diverse scientific fields1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. Conventionally, spectroscopic techniques rely on narrow slits or gratings, which impose a trade-off between spectral resolution and optical transmittance17,18,19,20,21,22, thus precluding measurements with simultaneous high sensitivity and high efficiency. Here we introduce RAFAEL, a sub-ångström ultra-high-transmittance snapshot spectroscopic technique, which targets this trade-off with integrated and reconfigurable photonics based on lithium niobate. Its design comprises bulk lithium niobate as an interference mask with a pixel-wise electrically tunable spectral response and delivers picometre-scale modulation with a high optical transmittance. Our approach achieves 88-Hz snapshot spectroscopy with a spectral resolution of approximately 0.5 Å at 400–1,000 nm (R = 12,000), spatial resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 and 73.2% total optical transmittance. Compared with state-of-the-art spectroscopic imagers23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34, RAFAEL offers double the total transmittance and a nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in spectral resolving power, as verified by extensive experiments. In particular, RAFAEL captured sub-ångström spectra, including all atomic absorption peaks, of up to 5,600 stars in a single snapshot, indicating ×100–10,000 improvement in observational efficiency compared with world-class astronomical spectrometers17,18,19,20,21. This high-performing yet easily integrated snapshot spectroscopic method could drive advances in fields ranging from material science to astrophysics.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale metagenomic and data-mining efforts have revealed an expansive diversity of bacteriophages (phages) within the human gut 1–3 . However, functional understanding of phage–host interactions within this complex environment is limited, largely due to a lack of cultured isolates available for experimental validation. Here we characterize 134 inducible prophages originating from 252 human gut bacterial isolates using 10 different induction conditions to expand the experimentally validated temperate phage–host pairs originating from the human gut. Importantly, only 18% of computationally predicted prophages could be induced in pure cultures. Moreover, we construct a 78-member synthetic microbiome that, when co-cultured in the presence of human colonic cells (Caco2), led to the induction of 35% phage species. Using cultured isolates, we demonstrate that human host-associated cellular products may act as induction agents, providing a possible link between gastrointestinal cell lysis and temperate phage populations 4,5 . We provide key insights into prophage diversity and genetics, including a genetic pathway for domestication, finding that polylysogeny was common and resulted in coordinated prophage induction, and that differential induction can be influenced by divergent prophage integration sites. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of culture-based techniques, alongside experimental validation, genomics and computational prediction, to understand the biology and function of temperate phages in the human gut microbiome. These culture-based approaches will enable applications across synthetic biology, biotechnology and microbiome fields.",

          "abstract": "Compartmentalization of eukaryotic genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin is of critical biological significance1,2,3. Previous studies have suggested a self-templating pathway involving the reading and writing of histone H3 lysine 9 methylation by SUV39H as the core mechanism for heterochromatin reassembly during cell division1,3. In fission yeast, the mammalian SUV39H homologue Clr4 forms a complex containing ubiquitin ligase Cul4, which catalyses H3K14 mono-ubiquitination (H3K14ub) to promote heterochromatin formation. However, whether heterochromatin reassembly in dividing mammalian cells involves a similar pathway is unknown. Here we identified G2E3 as an H3K14ub-specific, pericentromeric heterochromatin-localized E3 ligase. G2E3-catalysed H3K14ub potentiates histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by SUV39H and is specifically required for SUV39H compartmentalization and H3K9me3 in pericentromeric heterochromatin. Mechanistically, we found that G2E3 is highly expressed in G2/M phase and associates with mitotic chromosomes in an RNA-dependent manner to catalyse H3K14ub, which is essential for the subsequent sequential recruitment of SUV39H and HP1. The SUV39H chromodomain is a reader of dual H3K9me3 and H3K14ub modifications and SUV39H associates with pericentromeric heterochromatin primarily through its H3K14ub-binding activity. Notably, loss of G2E3 severely impairs pericentromeric heterochromatin organization and results in the aberrant accumulation of SUV39H and H3K9me3 in numerous euchromatin regions and widespread transcriptional repression. Thus, our findings revealed the H3K14ub-dependent SUV39H compartmentalization as a unified mechanism of pericentromeric heterochromatin formation, which is essential for proper euchromatin compartmentalization and transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have emerged as a promising non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to lead-based devices1-3, with certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of inverted architectures now exceeding 16%4-8. Despite an ideal bandgap supporting a theoretical PCE over 33%, TPSCs still lag in performance and stability, partly due to suboptimal hole transport layers and poor buried interface that hinder hole extraction. Here, we report (E)-(2-(4',5'-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-[2,2'-bithiophen]-5-yl)-1-cyanovinyl)phosphonic acid at the buried interface, using a molecular film to optimize hole transport layers in inverted TPSCs. This molecular film forms a homogeneous interfacial layer with well-matched energy level alignment, significantly enhancing hole extraction. Moreover, this approach creates a superwetting underlayer that guides the growth of uniform, high-quality Sn-based perovskite films with reduced defect density and minimized non-radiative recombination losses. The resulting inverted small-area TPSCs demonstrate a record PCE of 17.89% (certified 17.71% under reverse scanning mode). Furthermore, the encapsulated device maintains over 95% of the initial PCE after 1344 h of ambient shelf storage and over 94% after 1550 h of continuous operation under 1-sun illumination. Notably, we achieve a record PCE of 14.40% for 1 cm2 TPSCs, highlighting the scalability of our strategy.",

          "abstract": "Predicting complex disease risks on the basis of individual genomic profiles is an advancing field in human genetics1,2. However, most genetic studies have focused on populations of European ancestry, creating a global imbalance in precision medicine and underscoring the need for genomic research in non-European groups3,4. The Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative recruited more than half a million Taiwanese residents, providing a large dataset of genetic profiles and electronic medical record data for people with Han Chinese ancestry. Using extensive phenotypic data, we conducted comprehensive genomic analyses across the medical phenome with individuals genetically similar to Han Chinese reference populations. These analyses identified population-specific genetic risk variants and new findings for various complex traits. We developed polygenic risk scores, demonstrating strong predictive performance for conditions such as cardiometabolic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers and infectious diseases. We observed consistent findings in an independent dataset, Taiwan Biobank, and among people of East Asian ancestry in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Project. The identified genetic risks accounted for up to 10.3% of the overall health variation in the Taiwan Precision Medicine Initiative cohort. Our approach of characterizing the phenome-wide genomic landscape, developing population-specific risk-prediction models, assessing their performance and identifying the genetic effect on health serves as a model for similar studies in other diverse study populations.",

          "abstract": "Amines are among the most common functional groups in bioactive molecules and pharmaceuticals,1-3 yet they are almost universally treated as synthetic endpoints.4 Here we report a strategy that repositions native primary, secondary, and tertiary amines as handles for cross-coupling. The platform relies on in situ activation via borane coordination and exploits a copper catalytic redox system that generates amine-ligated boryl radicals, which undergo β-scission across the C(sp³)–N bond to release alkyl radicals. These intermediates engage in copper-catalyzed cross-couplings with a broad array of C-, N-, O-, and S-based nucleophiles. The method tolerates diverse amine classes, enables modular functionalization, and supports late-stage editing of complex drug scaffolds. In addition, amides can be incorporated into the manifold via reductive funneling. This work establishes a general approach to deaminative C–N bond functionalization and introduces a distinct approach for making and modifying druglike molecules.",

Despite major advances5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19, no species has yet been characterized with a truly comprehensive atlas of genetic variation. Here we present an extensive genomic and phenotypic resource for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on near telomere-to-telomere assemblies of 1,086 natural isolates. Leveraging these high-contiguity assemblies, we generated a highly complete species-wide structural variant atlas, gene-based pangenome and graph pangenome. By incorporating the full spectrum of genetic variation captured across the species, we conducted genome-wide association studies across 8,391 molecular and organismal traits19,20,21,22. The inclusion of structural variants and small insertion–deletion mutations improved heritability estimates by an average of 14.3% compared with analyses based only on single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Structural variants were more frequently associated with traits and exhibited greater pleiotropy than other variant types. Notably, the genetic architecture of molecular and organismal traits differed markedly. Together, this work provides a unique dataset that illuminates how diverse forms of genetic variation shape phenotypic diversity and lays the groundwork for integrative, genome-scale studies in other eukaryotic systems.",

Although a lot of quantum algorithms 2–4 have been developed for simulating quantum dynamics, a general-purpose method for simulating low-temperature quantum phenomena remains unknown. In classical settings, the analogous task of sampling from thermal distributions has been largely addressed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 5,6 . Here we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for thermal simulation that—akin to MCMC methods—exhibits detailed balance, respects locality and serves as a toy model for thermalization in open quantum systems. The enduring impact of MCMC methods suggests that our new construction may play an equally important part in quantum computing and applications in the physical sciences and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forests act as important global carbon sinks1, and Earth System Models predict increasing near-term carbon sink capacity for these forests, with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration thought to stimulate tree growth2,3. However, current forest inventory data analyses suggest that the carbon sink capacity of intact tropical forests may be in decline, portending a possible future switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources3,4,5,6,7. Here we use long-term forest inventory data (1971–2019) from Australian moist tropical forests and a causal inference framework8,9,10 to assess the carbon balance of woody aboveground standing biomass over time, the demographic processes accounting for it, and its climatic drivers, including cyclones. We find that a transition from sink (0.62 ± 0.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 1971–2000) to source (−0.93 ± 0.11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1: 2010–2019) has occurred for the aboveground woody biomass of these forests, with sink capacity declining at a rate of 0.041 ± 0.032 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. The transition was driven by increasingly extreme temperature and other climate anomalies, which have increased tree mortality and associated biomass losses4, with no evidence of the carbon fertilization (stimulation) of woody tree growth. Forest dynamics underlying carbon sink capacity were also punctuated by cyclones, with impacts of a similar magnitude to long-term climate-induced changes. Our findings suggest the potential for a similar response to climate change by woody aboveground biomass in moist tropical forests globally, which could culminate in a long-term switch from carbon sinks to carbon sources.",

          "abstract": "Water is essential for almost every aspect of life on our planet and, unsurprisingly, its properties have been studied in great detail 1 . However, disproportionately little remains known about the electrical properties of interfacial and strongly confined water 2,3 , in which the structure deviates from that of bulk water, becoming distinctly layered 4,5 . The structural change is expected to affect the conductivity of water and particularly its polarizability, which in turn modifies intermolecular forces that play a crucial role in many physical and chemical processes 6–9 . Here we use scanning dielectric microscopy (SDM) 10 to probe the in-plane electrical properties of water confined between atomically flat surfaces separated by distances down to 1 nm. For confinement exceeding several nanometres, water exhibits an in-plane dielectric constant close to that of bulk water and its proton conductivity is notably enhanced, gradually increasing with decreasing water thickness. This trend abruptly changes when the confined water becomes only a few molecules thick. Its in-plane dielectric constant reaches large, ferroelectric-like values of about 1,000, whereas the conductivity peaks at several S m −1 , close to values characteristic of superionic liquids. We attribute the enhancement to strongly disordered hydrogen bonding induced by the few-layer confinement, which facilitates both easier in-plane polarization of molecular dipoles and faster proton exchange. This insight into the electrical properties of nanoconfined water is important for understanding many phenomena that occur at aqueous interfaces and in nanoscale pores.",

The mechanism for stabilizing memories of survival-critical experiences, which are often emotionally salient and repeated, remains unclear 4 .

Using a novel brain-wide Fos tagging and imaging method, we found that astrocytic Fos ensembles were preferentially recruited in regions with neuronal engrams 5 and were more widespread during fear recall than during conditioning. We established the induction mechanism of the astrocytic ensemble, which involves two steps: (1) an initial fear experience that induces day-long, slow astrocytic state changes with noradrenaline receptor upregulation; and (2) enhanced noradrenaline responses during recall, a repeated experience, enabling astrocytes to integrate coincident signals from local engrams and long-range noradrenergic projections, which induce secondary astrocytic state changes, including the upregulation of Fos and the neuromodulatory molecule IGFBP2. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of the astrocytic ensemble signalling modulate engrams, and memory stability and precision. The astrocytic ensemble thus acts as a multiday trace in a subset of astrocytes after experience-dependent neural activity, which are eligible to capture future repeated experiences for stabilizing memories.",

          "abstract": "All mammalian organs depend on resident macrophage populations to coordinate repair and facilitate tissue-specific functions 1–3 . Functionally distinct macrophage populations reside in discrete tissue niches and are replenished through a combination of local proliferation and monocyte recruitment 4,5 . Declines in macrophage abundance and function have been linked to age-associated pathologies, including atherosclerosis, cancer and neurodegeneration 6–8 . However, the mechanisms that coordinate macrophage organization and replenishment within ageing tissues remain largely unclear. Here we show that capillary-associated macrophages (CAMs) are selectively lost over time, contributing to impaired vascular repair and reduced tissue perfusion in older mice. To investigate resident macrophage behaviour in vivo, we used intravital two-photon microscopy in live mice to non-invasively image the skin capillary plexus, a spatially well-defined vascular niche that undergoes rarefication and functional decline with age. We find that CAMs are lost at a rate exceeding capillary loss, resulting in macrophage-deficient vascular niches in both mice and humans. CAM phagocytic activity was locally required to repair obstructed capillary blood flow, leaving macrophage-deficient niches selectively vulnerable under homeostatic and injury conditions. Our study demonstrates that homeostatic renewal of resident macrophages is less precisely regulated than previously suggested 9–11 . Specifically, neighbouring macrophages do not proliferate or reorganize to compensate for macrophage loss without injury or increased growth factors, such as colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). These limitations in macrophage renewal may represent early and targetable contributors to tissue ageing.",

Although the Carnian sedimentary rocks of South America provided much of the available evidence for understanding the early evolution of these clades, key discoveries have remained restricted to the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión6,7 and Paraná basins8 in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Here we report a Carnian tetrapod assemblage from the previously unrecognized Northern Precordillera Basin in northwestern Argentina. Discoveries at this basin, in the Quebrada Santo Domingo site, include a nearly complete skeleton of the early sauropodomorph Huayracursor jaguensis gen. et sp. nov., and typical components of Late Carnian faunas, such as hyperodapedontine rhynchosaurs, gomphodontosuchine traversodontid cynodonts, and aetosaurs. Compared to its generally small and short-necked Carnian counterparts9,10, Huayracursor is larger and exhibits an incipient elongation of its cervical vertebrae, representing an intermediate condition for size and cervical elongation between known Carnian and Norian sauropodomorphs11. This discovery provides one of the oldest pieces of evidence of increased body mass and neck elongation in early Sauropodomorpha.",

          "abstract": "Most stony corals are obligate symbionts that are dependent on nutrients provided by the photosynthetic activity of dinoflagellates residing within specialized cells1. Disruption of this symbiotic consortium leads to coral bleaching and, ultimately, mortality2. However, a few coral species exhibit facultative symbiosis, allowing them to survive extended periods of bleaching3,4. Despite this resilience, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the genomic and cellular basis of facultative symbiosis in Oculina patagonica, a thermotolerant Mediterranean coral5,6. We sequenced and annotated a chromosome-scale genome of O. patagonica and built cell atlases for this species and two obligate symbiotic corals. Comparative genomic analysis revealed karyotypic and syntenic conservation across all scleractinians, with species-specific gene expansions primarily driven by tandem duplications. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of symbiotic and naturally aposymbiotic wild specimens identified an increase in phagocytic immune cells and a metabolic shift in gastrodermal gene expression from growth-related functions to quiescent, epithelial-like states. Cross-species comparison of host cells uncovered Oculina-specific metabolic and signalling adaptations indicative of an opportunistic, dual-feeding strategy that decouples survival from symbiotic state.",

          "abstract": "Stencilling, in which patterns are created by painting over masks, has ubiquitous applications in art, architecture and manufacturing. Modern, top-down microfabrication methods have succeeded in reducing mask sizes to under 10 nm (refs. 1,2 ), enabling ever smaller microdevices as today’s fastest computer chips. Meanwhile, bottom-up masking using chemical bonds or physical interactions has remained largely unexplored, despite its advantages of low cost, solution-processability, scalability and high compatibility with complex, curved and three-dimensional (3D) surfaces 3,4 . Here we report atomic stencilling to make patchy nanoparticles (NPs), using surface-adsorbed iodide submonolayers to create the mask and ligand-mediated grafted polymers onto unmasked regions as ‘paint’. We use this approach to synthesize more than 20 different types of NP coated with polymer patches in high yield. Polymer scaling theory and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation show that stencilling, along with the interplay of enthalpic and entropic effects of polymers, generates patchy particle morphologies not reported previously. These polymer-patched NPs self-assemble into extended crystals owing to highly uniform patches, including different non-closely packed superlattices. We propose that atomic stencilling opens new avenues in patterning NPs and other substrates at the nanometre length scale, leading to precise control of their chemistry, reactivity and interactions for a wide range of applications, such as targeted delivery, catalysis, microelectronics, integrated metamaterials and tissue engineering 5–11 .",

          "abstract": "The properties of mammalian cells depend on their location within organs. Gene expression in the liver varies between periportal and pericentral hepatocytes1,2,3, and in the intestine from crypts to villus tips4,5. A key element of tissue spatial organization is probably metabolic, but direct assessments of spatial metabolism remain limited. Here we map spatial metabolic gradients in the mouse liver and intestine. We develop an integrated experimental–computational workflow using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), isotope tracing and deep-learning artificial intelligence. Most measured metabolites (>90%) showed significant spatial concentration gradients in the liver lobules and intestinal villi. In the liver, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle metabolites and their isotope labelling from both glutamine and lactate localized periportally. Energy-stress metabolites, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP), also localized periportally, consistent with a high periportal energy demand. In the intestine, the TCA intermediates malate (tip) and citrate (crypt) showed opposite spatial patterns, aligning with higher glutamine catabolism in tips and lactate oxidation in crypts based on isotope tracing. Finally, we mapped the fate of the obesogenic dietary sugar fructose. In the intestine, oral fructose was catabolized faster in the villus bottom than in the tips. In the liver, fructose-derived carbon accumulated pericentrally as fructose-1-phosphate and triggered pericentral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Thus, we both provide foundational knowledge regarding intestine and liver metabolic organization and identify fructose-induced focal derangements in liver metabolism.",

Of note, four-membered saturated cyclic molecules such as azetidines, thietanes and cyclobutanes have garnered increasing attention in medicinal chemistry3-7. These molecules often possess physicochemical properties relevant to drug discovery: potency, stability, metabolic stability and target specificity3. The replacement of oxygen atoms in readily available oxetanes would offer a direct route to a variety of these cyclic pharmacophores, yet such atom swapping has been rarely reported for non-aromatic molecules. Here we report a general photocatalytic strategy that selectively substitutes the oxygen atom of an oxetane with a nitrogen-, sulfur- or carbon-based moiety, transforming it into a diverse range of saturated cyclic building blocks in a single operation. This atom swapping method exhibits high functional group compatibility and is applicable to late-stage functionalization, substantially simplifying the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex drug analogues that would otherwise require multi-step routes. Mechanistic investigations unveil insights on the origin of chemoselectivity that allows the endocyclic oxygen atom to react preferentially to generate an acyclic dihalide intermediate, which then undergoes efficient ring reconstruction in the presence of a nucleophilic species.",

          "abstract": "Parity and breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,2, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying this protection remain unclear. Here, we show that parity induces an accumulation of CD8+ T cells, including cells with a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype within human normal breast tissue. In murine models, pregnancy followed by lactation and involution drove the accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells in the mammary gland, coinciding with reduced tumour growth and increased intratumoural immune cell infiltration, effects that were abrogated by CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Importantly, this CD8+ T cell dependent tumour control was only observed following a complete cycle of lactation and involution. Consistent with this, primary TNBCs from parous women exhibited greater T cell infiltration and improved clinical outcomes. Together these findings, spanning preclinical models and over 1000 patient samples, provide new insight into how reproductive history shapes breast immunity, positioning CD8⁺ T cells as key mediators of parity-associated protection and informing novel strategies for both prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",

Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) was positive in 26/31 patients at baseline, and clearance was observed in 5/6 responders prior to surgery, while 19/20 non-responders remained ctDNA+. Responses were observed despite a low tumour mutational burden in all tumours, while chromosomal genomic instability scores were significantly higher in responders compared to non-responders. Furthermore, responding tumours had significantly higher baseline expression of proliferation signatures and TCF1, and imaging mass cytometry revealed a higher percentage of Ki-67+ cancer and Ki-67+ CD8+ T cells in responders compared to non-responders.

Catalytic systems have been developed for selective oxidation of methylenes in the presence aromatics4 and N-heterocycles5, however olefins remain an unsolved problem. Here we show that replacing the carboxylic acid with a H-bond donor solvent in sterically hindered manganese PDP catalysts changes the active oxidant to one that accelerates electron rich methylene oxidation and significantly slows epoxidation of electron deficient olefins (kC-H[O]/kepox = 38.5). Chemoselective methylene oxidation is demonstrated in forty-five molecules housing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality where all previous methods afforded allylic oxidation or epoxidation. Mechanistic studies support that the new oxidant proceeds via a more charged pathway that disfavors electron deficient bonds, demonstrating that highly reactive metal oxidants can be tuned to achieve chemoselectivity.

Here we reveal poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 5 to actively import easily synthesizable isopeptide-linked tripeptides that are processed into ncAAs within the cell. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of a variety of previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal 6 and crosslinker 7 moieties, post-translational modifications 8,9 and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. We then devise a high-throughput directed evolution platform to engineer tailored transporter systems for the import of ncAAs that were historically refractory to efficient uptake. Customized Escherichia coli strains expressing these evolved transporters facilitate single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild-type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide scaffolds for the co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation.

Moreover, the hand morphology of KNM-ER 101000 converges on that of gorillas in ways that are consistent with manual food processing and would have facilitated powerful grasping, such as that used in climbing. These fossils suggest that P. boisei was capable of tool making and use in some capacity while also supporting the proposed dichotomy of distinct dietary adaptations between Paranthropus and Homo.

          "abstract": "Quantifying physical mechanisms driving sea-level change—including global mean sea level (GMSL) and regional-to-local components (that is, sea-level budget)—is essential for reliable future projections and effective coastal management 1,2 . Although previous research has attempted to resolve China’s sea-level budget from the 1950s 3,4 , these studies capture short timescales and lack the long-term context necessary to fully assess modern sea-level rise in southeastern China 5 —one of the world’s most densely populated regions with immense socioeconomic importance 6 . Here we show that GMSL followed three distinct stages from 11,700 years before present (BP) to the modern day: (1) rapid early Holocene rise driven by the deglacial melt of land ice; (2) 4,000 years of stability from around 4200 BP to the mid-nineteenth century when regional processes dominated sea-level change; and (3) accelerating rise from the mid-nineteenth century. Our results arise from spatiotemporal hierarchical modelling of geological sea-level proxies and tide gauge data to produce site-specific sea-level budget estimates with uncertainty quantification. It is extremely likely ( P ≥ 0.95) that the GMSL rise rate since 1900 (1.51 ± 0.16 mm year −1 , 1 σ ) has exceeded any century over at least the past four millennia. Moreover, our analysis indicates that at least 94% of rapid modern urban subsidence is attributable to anthropogenic activities, with localized subsidence rates often exceeding GMSL rise. Such concurrent acceleration of global sea-level rise and rapid localized subsidence has not been observed in our Holocene geological record.",

Müller/A. de Graaff (CC-BY-4.0)\n\nWhen the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) looked back in time to observe the Universe’s earliest moments, it presented astronomers with something most peculiar: hundreds of ‘little red dots’ that inexplicably freckled the ancient cosmos.\n\nThe specks, named for their compact size in JWST images and their emission of long, ‘red’ wavelengths of light, initially baffled astronomers. They seemed too condensed to be galaxies, yet didn’t emit the right kind of light to be black holes. Researchers quickly dubbed the dots, which JWST first detected in 2022, Universe breakers, because they contradicted standard thinking about the features of the early Universe.\n\nOver the past few months, researchers have begun to settle on the identity of these dots, and it’s one that seldom emerges in astronomy: a brand-new type of celestial object. “It’s extremely rare that you get to work on a truly new physical phenomenon like this,” says Anna de Graaff, an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany. “It’s almost a shame that we’re starting to figure them out.”\n\nCould JWST solve cosmology’s big mystery? Physicists debate Universe-expansion data\n\nMany scientists now think that little red dots (LRDs) are a hybrid between a black hole and a star: an active black hole wrapped in a cocoon of hot, dense gas — much like the atmosphere of a star — that glows as the black hole warms it. A more conventional black hole, by contrast, doesn’t shine in the same way.\n\nEven as astronomers decide on a front-runner theory on the nature of these mysterious dots, often called rubies, they are left with more questions: did LRDs exist only in the most ancient Universe, or are they also present in more modern stretches of the cosmos? How do they evolve over time? And how do they form in the first place?\n\nJust three years after JWST’s first observations of these dots, some 200 manuscripts investigating LRDs have been posted to the arXiv preprint server (some of these manuscripts have not yet been peer reviewed). Here, Nature rounds up a few of the bright specks of research — all described in the past three months — that are illuminating this tantalizing new class of object.\n\nA remarkable ruby\n\nPerhaps the most pivotal LRD is an object called the Cliff, which makes the strongest case yet for the black-hole-star model. This object got its name because of the sharp break in the spectrum of light it emits: in a graph that shows the wavelengths of light radiated by the object at one point in time, its emissions are almost zero for ultraviolet light just outside the visible spectrum but they spike suddenly for slightly less energetic wavelengths of light.\n\nGiant black hole is one of the earliest ever seen — with clues for how these weird objects form\n\n“The sharp transition is not something normal galaxies can make,” says de Graaff, a co-author of a paper1 describing the results that was published last month in Astronomy and Astrophysics. “And black holes in the nearby Universe also don’t look like that. So this was the first object that could rule out a huge array of models.” The authors of the paper accordingly refer to the Cliff as a “remarkable ruby”.\n\nAnalysis of the spikes of light indicates that the object must be extremely energetic — like a black hole — but must also be encased in warm, dense gas similar to the atmosphere of a star. The team’s explanation of the object matched well with a model described2 earlier this year of a black hole swaddled in gas, and thus, the black hole star was born.\n\nGalactic pack\n\nIn addition to solidifying what LRDs are, astronomers are curious as to how they evolve. Some think such rubies could become the centres of galaxies.\n\nAs they reported in Nature Astronomy3 last month, one team of researchers is beginning to zero in on a potential answer. The LRD starring in their paper was surrounded by eight nearby galaxies and embedded in an especially large blob of dark matter, the invisible entity that binds groups of galaxies together, says study co-author Jan-Torge Schindler, an astronomer at the University of Hamburg in Germany. Such a large dark-matter halo usually hosts quasars, extremely bright cores at the centres of some galaxies.",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "Nature’s 2025 PhD survey\n\nThis article is the third in a short series discussing the results of Nature’s 2025 PhD survey. The next article will focus on international students. The survey, created in partnership with Thinks Insight & Strategy, a research consultancy based in London, launched in June and was advertised on nature.com, in Springer Nature digital products and through e-mail campaigns. It had 3,785 self-selecting respondents across 107 countries, with 44% describing themselves as female, 25% as belonging to an ethnic minority in their country of study and 33% as studying outside their country of origin. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/4ncsuo1.\n\nThe past few years have been tough on Camila Pinto, who earned her PhD at the Federal University of Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, in March. During her degree, she lost both her parents and had burnout and depression. Yet, her overall PhD experience was positive.\n\n“We say in my lab that ‘life happens during a PhD’, and many personal dramas unfold,” says Pinto, a materials scientist who has now embarked on a postdoc and holds a salaried teaching position at Brazil’s Federal Institute of Amazonas in Presidente Figueiredo, a small town in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. “What helped me keep going was the personal support of my supervisor, the solidarity of our national scientific community and the belief that my research serves a greater good.”\n\nPinto’s positive outlook might be a national characteristic. When Nature surveyed more than 3,700 doctoral candidates around the world earlier this year, Brazil stood out: 83% of respondents studying there reported being at least moderately satisfied with their PhD programme. It is the only country scoring significantly higher than the global average of 75%. Students in Brazil were also the most upbeat about their experience, with 80% saying that they enjoyed their degrees and 78% feeling fulfilled by their work, compared with global averages of 70% and 72%, respectively.\n\nThe global PhD landscape 2025\n\nThe only country that comes close to Brazil is Australia, which matches it on enjoyment and fulfilment, and scores just one point lower on satisfaction. Students in Australia and Brazil are also the most likely to say that their PhD experience matched their expectations, with 68% in Australia agreeing with this statement (including 29% who strongly agree) and 65% in Brazil (27% strongly agree).\n\nDoes that mean that these nations have the happiest PhD students in the world? In reality, the picture is more complex than that.\n\nBefore interrogating the survey data further, it’s important to set out some caveats. The self-selecting character of Nature’s PhD survey means that some countries are represented better than others. We received very few responses from some of the 107 nations. Eight had more than 100 participants, which makes comparisons between them robust: Australia (101 respondents), Brazil (113), China (312), Germany (247), India (430), Italy (111), the United Kingdom (201) and the United States (568). Another ten had between 50 and 100 respondents (Canada, Ethiopia, France, Iran, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Switzerland) and were also included in this analysis. The remaining nations had too few participants to study individually (see ‘Nordic niceness’). Caution is therefore needed when comparing country-level results, says Elsie Lauchlan, quantitative director of London-based research consultancy Thinks Insight & Strategy, which ran the survey with Nature. And further complications arise from the fact that people based in various countries or regions tend to answer questions about satisfaction and well-being differently — an effect known as cultural response bias.\n\nNordic niceness\n\nThe Nordic countries — Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland — routinely score near the top of global happiness surveys. However, individually, they had too few responses to Nature’s survey to be included in our satisfaction analysis. Combined, however, they had a similar number to other nations in this article. Their 97 respondents reported an impressive 85% satisfaction rate — higher even than Brazil’s.\n\nElham Badalzadehe Aghdam, an Iranian PhD candidate studying forest health at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden, says that these figures reflect her experience. “One reason PhD satisfaction is high in the Nordic countries is the structure and culture of doctoral studies here,” she explains. PhD candidates are treated as employees rather than as students, with a salary, social-security benefits and a good work–life balance, making the position feel more stable and professional than it does elsewhere. A collaborative, non-hierarchical academic culture also helps, she says.\n\nBrazil’s survey data offer no clear reason for why the country has the highest satisfaction score. Its respondents are significantly less likely than the global average to have concerns about a lack of mentoring (15% compared with 26%) and more likely to be satisfied with the intellectual challenge (92% compared with 81%). They also express a slightly higher-than-average satisfaction with their pay, supervisor relationship, research guidance and independence — although not significantly so. Meanwhile, they are less likely than average to be satisfied with their work–life balance and travel opportunities, and more likely to say that their university has a culture of long working hours. Indeed, when it comes to many of the individual measures, Brazil is outscored by the United Kingdom, which had an overall satisfaction score of 76% — close to the global average (see ‘PhD student satisfaction across five countries’).\n\nWorldwide, the survey identifies three measures that correlate with satisfaction. PhD students who spend at least one hour a week with their supervisors are significantly happier than average, as are those who are less than two years into their degree. Spending more than 60 hours a week on their PhD correlates inversely with satisfaction. Financial concerns, despite being high in most surveyed countries, don’t correlate with satisfaction levels in an obvious manner. In Germany, where some of the fewest students responded having financial concerns (27%), overall satisfaction is below average at 70%. So what’s really going on?\n\nSandra Dias, a cancer researcher at the Brazilian Center for Research in Energy and Materials in Campinas, thinks that her country’s cultural emphasis on community could play a part, as could its social support structures. “Universal health care, subsidized public transport and, for many, proximity to extended family reduce financial and emotional stress,” she says. A mild climate that enables outdoor activities year-round also helps, she adds.\n\nEngineering PhD student Izadora Menezes disagrees that Brazil’s students are the happiest, not least because of financial concerns resulting from stagnating stipends and research budget cuts.Credit: Izadora Rhaynna Santos de Menezes\n\nHowever, Izadora Menezes, who studies engineering at Brazil’s Federal University of São Carlos, disagrees with the idea that the nation’s PhD students are the happiest in the world. “Although I am satisfied with my personal experience with my PhD, I don’t think it reflects the reality in Brazil,” she says. Money is a key issue, she notes. Under then president Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government from 2019 to 2023, scholarships stagnated and funding for science was slashed. Although Menezes’s scholarship from the São Paulo Research Foundation FAPESP is relatively generous, PhD stipends in the country can be as low as 3,100 reais a month, she notes. Although that is equivalent to a monthly allowance of US$1,250 in the United States, it is “usually insufficient for a comfortable life”, says Menezes. (Stipend values have been adjusted throughout to US dollars using a measure of purchasing power parity.)\n\nPinto thinks that the country’s high satisfaction rate might stem at least in part from relief that Bolsonaro’s presidency, which she calls a “dark chapter” for research, is over. “We are still struggling to rebuild much of what was lost, but for the first time in a long while, there’s a renewed sense of optimism,” she says. “That hopefulness is part of our DNA.”\n\nSouthern satisfaction\n\nLike Brazil, Australia’s high satisfaction score is not immediately explained by Nature’s data. The country’s 101 respondents rate their satisfaction above average on most measures — for example, 58% of Australia-based PhD students feel satisfied with their work–life balance compared with 51% globally. But only the questions about tailored mental-health support and travel opportunities scored significantly higher than the global average.\n\nLifestyle factors, including outdoor culture and relatively safe living conditions, also add to improved well-being, says Eddie Attenborough, who studies food, bioprocesses and polymer science at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “When you’re happier outside of the lab, you’re more likely to feel fulfilled inside it,” he adds. Jesse Gardner-Russell, an ophthalmology PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne and national president of the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations (CAPA), thinks that the country’s social safety nets are important, including free or subsidized health care for most PhD students, a diverse university culture in which international students feel welcome and a good work–life balance. “I think that all of this fits together to create satisfaction.”\n\nEddie Attenborough says that outdoor lifestyles improve students’ satisfaction in Australia.\n\nThe high proportion of international PhD students in Australia’s sample (63%) could also influence its satisfaction score. Globally, students doing a PhD abroad report significantly higher satisfaction than do those studying at home (78% compared with 74%).\n\nLife in Australia is, however, expensive. Although the proportion of students reporting financial concerns (47%) is only slightly above the global average (42%), cost of living is consistently the top worry in CAPA’s surveys, Gardner-Russell says. A typical PhD stipend of Aus$33,500 a year (US$24,300) is below Australia’s minimum wage of around Aus$49,000. Moreover, unlike salaried jobs, stipends do not contribute to a pension plan, placing doctoral students at a disadvantage compared with their non-academic peers, he explains. “This can make PhD students feel very undervalued.”\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\nWhereas Australia and Brazil scored high across the board, Italy offers a more nuanced picture. Overall, the country scores on a par with Australia: 82% of its 111 respondents say that they are at least moderately satisfied with their PhDs. But when asked whether they enjoy their degrees and feel fulfilled by the work, students in Italy score significantly lower than in the other two nations, with only 68% agreeing on both measures. They are also significantly less satisfied than average about pay, independence and work–life balance and have more concerns about their mental health.\n\nMaria Roberta Belardo, who studies mathematical and physical sciences at the Scuola Superiore Meridionale in Naples, Italy, says that the country’s results reflect its complex academic landscape. Italian universities provide quality education, she says, but the pay is low — the average monthly stipend is €1,200 (US$1,960) after deductions — and the research community is small by European standards. Belardo says that many of the country’s PhD students are sustained mainly by their passion for their research topic. “In other words, Italian PhDs may feel proud of the degree they earn, while at the same time finding the experience itself less enjoyable and the professional outlook less secure, which, in my opinion, explains the mixed results of the survey.”\n\nADI, the Association of PhD Students and Postdocs in Italy, says that its 2024 survey, which received responses from some 7,000 PhD students in 2023, found that about half were at high risk of anxiety, depression and stress, caused mainly by economic insecurity, excessive workloads and uncertainty about the future. “In our opinion, if Italian PhD students declare themselves satisfied [in Nature’s survey], this satisfaction cannot be interpreted as an indication of idyllic living and working conditions. It could instead reflect a kind of ‘resilience’ or perhaps the prevalence of a ‘passion’ for research, which masks the daily difficulties,” says the ADI’s national secretary Davide Clementi, who is based in Palermo, Italy.",

          "authors": "Mariana Viglino",
          "abstract": "Imagine academia as a racetrack. Some scientists start further ahead than others; some run on clean tracks, others face mud or obstacles. Some can afford only heavy boots, instead of trainers. Some are told that they are not trying hard enough.\n\nEquity is more than a buzzword\n\nThese differing experiences represent the inequities that many researchers face in their careers. Scientists born and based in Latin America — and other historically colonized countries, often referred to as the global south — are familiar with many barriers, including limited funding; reading, writing and communicating their research in a language that isn’t their first; unstable economic and political landscapes; and systemic bias in favour of ideas, data, papers and people from the global north. They also face a high likelihood of encountering unequal partnerships and ‘parachute’ science — an extractive practice in which scientists from high-income countries use data from a lower-income community without involving them in the project.\n\nSome effects of these inequities are well documented. In my field of aquatic-mammal palaeontology, my colleagues and I have found that having a large proportion of Latin American authors on a paper negatively affects the number of citations it receives (A. M. Valenzuela-Toro et al. Commun. Biol. 8, 472; 2025). But publications are key to funding, professional assessments, promotions and international networking. They can prompt invitations to conferences and consideration for awards.\n\nAs a scientist and a woman born, educated and based in Latin America, I propose some steps that editors and publishers — the gatekeepers of publications, who are often scientists from the global north and haven’t experienced some of these barriers — can take to level the playing field.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nMake it easier to submit papers. Routinely ask authors what hurdles they faced, and improve systems. Offer guidance on the editorial and peer-review processes. Should authors first pitch to editors, or submit directly? When, and how, should they respond to reviewers’ concerns or appeal a decision? Often, tips for navigating these processes are shared in networks that Latin American researchers are not part of. And lower the language barrier: Spanish and Portuguese versions of submission systems would make them easier for many scientists to use. On publication, journals should offer free copyediting to expand articles’ reach. Artificial-intelligence tools can help — but they should be embraced only with clear guidelines, extreme caution and ethical responsibility.\n\nPartner with Latin American scientific societies. They can help journals to identify scholars to invite onto editorial boards and as reviewers. Owing to the barriers they face, highly qualified Latin American candidates might not have built an international profile through publications or conference invitations — but they can be outstanding choices. Increased Latin American representation will also encourage more submissions.\n\nGo beyond diversity commitments: track progression (positive or otherwise). Data are key to trigger progress and to monitor it. The scientific community must see statistics. Journals must share the demographic information of editorial-board members, authors of submitted and published manuscripts and reviewers. This is not easy — the preferred route for collecting demographic statistics is through self-identification, and publishers have historically not compiled this information, so it will take time to build enough data to see trends. There is no time to waste.",

          "authors": "Beth Woods",
          "abstract": "Each year, more than nine million people in the United States do not take their medicines as prescribed owing to cost concerns. People there pay up to four times as much for new medicines as do individuals in other high-income countries.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced a deal with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on 30 September, aimed at improving the affordability of drugs for people in the country. This is the first concrete step under Trump’s ‘most-favoured nation’ policy, which intends to align US medicine prices to those in other wealthy countries. But it is unlikely to deliver the promised reductions in drug costs, and the knock-on effects could adversely affect public health globally.\n\nAs part of the deal, some of Pfizer’s drugs will be offered in the United States through a direct-to-consumer website, referred to as TrumpRx, that is expected to launch in 2026 — cutting out intermediaries and securing lower prices.\n\nYet this probably won’t benefit the 92% of people with health insurance, who would be better off receiving medicines through their plans. And those who can’t afford insurance probably won’t be able to pay for expensive drugs either. For example, even with the agreed discount, Pfizer’s anti-inflammatory drug tofacitinib (sold under the brand name Xeljanz) will cost about US$3,600 a month.\n\nClaims that the deal will lower prices paid by Medicaid — a government programme providing health insurance to people with limited incomes and resources — have also been met with scepticism, because there is no evidence that it will improve on existing discounts. And from a financial perspective, the deal is not expected to affect pharmaceutical companies substantially. Pfizer’s stock price rose by nearly 15% in the five trading days after the announcement.\n\nTrump’s wider aim is to stop the ‘global freeloading’ of other high-income countries that, he says, benefit from low prices while accessing innovative drugs, the development of which has been funded mainly by US consumers. He argues that lowering prices in the United States and raising them elsewhere would be fairer and preserve industry revenues to support investments in research and development (R&D). But other wealthy nations shouldn’t be expected to make up for any shortfall in US industry revenues.\n\nDirectly linking what the US population pays to prices in other high-income countries, as proposed by Trump’s policy, might not be effective. Given the importance of the US market to the drug industry, strategies exist to avoid prices in other nations influencing those in the United States — private non-transparent agreements between pharmaceutical companies and health systems, for example. Firms could also decide not to sell their products in some countries to protect US revenues.\n\nIt is too early to gauge how effective the Trump administration’s mix of diplomatic pressure and tariff threats will be in persuading other governments to accept higher drug prices. But if the United States is even partially successful, the increased medical bill for other wealthy nations could severely compromise their ability to fund broader health priorities, not just new drugs. And the idea that such higher prices would be fair is misplaced. In England, for example, the population is already paying too much for medicines despite relatively stringent price regulations.\n\nInstead, to reduce drug costs, the United States must develop its own mechanism for price regulation. It could, for example, use approaches that directly tie drug prices to rigorous value assessments, such as those undertaken by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent non-profit organization in Boston, Massachusetts. This would require the Trump administration to engage with the complexity of the US market, in which high costs reflect a complex web of intermediaries and legal barriers to price negotiation. For example, despite reforms, Medicare — the US health-insurance programme for people aged 65 years and older — is allowed to negotiate drug prices for only a limited number of expensive drugs.",

          "abstract": "The statue of Alan Turing at Bletchley Park, UK.Credit: Steve Meddle/Shutterstock\n\nToday’s best artificial intelligence (AI) models sail through the Turing test, a famous thought experiment that asks whether a computer can pass as a human by interacting via text.\n\nSome see an upgraded test as a necessary benchmark for progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI) — an ambiguous term used by many technology firms to mean an AI system with the resourcefulness to match any human cognitive ability. But at an event at London’s Royal Society on 2 October, several researchers said that the Turing test should be scrapped altogether, and that developers should instead focus on evaluating AI safety and building specific capabilities that could be of benefit to the public.\n\n“Let’s figure out the kind of AI we want, and test for those things instead,” said Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. In focusing on “this march towards AGI, I think we’re really limiting our imaginations about what kind of systems we might want — and, more importantly, what kinds of systems we really don’t want — in our society”.\n\nThe event was organized to mark the 75-year anniversary of the publication of British mathematician Alan Turing's seminal paper describing the test, which he called the imitation game. Addressing the philosophically gnarly question of whether machines can think1, the test involves a series of short, text-based conversations between a judge and either a human or a computer. To win, the machine must convince the judge that it is human.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nThe meeting’s low-hype approach to machine intelligence proved popular. At the oversubscribed event, speaker Gary Marcus was introduced by Peter Gabriel, the frontman of the rock band Genesis, and, as a personal friend of Marcus, Matrix star Laurence Fishburne had a spot in the audience. More than 1,000 people also watched the event online.\n\n“The idea of AGI might not even be the right goal, at least not now,” said Marcus, a neuroscientist at New York University in New York City, during one of the keynote addresses. Some of the best AI models are highly specialized, such as AlphaFold, Google DeepMind’s protein-structure predictor, he said. “It does a single thing. It does not try to write sonnets,” he said.\n\nBeyond Turing\n\nTuring’s playful thought experiment has often been used as a gauge of machine intelligence, but it was never meant as a serious or practical test, said Sarah Dillon, a literature researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, who studies the mathematician’s works.\n\nSome of today’s most capable AI systems are refined versions of large language models (LLMs) that predict text on the basis of associations made in learning from internet data. In March, researchers tested four chatbots in a version of the Turing test, and found that the best models passed.\n\nYet the fact that chatbots can imitate speech credibly does not mean that they can understand, said several researchers at the event. Although LLM responses can be uncannily human, “when you go outside the box of what you normally ask of these systems, they have a lot of trouble,” said Marcus. As examples, he cited the inability of some models to label the parts on an elephant correctly, or to draw clock hands in anywhere but the ten and two positions. For this reason, models could still fail the Turing test if they are challenged by a scientist who knows their weaknesses.\n\nAI researcher Gary Marcus (left) with actor Laurence Fishburne at the Turing event.Credit: Courtesy of the Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton\n\nStill, the rapid improvement of LLM-based systems in a broad range of areas, especially reasoning tasks, has prompted speculation about whether machines will soon reach human-level performance on cognitive tests. To chart AI’s growing capabilities, and to capture non-language-based skills, researchers have sought to construct harder tests. One of the most recent is the second version of the puzzle-based Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for AGI (ARC-AGI-2), which is supposed to assess an AI’s ability to adapt efficiently to new problems. Such tests are often framed as milestones on the route to general intelligence, but researchers don’t agree on any one benchmark for achieving AGI.",

During an organized coffee break at the meeting, the team catered for nearly 1,000 attendees and raised roughly £450 (a little over US$600) in just 30 minutes for the Great North Air Ambulance Service.\n\nCakes for Good is just one example of scientists coming together not only to foster community in their own departments, but also to raise money for charitable causes. For some, these efforts represent a small but powerful way to make a difference in their communities when their busy schedules or financial situations might otherwise prevent it.\n\nBuilding community\n\nVeresvarska arrived at Durham as a new PhD student in September 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Making connections with other students or faculty members proved difficult, even after lockdowns began to lift and the world started to open up again, she says.\n\nTo help rebuild a sense of community in the department, Veresvarska and her co-founders started Cakes for Good in April 2022. Instead of baking for the department and accepting money to cover the cost of ingredients, as had been done in the past, the Cakes for Good team decided to donate any money raised to charity.\n\n“We thought that letting others [in the department] decide what charities this should go to might be a good way to get people involved and interested,” Veresvarska says.\n\nCakes for Good ran its first charity bake sale in May 2022 to support humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Since then, it has run monthly bake sales throughout the academic year to support global causes such as Medical Aid for Palestinians and support for schoolgirls in rural Kenya. It has also donated money from the sales to local charities supporting transgender youth, refugees and asylum seekers and environmental conservation. Each sale earns about £180–200, and Cakes for Good has raised roughly £4,555 for charity since 2022.\n\nCakes for Good bake sales organized by astronomers at Durham University, UK, have raised thousands of pounds for range of charities.Credit: Cakes for Good\n\nAnything chocolate is usually a big seller, Veresvarska says. The only complaint has been that some of the baked goods are just too good, she jokes, adding: “I had someone tell me in January that it’s unfair that we hold the bake sale outside their door, because they’re on a diet.”\n\nWorking to develop community is also at the heart of a biannual bake sale run by the Chemistry Graduate Students Society (CGSS) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with undergraduate chemistry clubs. Its first bake sale, in 2023, raised funds during Pride Month for a local organization, Spectrum, that offers a gathering place, as well as mental-health resources, for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOf the society’s two bake sales each year, the first raises funds for Spectrum, the second for another local charity, such as the Women’s Crisis Services of Waterloo Region. The organizers say that, at each event, they raise roughly Can$500–800 (US$360–580). Cookies — chocolate chip, matcha or snickerdoodle, which are rolled with cinnamon and sugar before baking — are usually a big hit (see ‘University of Waterloo’s idiot-proof cookies for scientists’), along with loaf cakes such as banana bread, says Madison Donohoe, a PhD student and co-president of the CGSS.\n\nAt the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada, the CGSS runs a charity bake sale three times a year. For an entrance fee of just Can$2, staff, faculty members and students in the department can take as many baked goods as they like, usually from a selection of up to ten options.\n\nLucas Andrew, a chemistry PhD student and CGSS president at the UBC, says that queues often form about 20 minutes before the charity bakes appear. Recent treats have included matcha cheesecake and butter mochi, a cake made with coconut milk and glutinous rice flour that originated in Hawaii. At each event, the group raises Can$100–200 for local charities. Among these are the PHS Community Services Society, which provides housing and health-care services to vulnerable people in Vancouver, and RAVEN, which supports local Indigenous communities.\n\nChemistry graduates at the University of British Columbia in Canada run charity bake sales three times a year.Credit: Amirhossein Rashidi (AHR shots)\n\n“As grad students, we don’t generally have a lot of disposable income,” Andrew says. “You may not be able to often donate on your own to a charity, but the fact that we can come together as this community and contribute to these local initiatives is really, really nice.”\n\nTips for success\n\nIf you’d like to start your own charity bake sale, these bakers have some words of wisdom to share.\n\nGo where the people are. Attract customers by hosting bake sales at busy times and locations. For the University of Waterloo’s bake sale, this means between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the atrium of the Science Teaching Complex, where a lot of hungry students will be on a break from class, says Emily Wedde, co-president of the CGSS.",

          "authors": "Fred Schwaller",
          "abstract": "The World Health Summit heard calls for low- and middle-income countries to take control of their health spending.Credit: World Health Summit\n\nWho will pay for global health? Scientists and policy leaders explored this question when they met this week at the World Health Summit in Berlin. The reason: a steep and consistent fall, beginning in 2021, in international funding for health services in low- and middle-income countries (see ‘Failing health’).\n\nThe United States has made the deepest cuts, of about US$9 billion, after the start of the year, when the administration of US President Donald Trump slashed funding to the US Agency for International Development. One estimate found that, by 2030, these cuts could lead to 14 million deaths globally1. The United States has also pulled out of the World Health Organization (WHO), withdrawing funding that represented around one-fifth of the $6.7-billion programme budget in 2022–23. France, Germany and the United Kingdom are also scaling back, according to data published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, based at the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nSource: IHME\n\n“In Jordan, we lost lives immediately when health care in hospitals stopped abruptly,” says Haitham Bashier, director of the Public Health Emergency Management Centre in Amman. At the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network, a regional public-health organization in Jordan, “60% of our funding for health projects came from US-based funds. Now it’s gone,” Bashier told Nature at the summit.\n\nHowever, Bashier also said the cuts are “a rare opportunity to reimagine how the global-health ecosystem functions”. “We’ve been implementing an agenda imposed onto us by somebody else. We mustn’t repeat the old US-donor system,” he says.\n\nTake control\n\nNotwithstanding the cuts, this year, high-income countries spent nearly 300 times more on development assistance for health than low-income countries spent on their own health systems. The consensus among health leaders attending the summit is that these countries should now take control of their own health costs.\n\n“The global south has failed in the last 25 years to finance our own primary health-care systems,” says Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of African Leaders Malaria Alliance in Tanzania. “This was a serious act of negligence. But we have the capacity to reclaim this space and develop our own capabilities and institutions for our own health systems. We are beholden to make these government investments,” she adds.\n\nJohn-Arne Røttingen, chief executive of Wellcome, the health-research charity in London, agrees it’s time for a rethink. “The fact is that countries have been establishing health care that follows the plans of external financing,” he says. “A country like Malawi has something like 50 different health plans all catering to different scopes of the international system.”\n\n“In a partnership on equal footing, one side cannot decide to reduce a previously agreed contribution by 25% or 50%,” says Gorik Ooms, a health-policy researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp in Belgium. That’s why “a cooperation agreed between partners on equal footing should be more reliable than a donor–recipient relationship”.\n\nWho will fill the gaps?\n\nOne big question is where funding will come from to fill the gaps left by the United States and European countries, and whether new funders will bring new demands. Philanthropic donors such as Wellcome and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, are not filling gaps left by US and European governments.\n\nIn May, China committed $500 million to the WHO after the United States withdrew from the agency. However, some researchers don’t think that China will step up further. “Those are not gaps China has ever aspired to fill,” says Karen Grépin, a health-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nChina’s strategy is different from that of Western donors, Grépin says. “It’s more likely to provide aid linked to infrastructure investments,” she adds. But as other donors scale back, “I do see China becoming an even more influential partner to countries around the world in terms of global health”.\n\nWhat next for the WHO?\n\nDelegates at the summit also discussed the future role of the WHO as it restructures following US funding cuts. One proposal was that the WHO could facilitate health-care programmes but leave more of the health-care delivery to national governments. Along with other international organizations, it could also coordinate research and development (R&D), health-data sharing and the creation of technologies such as digital health and artificial intelligence. Røttingen told Nature this might mean that “funders now need to relinquish some of their powers to national governments and align with their national plans and priorities”.\n\nRøttingen adds that international organizations can do better to support global collaboration in the logistics of rolling out new health technologies. “The major improvements in child health and life expectancies have been driven by new technologies and their scale up. In a world with fewer resources, we need to get more efficient at delivering those potentials.”",

But the fourth-year university student faces a cosmic challenge in reaching the next stage of her academic career: enrolling in a PhD programme.\n\nPreliminary survey data show that dozens of US graduate programmes in astronomy and physics are planning to admit smaller PhD cohorts than usual for the next academic year — or even no graduate students at all. To compensate, Sarían, who is studying astronomy at Ohio State University in Columbus, is applying to more graduate schools than she’d originally planned, perhaps as many as 20.\n\nSarían is far from alone in her predicament. Across scientific disciplines, US university departments are cutting the numbers of PhD candidates they plan to accept in the current application cycle, for students due to begin in 2026. Some plan to pause admissions altogether. Programmes “in even some of the most elite among elite institutions are taking this step out of an abundance of caution”, says Julie Posselt at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who studies higher education. Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for instance, is significantly cutting PhD admissions across a swathe of departments ― and cutting admissions in at least one science department by roughly 75%, according to a 20 October story in the student newspaper The Crimson.\n\nThese nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties\n\nThe cutbacks are being driven by several factors, including institutional decisions about which research fields to support. But the reductions are due in large part to the US political environment, researchers say. Since Donald Trump became president in January, his administration has frozen billions of dollars in research funding at targeted institutions, including Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Harvard; although some of this has been reinstated, large deficits and uncertainties remain. The administration has also proposed massive cuts in federal support for research infrastructure. Trump’s administration is now asking all US universities to support its priorities, which include a ban on diversity programmes, in exchange for better access to federal research monies.\n\nMany researchers worry about the long-term effects of throttling the pipeline of trained scientists. “If this keeps up, it would be really devastating for the field, because this is where the next generation of experts comes from,” says Emily Levesque, an astronomer at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nNature asked the US Department of Education for comment, and received an automated reply saying the press office would not respond to queries until after the ongoing US government shutdown ends.\n\nThe turmoil continues\n\nEarlier this year, many university departments slashed their incoming PhD classes in a last-minute scramble as the Trump administration began cutting research funds. Now they are trying to work out how many students they can accommodate in an uncertain future.\n\nFew universities have revealed details of their graduate admissions plans for the 2026-2027 academic year. But several grassroots surveys hint that broad cutbacks are in the works across both US institutions and research disciplines.\n\nLevesque and her colleagues surveyed more than 150 US astronomy and physics graduate programmes, and found that at least 33 of the 91 respondents planned to admit fewer or no graduate students for the academic year starting in the second half of 2026.\n\nMeet the early-career scientists planning to leave the United States\n\nMeanwhile, 40 of the 45 biology departments that responded to a separate survey — sent to roughly 80 biology programmes — said that they had already shrunk their anticipated PhD cohorts for the 2026-2027 academic year or planned to do so. Kimberly Cooper, a developmental biologist at the University of California, San Diego, instituted the survey to share information between those responsible for admitting PhD students. “We were having all these conversations about what we do, and making the decisions, all in isolation,” she says. The response was so overwhelming that departmental representatives now meet in a monthly video call to share their experiences.",

          "abstract": "A blood test measuring levels of tau protein is almost 98% accurate in ruling out Alzheimer’s disease in individuals with cognitive impairments.Credit: Thomas Deerinck, NCMIR/SPL\n\nA new blood test to aid with the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The test, which is designed to rule out cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer’s disease, is the first blood test cleared for use in primary-care settings but not a first for Alzheimer’s.\n\nElecsys pTau181 — developed by two pharmaceutical companies, Roche in Basel, Switzerland, and Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana — measures a specific phosphorylated form of tau, known as pTau181 in blood plasma. The test quantifies how much tau protein in the body has been modified as a result of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn a press release on 13 October, Roche reported that in a clinical trial of 312 participants, the Elecsys pTau181 test was correctly able to rule out Alzheimer’s 97.9% of the time. The test uses a negative predictive value and helps to rule out Alzheimer’s in individuals with cognitive decline, rather than giving a positive indication that someone has the disease.\n\nFaster, cheaper, better: the rise of blood tests for Alzheimer’s\n\n“Numerous research studies have shown that these blood signatures have high concordance. They agree really well with the gold standard biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease, which we have been using in specialized settings for many years,” says Ashvini Keshavan, a neurologist and biomarker researcher at University College London.\n\nHowever, without full access to the trial data, Keshavan says it’s difficult to fully assess how accurate the test is. “It would be important to see the sensitivity, specificity and positive prediction values to assess the accuracy of this test.”\n\nHow accurate is the blood test?\n\nAlzheimer’s disease pathology is characterized by the build-up of sticky amyloid-β plaques and tangles of tau proteins in brain tissue. Both proteins disrupt brain function, lead to neuron death and are the causes of cognitive decline associated with the disease1.\n\nOne other Alzheimer’s blood test has already been approved to measure these biomarkers in individuals’ blood. In May, Lumipulse, developed by biotechnology firm Fujirebio in Tokyo, gained approval from the FDA. This test measures the ratio of two proteins: pTau217 and amyloid-β (1–42). Alicia Algeciras-Schimnich, a clinical chemist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, says the two tests work slightly differently — with the Lumipulse test able to both positively test for and rule out the presence of Alzheimer’s pathology.\n\nDuring a trial of 499 people, 97% of individuals who tested negative for the disease on the Lumipulse test had their results confirmed by follow-up diagnostics tests, which measure the levels of these proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue. Almost 92% of those with a positive Lumipulse result for Alzheimer’s disease had positive follow-up tests.\n\nColoured magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of a healthy brain (left) and a brain with aggregations of tau proteins (right). Credit: Mark & Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Inst./SPL\n\nBut as accurate as they’re said to be, the blood tests are prone to uncertain results when linking cognitive symptoms with Alzheimer’s. Individuals can fall into a ‘grey zone’ and require further testing to provide a clear diagnosis.\n\nMore than 30% of all samples that were analysed with a pTau217 test developed by Quanterix, a life-sciences company in Billerica, Massachusetts, fell into this grey zone2. A similar number has not been reported for the Elecsys or Lumipulse tests.\n\nWill the tests change Alzheimer’s diagnostics?",

That means I’ve now spent four years in the doctoral programme and am exactly 365 days away from professional disgrace and having my credentials quietly revoked in a humiliating end-of-cycle formality they call ‘declassification’. It’s not a euphemism. If I don’t find a new insect species by this time next year, I don’t get a PhD. I get a polite ejection from the Galactic Consortium of Insect Scientists (GCIS) and maybe a commemorative keychain.\n\nThe GCIS — venerable, bureaucratic and with all the warmth of cryogenic fog — was very clear in our orientation: discovery must occur within four to five Earth-standard years. No ifs, no bugs, no degree. It’s all written in some charter older than half the member planets, filled with flowery declarations about scientific value and intersystemal knowledge equity. The charter calls it a time-bound discovery mandate. I call it the Bug Rule.\n\nBack when I applied, I thought, please, how hard can it be? Insects make up 93% of documented animal life in the habitable Universe. They evolve faster than rumours, hitch rides on cargo freighters and colonize anything that’s even vaguely damp and not currently on fire. I assumed I’d stub my toe on a new species just walking to the dorm kitchen.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nInstead, I’ve become the department’s leading authority on not finding things. My thesis so far: Things That Weren’t New Insects, Volume 3.\n\nMy catalogue includes a long list of things that weren’t new insects: larval Terran micro beetles in borrowed shells; a ‘glider fly’ that turned out to be corrupted sensor feedback; and my personal favourite, a Martian ash-louse misidentified by a colleague as a nova-strain. The GCIS slapped them with a two-year publication ban and repossessed their lab footwear — they now study fungal drift on Europa. Barefoot. Metaphorically, but still.\n\nThe consortium used to care about taxonomy for taxonomy’s sake. Now it’s all triage and panic. With ecological systems collapsing across six planets and protein shortages spiralling, any insect with metabolic flexibility might save a biosphere, or at least feed a few billion desperate people. They don’t care if it’s beautiful or horrifying. If it breeds in pressure-variable conditions and doesn’t murder the host species? Into the database it goes.\n\nBut the requirements remain annoyingly intact. The insect must be isolated, fully sequenced, confirmed independently by two peer reviewers who aren’t legally dead, and are, of course, sentient-neutral. That last clause destroyed my best lead: a hive-minded crustwing from Proxima Centauri b that could mimic human speech. The GCIS deemed it a “biolinguistic contamination vector” and had it flash-incinerated. I still hear it humming in my dreams.\n\nSome nights I wake up with the taste of copper in my mouth and the faint impression I’ve just signed a contract.\n\nAnyway.\n\nHere’s my current situation. Still on Belt Station Agastya Theta, stationed on Deck 12, the biowaste reprocessing ring. It handles gut fauna from 63 livestock species and turns them into protein gel. The air smells like sanitized dung and melted ozone seals. But I’ve found a vent behind the centrifugal filter unit that isn’t in the schematics. Perfect heat signature. Subtle airflow. Unregistered by maintenance bots. Something lives in there.\n\nI’ve seen it. Not clearly, but enough. A flicker in still air. Once, a fragment of wing. Translucent, vibrating faintly, like it was humming in a frequency I couldn’t hear.\n\nEvery day for the past fortnight, I’ve left bait outside the crevice. Synthfruit rind, pheromone droplets, even powdered Terran wasp resin. Something takes it. Not all at once. Not messily. Deliberately. With intent.\n\nI’ve named it the Ghost Ant. Not because it looks like an ant. I still haven’t seen the body. I just like the drama. Better than Provisional Record KX-5/Delta or Biological Trace Entity 19a-Rho.\n\nMy adviser, Dr Juno, thinks I’m hallucinating under deadline pressure. She calls my current progress “theoretical optimism” and has suggested I pivot to fungal symbiosis, which, in academic terms, is the equivalent of being told to go swab mould and reflect on my choices. The implication wasn’t subtle.\n\nStill, I check the vent each morning. I don’t scan. That could spook it. I just crouch beside the unit, hold my breath, and look for changes. Yesterday, I found a shard of exoshell. About the size of a thumbnail, folded over itself five times, shimmering like compressed oil film.\n\nI haven’t reported it to the GCIS.\n\nNot because I’m trying to hoard glory. I just need to be sure. I need to know it’s mine. The last doctoral candidate who submitted too early had their discovery reassigned to a senior researcher who had “guided their thinking”. That student now teaches Introduction to Bioforms on a Class-2 moon school for children with partial language cortices.\n\nI want more than that.\n\nI want to name something no one else has seen. I want the Ghost Ant to be the insect that justifies this past exhausting year.",

According to a study published today in Nature1, a type of cell in the brain called an astrocyte is a key player in stabilizing memories for long-term recall.\n\nAstrocytes were thought to simply support neurons in creating the physical traces of memories in the brain, but the study found that they have a much more active role — and can even be directly triggered by repeated emotional experiences. The researchers behind the finding suggest that the cells could be a fresh target for treating memory conditions such as those associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“We provide an answer to the question of how a specific memory is stored for the long term,” says study co-author Jun Nagai, a neuroscientist at RIKEN Center for Brain Science in Wako, Japan. By studying astrocytes, Nagai said, the study identifies how the brain selectively filters important memories at the cellular level.\n\nStable memories\n\nNagai and his colleagues focused on the question of memory stabilization: how a short-term memory becomes more permanent in the brain. Previous research had found physical traces of memories in neuronal networks in brain regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala2. But it was unclear how these ‘engrams’ were stored in the brain as lasting memories after repeated exposure to the same stimulus.\n\nTo dig deeper, the researchers developed a method for measuring activation patterns in astrocytes across a whole brain of a mouse as it completes a memory task. They measured the upregulation of a gene called Fos — an early marker of cell activity that is associated with the physical traces of memories in the brain3.\n\nIn a well-established fear-conditioning memory task, mice learnt to associate a certain cage with unpleasant shocks to their feet while the researchers tracked the level of Fos in their brains. Days later, the animals would re-enter the cage and recall the unpleasant sensation. The researchers observed strong Fos upregulation in astrocytes in the animals’ amygdalas and other brain regions when mice re-entered the cage, but not during the initial learning phase, suggesting that astrocyte activity was more important for recalling past events than creating new memories.\n\n“The surprise was that astrocytes did not respond to the fear experience the first time, only the second time,” says Nagai.\n\nBrain stimulation leads to long-lasting improvements in memory",

Admission letters to the prestigious institution came with an invitation code to an artificial-intelligence agent. The bot is designed to answer students’ questions about courses, clubs and life on campus.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nAt Ohio State University in Columbus, students this year will take compulsory AI classes as part of an initiative to ensure that all of them are ‘AI fluent’ by the time they graduate. And at the University of Sydney, Australia, students will take traditional, in-person tests to prove that they have learnt the required skills and not outsourced them to AI.\n\nAll this is part of a sea change sweeping through campuses as universities and students scramble to adapt to the use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. These tools can, within seconds, analyse complex information, answer questions and generate polished essays — some of the exact skills that universities have conventionally taught. Eighty-six per cent of university students were regularly using AI in their studies in 2024, according to one global survey1 — and some polls show even more. “We are seeing students become power users of these tools,” says Marc Watkins, a researcher who specializes in AI and education at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.\n\nTo some, AI presents an exciting opportunity to improve education and prepare students for a rapidly changing world. Universities such as Tsinghua and Ohio State are already weaving AI into their teaching — and some studies hint that AI-powered tools can help students to learn. A randomized controlled trial2 involving physics undergraduates at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, suggested that those who used a custom-built AI tutor learnt more in less time than did students who were taught by humans alone.\n\nBut many education specialists are deeply concerned about the explosion of AI on campuses: they fear that AI tools are impeding learning because they’re so new that teachers and students are struggling to use them well. Faculty members also worry that students are using AI to short-cut their way through assignments and tests, and some research3 hints that offloading mental work in this way can stifle independent, critical thought.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nAnd some academics are angry that universities are allowing or even encouraging the use of AI tools — many of which are controlled by companies, have unknown cognitive impacts and are dogged by ethical and environmental concerns. An open letter released in June by scholars objecting to the uncritical adoption of AI technologies by universities quickly racked up more than 1,000 signatures from academics worldwide (see go.nature.com/4qpkygs). “Our funding must not be misspent on profit-making companies, which offer little in return and actively de-skill our students,” it reads.\n\nThere is one point of agreement among both enthusiasts and sceptics: the future has already arrived. “The rate of adoption of various generative AI tools by students and faculty across the world has been accelerating too fast for institutional policies, pedagogies and ethics to keep up,” says Shafika Isaacs, chief of section for technology and AI in education at the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO, in Paris.\n\nThe AI generation\n\nUniversities have been adapting to new technologies for decades — from computers and the Internet to online courses. But generative AI tools present a fundamental challenge, researchers say. Not only can they quickly perform some of the core tasks that universities teach students, but they have spread and are changing at pace. “The thing that is different about AI to every other technology is the speed at which it moves,” says Sue Attewell, head of AI at Jisc, a non-profit digital and data body for UK higher education, headquartered in Bristol.\n\nSurveys around the world show that students are quickly incorporating AI into their lives. “The number of users who are essentially young teens is just astronomically high,” says Watkins. “You’re talking hundreds of millions of users worldwide below the age of 24.” And science students seem to be early adopters. This year, the AI firm Anthropic, in San Francisco, California, analysed one million anonymized conversations between university students and its generative AI, Claude. It found that students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics were using it disproportionately more than were those in areas such as business and humanities4.\n\nBut what are students using AI for? In a survey of more than 1,000 UK students by the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think tank in Oxford, UK, most were, unsurprisingly, using AI tools to write, improve or summarize text (see ‘How university students use AI’). Nearly 90% of students said they had used generative AI for assessments such as exams or coursework. Most (58%) said they used it to explain concepts in the assessment, 25% used AI-generated text after editing it first and 8% admitted they’d used raw AI-written text5.\n\nSource: J. Freeman Student Generative AI Survey 2025 (HEPI, 2025)\n\nAttewell, who has conducted student focus groups on AI, says many students are using the tools to streamline their studies and become more efficient, not to cheat. And many just want guidance on how to boost their learning with AI, she says. Students might “know how to use [AI] brilliantly on social media or for their social life, but it doesn’t mean that they know how to use it for academic use”.\n\nThis, however, is where many universities are falling short. Institutions around the world have been scrambling to introduce policies for staff and students on the best ways to use AI — but with mixed results. On US campuses, “it’s been chaotic for the past two and a half years, and I don’t think it’s going to change anytime soon,” Watkins says. That’s because many institutions allow individual faculty members to decide whether and how AI can be used in their courses, he says, which leaves some students confused. “We might have a freshman student taking five classes, and they will be exposed to five different AI policies.”\n\nIn Australia, by contrast, there has been a strong, nationally coordinated response, educators say, in part because the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency has worked to develop guidelines with universities since 2023. And in China, “the integration of AI into universities is not optional, but an integral part of national strategy,” says Ronghuai Huang, co-dean of the Smart Learning Institute at Beijing Normal University.\n\nData and anecdote suggest that faculty members are embracing AI more cautiously than students are. Some staff are using AI tools to automate their own work, such as by helping to draft feedback on assignments, say researchers, whereas others are rejecting it outright. A survey this year of more than 1,600 faculty members from 28 countries by the Digital Education Council, an organization focused on technology in higher education, found that around 60% were using AI tools in teaching — less than the proportion of students using them6. However, 80% said their institution had not made it clear how to use AI in their teaching. “Faculty use is less sophisticated than student use,” says George Siemens, who studies technology and education at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nMeanwhile, big technology companies such as OpenAI and Google have been pitching their products to students and universities. “We’re inundated by companies wanting to partner with us,” says Ravi Bellamkonda, Ohio State University’s executive vice-president and provost. Last year, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Edu, a version of the popular chatbot tailored for universities. This February, when the California State University system announced it was giving its 520,000 students and faculty members access to that tool, it became “the largest implementation of ChatGPT by any single organization or company anywhere in the world”, according to OpenAI. In August, Google announced it was making its most advanced AI tools available for free to students aged over 18 in the United States and in a handful of other countries.\n\nEducation specialists say that tech firms are motivated by commercial interests and the opportunity to embed their AI systems into the lives of millions of young users. Universities that strike agreements with tech firms typically get campus-wide access to the latest AI models and data protection, meaning that student and faculty data and academic work are not fed into an AI training model.\n\nSome universities are grabbing the AI bull by the horns. Danny Liu, a biologist who specializes in educational technology at the University of Sydney, was one of the first to develop a generative AI platform tailored to higher education. Called Cogniti and developed in 2023, it is now embedded in the university’s digital learning platform and allows teachers to design custom AI agents for their courses. This might be an AI tutor for a science module, or an AI tool that expands brief marking comments into more specific student feedback. Cogniti is being used by more than 1,000 educators at his university, Liu says, and has been shared with more than 100 universities worldwide.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nAt Tsinghua University, academics also quickly started experimenting with ChatGPT after its release in November 2022, says Shuaiguo Wang, who directs the Center for Online Education there. Within a year, about 100 different AI teaching assistants had sprung up, and the university sought a more systematic approach. It also didn’t want to be reliant on any one AI model — such as the large language models (LLMs) that underlie ChatGPT and related tools — because “a new model emerges almost every day”, Wang says. Another key goal was to correct hallucinations, the inaccurate content that LLMs sometimes spout.\n\nIn April last year, the university led the development of a central, three-layer ‘architecture’ to incorporate AI into teaching. The bottom layer is where AI models are plugged in: the system draws on about 30 models from companies including DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud, OpenAI and Google, Wang says. The middle layer contains ‘knowledge engines’ that hold accurate, up-to-date information for different academic fields. The top layer consists of various student-facing platforms, including an educational one that hosts teaching assistants, as well as the AI bot to help students starting at Tsinghua.\n\nAs part of this system, for instance, students can review slides after a class and click a button saying ‘I’m confused’. This allows them to ask a pop-up AI agent questions. The intermediary layer analyses the question and directs it to the appropriate AI model, as well as searching its own databases; it then compiles the information to provide an accurate answer. Wang says the system has been adopted by hundreds of universities across China.\n\nThis year, Wang is changing tack and launching studies to ask a crucial and outstanding question: do students using AI tools actually learn more? Early results — as yet unpublished — have raised some red flags. Wang and his colleagues found that students who use an AI tutor often score higher in tests immediately after a class than do those who don’t use the agent. But two to three weeks later, the AI users scored lower than their peers. “Students might have a false sense of understanding,” he says.\n\nClassroom concerns\n\nWang is not the only one worried about the impact of AI on students’ learning — as Nataliya Kosmyna discovered when, in June, she and her colleagues released a preprint7 suggesting that students who use ChatGPT to help write an essay use less of their brains than do students who write it on their own. She has since received some 4,000 e-mails from school and university teachers worldwide who are concerned that the result reflects what is happening to students in their classrooms who are using AI. In a lot of cases, “they actually sound very desperate”, she says.\n\nKosmyna, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her team used electro-encephalography (EEG) to study the patterns of electrical activity in 54 students’ brains as they wrote 20-minute essays on questions such as “Do works of art have the power to change people’s lives?” The students were split into three groups: one with access to an LLM; another that could use websites and search engines but not LLMs; and a third that relied only on their own knowledge. The team used EEG to measure ‘connectivity’ between brain regions — the extent to which areas were communicating with each other.\n\nStudents using only their brains showed the strongest and widest pattern of connectivity and were usually able to later recall what they’d written. The LLM-using group showed the weakest connectivity — suggesting that there was less cross-brain communication — and could sometimes barely remember a word of their prose.\n\nKosmyna acknowledges that the study involved only a small number of students and did not look at the long-term impacts of using AI, among other limitations. (She also found it ironic that some commentators misinterpreted the study because they used AI to generate incorrect summaries of her 200-page preprint.) But the study fuelled a widespread concern that students who rely on AI in their studies are failing to develop valuable skills such as critical thinking — the ability to analyse and critique information and to reach considered conclusions. Anthropic’s analysis of one million student–AI conversations in Claude showed that nearly half of them involved individuals seeking direct answers or content with little engagement on their part.\n\nChatGPT for students: learners find creative new uses for chatbots\n\nOlivia Guest, a computational cognitive scientist at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, who led the writing of the June protest letter, says she has observed related problems with students in the past couple of years. “Their skills have dramatically changed,” she says: some struggle to reference a source or write an essay.",

          "authors": "Helge Kragh",
          "abstract": "Discordance: The Troubled History of the Hubble Constant Jim Baggott Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEver since the publication of James Jeans’ The Mysterious Universe in 1930 and Willem de Sitter’s Kosmos two years later, popular books on the Universe have proliferated. Jim Baggott is an experienced British science writer whose previous works on modern physics include Higgs (2012) and Quantum Reality (2020).\n\nWhy bad philosophy is stopping progress in physics\n\nHis latest book, Discordance, fits into the class of conventional popular cosmology, in so far that it is an account of how our present understanding of the Universe has emerged. But it is also, with some exceptions, more historically correct than other similar books. Baggott’s book is a masterpiece that combines depth with clarity and comprehensiveness with readability. It presents modern cosmology as an unfinished business, rather than as the final conclusion on what the Universe is all about.\n\nDiscordance does not shy away from difficult concepts, either. Modern cosmology is challenging to understand and Baggott ambitiously introduces his readers to the technical terms cosmologists use to think about the Universe. For example, he explains in detail how patterns in the cosmic microwave background tell us about the behaviour of matter and radiation in the hot early Universe. And he reveals why cosmologists are so interested in ‘type Ia supernovae’ — the rare explosions of dying stars that function as markers of cosmic distances and help to trace how the Universe expands.\n\n“The science can be hard,” Baggott admits, “but the reward for sticking with it is the glimpse it affords of the extraordinary beauty of the universe. Not just the universe as we see it, but the universe as we try to comprehend it.”\n\nA humbling tension\n\nDiscordance is essentially the story of how scientists have perceived and explained the Universe from the early twentieth century to the present. The title refers to the fact that the favoured theory of the Universe disagrees with some observations and is challenged by rival ideas. It also refers to concordance — the antonym of discordance — in so far that the currently accepted theory of the cosmos is sometimes called the concordance model.\n\nHow Stephen Hawking flip-flopped on whether the Universe has a beginning\n\nMore specifically, the book focuses on the Hubble constant, the measured rate of the Universe’s expansion — a key parameter in cosmology since its introduction in 1929. Incidentally, the Hubble constant is not constant. Because the inverse Hubble constant provides a rough measure of the Universe’s age, the parameter’s value slowly decreases as the Universe grows older. Thus, the term is a misnomer. But many astronomers and physicists still prefer this well-established terminology over the alternative, the Hubble parameter, and so does Baggott.\n\nThe book describes how astronomers’ estimates of the Hubble constant have changed over time as observations have improved, first drastically and, over the past few decades, more modestly, albeit still markedly. Originally, the problem was a too-large value that implied that the Universe’s age was less than that of Earth — an obvious difficulty. Advanced telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, fuelled the development of ‘precision cosmology’ and narrowed the value down to around 70, in the awkward unit of kilometres per second per megaparsec.\n\nYet disagreements between results from different methods persist — a much-discussed conundrum known as the Hubble tension. Reliable results estimated using the cosmic microwave background (remnant light from the early Universe) disagree with equally reliable findings from astronomical measurements using nearby galaxies. Although the two techniques’ estimates for the Hubble constant are not hugely different, astronomers worry that they are distinct enough to create a serious problem. Or are they? As Baggott points out, amid the confusion, we don’t know whether it is a real problem, nor whether improved measurements will solve the issue.\n\nTemperature variations in the cosmic microwave background reveal the seeds of galaxies that we observe today.Credit: ESA, The Planck Collaboration/SPL\n\nIn addition to the Hubble tension, the current standard cosmological model has a few other problems, of which the lack of understanding about dark matter (if it exists) is the best known. Scientists’ attempts to explain the dark energy that ‘blows up’ the Universe and accelerates its expansion have so far failed miserably. Similarly, physicists have been unable to explain why the Universe consists almost exclusively of matter with practically no trace of antimatter. These problems, too, are dealt with in Discordance, expertly but in less detail than the Hubble tension.\n\nGiven all these gaps in understanding, leading cosmologists disagree about whether some type of new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics is required to remedy what a few scientists consider a fundamental crisis. Baggott’s conclusion is balanced: “The arguments in favour of new physics and the demands to rethink cosmology should not detract from the extraordinary achievements of astronomy and cosmology over the past century or so. What we are witnessing is simply the scientific enterprise at work, and this is often messy and incoherent.”\n\nA matter of precedence",

Credit: Anna Moneymaker/Getty\n\nUpdate: On Wednesday, US district judge Susan Illston temporarily blocked the mass lay-offs made by the Trump administration after unions representing federal workers sued. A hearing for the case is scheduled for 28 October.\n\nThe shutdown of the US government, which is about to enter its third week, is starting to take a toll on US science. Since the shutdown began, the administration of US President Donald Trump has cancelled funding for clean-energy research projects and laid off public-health workers. The activities of some federally funded museums and laboratories have been suspended, along with the processing of grant applications by agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\nFunding to run the US government expired on 1 October after members of the US Congress failed to pass a spending bill. Negotiations to end the impasse have made little progress. Lawmakers from the opposition Democratic party say that they will pass the spending bill only if it extends popular health-care subsidies, a condition that Republicans do not want to negotiate on. “The longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,” US vice-president JD Vance said on Sunday.\n\nStaff reductions\n\nThe Trump administration said in a court filing on Friday that it will lay off 4,100–4,200 federal employees, an action officially termed a reduction in force (RIF). The Trump administration invoked the absence of a spending bill as justification for the lay-offs, which are an unprecedented measure during a shutdown. Unions representing federal workers have filed suit over the lay-offs.\n\nTrump team guts AIDS-eradication programme and slashes HIV research grants\n\nStarting on Friday night, some 1,300 staff members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received RIF notices, although the notices for 700 of them were quickly rescinded, according to Local 2883 of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing CDC employees. The lay-offs would “undermine the nation’s ability to respond to public-health emergencies”, a CDC staff member who has been affected by the lay-off said on Tuesday at a news conference organized by Local 2883.\n\nWord of lay-offs at the CDC’s influential National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) sparked particular concern among epidemiologists. The programme has been collecting US health data since the early 1960s, and has helped researchers to understand crucial public-health issues such as the health effects of lead in petrol.\n\nFormer CDC staff member Asher Rosinger, who is now an epidemiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says CDC staffers told him that the lay-offs have decimated the NHANES planning branch, a team that he says is crucial to the operation of the programme. “This gold standard survey may no longer be able to operate in the future,” he says.\n\nDouble lay-off\n\nSome CDC employees have now been laid off twice in the span of half a year, says Isaac Michael, a mathematical statistician at the CDC. Michael and his colleagues ran a survey and database to track the experience of new mothers in the United States — until the entire team was laid off in April.\n\nSeveral court orders have preserved their employment status for now, although they will still not be allowed to work even when the government reopens. But some of his colleagues received a second lay-off notice in the last few days, making it unlikely they will ever be reinstated.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nIf a state experiences an increase in maternal or infant deaths, “we won’t even know there’s a problem, because we’re not collecting any reliable data, and we won’t be able to do anything to help”, Michael says.\n\nAndrew Nixon, communications director at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the CDC, said that all HHS employees receiving RIF notices were designated as non-essential by their respective divisions, and that the HHS will continue to close “wasteful and duplicative entities”.\n\nThe administration’s court filing said that the US Environmental Protection Agency would lose 20–30 people. Staff members at US Department of Energy (DoE) offices who oversee renewable energy, energy efficiency and other areas have also received RIF notices, a DoE spokesperson said. “These offices are being realigned to reflect the Trump administration’s commitment to advancing affordable, reliable and secure energy for the American people,” they said.\n\nFunding cuts\n\nCoinciding with the shutdown, the administration has also announced a fresh round of cuts to research projects, adding to the billions of dollars of federal research grants that have been revoked since Trump took office in January.\n\nOn the second day of the shutdown, the DoE announced that it was cutting almost US$7.6 billion in funding from 223 energy projects, many of which support renewable energy. An analysis by Nature found that the list includes grants for 33 academic institutions, which have a combined value of $620 million.",

The findings1, published in PLoS Biology, add to researchers’ understanding of what conscious and unconscious brain states look like.\n\nChildren with severe epilepsy who do not respond to medication can undergo a surgical procedure called a hemispherotomy. During surgery, clinicians disconnect the part of the brain in which seizures originate from the rest of the brain, stopping them from spreading. The disconnected tissue is left in the skull and has an intact blood supply.\n\nThe team wanted to find out whether the disconnected part has some form of awareness — or was capable of exhibiting consciousness, says co-author Marcello Massimini, a neurophysiology researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. “The question arises because we have no access” to the disconnected region, he says, adding that it was unclear what happens once part of the brain is isolated.\n\nStudies investigating consciousness are difficult because there is no consensus on what conscious and unconscious states in the brain look like, says Ariel Zeleznikow-Johnston, a neuroscientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “There’s no generally accepted definitive signatures of consciousness in terms of electrical readings or brain activity,” he adds.\n\nEven defining unconsciousness is challenging, because activities associated with consciousness, such as remembering dreams, can occur during states associated with unconsciousness, such as sleep or anaesthesia, Massimini says.\n\nAsleep or awake\n\nResearchers in Italy, Australia and the United Kingdom examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) — a test that measures electrical activity in the brain — from ten awake children before they had a hemispherotomy and between six months and three years after the procedure. They compared the recordings with a database of EEGs from children with typical brains that were taken while they were awake or asleep.\n\nThey found that the electrical activity slowed in the disconnected region after surgery, whereas activity in the intact brain did not change. The EEG of the intact region was also similar to EEGs from control children who were awake. After surgery, the disconnected region became dominated by slow rhythms called delta waves and was similar to EEGs taken while control children were in deep sleep.\n\nThe slow pattern persists for months or years after surgery. Massimini says this finding raises questions about its function. The pattern has also been observed in injured parts of the brain among awake people who have had a stroke or traumatic brain injury. It could be protective, involved in maintaining a stable environment in the brain or helping the brain adapt to injury, he says.",

          "abstract": "Off a quiet hallway on the top floor of a building at the University of Osaka in Japan, Katsuhiko Hayashi is hatching a revolution.\n\nHuman embryo science: can the world’s regulators keep pace?\n\nHe is on a decades-long quest to grow eggs and sperm in the laboratory. Hayashi wants to understand the fundamental biology of these reproductive cells. But, if he succeeds, it could forever alter how humans reproduce.\n\nEven for a scientist known for extreme doggedness, it has been a tortuous road. It has taken Hayashi to some strange places: his lab grows fragments of faux ovaries and testes in dishes and has produced mice with two fathers and no mother1.\n\nEvery paper he publishes brings e-mails from people clamouring for help with their fertility. “I tell them, ‘This is still experimental’,” Hayashi says. “But sometimes, I can’t respond. There are too many.”\n\nThe work that Hayashi and others in the field are doing could offer fresh hope to people struggling with infertility, and to same-sex couples who want children who are genetically related to both partners. But despite the dazzling results researchers have achieved in rodents, that future remains distant. “The technology is super cool,” says Christian Kramme, chief scientific officer at Gameto, a fertility-focused biotechnology company in Austin, Texas. “But fundamentally, I don’t believe there is a single person in the world that should attempt to enact this clinically in the next decade.”\n\nThere are plenty of interim goals for researchers to chase, however. Drug companies and regulators hope that a bountiful supply of human gametes — the collective term for egg and sperm cells — could make it easier to test whether drugs and other compounds could reduce fertility or cause mutations that would be passed on to the next generation, says Ina Dobrinski, a reproductive biologist at the University of Calgary in Canada.\n\nAnd learning how to recapitulate human development in the laboratory could reveal clues about infertility, says Azim Surani, a developmental biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “This will be the greatest outcome from these studies,” he says. “Once you understand what causes infertility, you might find ways of overcoming that.”\n\nBut as labs move forwards with these experiments, some researchers are raising concerns about potential future uses of the technology. Growing large numbers of gametes in the laboratory could make it easier for parents to select embryos for desirable traits and even facilitate the generation of genetically modified babies.\n\nAlthough such uses are, by some estimates, at least 15 years away, researchers and some government bodies are calling for regulations to address the potential issues associated with lab-grown eggs and sperm — a process known as in vitro gametogenesis (IVG).\n\nResearchers differ in their estimates of when human IVG will become a reality. Hayashi’s laboratory has produced fertile mouse pups from what he calls egg-like cells grown in the lab2. There’s a chance that human equivalents of these cells could be made in a lab in the next two years, he says.\n\nThese mice have two biologically male parents. They were generated using eggs made from the males’ skin cells.Credit: Katsuhiko Hayashi, University of Osaka\n\nBut that doesn’t mean they’ll be ready for use in people, he adds. Only a small proportion of the mouse embryos generated from his egg-like cells give rise to live pups, and Hayashi speculates that it could take five years or more to produce truly functional human eggs with acceptable success rates.\n\nScientists will also need to develop and test non-human primate gametes. Ideally, the offspring generated from these eggs and sperm would be tracked for multiple generations, adding years to the timeline. “That’s a critical point,” says Mitinori Saitou, a developmental biologist at Kyoto University in Japan. “My guess is that probably we will have to rely on our next generation of scientists for this.”\n\nA recipe for gametes\n\nFor nearly 20 years, researchers have known how to reprogram cells in the human body into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can take on nearly any cellular identity. Such cells have been used to make cardiac cells that beat in unison, and nerve cells that conduct electrical signals. But recapitulating the complex and lengthy development of sperm and eggs has proved to be more difficult. “There are so many stages involved,” says Surani. “And each of these is very complex.”\n\nNormally, gametogenesis starts well before birth. Egg development begins in the fetus, in which immature eggs are produced by the millions. Some of these cells then initiate a specialized form of division, called meiosis, in which they lose a set of chromosomes, each cell keeping half the number of an ordinary cell. But this division takes years to complete: the cells pause mid-meiosis and will not resume until years later, after puberty, when they are ovulated. Each immature egg is surrounded by tissue that forms a fluid-filled follicle. These follicles secrete hormones and mature as the egg develops.\n\nMeanwhile, the cells that give rise to sperm also form in the fetus and, after puberty, can produce millions of sperm each day in the winding seminiferous tubules of the testes. Their tubular environment is more complex than the ovary’s follicles, and harder for scientists to recapitulate in the laboratory.\n\nIn both cases, the milieu of a developing egg or sperm is crucial. The cells communicate with their surroundings through proteins and other molecules, and receive physical cues from their environment that influence their development.\n\nImmature sperm seem to respond to the flow of fluid around them as it moves through the tubules of the testes, says Hayashi. And the stiffness of tissues in an ovary helps to hold a developing egg in a state of arrest, says Evelyn Telfer, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK.\n\nThe controversial embryo tests that promise a better baby\n\nThese signals and scaffolds are difficult to replicate in the lab — especially for human IVG, because it is so hard to obtain tissue to study normal development of the ovaries and testes. Researchers are using techniques that allow them to monitor gene activity and protein expression in individual cells and intact tissue, to pinpoint which molecules and cell types might be important, says Chuva de Sousa Lopes, a developmental biologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.\n\nSome studies incubate human cells with mouse ovarian or testicular cells to encourage them to develop into eggs and sperm3. But this approach cannot not be used to make gametes for use in human reproduction because of possible contamination with animal viruses.\n\nAt the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, urologist Ryan Flannigan and his colleagues are 3D printing testicular tubules from human cells for their IVG experiments4. Other approaches include using microfluidic devices designed to mimic the organs. Dobrinski’s lab grows 3D cell cultures called organoids, which combine several cell types found in the testes.\n\nThere are still kinks to work out. Dobrinski’s team, for example, struggles to keep its organoids alive for long enough to grow human gametes. In humans, egg and sperm development takes months3, not counting the years-long wait for puberty, says Kotaro Sasaki, a reproductive biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “Many people do not know how difficult it is,” he says.\n\nGametes in gear\n\nThat lengthy time in culture not only slows research, but can also raise the risk of something going wrong, potentially compromising the health of the final product and any offspring, says Eishi Aizawa, a developmental biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nSome groups are trying to make the process more efficient. For example, one team recently found three proteins that each seem able to initiate meiosis in both male and female iPS cells5.\n\nBut some features of this meiosis are unusual, and the cells don’t complete their division, says team member Merrick Pierson Smela, chief scientific officer of Ovelle, a biotechnology company in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMeiosis is a key stumbling point for IVG, says Paula Cohen, a cell biologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York. She and her collaborators have been trying to coax immature human gametes to undergo normal meiosis for about a decade. “It doesn’t work,” she says. Cohen says that many of the teams that have reported success have not fully demonstrated that meiosis is proceeding in their Petri dishes as it would in the body. And proper meiosis is important: errors in the process can lead to gametes with the wrong number of chromosomes.\n\nA different approach, reported last month6, seems to produce functional eggs capable of being fertilized. Researchers replaced the nucleus of an immature egg cell, which has one copy of each chromosome, with the nucleus from a skin cell, which contains two of each. They then triggered a process, which they called mitomeiosis, that discarded one set of chromosomes, mimicking some features of meiosis.\n\nAbout 9% of these cells led to viable eggs that were fertilized and developed for another six days, generating a precursor to an embryo known as a blastocyst. But all the blastocysts had chromosomal abnormalities, and they did not undergo the genetic shuffling that usually takes place during the development of gametes. This recombination is a source of genetic diversity, and it’s unclear how the lack of it would affect offspring, says Cohen, or how the mitomeiosis process affects subsequent cell divisions. “This would need to be studied intensively.”\n\nLab-grown gametes could one day be used for in vitro fertilization.Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nAnother hurdle to achieving human IVG is recreating the complex sequence of DNA alterations that occur at different stages of development. Early in gametogenesis, cells systematically erase certain chemical modifications that can affect gene activity; later, new modifications are added onto certain regions of DNA, some of which are then said to be ‘imprinted’.\n\nThis step is crucial: more than a dozen disorders have been linked to improper imprinting, says Surani. “You have to get this right,” he says.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Success rates for Europe’s leading research grants are declining — some to single percentage points — as a surge in applications far outweighs the funds available. Data gathered by Nature show that researchers, especially those at the start of their academic journeys, are facing increasingly fierce competition to pursue research careers (see ‘Funding competition’).\n\nLast month, the European Commission said that the European Union’s research and innovation framework programme had received the highest number of funding proposals in its four-decade history this year.\n\nApplications for the 2025 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships exceeded 17,000 — an increase of nearly 65% compared with 2024. The MSCA scheme has a proposed budget of €404.3 million (US$471 million) to fund around 1,650 projects, and the success rate (the proportion of awards granted) is expected to drop below 10%, down from nearly 17% last year.\n\nThe European Research Council (ERC), Europe’s premier funding agency for basic research, has reported similar surges in applications across its schemes. For its Starting Grants — open to early-career researchers with two to seven years of experience after completing a PhD — the ERC has received 13% more proposals so far compared with 2024. Only 12% will be funded, down from 14% last year.\n\nApplications for the ERC’s Advanced Grants — which fund established researchers — have also risen, by 31% and 82% compared with 2024 and 2023, respectively. Yet only an estimated 276 projects (8%) will be funded, down from 11% last year.\n\n“We’re extremely pleased that there is such a high demand for ERC grants. It shows that people have ideas for fundamental science, for frontier science, that there’s a need for it, there’s a desire for it,” says Maria Leptin, president of the ERC. “The flip side is we don’t have more money. And so, the success rates will go down, and there will be frustration in the community,” she adds.\n\nEurope’s life-sciences organization, EMBO has received “a record number” of applications for its postdoctoral fellowships this year, says Karin Dumstrei, head of the programme.\n\nThe result is that many researchers are fighting to stay in an increasingly competitive academic system. “You can work as hard as you want, but at the end of the day, it’s down to numbers. It’s down to luck,” says Christina Carlisi, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London, who has been applying for grants this year and feeling the strain. “It’s mostly out of your control. And I think that’s sometimes difficult to grapple with in terms of keeping the motivation going.”\n\nDeclining success rates\n\nNational funding bodies across Europe are experiencing similar increases in applications. The German research foundation (DFG) — the country’s largest independent research funding organization — told Nature that applications for its early-career grants between January and August were up by 20% compared with the same period in 2024.\n\nI won three competitive grants in a row. Here’s how I learnt what to do\n\nAnother major funder in Germany, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, has received at least 20% more postdoctoral applications so far this year than in the same period last year. Applications from India and China make up the largest share of this increase, a representative of the foundation told Nature, and applications from the United States have also risen, although to a lesser extent.\n\nGrant applications received by the United Kingdom’s central research funder, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), have almost doubled since 2017–18, according to a report published this year. But over the same period, the success rates have nearly halved — from 36% in 2017–18 to 19% in 2024–25, the lowest in the decade. Data shared with Nature by the UKRI’s Medical Research Council show that two of its grant schemes recorded the highest number of applications since 2020 this year.\n\nThe Swedish Research Council told Nature that it has also observed a significant rise in applications in the past three years, but the Research Council of Norway said that it has not seen any major changes.\n\nEuropean competition\n\nResearchers and officials say it is too early to know what is driving the spike in applications. Cuts to science budgets and political instability are prompting US researchers to look for jobs in Europe. Academics in the United States can apply for EU grants provided that they carry out the research in institutions within Europe. European scientists who have built careers in the United States might also be seeking opportunities to return home.\n\nWhen the government cancels your research grant, here’s what you can do",

          "title": "Why simply ending animal testing isn’t the answer in biomedical research",
          "authors": "K. C. Kent Lloyd",
          "abstract": "A polarized debate in biomedical research is pitting those who favour ‘traditional animal models’ — meaning living non-human mammals, such as mice, that are used to investigate human disease mechanisms, responses to treatments and so on — against proponents of various experimental approaches collectively termed NAMs.\n\nNAMs, short for ‘new approach methodologies’ or ‘novel alternative methods’, include in vitro models, such as organoids grown from stem cells or other cells, that are designed to mimic the properties of human organs or tissues1; computational (in silico) modelling approaches that predict how biological systems respond to drugs or other perturbations2; and chemical (in chemico) techniques that assess how biological molecules interact outside an organism or cell3.\n\nNAMs could markedly accelerate progress in drug discovery, toxicology and disease modelling. They could also lessen the need for animal testing, which is ethically problematic for many people. But framing NAMs as innovative disrupters and ‘traditional animal models’ as outdated holdovers — as many are now doing — oversimplifies a reality that is much more nuanced. Worse, it is distracting researchers from considering the scientific, ethical and translational issues related to both types of approach.\n\nComplementary approaches\n\nAs a clinically trained veterinarian and biomedical scientist, I have been using mouse models to try to understand human genetic diseases for more than 20 years. The principles driving the development of NAMs are not new. For decades, researchers have been using tools, such as human induced pluripotent stem cells, to garner information relevant to humans and to lessen the need for animal testing. What’s brought all this to the fore are major technological advances in NAMs and a push by regulators and funders globally for the expanded use of these methods in research.\n\nBut instead of asking whether ‘to NAM or not to NAM?’ when considering the use of anything as a research model, the question should be: ‘Does the model I am using faithfully represent the biological system I am studying?’\n\nAlternatives to animal testing are the future — it’s time that journals, funders and scientists embrace them\n\nNAMs and animal models offer distinct, often complementary insights into the workings of complex in vivo biological systems. For well-defined, narrow applications, such as in toxicology, or when researchers are wanting to assess a specific biological process or disease mechanism at the molecular, chemical, cellular or organ level, NAMs are proving highly useful. Currently, however, no NAM can model how a specific gene functions in a person, how an organ or the entire body works or how a disease progresses.\n\nAll models — whether they are NAMs or inbred mice — should be updated, refined or replaced as tools and data emerge that allow researchers to better match models to the human system they are trying to investigate.\n\nExperimental technologies, such as the gene-editing tool4 CRISPR–Cas9, have made it easier for researchers to design animal models that more faithfully recapitulate human biological processes or phenomena. Targeted genome editing in mice5, for instance, has shown how some human genes have different effects in men and women6, and how some have different effects at different life stages7. It has also uncovered cases of genetic pleiotropy, in which a single gene influences multiple traits8,9. Future advances will probably improve animal models even further.\n\nNerve cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.Credit: Ikelos/Dr Christopher B. Jackson/SPL\n\nMoreover, for all models, the quality and usefulness of the information generated will depend on a host of factors that are extraneous to the model itself.\n\nNAMs are increasingly being touted as a solution for the limited translatability of findings from preclinical research to the clinic10. On average, 86% of drug candidates fail in clinical trials10, and some of these failures have been linked to the use of animal models11.\n\nBut problems with translatability can stem from factors other than the physiological differences between species12,13. For instance, the disease models could have been oversimplified, or the group sizes made too small, or the animals being tested might not have been assigned to the treatment groups in a sufficiently random manner. Many of these issues could apply equally to studies involving NAMs.\n\nA problem with framing",

          "authors": "Ron Laskey",
          "abstract": "Credit: Jerry Mason/Science Photo Library\n\nJohn Gurdon transformed biology by proving that when cells specialize to become a specific type, such as skin or nerve cells, they do so by switching genes on and off, not by losing genetic information. This insight came from his pioneering experiments between the 1950s and the 1970s, when he transferred the nucleus (the part of the cell containing DNA) from frog cells into frog eggs whose nuclei had been removed. Some of the eggs developed into adult frogs, showing that some specialized cells retain the full genetic blueprint to make an entire organism.\n\nDolly at 20: The inside story on the world’s most famous sheep\n\nHe also provided early evidence that, although the number of pluripotent cells — which can become many cell types — declines during development, some persist into adulthood. His work laid the foundation for animal cloning and, decades later, the birth of the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep.\n\nGurdon shared the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan, who discovered how to reprogram adult cells into a stem-cell-like state. Together, their discoveries reshaped research into how organisms develop, as well as cell biology and regenerative medicine.\n\nAfter his early success, Gurdon studied how the nucleus is influenced by the cytoplasm that surrounds it. By transplanting nuclei into eggs and their precursor cells (oocytes), he showed that substances in the cytoplasm control the cell cycle — the sequence of growth and division — and gene activity. He identified chemical triggers for DNA copying and cell division, helping to define how all cells multiply.\n\nBorn in southern England in 1933, Gurdon grew up in a comfortable home but struggled at school. At 13, he went to Eton College in Windsor, UK — an experience he later called “intensely uncomfortable”. At 15, he was ranked last out of 250 students in a notorious biology report. His teacher wrote: “He will not listen but will insist on doing his work in his own way. I believe he has ideas about becoming a scientist; on his present showing, this is quite ridiculous.”\n\nWhat is an embryo? Scientists say definition needs to change\n\nFollowing that disaster, Eton excluded him from any further science classes. Christ Church College at the University of Oxford, UK, offered him a place on the strength of his Latin and Greek, on the condition that he studied anything except Latin and Greek. He spent a gap year learning elementary biology and was allowed to switch to zoology. He had a long-standing interest in insects and gained first-class honours in zoology, but the professor of entomology rejected his application to study insects for a doctoral degree. Fortunately for science, Michail Fischberg, a lecturer in developmental biology, offered him a doctoral project studying the embryo of the clawed frog Xenopus, leading to his landmark nuclear-transplantation experiments.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Layland Masuda/Getty\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding induces the accumulation of specialized immune cells that reduce the chances of breast cancer developing, finds a study1 in humans and mice that is published in Nature today.\n\nBreastfeeding is known to reduce the risk of breast cancer, but the mechanism underlying this protection has been unclear. During pregnancy and postpartum, the human breast significantly remodels itself to create a supply of nutritious milk to help a baby’s organs, brain and bones to grow. After weaning, the breast goes through a process called involution, changing back. During this process, new cells are created and older, damaged cells are cleared out.\n\nThis biological redesign is also “a main trigger” for the recruitment of specialized immune cells to the breast, called CD8+ T cells, says study co-author Sherene Loi. Other immune challenges, including milk proteins, any foreign material coming from the baby, mastitis and viruses, also bring T cells to the breast tissue, says Loi, a medical oncologist at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nT-cell count\n\nLoi and her colleagues’ research had three parts. First, they looked at a diverse population of 260 healthy women who had undergone preventative mastectomies or breast reductions — some of whom had a normal risk of breast cancer, others an elevated risk — and compared the T-cell count in the removed breast tissue of women with and without children. Women who had had children had more T cells and those cells were long-lived, persisting for up to 50 years after pregnancy.\n\nNext, the authors used mouse models to determine whether pregnancy and breastfeeding protect against breast cancer. Mice that had never had pups, mice that had pups that were almost immediately removed, forcing weaning and mice that had gone through a full cycle of lactation and involution had cancer cells introduced into a mammary fat pad. Loi and colleagues found that the tumours were smaller in the mice that had lactated, and that these animals also had more T cells in the tumours, than the mice that had their pups removed, forcing weaning. “Immunity was both in the breast and systemic. So lactation does actually change the whole body’s immunity in these mice models,” says Loi.\n\nLast, the team looked at a population of more than 1,000 women who had what is known as triple-negative breast cancer, which occurs most commonly in women under the age of 40 and is one of the most aggressive forms of the disease. All of the women had given birth. Those who had breastfed had better survival rates — and their tumours contained more T cells — than did those who hadn’t breastfed.\n\nJulia Ransohoff, an oncologist who treats and researches breast cancer at Stanford University in California, says the study leverages a creative set of data from mice and humans to show that breastfeeding and involution result in CD8+ T-cell-driven antitumour immunity in breast tissue. The study also finds that these T cells are associated with triple-negative breast tumour regression. In people, some of these immune cells are retained for decades after a baby’s delivery, she adds.",

          "abstract": "An electrical device implanted under the retina helps to restore some visual acuity to people with age-related macular degeneration.Credit: Science Corporation\n\nScientists have used an eye implant to improve the vision of dozens of people left functionally blind by age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The implant, which measures 2 millimetres by 2 millimetres, and is just 30 micrometres thick, is surgically inserted beneath the retina to replace the light-sensitive cells that have been lost to the disease.\n\nThe clinical trial, which is described today in The New England Journal of Medicine1, involved 38 people with advanced AMD whose retinas had degenerated severely. One year after device implantation, 80% of participants had gained a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision.\n\n“Where this dead retina was a complete blind spot, vision was restored,” says trial leader Frank Holz, an ophthalmologist at the University of Bonn in Germany. “Patients could read letters, they could read words, and they could function in their daily life.”\n\nReversing blindness with stem cells\n\nDespite some minor events related to implantation surgery, the trial’s safety-monitoring board viewed the device’s benefits as outweighing its risks. In June, the device’s owners — the San Francisco-based neurotechnology company Science Corporation — applied for certification that would allow the device to be sold on the European market.\n\n“I think this is an exciting and significant study, which has been well-designed and analysed. It gives hope for providing vision in patients for whom this was more ‘science-fiction’ than reality,” says Francesca Cordeiro, an ophthalmologist at Imperial College London.\n\nRestored vision\n\nAMD is the commonest form of incurable blindness in older people. There are two main types, wet and dry AMD. The current work studied people with dry AMD, the advanced form of which affects around 5 million people globally. In dry AMD, the central retina’s light-sensitive cells die over a period of years, leaving affected individuals with intact peripheral vision but without their high-acuity central vision. “They can’t recognize faces, they can’t read, they can’t drive a car, they can’t watch television,” says Holz.\n\nThe light-sensitive cells that die (rods and cones) convert light into electrochemical signals that are conveyed to other types of retinal neurons, which then send messages to the brain’s visual-processing regions. Because retinal neurons survive AMD, scientists reasoned that a light-sensitive implant that electrically stimulates the retina according to the pattern of photons striking it could reinstate a sense of vision.\n\nA visual guide to repairing the retina\n\nThe implant, termed PRIMA — for photovoltaic retina implant microarray — was originally developed by the Paris-based company Pixium Vision, and was acquired by Science Corporation last year. It is wireless, unlike previous retinal devices. And, being photovoltaic, the photons that activate it also provide the energy source for generating its electrical output.\n\nIt is used in combination with glasses that contain a camera that captures images and converts them into patterns of infrared light that they transmit to the retinal implant.\n\nThe system, which allows users to zoom in and out on target objects, and adjust contrast and brightness, does, Holz says, take months of intensive training to use optimally.\n\nIn the current study, 38 individuals were treated at 17 clinical sites across 5 European countries, and 32 of the participants were tested a year after implantation. Twenty-six of them had a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision — which, on average, amounted to being able to see two lines further down a standard eye test chart of letters. Overall, most participants’ vision came close to the resolution achievable with PRIMA.\n\nBy the study’s end, most recipients were using PRIMA at home to read letters, words and numbers. Of the 32, 22 said that their user satisfaction was medium to high.",

Credit: Lewis Houghton/SPL\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating drugs or understanding basic biology, researchers are increasingly favouring various innovative experimental approaches over animal models or immortalized human cell lines.\n\nSuch approaches, known as NAMs — short for ‘novel alternative methods’ or ‘new approach methodologies’ — remove the ethical problems associated with experimenting on animals. By being able to capture much more human genetic variability than the animal models and cell lines traditionally used in research can, they also promise to identify safe and effective treatments more reliably and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nExamples of NAMs include: multicellular in vitro systems that mimic the biological and mechanical properties of human organs and tissues; chemical (in chemico) assessments of the interactions between biological molecules outside a cell or organism; and computational (in silico) modelling approaches, such as those that predict how molecules will interact.\n\nWhy simply ending animal testing isn’t the answer in biomedical research\n\nSome governments and regulators worldwide are now pushing for the increased use of NAMs in research, partly because of pressure from animal-rights groups. In April, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to phase out its requirement for animal testing in the development of monoclonal antibody therapies, among other drugs. And just last month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded US$87 million to set up the Standardized Organoid Modeling Center, a national resource dedicated to the development of organoid-based NAMs “to reduce reliance on animal modeling”.\n\nYet, despite all of these developments, early adopters of NAMs — ourselves included — are still encountering resistance. Although there has been some progress (see ‘On the rise’), many such researchers struggle to publish their work, particularly in high-impact journals. Some continue to be asked by reviewers to validate their studies in animals or, when applying for grants, find that funders view pilot data more favourably if those data include animal studies. Early-career researchers, in particular, report feeling pressured into including experiments on animals, even when there seems little scientific justification for doing so.\n\nSource: K. Taylor et al. Front. Lab Chip Technol. 3, 1426895 (2024)\n\nTo take advantage of the opportunities that NAMs now present — and of the growing number of initiatives aimed at boosting the development and use of these approaches — changes are needed in how scientific journals, regulators and funders operate. This would help to ensure that those who are implementing these transformative technologies are applauded, not penalized.\n\nWhat is a NAM?\n\nSome cell- and tissue-based NAMs involve human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. These can be generated in the laboratory from somatic cells, such as blood or skin cells. They continuously self-renew and, with the appropriate chemicals and mix of growth factors, can differentiate into almost any cell type in the body. Thus, using blood draws or biopsies, researchers can, in principle, obtain an unlimited supply of cells representing any organ type, patient or patient population.\n\nOrganoids and spheroids are among the NAMs that can be generated from iPS cells or other cells. These 3D structures allow researchers to analyse cell behaviour, model diseases and test drugs in in vitro systems that mimic the architecture, function and cell types of a human organ, or the conditions provided by natural tissues.\n\nAn organoid made from cells found in the lining of the uterus. Credit: Konstantina Nikolakopoulou, Turco Lab, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research\n\nUsing collagen, other similar proteins or polymer hydrogels that are free from animal derivatives, models are now being designed that biologically and mechanically mimic the microenvironments of tumours and the extracellular matrix (the network of proteins and other molecules that surrounds cells and tissues).\n\nTumour spheroids generated from a person’s tumour tissue, or an entire biopsy, can be implanted into an extracellular matrix. And a circulatory system involving a pump can even push nutrients through the spheroids1. These technologies allow researchers to control and monitor the tumour microenvironment much more efficiently than if they were using animal models or patient-derived xenografts, a technique in which a biopsy of an individual’s tumour is implanted into a mouse model.\n\nModelling of the blood–brain barrier has also gained momentum. Using brain organoids, researchers can investigate whether certain drugs — or even cancer cells — can cross this barrier.\n\nMeanwhile, advances in NAMs in chemico and in silico are helping to accelerate drug development by flagging promising candidates for testing.\n\nThe FDA’s AnimalGAN models, for example, use artificial intelligence to generate animal-based data in toxicology that would otherwise need to be obtained using animal studies. Likewise, mathematical approaches, such as quantitative structure–activity relationship models, can work out the mathematical relationship between the chemical structure of a compound and its biological activity and predict the properties of new chemical entities.\n\nTrials in a dish\n\nGlobally, on average 86% of drug candidates fail in human clinical trials2. This is either because of problems with toxicity or, more commonly, because the drugs are not sufficiently effective in humans3. This inefficiency seems to be mainly the result of experiments in animal models failing to predict human responses to medications4.\n\nFor the past half a century, drug development has involved testing compounds in animals for years before exposing them to any human biology. By bringing human biology to the earliest phases of drug discovery, NAMs could significantly reduce the time and money needed to obtain positive results.\n\nOrganoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases\n\nUsing ‘clinical trials in a dish’ (CTIDs) — in which each ‘dish’ might consist of a panel of 100 organoids generated using stem cells or diseased tissues from 100 individuals, say — researchers can test therapies on a representative sample of patients before they test them in animals or in conventional clinical trials5.\n\nCTIDs could be especially useful for developing therapies to treat rare diseases caused by genetic mutations. More than 100 mutations of the LMNA gene, for example, are known to cause rare inherited heart diseases6. Using CTIDs, drug developers could tailor therapies to individuals with different mutations by simultaneously testing the effectiveness of several drugs on multiple patients’ cells in vitro7,8.\n\nBesides benefiting the discovery and development of drugs for inherited diseases, CTIDs could provide crucial training data for AI models that have been designed to aid drug discovery9.\n\nNAMs could also help to reduce health inequalities. At scale, almost all of the alternative models cost less than animal work does, which could reduce costs for patients10. And with the use of human iPS cells and patient-derived tissue in vitro, it should be possible to perform more-inclusive clinical trials in which medication is tested in under-represented populations, including those from low- and middle-income countries.\n\nShifting mindsets\n\nAs early users of NAMs, we’ve been encouraged by various initiatives, both in the United States and Europe, to reduce the use of animal testing in research.\n\nThe FDA’s April announcement about monoclonal antibody therapies is part of a broader effort to ‘replace, reduce and refine’ the use of animals in research11. A few weeks afterwards, the NIH declared that it would establish the Office of Research Innovation, Validation, and Application (ORIVA), in part to coordinate efforts to develop and expand the use of NAMs.",

          "abstract": "Ultra-runners face a limit on how much energy they can expend.Credit: Jean-Philippe Ksiazek/AFP via Getty\n\nThe human body has a ‘metabolic ceiling’ that even the most extreme athletes cannot surpass. A study1 published today in the journal Current Biology finds that over a prolonged period — of 30 weeks or more — that ceiling is about 2.4 times an athlete’s basal metabolic rate (BMR), the minimum amount of energy the body needs per day for essential tasks, such as breathing.\n\nFor short periods, people can burn up to about ten times their BMR. Researchers have previously proposed that the body has a metabolic limit2 of around 2.5 times BMR over extended periods, but it has never been properly tested until now, says Andrew Best, a biological anthropologist at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts in North Adams and a co-author of the work.\n\nBest and his colleagues recruited 14 high-endurance athletes — ultra-runners, cyclists and triathletes. Participants drank doubly labelled water containing deuterium and oxygen-18, which are heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen. Once ingested, both deuterium and oxygen-18 will be lost from the body in the form of water, through urine and sweat. However, some of the oxygen-18 will also exit the body in the form of exhaled carbon dioxide.\n\nBy tracing the quantity of these molecules that were flushed out in urine, the scientists were able to calculate the amount of CO2 exhaled, and, from this, estimate the number of calories the athletes burnt. This allowed the team to trace the athletes’ energy output as they did activities — such as competitions — in real time, rather than measuring them on treadmills in a laboratory, says Best.\n\nHitting the ceiling\n\nDuring multi-day competitions, some athletes burnt around 9,000 calories a day. But over longer periods — 30 and 52 weeks — their energy expenditure averaged about 2.4 times their BMR. The results show that even the most extreme athletes reach a metabolic ceiling that it is exceptionally difficult to exceed.\n\nThe researchers also found that when athletes devoted more energy to running, cycling and swimming, they unconsciously cut back on using energy elsewhere, such as walking or fidgeting.",

          "abstract": "Nathalie Bock and her partner juggled childcare, hospital visits and work commitments after their twin sons were born. Credit: Nathalie Bock\n\nIn January 2021, my partner and I were on fixed-term postdoctoral fellowships in Australia when life threw us a rapid sequence of curveballs. We hadn’t planned on four children, but our third pregnancy became twins. Elio, one of our twin boys, was born with intestinal atresia: his small intestine wasn’t connected to his large intestine. A day after birth, surgeons made a life-saving stoma.\n\nSix weeks later, while he was still in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a biopsy revealed that he had total colonic Hirschsprung disease (TCHD). Elio’s colon would never function, meaning that the stoma bag was going to stay for a few years. Living with TCHD entails chronic diarrhoea, vitamin supplementation and a constant risk of dehydration.\n\nBeing in a neonatal care unit is hard at any time, but Australia’s strict pandemic border closures meant that our relatives from abroad — we’re from France and Italy — could not fly in to help. After eight weeks, Elio moved from the NICU to the children’s hospital, where a parent had to remain with him at all times. My partner packed a suitcase; he lived in hospital for another three months while we waited for Elio’s stomal output to stabilize. At home I juggled looking after our two older children, aged five and eight, breastfeeding Elio’s brother Enzo, and a daily 45-kilometre commute between our home and the hospital.\n\nLuckily, our institutions granted us extra personal leave, which helped considerably. Still, we were two materials scientists on fixed-term contracts, now a family of six, including a disabled child. We made a pact: we would be there fully for Elio and would not sacrifice one of our careers to save the other, as many others (typically women) are forced to do. We’d spent years of our professional lives pursuing these career paths and, as stubborn optimists, we believed that with the right mindset we could both keep our careers going. We thought this would be the best way to provide our family with stability and fulfilment. Our plan was the same as those we’d put in place during frantic grant-writing seasons — to take turns advancing our work, to keep both of our research careers alive.\n\nI won three competitive grants in a row. Here’s how I learnt what to do\n\nFrom March to June 2021, my partner continued with his fellowship — developing sustainable, biodegradable materials for Australian commercial packaging products — while juggling nasogastric feeds, stoma care and baby cuddles. I advanced my fellowship work on the development of new biomaterials that can be used to culture and test cancer tissue in the laboratory, while running the rest of the family, buoyed by the support of my colleagues and friends.\n\nWe made it work from June to December. Elio’s disability was not eligible for government support, however, and despite donations from relatives and friends, we couldn’t afford a specialized carer. So, by late 2021, we started trialling the only nursery that would take Elio. His medical team helped us to adapt his daytime feeding so that he no longer needed nasogastric feeds. Nurses trained the nursery staff to empty his stoma bag and give him multiple medications. Soon after, Elio was fully enrolled at nursery: no more isolation and plenty of fun alongside Enzo and the other toddlers. One of our biggest successes as a family.\n\nThen came a new hurdle: how to respond to questions around career disruption on our grant applications. Many Australian funders offer applicants the opportunity to describe their personal circumstances, so that an individual’s track record of research can be judged fairly, which is a well-meaning attempt to balance the playing field for scientists whose careers have been thrown off course by life events.\n\nNathalie Bock develops biomaterials to study the role of cellular microenvironments in normal and pathological tissue states.Credit: Nathalie Bock\n\nIn practice, however, this meant disclosing intimate details about my family’s and my life to people who were unqualified to assess them. This information gets sent to peer reviewers, who are often colleagues, whose expertise is in science, not socio-medical assessment.\n\nWhen my partner encountered this request in an important grant submission, he chose not to disclose this information. He felt that it was too personal and with hospital life in full swing, he also knew that he didn’t have the capacity to bring this funding application to a more competitive level. He asked a senior colleague, originally a co-investigator, to step up as the lead applicant. The grant succeeded — a collective win — but my partner relinquished leadership.\n\nI felt similarly reluctant to disclose my recent personal trials. As a grant reviewer myself, I had read deeply personal accounts from others that I had no training to evaluate. In our small research community, I would sometimes find myself working with those same researchers who had shared their experiences in their applications. I’ve made the difficult decision to share personal details here to raise awareness of these issues. But, in the context of grant assessment, I doubt any reseacher wants their colleagues to know such details about them.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent dyes can help researchers to visualize the structure of a cell — but it can be difficult to use more than a handful.Credit: David Becker/SPL\n\nWhen working with fluorescent dyes or proteins, researchers typically focus on two variables: the wavelength of light at which the molecules are stimulated to fluoresce, and the wavelengths at which they emit light — that is, their colour. By balancing those properties, researchers can distinguish between half a dozen or so fluorescently tagged molecules in the same sample.\n\nBut there’s more to fluorescence than colour, and scientists can now more easily use another property of fluorescent molecules to increase the number of proteins that can be visualized at the same time.\n\nLed by Xin Zhang, a chemist at Westlake University in Hangzhou, China, the team designed more than two dozen fluorescent proteins that differ not only by colour, but also in how much time they spend in their excited state — a property called the fluorescence lifetime. The researchers call these molecules time-resolved fluorescent proteins, or tr-FPs. Their findings were published online last month in Cell1.\n\n“It’s brilliant work,” says Conor Evans, a physical chemist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. The team has given researchers a “dial-able palette” from which they can pick both a colour and a lifetime to get what they need, he says. “That’s very powerful.”\n\nExpanding the palette\n\nSuppose that a scientist wants to map a cellular process associated with a specific protein. To work out where in the cell that process occurs, the researcher can use fluorescent dyes to highlight cellular landmarks — blue for the nucleus, red for the cytoskeleton and green for the mitochondria, for instance. Viewing other proteins of interest against this background would require still more colours. However, because the visible spectrum is relatively narrow and fluorescent molecules emit light over a range of wavelengths, standard microscopes can handle only a handful of colours simultaneously. After that, the emission spectra start to bleed together, making it difficult to discern which signals are coming from which molecule.\n\nThe fluorescence lifetime provides a way to expand that palette.\n\nWhen a fluorescent molecule absorbs light, its electronic energy levels increase to enter what is called the excited state. The molecule hovers in this excited state for pico- to nanoseconds, and then begins its luminous descent to the ground state, emitting excess energy in the form of photons. The time a molecule spends in an excited state — that is, between absorbing and emitting photons — is called the lifetime.\n\nTo change the lifetimes of existing fluorescent proteins, Zhang’s team mutated some of the amino-acid residues to destabilize the region in which the fluorescent signal is generated. The researchers then screened the resulting proteins to identify variants with different lifetimes, but identical emission spectra, to those of their wild-type counterparts. In all, they produced 28 variants, spanning most of the visible spectrum.\n\nZhang’s group then put this palette to work, fusing the tr-FPs to various target proteins and testing their behaviour in various subcellular locations. They also examined how the tr-FPs performed in a wide range of applications, including super-resolution microscopy, and showed that the technology enables live-cell imaging of nine target proteins using only three colour channels.\n\nZhang notes that lifetime-based imaging is not a new concept, but he hopes the tr-FPs will help more researchers to take advantage of the technique. “I think this is more like an addition to the broad and powerful family of fluorescent proteins,” he says, rather than some kind of paradigm shift.\n\nThe researchers did, however, test the tr-FPs in what they say is a new application: quantifying the relative concentrations of two proteins in a single living cell, something that is difficult to determine from fluorescence intensity alone.",

          "abstract": "The University of Virginia in Charlottesville on 17 October rejected an offer from the administration of US President Donald Trump to sign a higher education ‘compact’.Credit: Peter Morgan/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nUS President Donald Trump asked US universities earlier this month to sign a ‘compact’ aligning their student admissions, hiring and research with his administration’s priorities — or risk forfeiting federal research funds. And many scientists have been calling on their institutions to reject the offer.\n\nHow Trump’s attack on universities is putting research in peril\n\n“Short-term gain in research funding is not worth giving up the power that we have as scientists,” says Caitlin Hicks Pries, a biologist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, who signed a petition against her school signing on to the compact. “We want our research funded, but we want it funded based on the quality of our ideas and the quality of science.”\n\nSeven of the nine universities initially invited to take the 1 October offer have now rejected it: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge; Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island; the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in Philadelphia; the University of Southern California in Los Angeles; the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; Dartmouth and the University of Arizona in Tucson.\n\nLate on 20 October, Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement that it would continue to provide the Trump administration with feedback on the compact offer, but that “research awards should be made based on merit alone”.\n\nSome, including MIT, have echoed their researchers’ concerns, citing the importance of academic freedom in their rationale. “In our view, America’s leadership in science and innovation depends on independent thinking and open competition for excellence,” MIT president Sally Kornbluth wrote in a public statement. “Therefore, with respect, we cannot support the proposed approach.”\n\nIn a 12 October post on his social-media platform Truth Social, Trump informally expanded the compact offer to all US universities. And schools in Kansas, Arizona and Missouri were invited by the White House last week to discuss it.\n\nThe US Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment on researchers’ concerns in this story. Nature instead received an automatic reply stating that there would be no response while the US government is shut down.\n\nHigher education under attack\n\nThe Trump administration, complaining that US higher education has become too liberal, has been taking action against universities for months. One of the first of these was the attempt to cut billions in research funding at all schools by capping indirect costs at 15%. (These are costs for things such as electricity for laboratories, paid on top of research grants.) Federal judges have since blocked those plans, but the uncertainty it has caused for schools has, in part, spurred some to reduce hiring and admissions.\n\nHarvard vs Trump: millions in grant money begin trickling back to scientists\n\nSome institutions, including Columbia University in New York City and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had their federal research funding frozen. Columbia agreed to pay US$220 million over three years and to a number of other concessions to restore its grants. Harvard, however, sued, and a judge ruled in its favour, giving its research funding back.\n\nFor Timmons Roberts, an environmental studies researcher at Brown, the prospect of a compact felt all too familiar. In July, his university agreed to pay $50 million over 10 years to support workforce development in Rhode Island in exchange for restoring its research funding, which had been frozen since April. Before Brown rejected the compact, Roberts spoke at a rally where he and his colleagues urged the institution to turn it down. Agreeing to the ‘deal’ won’t stop the Trump administration from asking for more in the future, Roberts says.\n\nThe compact was heavily shaped by billionaire financier Marc Rowan. In a New York Times op-ed explaining his involvement, Rowan stated that the compact was “intended to promote excellence in core academic pursuits and to protect free speech” while reforming a “broken” system.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nUniversity presidents said they agreed with many priorities of the compact, such as academic excellence and reintroducing standardized tests for admissions, which some institutions have already done. But the compact would additionally alter university admissions, by preventing officials from considering factors such as sex, race or nationality when deciding which students to admit, and marginalise transgender and nonbinary people by defining people as only ‘male’ or ‘female’. It also imposes a 15% limit on the proportion of international undergraduate students at schools; none of the institutions initially invited to sign the compact are above that threshold.\n\nAgreeing to the compact would additionally require schools with endowments over $2 million per undergraduate student to provide free tuition for those earning degrees in “hard science programs”. Tuition being too expensive is a real issue, “but I don’t think the way to fix it is to tell universities that they can’t charge it”, says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT who has been involved in faculty discussions about academic freedom and responding to the compact. “The federal government has every right to put conditions on recipients of federal grants, but the proper way to do that is through Congress,” which controls US funding. MIT meets the $2 million funding criterion; students whose families make less than $200,000 per year already receive free tuition.",

          "abstract": "The MC4R gene promotes gain of fat tissue (pictured, artificially coloured fat cells) but suppresses cholesterol levels.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nA gene that causes obesity is paradoxically linked to a reduced risk of having heart disease and high cholesterol, according to an analysis of thousands of people with obesity.\n\nObesity is often associated with high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or ‘bad’ cholesterol, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. But the new results, published on 16 October in Nature Medicine1, reveal that people with obesity due to relatively rare forms of a gene called MC4R have lower levels of LDL cholesterol and reduced rates of heart disease than do peers with a similar body-mass-index.\n\n“Although the obesity is quite severe in mutation carriers, their risk of these additional complications of obesity is reduced,” says Anke Hinney, a geneticist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, who was not involved with the study. “This is really good news.”\n\nThe results could also point drug developers to new targets for treating high cholesterol, she says.\n\nA weighty paradox\n\nThe study emerged from an effort to understand the fundamental mechanisms that regulate body weight — and why some people with obesity maintain good heart health, says study author Sadaf Farooqi, who studies metabolism at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThese brain cells could influence how fast you eat — and when you stop\n\nTo learn more, Farooqi and her colleagues turned to MC4R, which encodes a pivotal protein in the brain that acts as a brake on hunger. “Its activation tells you to reduce food intake,” she says. “If that doesn’t work due to loss-of-function mutations, then you don’t have the brake on and you gain weight.”\n\nAs a result, people who carry such mutations are prone to obesity: about 1% of people with obesity — and up to 5% of children with obesity — carry mutations that impair MC4R. That amounts to roughly 1 in 300 people in the United Kingdom.\n\nHeart healthy\n\nFarooqi and her team identified hundreds of people with these mutations by analysing genetic sequences from participants in two research projects: the Genetics of Obesity Study and the UK Biobank.",

Here, our longitudinal study of an undergraduate student community (N = 5,192) reveals that undergraduates who perceive their peers as empathic report better current and future well-being. Yet we document an ‘empathy perception gap’: people systematically see others as less empathic than others see themselves. Students who perceived their peers as less empathic were less willing to take social risks and grew more isolated over time. To disrupt this cycle, we conducted two field experiments that presented students with data on their peers’ self-reported empathy and behavioural nudges to encourage social risk taking. These interventions reduced the empathy perception gap, increased social behaviours and expanded social networks months later. This work offers a promising, scalable strategy to cultivate social well-being, simply by presenting people with data about each other.",

In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural and clinical research on ill-being and well-being. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for ill-being and well-being. By contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often exert divergent influences.

Yet despite decades of research on the adoption of conservation and climate-smart agricultural practices, little is known about the extent to which these practices persist over time. One key reason is the lack of longitudinal, field-level data. Using ground-verified, longitudinal data on cover cropping across thousands of farm parcels in Indiana (USA), we find that persistence is low and contrasts sharply with the predictions made by Indiana conservation experts. We also find low persistence in a new national dataset of self-reported cover cropping by farm operators. The potential for low behavioral persistence in sustainable agricultural practices raises essential questions about the design of conservation programs and the modeling and valuation of ecosystem services.",

In this study I answer two questions about the quality of the American public sphere that have generated widespread speculation, but little evidence to date. First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views. Political participation is significantly higher on average than 25 y ago. Few people reported engaging with online political discussants, despite efforts to make sure they were included in network measures.",

          "abstract": "Although seminal studies from the early 1960s suggested quality preschool can have lasting positive effects, agreement is lacking on the efficacy of different preschool models. The Montessori model is longstanding but lacks rigorous impact studies; prior random lottery studies included just one or two schools, among other compromises. Here, we report on end-of-kindergarten (age 5 to 6) impacts from a national study of public Montessori preschool. We compared children offered a Montessori seat via competitive lottery admission processes at one of 24 public Montessori schools at age 3 ( n = 242 ) to children not offered a seat ( n = 346 ), estimating Montessori impacts with intention-to-treat and complier average causal effect models. Roughly half of the treatment sample still attended Montessori for kindergarten. Although there were no notable impacts at the end of PK3 or PK4, at the end of kindergarten, controlling for baseline scores and demographics, Montessori children had significantly higher reading, short-term memory, theory of mind, and executive function scores. Intention-to-treat effect sizes exceeded a fifth of a SD, considered large in field-based school research [M. A. Kraft, Educ. Res. 49 , 241–253 (2020)]. This contrasts sharply with the more typical finding, where impacts of preschool are observed immediately following the program but disappear by the end of kindergarten. Further, a cost analysis suggested three years of public Montessori preschool costs less per child than traditional programs, largely due to Montessori having higher child:teacher ratios in PK3 and PK4. Although sensitivity and robustness analyses yielded similar results, important limitations of the study should be noted.",

Using live cell imaging, we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organization that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modeling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembled a division ring—which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depend, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.",

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this fate bias remain unclear. Here, we report that linker histone regulates HSPC fate choice at the lymphoid versus myeloid bifurcation. Linker histones package nucleosomes and compact chromatin. HSPCs expressing a doxycycline (dox)-inducible H1.0 transgene favor the lymphoid fate, display strengthened nucleosome organization, and reduced chromatin accessibility at subsets of genomic regions. The genomic regions showing reduced chromatin accessibility host many known marker genes of myeloid-biased HSCs. The transcription factor Hlf is located in one of the most differentially closed regions, whose chromatin accessibility and gene expression are reduced in H1.0 high HSPCs. Failure to reduce Hlf expression in multipotential HSPCs abrogates the H1.0-endowed lymphoid potential. Furthermore, HSPCs display aspartyl protease–dependent H1.0 decreases, especially in response to interferon alpha (IFNα). Aspartyl protease inhibitors preserve endogenous H1.0 levels and promote the lymphoid fate of wild type HSPCs. Thus, our work elucidates a molecular scenario of how myeloid bias arises and uncovers a point of intervention for correcting myeloid skewed hematopoiesis.",

          "abstract": "Early life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to physical and mental disorders lifelong. How ELA affects brain functions, leading to these vulnerabilities, is a mystery. To understand ELA’s impacts, investigations into neural activity affected by ELA must go beyond localized areas toward simultaneous recordings from multiple widely distributed regions over time. Such studies will expose relative activity between regions and discover shifts in regional activity in response to different experiences. Here, we performed longitudinal manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to measure degrees of brain-wide neural activity in ELA-exposed mice across a series of experiences in adulthood. To ascertain whether ELA resulted in atypical brain activity, results were compared to those of the standard mouse (Std). MEMRI captured activity in the freely moving home cage condition, and short- and long-term after exposure to TMT, a naturalistic predator threat. Images were normalized and aligned then analyzed with statistical mapping and automated segmentation. We found that neural activity in the home cage was greater in ELA compared to Std in multiple striatal-pallidal and hypothalamic regions. Upon acute threat, neural activity in Std increased in these regions to become more similar to that in ELA, while new hyperactive responses in ELA emerged in the midbrain and hindbrain. Nine days after acute threat, heightened neural activity in ELA persisted within locus coeruleus and increased within the posterior amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamus. These results reveal functional imbalances that arise between multiple brain-systems after ELA, which are dependent upon context and cumulative experiences into adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and is tightly controlled by signaling events in the flagellum. Slc9c1 encodes a sperm-specific Na + /H + exchanger (sNHE/SLC9C1) that localizes to the flagellum and is indispensable for sperm motility and male fertility. SLC9C1 is unique among Na + /H + exchangers in that it possesses a voltage-sensing domain (VSD), the physiological function of which remains poorly understood in mammals. Here, by analyzing coevolving genes with Slc9c1 , we identified Tmem217 , which encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized in the sperm flagellum. Knockout (KO) of Tmem217 in mice resulted in sperm motility defects and male infertility, phenocopying Slc9c1 KO mice. Coimmunoprecipitation and structural prediction analyses indicated that TMEM217 binds to SLC9C1 via its VSD. Further analyses indicated that the amounts of SLC9C1 and its associated protein, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), were lost in mature Tmem217 KO spermatozoa, leading to disrupted 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathways. Remarkably, cAMP analogs restored the impaired motility and fertilizing ability of Tmem217 KO spermatozoa in vitro, validating the essential role of TMEM217 in regulating cAMP production. Our findings indicate that the association of TMEM217 with SLC9C1 via its VSD is critical for the proper organization and function of the SLC9C1–sAC–cAMP axis in mature spermatozoa.",

          "abstract": "The emerging electrocatalytic C–N coupling reaction provides an attractive route toward green urea synthesis, but a lack of in-depth insight into the catalytic mechanism and the geometric/electronic configurations that determine the key C- and N-coupling intermediates formation hampers the exploration of efficient catalysts. Herein, we design a bimetallic oxide (Fe-Mo-O) with dual active sites of Fe and Mo for the adsorption and activation of NO 2 − and CO 2 , respectively. Constructing dual-metal catalyst leads to an upshift of the d-band center and the generation of an intermediate-spin Fe center, which not only favors the selective conversion of *CO 2 into the key intermediate *CO on Mo sites, but also facilitates the adsorption and reduction of NO 2 − on Fe sites. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations together elucidate that urea generation is associated with the formation of *CONH 2 intermediate by coupling *CO and *NH 2 on the alternating Mo and intermediate-spin Fe active sites, ultimately synergistically lowering the C–N coupling energy barrier. Specifically, the Fe-Mo-O catalyst delivers a high urea yield rate of 681.8 μg h −1 mg −1 cat. and an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 60% at −0.5 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, a C–N coupling paired with a glycerol oxidation system allows for energy-saving electrochemical coproduction of urea and formic acid. Our findings offer a feasible strategy to develop cutting-edge electrocatalysts for urea synthesis by active site design and electronic structure regulation.",

Given that M. tb, M. bovis, and M. orygis pose significant threats to the health of humans and animals, we sought to understand fundamental differences in pathogenicity among these closely related organisms. Building upon historical observations, we conducted a comparative virulence assessment of these pathogens using both bovine and murine infection models. Holstein calves were infected via aerosol with M. tb, M. bovis, or M. orygis , and pathology was analyzed through macroscopic and microscopic assessments of lungs and lymph nodes, along with quantitative tissue bacterial burden measurements. In C57BL/6 mice, we compared virulence using three readouts, namely survival, lethal dose determination, and detailed pathological assessments. Despite genomic similarity, animal-adapted MTBCs consistently showed dramatically enhanced virulence compared to M. tb with distinct immunopathology and, in the murine model, mortality within 24 days. Using gene disruption studies guided by proteomic comparisons, we determined that these infection outcomes were dependent on shared (ESAT-6) and lineage-associated (MPT70) virulence factors, the route of infection, and prior infection or immunization. Our findings reveal unexpected virulence hierarchies within the MTBC, with fundamental and translational implications for tuberculosis research.",

This interhemispheric exchange of information critically depends upon the corpus callosum. Classical anatomical descriptions of callosal organization outline a topographic gradient from front to back, such that specific transcallosal fibers support distinct aspects of integrated brain function. Here, we present a challenge to this conventional model. Using neuroimaging data obtained from a new cohort of adult corpus callosotomy patients, we leverage modern network neuroscience techniques to show that full interhemispheric integration can be achieved via a small proportion of posterior callosal fibers. Partial callosotomy patients with spared callosal fibers retained widespread patterns of interhemispheric functional connectivity and showed no signs of behavioral disconnection, even with only 1 cm of the splenium intact. Conversely, only complete callosotomy patients demonstrated sweeping disruptions of interhemispheric network architectures, aligning with disconnection syndromes long-thought to reflect diminished information propagation and communication across the brain. These findings motivate an evolving mechanistic understanding of synchronized interhemispheric neural activity for large-scale human brain function and behavior.",

          "abstract": "Primary production in the ocean is a fundamental process that supports marine food webs and global carbon sequestration. This process depends on nutrients that are often limited in surface waters. Whales are known to release essential elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron, yet the extent of their contribution to ocean primary production remains unclear. Here, we present daily estimates of nutrient input by baleen whales in high-latitude feeding grounds (Nordic and Barents Seas), based on multielement analyses of feces and urine. We then used end-to-end ecosystem models to assess the impact of these nutrients on primary production. We found that nitrogen is primarily excreted via urine, whereas phosphorus and trace elements are mainly released through feces. Ecosystem models indicate that baleen whales, including minke, fin, sei, humpback, blue, and bowhead whales, support annual and seasonal net primary production, with varying impacts across space and time. While the annual effects are modest (&lt;2%) in most areas, the greatest impacts (up to 10%) occur during summer stratification and in offshore areas far from other nutrient sources. These increases in primary production have cascading effects on the food web, driving rises in mesozooplankton biomass. This study highlights the ecological significance of nutrient cycling by whales and underscores the value of integrating whale nutrient data into ecosystem modeling to assess the broader impacts of whales on marine productivity.",

The model relies solely on simulated data rather than well-registered real data pairs, and is trained to descatter and restore hidden spatial information at greater depths. Quantitative evaluations on simulated fluorescent beads and vasculature show significant performance improvements in peak signal-to-noise ratio (23 to 29 dB) and structural similarity index (23×) compared to the raw data. We also apply the framework to various ex vivo and in vivo experiments, achieving clear visualization of lipid droplets up to a depth of 1,300 μm and of vascular structure and astrocytes up to 950 μm and 500 μm, respectively, in live mouse brains at lower excitation powers.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade, the connection between physics and topology has resulted in the discovery of several new phenomena. A celebrated example is the field of topological insulators [X.-L. Qi, S.-C. Zhang, Rev. Mod. Phys. 83 , 1057–1110 (2011)]., in which topological quantities describing the bulk medium response in reciprocal space dictate the presence of protected transport states at the boundary of a finite sample. Broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of a material play a prominent role in determining its topological features relevant to these phenomena. As another landmark phenomenon driven by broken symmetries, twistronics leverages the rotation angle between coupled layers to control in extreme ways the dispersion topology, leading to flat-band superconductivity [Y. Cao et al. , Nature 556 , 43–50 (2018)] and topological transitions for polaritons [G. Hu et al. , Nature 582 , 209–213 (2020)]. Here, we apply these concepts to elastodynamic waves, and exploit the twist degree-of-freedom to control broken symmetries in the microscopic structure of elastic metasurfaces, demonstrating extreme wave control. We predict and experimentally demonstrate topological transitions within twisted elastodynamic metasurfaces, which we harness for broadband, reconfigurable, and robust manipulation of phonons. Our twist-elastic approach opens alternative directions in microelectronics, microfluidics, and ultrasound sensing, leveraging precise multifunctional engineering of mechanical vibrations of relevance to many modern technologies.",

While treatments targeting AChR autoantibodies benefit many, some patients remain refractory, highlighting the need for personalized therapies. This study evaluates the therapeutic potential of S-1117, a pan-IgG-specific protease, in AChR autoantibody-mediated pathology. Using live cell-based assays, we examined AChR-specific monoclonal IgG autoantibodies (mAbs) and patient-derived serum samples for their effects on receptor binding, blockade, internalization, and complement activation, before and after treatment with S-1117. S-1117 effectively removed the crystallizable fragment (Fc)γ from both mAbs and serum IgG, impairing Fcγ-mediated complement activation in both soluble and antigen-bound forms. In cases with partial complement reduction, AChR-specific IgM contributed to complement deposition. AChR-IgM acted in concert with IgG in some patients to enhance complement deposition, while acting as main complement driver in others. An IgM-specific protease completely suppressed the pathogenic effects of AChR-IgM in two independent patient cohorts. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of S-1117 in neutralizing AChR-IgG Fcγ-mediated effector functions and reveal an MG subset driven by IgM pathology. Our study shows that targeting both IgG- and IgM-mediated mechanisms with therapeutic proteases provides an approach to MG treatment and establishes a framework for patient stratification based on disease mechanisms, advancing precision medicine in MG.",

TMEM16F-mediated PS scrambling polarized macrophages to an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype, which promotes TGF-β1 secretion and regulatory T cell expansion to suppress cytotoxic lymphocytes. Genetic ablation of TMEM16F abolished PS exposure, systemically reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment and primary immune organs toward immune activation, and suppressed tumor growth across cancer models. Pharmacological scramblase inhibition produced these effects, demonstrating therapeutic potential.

          "abstract": "Despite extensive genetic heterogeneity, 72% of pathogenic alleles for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) arise from coding and regulatory variants in genes of the RET and EDNRB gene regulatory network (GRN) in the enteric nervous system (ENS). To elucidate the mechanisms leading to enteric neuronal loss from these genetic defects, we generated four strains of mice carrying reduced function alleles at Ret or Ednrb or both, along with their wild-type alleles. ENS tissue- and single-cell gene expression profiling of the developing and postnatal gastrointestinal tract in these five mouse models revealed three major insights: i) Ret and Ednrb deficiency, rather than complete loss, is sufficient to induce HSCR, ii) Ret and Ednrb demonstrate strong trans interactions, and iii) disruption of this interaction leads to cellular fate changes to compensate for neuronal loss. Critically, we show the combined reduction of signaling of these two receptors below a threshold in enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs) leads to a molecular tipping point at which otherwise lesser cellular defects result in aganglionosis. This study of targeted mouse models of a multifactorial disorder reveals how increasing dosage of genetic defects within a GRN leads to quantifiably increasing dysregulation from genotype to gene expression to cellular identity to function. Importantly, our studies establish that aganglionosis results only with severely reduced gene expression at both receptor genes and their consequent disruption of normal and compensatory cell fate trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The role of HIF2α, encoded by EPAS1 , in neuroblastoma remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate that induction of high levels of HIF2α in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells results in a rapid and profound reduction of the oncoprotein MYCN. This is followed by an upregulation of genes characteristic of noradrenergic cells in the adrenal medulla. Additionally, upon induction of HIF2α, the proliferation rate drops substantially, and cells develop elongated neurite-like protrusions, indicative of differentiation. In vivo HIF2α induction in established xenografts significantly attenuates tumor growth. Notably, analysis of sequenced neuroblastoma patient samples, revealed a negative correlation between EPAS1 and MYCN expression and a strong positive correlation between EPAS1 expression, high expression levels of noradrenergic markers, and improved patient outcome. This was paralleled by analysis of human developing adrenal medulla datasets wherein EPAS1 expression was prominent in populations with high expression levels of genes characteristic of noradrenergic chromaffin cells. Our findings show that high levels of HIF2α in neuroblastoma, leads to drastically reduced MYCN protein levels, cell cycle exit, and noradrenergic cell differentiation. Taken together, our results challenge the dogma that HIF2α acts as an oncogene in neuroblastoma.",

However, decision makers make systematic errors when processing these graphs, with important consequences for statistical communication in science, medicine, and policy. We propose that decision makers are Bayesian learners, who learn optimally given the data points that they attend to. Accordingly, judgment errors arise from biased sampling of information from graphs. We tested our theory in four eye-tracking experiments (total N = 421), in which participants made correlation judgments from scatterplots of both experimentally manipulated data (Experiment 1) and real data (Experiment 2), as well as plots with different display formats (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants’ judgments displayed several known biases, including underestimation of absolute correlations and sensitivity to irrelevant visual features. Importantly, the (optimal) Bayesian belief updating model, trained on the sensory inputs from visual information search, predicted both participants’ judgments and associated biases with high accuracy in all the experiments. Additionally, a computational model of participants’ information sampling processes, combined with the Bayesian model, reproduced all behavioral regularities. These results shed light on the cognitive mechanisms of belief formation, show how statistical judgments can be quantitatively predicted and manipulated, and provide insights for data visualization and statistical communication.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While robust methods to monitor gene transcription are widespread, the visualization of proteins in vivo is more elusive. To meet this challenge, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag functions well in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types in intact animals. To identify optimal DogTag insertions into CSPs, we describe a flow cytometry–based platform for rapidly screening candidates in vitro. We demonstrate the ability to tag and visualize three members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) in vivo: the transmembrane protein mCD8 and two GPI-anchored proteins belonging to the DIP-Dpr interactome that interact biophysically to facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular and brain synapses. FETCH enables precise temporal and spatial control to visualize tagged proteins in vivo, features that are adaptable to a multitude of applications for modifying any cell surface protein.",

Mechanistically, mutant p53 enhances RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell contractility and cell-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) reorganization via increasing mevalonate pathway–dependent RhoA localization to the membrane. In line with this, RhoA-dependent proinvasive activity is also mediated by IDI-1, a mevalonate pathway product. Further, the invasion-enhancing effect of mutant p53 is dictated by the biomechanical properties of the surrounding ECM, thereby adding a cell-independent layer of regulation to mutant p53 GOF activity that is mediated by dynamic reciprocal cell–ECM interactions. Together our findings link mutant p53 metabolic GOF activity with a context-dependent invasive cellular phenotype.",

Eight Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps) are encoded in the Drosophila genome; whether these Dilps respond uniformly to changes in dietary nutrients is unknown. Here, we investigate the endocrine responses of Dilp2, secreted by brain insulin-producing cells, and Dilp6, produced by the fat body, to dietary sugar and protein in mid-third instar Drosophila larvae. Starvation leads to a profound reduction in circulating Dilp2 without affecting circulating Dilp6 levels. Diets containing sugar alone drive nutrient storage and increase hemolymph Dilp6, but do not promote Dilp2 release. In contrast, dietary protein drives growth and restores hemolymph Dilp2 but strongly reduces circulating Dilp6. Furthermore, circulating levels of Dilp2 and Dilp6 are modulated by the ratio of sugar to protein in the diet. We find that depleting circulating Dilp6 via fat body specific knockdown or increasing insulin receptor (InR) levels in fat body leads to increased levels of triglyceride storage but decreased peripheral growth. Our results suggest that Dilp6, a hormone produced in response to dietary sugar, may direct the use of sugar for growth instead of fat storage at the end stage of larval development. Our findings reveal different modes of regulation for Dilp2 and Dilp6 and raise the question of how the single known Drosophila InR integrates divergent signals from distinct Dilps to control growth and metabolism.",

          "abstract": "A theory of solutions of charged polyelectrolyte (PE) macromolecules, treating them as electric dipoles, is proposed. In a thin thread of PE solution sustained between two disks—whether wettable or nonwettable—these dipoles are reoriented by an axial electric field, aligning themselves with the field direction. This alignment causes significant axial elastic stresses and affects capillary self-thinning dynamics of the thread, slowing the process and potentially arresting it entirely, and even leading to oscillatory regimes. Accordingly, the evolution of the thread radius deviates significantly from the exponential decay characteristic of solutions of flexible polymer macromolecules and the linear decay characteristic of Newtonian fluids. At relatively high electric field strengths, in a thread where elastic stresses become dominant, an oscillatory regime emerges. Here, the cross-sectional radius not only decreases but also increases and oscillates in time—a behavior rooted in an ill-posedness of the problem reducing to the Laplace equation in case of strong electric fields. This indicates a manifestation of Hadamard instability. The theory is supported by experimental data acquired in this work.",

          "abstract": "The T cell receptor (TCR), a master regulator of adaptive immunity, serves as a molecular transducer that converts antigen recognition into precisely modulated intracellular signals, orchestrating both T cell development and effector functions. In this study, we leveraged a germline CD3ε I173A mutation, a previously characterized alteration that amplifies TCR signaling through the disruption of inhibitory lipid interactions, to dissect how thymocyte-intrinsic TCR signaling amplification influences the fate of mature T cells. Remarkably, thymic double-positive cells in CD3ε I173A mice with altered TCR repertoires demonstrated a significant downregulation of the phosphatidylserine decarboxylase homolog gene AC149090.1 . This modulation triggered a comprehensive rewiring of lipid metabolic pathways, establishing a systemic compensatory mechanism to counterbalance excessive TCR signaling. These metabolic adaptations culminated in functionally compromised mature T cells, characterized by diminished activation potential, reduced proliferative capacity, and impaired antitumor efficacy in CD3ε I173A mice. Our results underscore the critical role of thymic TCR signaling in T cell development for sustaining immune homeostasis and orchestrating mature T cell functionality, unveiling the lipid metabolic plasticity during thymocyte development that acts as a critical regulatory checkpoint for maintaining immune homeostasis.",

NADK2, a chloroplast-localized NAD kinase, supplies NADP + to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant of NADK2 ( nadk2 ) exhibits a reduced NADP + /NAD + ratio, slow growth, and pale green leaves. To gain further insights into NAD(P)(H) metabolism in chloroplasts, nadk2 revertant mutants ( nkr ) were screened from the M2 generation of EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate)-treated nadk2 seeds. Among them, nkr1 displayed greener leaves and improved growth compared to nadk2 . Genetic mapping and genomic sequencing identified At3g18500 ( CCR4C ) as the causal gene. The nkr1 mutant carried a single nucleotide substitution, introducing a stop codon within the predicted N-terminal chloroplast localization signal, resulting in the loss of CCR4C protein function. The nadk2 ccr4c double mutant restored leaf color and growth to near wild-type levels. To investigate the function of CCR4C, recombinant CCR4C protein was purified and shown to directly convert NADP(H) to NAD(H). Localization analysis with CCR4C-GFP fusion proteins confirmed chloroplast targeting. Furthermore, ccr4c single mutants exhibited disrupted NAD(P)(H) balance and enhanced tolerance to ROS stress (e.g., H 2 O 2 , methyl viologen). These findings reveal CCR4C as a chloroplast-localized NADP(H) phosphatase crucial for maintaining NAD(P)(H) balance, providing insights into how plant cells manage chloroplast metabolism.",

While Earth’s meteorite collection serves as a key reference for material flux in the Earth–Moon system, it suffers from profound biases arising from Earth’s orbital dynamics and atmospheric filtering. Systematic identification and classification of meteorites on the airless Moon thus provide additional critical constraints for reconstructing the primordial accretion history and impactor population of the inner Solar System. However, identifying impactors on the Moon remains challenging due to their vaporization upon colliding at high velocities with the lunar surface. In situ remote sensing has previously detected chondritic impactor materials in the South-Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin of the far side of the Moon. The first opportunity to measure materials from the SPA basin has come via the Chang’e-6 (CE-6) mission, which returned samples from the Apollo basin inside the SPA basin. In this study, we screened seven olivine-porphyritic clasts as potential impactor relics in regolith returned by the CE-6 mission. These clasts were identified, via textural characterization, olivine Fe–Mn–Zn systematics, and in-situ triple oxygen isotopes, as impact relics solidified from melted chondritic parent bodies. Intriguingly, the parent body of all the identified impactor relics in this study resemble CI-like chondrites, a volatile-rich meteorite group that is relatively rare in Earth’s meteorite collection. The detection and classification of these impactor relics impose significant constraints on the proportions of meteoritic materials in the Earth–Moon system and their potential contributions to water inventories on the lunar surface.",

We report elevated cytosolic levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in neutrophils from patients with severe and critical COVID-19, correlating with enhanced NADPH oxidase–dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Using T2AA, a small-molecule inhibitor of the PCNA scaffold, we demonstrate potent suppression of NADPH oxidase activation and NET release, particularly in response to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Mechanistically, we identify a previously unrecognized interaction between PCNA and the heterodimeric S100A8/S100A9 (calprotectin), predominantly enriched in CD16 high CD62L low neutrophils expanded during COVID-19. PCNA binds the dimeric S100A8/S100A9 complex mediated via S100A8 subunit with micromolar affinity, and this interaction is abrogated by tetramerization, suggesting regulation by intracellular calcium. Disruption of this complex by T2AA inhibited ROS production in an S100A8/S100A9-dependent manner, implicating calprotectin as a functional regulator of neutrophil activation. In a betacoronavirus mouse model, T2AA treatment attenuated lung inflammation, reduced NET and calprotectin levels, and shifted pulmonary neutrophils away from hyperactivated and immunosuppressive phenotypes, consistent with immune reprogramming toward resolution. These findings establish cytosolic PCNA as a central scaffold in neutrophil hyperactivation during COVID-19 and highlight its pharmacological disruption as a promising host-directed strategy to limit inflammation and prevent organ damage.",

Early visual areas, however, are known to encode retinotopic positions, and how these representations get transformed into a position-invariant neural code remains unclear. Building upon a computational model of reading, we used 7T functional MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1–V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the visual word form area, transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60 to 200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220 to 450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured prelexical representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.",

However, diffusible antibacterial proteins (ABPs) that share this broad-spectrum activity are not known to exist. Here, we report a family of proteins widespread in gram-positive bacteria that display potent antibacterial activity against a diverse range of target organisms. Upon entering susceptible cells, these ABPs enzymatically degrade essential cellular components including DNA, transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA), and ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). Unlike previously characterized bactericidal proteins, which require a specific cell surface receptor and therefore display a narrow spectrum of activity, we find that ABPs act in a receptor-independent manner and consequently kill bacteria spanning multiple phyla. Target cell entry by ABPs requires proteolytic activation by a cognate, coexported serine protease, and the liberated toxin component of the cleaved ABP is driven across the target cell membrane by the proton motive force. By examining representative ABPs from diverse pathogenic, commensal, and environmental bacteria, we show that broad-spectrum antibacterial activity is a conserved property of this protein family. Collectively, our work demonstrates that secreted proteins can act as broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that ABPs represent one of potentially many such families produced in nature.",

Reconstructing pollinator historic demographies provides an evolutionary perspective to understand contemporary population declines. The Franklin bumble bee ( Bombus franklini ), once endemic to Oregon and California and last observed alive in 2006, is emblematic of this phenomenon. We collected whole-genome sequence data from museum specimens spanning four decades to elucidate the genetic and demographic history of this potentially extinct species. Heterozygosity estimates of 25 individuals were remarkably low, and runs of homozygosity (ROH) patterns identified short segments suggestive of historical inbreeding, with some individuals having almost entire chromosomes in ROH. Demographic reconstructions revealed a marked decline in effective population size beginning in the late Pleistocene, with further declines in the last 400 y, which may have been influenced by fire and drought stressors. We found little to no genomic evidence implicating pathogens in the species’ decline and used coalescent simulations to show that we would be able to detect recently reduced heterozygosity only when colony-level survival rates are 15 to 30%. We conclude that a combination of historically low effective population size and genetic diversity along with environmental stochasticity heightened this species’ extinction vulnerability prior to recent anthropogenic stressors. This study demonstrates the utility of museum collections for clarifying genetic and demographic dynamics of rare species and suggests that B. franklini may have already been on a trajectory of decline prior to human impacts.",

However, the precise mechanism of native gold formation associated with organic matter remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate gold precipitation at oil–water interfaces through in situ thermal experiments using various combinations of oil and HAuCl 4 -bearing solutions. Our results reveal that gold particles form spontaneously following the extensive generation and evolution of water microdroplets at oil–water interfaces at temperatures of 140 to 400 °C. We propose that electrons (e − ), released from the conversion of hydroxide ions (OH − ) to hydroxyl radicals (·OH) in water microdroplets, together with H atoms (·H) formed through electron transfer involving H 3 O + , and spontaneously generated H 2 O 2 from·OH recombination, drive the reduction of Au 3+ to Au 0 . The atomic gold progressively aggregates into Au 0 clusters and Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), ultimately forming micrometer-scale gold particles and wires. This precipitation process occurs within minutes at temperatures above 350 °C and within hours below 200 °C. The experimentally produced gold particles exhibit textures like those in natural ore deposits. This interfacial microdroplet–induced mechanism provides a unique perspective on native gold formation in hydrocarbon-rich geosystems. Beyond its geological significance, this mechanism offers a potentially simplified approach for gold recovery from electronic waste without the need to introduce complex adsorbents or reducing agents into the waste stream.",

To investigate this issue, we screened libraries of ~100 million short (semi-)random sequences, mimicking early stages of gene birth, for genes that promote Escherichia coli survival during phage infection. This selection uncovered thousands of functional genes that confer viral resistance through at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) activation of a bacterial regulatory system that remodels the outer membrane, which provides broad-spectrum defense, and 2) transcriptional repression of bacterial outer membrane receptors required for phage adsorption, which provides phage-specific protection. Remarkably, unrelated random genes with no sequence similarity produced similar protective phenotypes, revealing that diverse sequences can converge on equivalent functions. We further showed that T4 phage rapidly evolves to counter these novel defenses, acquiring baseplate mutations that enhance adsorption to resistant hosts. Together, these findings demonstrate that random sequences can rapidly evolve into functional genes with direct fitness benefit, highlighting the evolutionary potential of de novo gene birth in the microbial world.",

In this work, we study this issue from both an economic and an algorithmic point of view, focusing on a phenomenon that reduces barriers to entry. Specifically, an incumbent company risks reputational damage unless its model is sufficiently aligned with safety objectives, whereas a new company can more easily avoid reputational damage. To study this issue formally, we define a multi-objective high-dimensional regression framework that captures reputational damage, and we characterize the number of data points that a new company needs to enter the market. Our results demonstrate how multi-objective considerations can fundamentally reduce barriers to entry—the required number of data points can be significantly smaller than the incumbent company’s dataset size. En route to proving these results, we develop scaling laws for high-dimensional linear regression in multi-objective environments, showing that the scaling rate becomes slower when the dataset size is large, which could be of independent interest.",

Here, we presented a composite acoustic metamaterial that replaces the high-stiffness neck of a Helmholtz resonator with a soft, viscoelastic cylindrical shell. This structural modification enables material deformation and shifts the dominant energy dissipation mechanism from air resonance to intrinsic viscoelastic damping. A single unit achieves over 97% absorption across a broad low-frequency range (227 to 329 Hz) with deep-subwavelength thickness (λ/15 at 227 Hz). We developed a discretized impedance model that quantitatively links material properties and geometry to absorption behavior.

However, interactions between Fe nutrition of microbes, including both heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton, and viral lysis are not well known. Here, we present viral infection dynamics under Fe-limited and Fe-replete conditions for isolates of three types of marine picoplankton, the photosynthetic picoeukaryote Ostreococcus , the cyanobacterium Synechococcus , and the heterotrophic bacterium Vibrio . Iron limitation of Ostreococcus resulted in slowed growth and reduced viral burst sizes; this is similar to prior results from studies of larger eukaryotic phytoplankton, where reduced viral replication under Fe limitation is attributed to the viral reliance on host metabolism and replication machinery. Fe limitation of one Vibrio impacted dynamics of its virus similarly, lengthening the latent period before infected cells burst to release new viruses, and reducing the number of infective particles released upon lysis. In contrast, for another Vibrio isolate, Fe limitation had no discernible effect on replication of its virus. Furthermore, dynamics of three cyanophages that infect the same Synechococcus isolate were not affected by Fe limitation of the host, either in terms of latent period or burst size. The results show that some marine viruses, particularly cyanophages, can replicate efficiently even when host growth is compromised.

Effective bindings between T cell receptors (TCRs) and pathogen derived peptides presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) mediate immune responses. However, predicting these interactions remains challenging due to limited functional data on T cell reactivities. Here, we introduce a computational approach to predict TCR interactions with peptides presented on MHC-I alleles, and to design immunogenic peptides for specified TCR–MHC complexes. Our method leverages HERMES, a structure-based machine learning model trained on the protein universe to predict amino acid preferences based on local structural environments. Despite no direct training on TCR-pMHC data, HERMES’s implicit physical reasoning enables us to make accurate predictions of both TCR–pMHC binding affinities and T cell activities across diverse viral and cancer epitopes, achieving up to 0.72 correlation with experimental data. Leveraging our TCR recognition model, we develop a computational protocol for de novo design of immunogenic peptides. Through experimental validation in three TCR–MHC systems, we demonstrate that our designs—with up to five substitutions from the native sequence—activate T cells at success rates of up to 50%. Last, we use our generative framework to quantify the diversity of the peptide recognition landscape for various TCR–MHC’s, offering key insights into T cell specificity. Our approach provides a platform for immunogenic peptide and neoantigen design, as well as for evaluating TCR specificity, offering a computational framework to inform design of engineered T cell therapies and vaccines.",

Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation.

          "abstract": "The pace and trajectory of ecosystem development are governed by the availability and cycling of limiting nutrients, and anthropogenic disturbances such as acid rain and deforestation alter these trajectories by removing substantial quantities of nutrients via titration or harvest. Here, we use six decades of continuous chemical and hydrologic data from three adjacent headwater catchments in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire—one deforested (W5), one CaSiO 3 -enriched (W1), and one reference (W6)—to quantify long-term nutrient and mineral fluxes. Acid deposition since 1900 drove pronounced depletion and export of base cations, particularly calcium, across all watersheds. Experimental deforestation of W5 intensified loss of biomass and nutrient cations and triggered sustained increases in streamwater pH, Ca 2+ , and SiO 2 exports over nearly four decades, greatly exceeding the effects of direct CaSiO 3 enrichment in both duration and magnitude. We detect no long-term changes in water yield or water flow paths in the experimental watersheds, and we attribute this multidecadal increase in weathering rates following deforestation to biological responses to severe nutrient limitation. Our evidence suggests that in the regrowing forest, plants are investing photosynthate into belowground processes that amplify mineral weathering to access phosphorus and micronutrients, consequently elevating the export of less limiting elements present in silicate parent material. Throughout decades of forest regrowth, enhanced biotic weathering has continued to deplete the acid buffering capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem while the export of weathering products has elevated the pH of the receiving stream.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how bacteria interact with surfaces is critical for advancing applications in biofilm and biofouling prevention, biomaterial development, or biosensing. However, the biophysical mechanisms underlying these interactions remain poorly characterized, and novel microscopy strategies are needed to specifically address the biointerface. In this study, we employ fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with the tension reporter Flipper-TR to investigate membrane tension in live bacteria interacting with various surfaces. We show that Flipper-TR stains both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial membranes, exhibiting fluorescence lifetimes shorter than those in eukaryotic cells, with slight variations between bacterial types and likely reflecting differences in membrane composition. Flipper-TR displays lifetime variations along the vertical axis of bacterial cells, suggesting spatial differences in membrane tension influenced by cell wall architecture. Our results further demonstrate that Flipper-TR is responsive to the nature of bacterial interactions with surfaces. By comparing bacterial immobilization on surfaces with different coatings, we show that Flipper-TR can sensitively distinguish differences in membrane tension arising from distinct adhesion mechanisms. Additionally, Flipper-TR detects changes in membrane tension when bacteria are exposed to engineered nanostructured substrates. Overall, this work expands the toolbox to study the mechanical aspects of bacterial–material interactions and contributes to providing design rules for novel materials that influence bacterial behavior.",

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate estimation of protein–ligand binding affinities is crucial for early-stage drug discovery, yet hindered by a trade-off between the accuracy of gold-standard physics-based methods and the speed of simpler empirical scoring functions. Machine learning (ML) promised to bridge this gap, but its potential is unrealized due to limited model generalizability. Current ML models often fail when predicting affinities for novel proteins or chemical series unseen during training. We hypothesize that this failure stems from a competition within these models during training, where the learning of spurious correlations from structural motifs prevalent in the training data competes with the learning of transferable, physicochemical principles governing molecular interaction. Here, we introduce COnvolutional Representation of Distance-dependent Interactions with Attention Learning (CORDIAL), a deep learning framework designed with an inductive bias toward learning the distance-dependent physicochemical interaction signatures between proteins and ligands, explicitly avoiding direct parameterization of their chemical structures. This interaction-only approach proves effective. Through leave-superfamily-out validation that simulates encounters with novel protein families, we demonstrate that CORDIAL maintains predictive performance and calibration. This contrasts with diverse contemporary ML models, whose predictive ability is degraded under these conditions. Our results highlight the value of encoding appropriate task-specific physicochemical principles into ML architectures and offer a validated strategy for developing generalizable models for structure-based drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "Puberty is a critical transition period to achieve reproductive capacity in all mammalian species. At puberty, hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons release kisspeptin, stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release and activating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Here, we show that Kiss1 neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus ( Kiss1 ARC ) of female mice undergo profound intrinsic plasticity at puberty. Kiss1 ARC neurons in brain slices from 3-wk-old mice, when depolarized, typically fire a short high-frequency burst of action potentials before falling silent. This would make them unsuitable for the sustained activity that is required to activate pulsatile GnRH secretion and the HPG axis. At 4 wk of age and after puberty, Kiss1 ARC neurons can fire a sustained train of action potentials. There is a concomitant hyperpolarization in action potential threshold and postspike minimum voltage and larger medium after-hyperpolarizations (mAHP) and hyperpolarization-induced voltage sags. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant changes in ion channel expression after puberty. Using quantitative PCR, we confirmed changes in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium, calcium, potassium, and cation channels. Blocking hyperpolarization-induced cation channels caused Kiss1 ARC neurons from postpuberty mice to fire less sustained trains of action potentials. Recordings from Kiss1 ARC neurons in mice after ovariectomy and 17β-estradiol replacement revealed a critical window of estrogen-dependent plasticity between 3 and 6 wk, which is essential for the maturation of Kiss1 ARC neurons and the development of their adult electrophysiological activity. This represents an example of sex steroid–dependent plasticity in the mammalian brain at puberty.",

When amino acids are abundant, it binds to the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 to activate cellular programs for growth and proliferation. In its functional cycle, besides local conformational changes near the nucleotides that are commonly observed in monomeric signaling GTPases, the relative positioning of the two Rag subunits, i.e., the global conformation, is unique due to the heterodimeric architecture. Although various global conformations have been captured in static structural models, dynamic transitions between these conformations and their biological relevance remain unclear. Here, we visualize the global conformation of the Rag GTPase heterodimer using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. By tracking the movement of individual protein molecules, we found that the two subunits explore a wide conformational space, which is strictly dictated by the bound nucleotides, regulators, and mutations. Additionally, we demonstrate that proper modulation of the global conformation is crucial for correctly interpreting amino acid signals.

          "abstract": "Cullin Ring E3 Ligases (CRLs) belong to the largest family of multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligases. A cullin serves as the scaffold protein that recruits E3 ligases and substrate receptors in a CRL complex, whose activity requires cullin neddylation, a posttranslational modification that can be pharmacologically targeted by neddylation inhibitors. Elevated neddylation activity has been observed in the liver and adipose tissue of obese mice, implicating a pathogenic link between altered CRL activity and the development of metabolic disorders. Emerging evidence has also shown that neddylation inhibitors possess antiobesity and hypoglycemic property. However, the roles of cullin proteins in regulating adipocyte biology are still incompletely defined. Here, we report that pan neddylation inhibitor TAS4464 treatment reversed obesity and adipose inflammation, resulting in improved hepatic steatosis and insulin sensitivity in obese mice. Among all mammalian cullin proteins that were targeted by TAS4464, we identified that cullin 3 (Cul3) was required for adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy. A complete absence of Cul3 in adipocytes caused severely inhibited adipose expansion associated with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver and brown adipose tissue and insulin resistance, while adipocyte-specific Cul3 haploinsufficiency attenuated obesity and improved overall metabolic homeostasis, which recapitulated the metabolic benefits of TAS4464. Mechanistically, we found that Cul3 inhibition caused adipose nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) stabilization, which contributed to impaired adipogenesis by inhibiting lipogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that Cul3 is required during adipogenesis and acts as a downstream mediator of the antiobesity effect of pan neddylation inhibitors.",

          "abstract": "Bone pain is a presenting feature of bone cancers such as osteosarcoma (OS), relayed by skeletal-innervating peripheral afferent neurons. Potential functions of tumor-associated sensory neurons in bone cancers beyond pain sensation are unknown. To uncover neural regulatory functions, a chemical-genetic approach in mice with a knock-in allele for TrkA was used to functionally perturb sensory nerve innervation during OS growth and disease progression. TrkA inhibition in transgenic mice led to significant reductions in sarcoma-associated sensory innervation and vascularization, skewed tumor associated macrophage polarization, reduced tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged overall survival. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that sarcoma denervation was associated with phenotypic alterations in both OS tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment, and with reduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. Multimodal and multiomics analyses of human OS bone samples further implicated peripheral innervation and neurotrophin signaling in OS tumor biology. Next and in two parallel approaches to inhibit nerve ingrowth, we repurposed FDA-approved bupivacaine liposomes and separately blocked CGRP signaling using FDA-approved Rimegepant. Both strategies led to significant reductions in sarcoma growth, vascularity, and sarcoma-induced hyperalgesia. In sum, TrkA-expressing peripheral neurons positively regulate key aspects of OS progression and sensory neural inhibition disrupts CGRP signaling within the sarcoma microenvironment leading to significantly reduced tumor growth and improved survival. These data suggest that interventions to prevent pathological innervation of OS represent an adjunctive therapy to improve clinical outcomes and survival.",

The mechanisms regulating CMS protein accumulation remain unclear. Here, we explored this process using wild-abortive CMS (CMS-WA) rice ( Oryza sativa ). We show that WA352, the causal protein of CMS-WA, is degraded by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). Structural analysis and protein truncation assays revealed that the N terminus of WA352 is critical for its anchoring to the inner mitochondrial membrane and its UPS-mediated degradation. Functional complementation confirmed that WA352 151–352 , lacking the N-terminal domain, accumulates constitutively in vegetative tissues, causing a reactive oxygen species burst and retarding rice growth. We further identified three mitochondrion-localized F-box proteins that participate in WA352 ubiquitination and degradation. Our findings demonstrate that UPS-mediated regulation restricts WA352 accumulation to anthers, allowing it to specifically disrupt anther development, thus helping to explain the male-specific effects of CMS genes in plants.",

          "abstract": "In arthropods, bacterial infection activates dual oxidase 2 (Duox2) to produce extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), while stimulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) through immune deficiency (Imd)/Relish pathway. Although both strategies contribute significantly to antibacterial immunity, the Duox2/ROS system and Relish/AMPs pathway are generally considered separate branches. In the present study, we report that these two branches are connected by an aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) in a crustacean, the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii . Aqp4 is found to be critical for the crayfish antibacterial response. The significance of Aqp4 is achieved by transporting extracellular ROS into the intracellular compartment after bacterial infection. The increase in intracellular ROS levels, mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase, promotes the nuclear translocation and thereby the transcriptional activity of FoxO. As the key transcription factor of Relish, FoxO regulates the upregulation of Relish and ultimately the expression of Relish-targeting AMPs. By linking ROS production to AMP expression, the sequential ROS/Aqp4/FoxO/Relish/AMPs axis makes a relatively significant, yet previously unnoticed, contribution to the antibacterial response. Therefore, this study reveals the intriguing association between ROS production and AMP expression, the two central antibacterial strategies and provides insights into the regulatory mechanisms of arthropod immunity.",

          "abstract": "Animals navigate their environment stably without inefficient course corrections despite unavoidable errors. In humans, this stability is achieved by modulating the placement of the foot on each step such that recent errors are corrected. However, it is unknown whether animals with diverse nervous systems and body mechanics use such foot placement control; foot trajectories of many-legged animals are considered to be stereotypical velocity-driven patterns, as opposed to error-driven. Here, we put forth a unified “feedforward-feedback” control structure for stable locomotion that combines velocity-driven and body state error-driven foot placement. We provide empirical support for this control structure across flies, mice, and humans by mining their natural locomotor variability, finding that a competing control structure with purely velocity-driven foot placement is not supported by the data. This work finds shared behavioral signatures of foot placement control in flies, mice, and humans. We find that key characteristics of these signatures, such as their urgency and centralization, vary with neuromechanical embodiment across species. For example, more inherently stable multilegged animals exhibit less urgent control with a lower control magnitude and a slower correction timescale compared to humans. Furthermore, many-legged animals display modular, direction-, and leg-specific control signatures, whereas humans exhibit common signatures across both legs. Overall, our findings provide insight into stable locomotion across species, revealing how species with diverse neuromechanics achieve a shared functional goal: foot placement control.",

Previous studies have suggested that cortical disinhibition is a feature of PD, but there has been little direct evidence of the changes in cortical neuronal spiking activity to support this hypothesis. To test the hypothesis that activity in the motor cortex is enhanced in PD, we investigated the effects of parkinsonism on movement-related neuronal activity in the primary motor cortex (M1). Microelectrode arrays were chronically implanted in M1 of two nonhuman primates and populations of cells were collected before and after the induction of parkinsonism using the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. In both animals, we found that during the reaching task in the parkinsonian state, the proportion of M1 neurons that were activated (excited) during movement were increased, while those that were suppressed (inhibited) decreased. These data support the concept that dopaminergic loss in parkinsonism promotes a loss of inhibition in the motor cortex, leading to overactivity in M1 and a disruption in spatial-temporal processing of information within the BGTC circuit that contributes to the motor dysfunction observed in PD.",

          "abstract": "Signaling pathways induce stereotyped transcriptional changes as stem cells progress into mature cell types during embryogenesis. Signaling perturbations are necessary to discover which genes are responsive or insensitive to pathway activity. However, gene regulation is additionally dependent on cell state-specific factors like chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding. Thus, transcriptional profiles need to be assayed in single cells to identify potentially multiple, distinct perturbation responses among heterogeneous cell states in an embryo. In perturbation studies, comparing heterogeneous transcriptional states among experimental conditions often requires samples to be collected over multiple independent experiments, which can introduce confounding batch effects. We present Design-Aware Integration of Single Cell ExpEriments (DAISEE), a new algorithm that models perturbation responses in single-cell datasets collected according to complex experimental designs. We demonstrate that DAISEE improves upon a previously available integrative nonnegative matrix factorization framework, more efficiently separating perturbation responses from confounding variation. We use DAISEE to integrate newly collected single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from 5-h-old zebrafish embryos expressing optimized photoswitchable MEK (psMEK), which globally activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule involved in many cell specification events. psMEK drives some cells that are normally not exposed to ERK signals toward other wild type states and induces novel states expressing early-acting endothelial genes. Overactive signaling is therefore capable of producing unexpected gene expression states in developing embryos.",

We used cryoelectron microscopy to structurally interrogate reaction intermediates from in vitro biochemical assays to inform the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the human mitochondrial AAA+ protease, LONP1. Our results demonstrate that substrate binding, rather than nucleotide binding, activates the assembly and allosterically regulates proteolytic activity. The N-terminal domain plays a critical role in this process and facilitates the initial stages of substrate selection and engagement. Moreover, structures of LONP1 actively degrading a substrate in the presence of ATP provide important context to the conventional understanding of the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is likely not limited to a single position in the right-handed spiral during the hand-over-hand translocation mechanism.",

          "abstract": "Brain-wide association studies using functional MRI have advanced our understanding of how behavioral traits relate to individual variability in brain function. These studies typically identify functional connectivity (FC) patterns linked to behavioral traits using either whole-brain or region-wise predictive models. However, whole-brain models often struggle with generalizability and interpretability due to the high dimensionality of FC data, while region-wise models isolate predictions, limiting their ability to capture the integrated contributions of brain-wide FC patterns. In this study, we introduce an interpretable predictive model that learns fine-grained FC patterns predictive of behavioral traits, jointly at the regional and participant levels, to characterize the overall association of FC patterns with a target trait. Our model jointly learns a relevance score and a dedicated prediction function for each brain region, then integrates the regional predictions using the relevance scores as weights to generate a participant-level prediction, capturing the collective association of FC patterns with the trait. We validated our method using FC data from 6,798 participants in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to predict cognition. Our model identified the cingulo-parietal, retrosplenial-temporal, dorsal attention, and cingulo-opercular networks as collectively predictive of cognitive traits, achieved competitive prediction accuracy, and enabled detailed characterization of fine-grained FC differences across cognitive domains. The learned relevance scores enhanced region-wise predictions of longitudinal cognitive measures in the ABCD cohort and cognitive traits in the Human Connectome Project Development cohort. These findings suggest that our method effectively characterizes generalizable and fine-grained FC patterns linked to cognition in youth.",

          "abstract": "Deep learning has advanced our ability to assess the effects that individual mutations have on protein function; however, predicting the complex interplay between two or more mutations remains challenging. Here, we seek to address this challenge by building a deep learning framework that incorporates information related to protein dynamics. Namely, we build a neural network architecture using a physics-based metric called the Asymmetric Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI asym ), which quantifies the degree to which each member of a pair of residues influences the flexibility of the other. DCI asym enables us to train models through an allosteric Graph Neural Network (GNN) in which each residue is linked to its distant dynamic influencers. Despite not being trained on experimental epistasis data, our GNN consistently outperforms existing approaches on deep mutational scanning datasets across four distinct proteins, highlighting its enhanced capacity to model epistatic interactions. Our GNN model was then challenged to predict the functions of 37 novel, computationally designed TEM-1 β-lactamase variants of unknown function, and it demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy for these variants. Thus, our GNN provides a pathway for better assessing the impact of multiple mutations on protein function, including epistatic relationships and mutations that have profound effects on activity despite being spatially far from the active site.",

          "abstract": "Speech comprehension involves transforming an acoustic waveform into meaning. To do so, the human brain generates a hierarchy of features that converts the sensory input into increasingly abstract language properties. However, little is known about how rapid incoming sequences of hierarchical features are continuously coordinated. Here, we propose that each language feature is supported by a dynamic neural code, which represents the sequence history of hierarchical features in parallel. To test this “hierarchical dynamic coding” (HDC) hypothesis, we use time-resolved decoding of brain activity to track the construction, maintenance, and update of a comprehensive hierarchy of language features spanning phonetic, word form, lexical–syntactic, syntactic, and semantic representations. For this, we recorded 21 native English participants with magnetoencephalography (MEG), while they listened to two hours of short stories in English. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, the brain represents and simultaneously maintains a sequence of hierarchical features. Second, the duration of these representations depends on their level in the language hierarchy. Third, each representation is maintained by a dynamic neural code, which evolves at a speed commensurate with its corresponding linguistic level. This HDC preserves the maintenance of information over time while limiting destructive interference between successive features. Overall, HDC reveals how the human brain maintains and updates the continuously unfolding language hierarchy during natural speech comprehension, thereby anchoring linguistic theories to their biological implementations.",

These enrichments are recorded in water desorbed from mineral surfaces and evolved from poorly crystalline phases, hydrated salts, jarosite, and clays. All evolved waters are deuterium-enriched relative to common terrestrial waters, reflecting hydrogen loss to space. Because oxygen in structurally bound hydroxyl groups is least likely to exchange with other sources over geologic timescales, we focus on oxygen in water evolved during dehydroxylation of smectite clays. Several samples have 18 O/ 16 O ratios commensurate with precipitation from, or near-complete equilibration with, water moderately 18 O-enriched relative to terrestrial meteoric waters—consistent with other evidence that Mars’s hydrosphere is basically like Earth’s in terms of oxygen isotopes. Unlike hydrogen, oxygen atmospheric escape did not lead to extreme 18 O enrichments on Mars. Locally, however, most Gale smectites’ 18 O/ 16 O values require a pronounced 18 O-enrichment of their parental waters. On Earth, the most extreme 18 O enrichments in surface waters are found in closed basins having undergone significant evaporative loss into a low-humidity atmosphere, and the 18 O/ 16 O of authigenic clay minerals formed in these environs reflect those enrichments. A similar process acting on the hydrologic reservoir local to Gale at the time of clay formation and early diagenesis is a plausible explanation for the distinctive oxygen isotopic compositions of these clays.",

          "abstract": "Testosterone administration to nonsinging adult female canaries induces song, making this a model for behavioral plasticity and its underlying neural mechanisms in vertebrates. The song control nucleus HVC is traditionally believed to undergo a substantial size change when transitioning from a nonfunctional to a functional (song-producing) state. Using 2-photon in vivo imaging, we tracked the spatial distribution and anatomical properties of HVC neurons over several weeks of testosterone-induced song development. Surprisingly, despite ultrastructural changes of HVC neurons, testosterone did neither alter neuronal spacing nor HVC size. Instead, spatial transcriptomics revealed that testosterone modulates gene networks throughout HVC, aligning transcriptomic profiles between its peripheral and central HVC regions in singing birds, thereby mimicking the histological appearance of an enlarging HVC. Our results demonstrate that changes in HVC size in adults reflect phenotypic changes in neurons within a stable framework. Importantly, the nonfunctional state is not associated with a reduced brain area volume, preserving HVC’s capacity for functional differentiation throughout life.",

Although these genomic alterations are often attributed to the action of error-prone DNA polymerases on UV-induced DNA lesions during replicative DNA synthesis, UV damage can also result in mutagenic and recombinogenic DNA damage in nondividing cells. We examined the effects of UV on cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arrested in G 1 of the cell cycle. By mating an irradiated haploid with an unirradiated haploid, we found that recombination was initiated only on the irradiated chromosome. This result indicates that trans effects of UV on recombination (for example, induction of recombinogenic proteins stimulating DNA breaks on the unirradiated homolog) are small or negligible. In addition, we show that most of the UV-induced mutations produced in G 1 -irradiated cells result in mutations at identical positions in both strands of the duplex. As observed for recombination events, mutations are almost exclusively on the irradiated chromosome, indicating the near absence of a trans effect on mutations.",

To explain how transport emerges from the system components and their interactions, we used experimental data and theoretical information to construct an integrative Brownian dynamics model of transport through an NPC, coupled to a kinetic model of transport in the cell. The model recapitulates key aspects of transport for a wide range of molecular cargoes, including preribosomes and viral capsids. Our model quantifies how flexible phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat proteins create an entropic barrier to passive diffusion and how this barrier is selectively lowered in facilitated diffusion by the many transient interactions of nuclear transport receptors with the FG repeats. Selective transport is enhanced by “fuzzy” multivalent interactions, redundant FG repeat mass, coupling to the energy-dependent RanGTP concentration gradient, and exponential dependence of transport kinetics on the transport barrier. Our model will facilitate rational modulation of the NPC and its artificial mimics.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers (COs) are needed to produce genetically balanced gametes. In mammals, CO formation is mediated by a conserved set of pro-CO proteins via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian pro-CO factor HEIP1. In mouse HEIP1 is essential for crossover and fertility of both sexes. HEIP1 promotes crossover by orchestrating the recruitment of other pro-CO proteins, including the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5) and E3 ligases (HEI10, RNF212, and RNF212B), that are required to mature CO sites and recruit the CO-specific resolution complex MutLγ. Moreover, HEIP1 directly interacts with HEI10, suggesting a direct role in controlling the recruitment of pro-CO E3 ligases. During early stages of meiotic prophase I, HEIP1 interacts with the chromosome axes, independently of recombination, before relocalizing to the central region of the synaptonemal complex. We propose that HEIP1 is a conserved master regulator of CO proteins that controls different CO maturation steps.",

Between 4.5 and 3 Ma, sea level highstands remained up to 20 m above present whereas the first lowstands below present suggest onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 4 Ma. Intensification of global glaciation occurred from 3 Ma to 2.5 Ma, culminating in lowstands similar to the Last Glacial Maximum lowstand at 21,000 years ago and that reoccurred throughout much of the Pleistocene. We attribute the middle Pleistocene transition in ice sheet variability (1.2 Ma to 0.62 Ma) to modulation of 41-thousand-year (kyr) obliquity forcing by an increase in ~100-kyr CO 2 variability.",

          "abstract": "Alkene hydrogenation is a cornerstone of chemical synthesis, yet enzymatic strategies remain limited to electron deficient substrates via hydride transfer. Using heme enzymes, we unlock a hydrogenation pathway for the asymmetric reduction of unactivated olefins. A silane promoted heme-cysteine redox cycle in the active site catalyzes sequential hydrogen atom transfer to challenging scaffolds including 1,1-disubstituted as well as tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes. The evolved enzymes are promiscuous, oxygen-tolerant, utilize earth-abundant iron, and can operate on gram scale under ambient conditions. Orthogonal hydrogen atom sources enable site-divergent asymmetric isotope labeling. Mechanistic and computational studies support a stepwise radical process. Our work introduces a biochemical approach for stereoselective olefin reduction and provides a platform for next-generation biocatalytic hydrogenation.",

RADA16 accelerated the transition of hiPSC-CMs toward adult-like gene expression profiles, enhanced sarcomere organization, and improved vascularization in the transplanted site. Flexible mesh nanoelectronics revealed fibrillation of transplanted hiPSC-CMs within the beating recipient heart, and RADA16 dramatically reduced the automaticity of hiPSC-CMs. Our findings demonstrate the potential of self-assembling nanofibers to advance cardiac cell therapy and how flexible mesh nanoelectronics technology could improve safety.",

In strongly coupled e-h bilayers, electrons and holes spontaneously form three-particle trion bound states. The interlayer trions can assume 1e-2h and 2e-1h configurations.

          "abstract": "As droughts become longer and more intense, impacts on terrestrial primary productivity are expected to increase progressively. Yet, some ecosystems appear to acclimate to multiyear drought, with constant or diminishing reductions in productivity as drought duration increases. We quantified the combined effects of drought duration and intensity on aboveground productivity in 74 grasslands and shrublands distributed globally. Ecosystem acclimation with multiyear drought was observed overall, except when droughts were extreme (i.e., ≤1-in-100-year likelihood of occurrence). Productivity losses after four consecutive years of extreme drought increased by ~2.5-fold compared with those of the first year. These results portend a foundational shift in ecosystem behavior if drought duration and intensity increase, from maintenance of reduced functioning over time to progressive and profound losses of productivity when droughts are extreme.",

Active modifications to the spatial environment could therefore be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing control- or pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis. Pathogen exposure led to architectural changes, including faster nest growth, increased interentrance distance, transmission-inhibitory changes in nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced transmission and highlighted a synergy between architectural and behavioral responses to disease. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organization can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.",

The CDK-activating kinase (CAK) acts as a master regulator of CDK activity by catalyzing the activating phosphorylation of CDKs on a conserved threonine residue within the regulatory T-loop. However, structural data illuminating the mechanism by which the CAK recognizes and activates CDKs have remained elusive. Here, we determine high-resolution structures of the CAK in complex with CDK2 and CDK2-cyclin A2 by cryogenic electron microscopy. Our structures reveal a T-loop–independent kinase-kinase interface with contributions from both kinase lobes. Computational analysis and structures of CAK in complex with CDK1-cyclin B1 and CDK11 indicate that these structures represent the general architecture of CAK-CDK complexes.

          "abstract": "Metal ions are essential in regulating protein functions through interactions with residues such as cysteine, but comprehensive mapping of metal-specific metalloproteomes in mammals remains limited. Here, we introduce CysMP, a cysteine-centered metalloprotein profiling strategy to profile the metalloproteomes of 11 key metal ions. CysMP identified 8895 metal-binding sites across 4150 proteins, enabling quantitative comparisons between different metals and revealing both their binding promiscuity and preferences. Notably, zinc and copper ions exhibit the broadest protein interaction profiles. CysMP uncovers numerous potential metalloproteins. We demonstrate that copper and zinc bind to and inhibit 5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, resulting in the accumulation of 5′-methylthioadenosine. Furthermore, copper binding suppresses phosphoglycerate kinase 1 activity, leading to a down-regulation of glycolysis. Our work not only establishes a valuable resource for a dual-specific metalloproteome database but also paves the way for understanding the molecular insights of metalloprotein functions.",

In contrast, the mycobiome and resident viruses showed no significant coevolution with host immunity. By 1 year, infants who previously wheezed displayed an upper airway microbiota enriched in Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella , accompanied by a distinct local and systemic immune gene signature featuring elevated classical monocyte-related genes.

This architecture facilitates efficient bidirectional ion transport and intramolecular charge transfer, leading to reversible coupling of redox units 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTCDA/NTCDA) ·− and N 4 , N 4 -bis[4′-amino-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4-yl]-(1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-diamine (TAAB/TAAB + ).

The limited or delayed fallout from Ivy Mike (1952 CE) compared to Operation Castle (1954 CE), despite their detonation in close proximity, exemplifies how stratospheric circulation and seasonal dynamics create periods of reduced transport to Antarctica. These records also reveal seasonal fallout patterns in Antarctica, with enhanced deposition during austral summers driven by stratosphere-troposphere exchange.

In this study, we fabricated a photodetector optimized for UVA detection based on a fully transparent p-n junction photodiode architecture. A multijunction structure was designed using SnO 2 /ZnO as n-type oxide semiconductors and CoO x combined with defect-engineered HfO x as p-type semiconductors, with ITO serving as the cathode. The photodiode exhibited excellent photoresponse in the 340 to 350 nm wavelength range, with an average visible transmittance of ~75% and a responsivity of 80.1 mA W −1 . Furthermore, the device enables real-time UVA monitoring under sunlight, demonstrating strong potential for applications in wearable UVA sensing and skin protection health care systems.",

          "abstract": "The topography of Madagascar reflects a dynamic history of water divide migration, initially driven by rift events on both coasts separated by ~80 million years and later modified by Late Cenozoic volcanic and tectonic activity. This study examines how rifting-induced tilting of an escarpment-plateau landscape led to changes in drainage area and water divide positions. Combining topographic analysis and erosion rates inferred from cosmogenic isotope concentrations, we document a westward-tilted low-relief plateau with sinuous remnant escarpments along the western margin and a linear, high-relief escarpment corresponding to the modern drainage divide on the eastern margin. Our numerical modeling demonstrates that landscape asymmetry and contrasting escarpment morphology can result from a shift in the main water divide across the island during the second rifting event. These mechanistic processes allow us to reconstruct the landscape evolution of Madagascar over more than 100 million years with profound implications for the topography, hydrology, and biodiversity development of passive continental margins.",

          "abstract": "The tissue environment governs vascular remodeling, a key determinant of collateral circulation (CC) in ischemic disease, yet the mechanisms driving CC in adults remain unclear. Plasma profiling from patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and ischemic murine muscle revealed dysregulated lipid metabolism, including elevated APOA1 binding protein ( AIBP), with levels positively correlating with PAD severity. Myeloid cells enriched at CC sites increased AIBP expression postischemia. Genetic deletion of AIBP expanded CXCR4⁺ capillary endothelial cells ( CECs) with stemlike and proliferative properties that remodeled into functional collaterals, a process blocked by CXCR4 inhibition. Mechanistically, AIBP bound the endocytic receptor LRP2 to promote endothelial uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)–associated miR-223, a repressor of CXCR4. Disruption of this AIBP–LRP2–HDL–miR-223 axis restored CXCR4 and rescued CC growth. These findings define a two-phase mechanism in which stemlike CECs first expand and then transition to arterial fates, establishing a therapeutic strategy for revascularization in ischemic vascular disease.",

          "abstract": "Arsenic is a potent carcinogen whose presence in groundwater poses a persistent global public health threat. While groundwater treatment mitigates arsenic exposure, it generates concentrated arsenic-rich by-products that are universally considered economic and environmental burdens. However, arsenic is experiencing a renaissance. Both the United States and European Union have classified arsenic as a critical raw material (CRM) due to the role of metallic arsenic [As(0)] in materials needed for digital infrastructure and clean energy systems. Bringing these two material flows together, we show that arsenic removed during groundwater treatment can be transformed into pure amorphous As(0) nanoparticles via a two-stage process of alkali extraction and selective reduction. The creation of valuable CRMs from carcinogenic treatment by-products is a potentially disruptive technology for the water sector that can alter global As(0) supply chains. Revenue from upcycled As(0) can also help improve the challenging economics of water treatment in marginalized arsenic-affected regions.",

However, the effect of water on core-mantle element partitioning remains poorly constrained. Using machine learning molecular dynamics simulations trained on quantum mechanical data, we show that increasing water content promotes magnesium partitioning into the metallic core, whereas silicon, iron, and hydrogen increasingly prefer the silicate mantle. On the basis of Earth’s core mass fraction and oxygen fugacity during core formation, a self-consistent hydrous core-mantle differentiation model yields a bulk Earth water content of ~0.23 weight % (equivalently ~10 ocean masses), a bulk Earth magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.16 ± 0.01, and a mantle magnesium/silicon ratio of 1.25 to 1.28. The initial core would contain 3.5 to 4.1 weight % silicon, 2.9 to 3.1 weight % oxygen, 0.11 to 0.14 weight % magnesium, and 0.04 to 0.10 weight % hydrogen, along with sulfur and carbon.

We reconstituted the V/A-ATPase into liposomes and performed structural analysis using cryo-EM under conditions where the proton motive force was applied in the presence of ADP and Pi. ATP molecules were bound at two of the three catalytic sites of V/A-ATPase, confirming that the structure represents a state adopted during ATP synthesis. In this structure, the catalytic site closes upon binding of ADP and Pi through an induced fit mechanism. Multiple structures were obtained where the membrane-embedded rotor ring was in a different position relative to the stator. By comparing these structures, we found that torsion occurs in both the central rotor and the peripheral stator during 31° rotation of rotor ring. These structural snapshots of V/A-ATPase provide crucial insights into the mechanism of rotary catalysis of ATP synthesis.",

          "authors": "Nicholas A. Levis, Erik J. Ragsdale",
          "abstract": "A common developmental response to resource competition is an inducible offense, the facultative predation of competitors. At its extreme, this response involves the development of alternative phenotypic morphs, or polyphenism. However, how polyphenism evolves to meet ecological challenges, such as competitor species, is unknown. Using replicated experimental evolution, during which starved nematodes could consume heterospecific competitors, we investigated whether induction of a predatory morph could evolve and how generalizable this change’s genetic basis is. Fifty generations of evolution across multiple populations resulted in parallel changes in higher morph-induction and parallel genomic responses, including repeated selection for a specific transcription-factor binding-site variant. In tandem, we artificially selected directly for tooth morphology and drove the predatory morph near to fixation. That trait-specific selection promoted greater changes in predatory morph induction than experimental evolution indicates that polyphenism evolution is balanced by selection for whole-organism performance. Our results thus describe the predictability by which a resource polyphenism evolves amid scarce resources.",

          "abstract": "Southeast Asia boasts some of the world’s most diverse ecosystems, yet it has experienced a dramatic decline in biodiversity due to extensive deforestation in recent decades. Understanding how species adapted to past habitat loss could provide valuable insights for developing effective conservation strategies to address current threats. We apply state-of-the-art isotope measurements of enamel-bound zinc (δ 66 Zn) and nitrogen (δ 15 N enamel ) analyses to fossil mammal teeth from Coc Muoi [148 to 117 thousand years (ka) and Duoi U’Oi (70 to 60 ka)], Vietnam. Alongside published regional data (δ 66 Zn, δ 13 C, and δ 18 O), we explore how different taxa adapt their diets and behaviors in the face of climatic and environmental changes. We show that foraging in diverse habitats and diversifying food consumed is associated with extant species, while extinct or locally extirpated taxa show these traits to a lesser extent. We underscore the precariousness of certain species and the pressing need for robust conservation policies to safeguard Southeast Asia’s biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "An intense earthquake swarm lasting ~3 years ultimately led to the 2024 M w (moment magnitude) 7.5 earthquake in the Noto Peninsula, Japan. The spatial complexities in swarm evolution and earthquake rupture have been observed, but the factors controlling these complexities remain unclear. Using high-resolution subsurface imaging with dense seismic observation, we identified a high-velocity body collocated with the major slip zone, which the preceding swarm avoided. The spatial distribution and absolute velocity of the high-velocity body and the adjacent ring-shaped swarm cluster indicate that the high-velocity body is a solidified ancient magma. It initially acted as an impermeable barrier to the fluid migrations that triggered swarm earthquakes, eventually rupturing as an asperity of the 2024 earthquake. Our observation suggests that the heterogeneity in fault zone permeability, originating from ancient volcanic activity (&gt;15 million years ago), controlled the present-day swarm evolution and the large earthquake generation.",

Here, we show that micronuclei in hepatocytes trigger a hepatic immune response and promote HCC development via an increased level of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). Livers of a CLD model ( Mcl1 Δhep mice) show increased micronuclei and eccDNA levels. Circular sequencing confirms higher eccDNA levels in micronuclei compared to primary nuclei. The nuclei-segregated DNA fiber (NuSeF) assay we developed demonstrates that micronuclei are more susceptible to replication stress, exhibiting increased replication fork slowing. Comparing different murine liver disease models reveals that high eccDNA correlates with an increased tumor incidence. eccDNA is a strong immunostimulant and promotes a cross-talk between hepatocytes and immune cells through the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of Sting1 in Mcl1 Δhep mice reduces immune cell chemotaxis and tumor incidence. Our findings suggest that eccDNA from micronuclei mediates inflammation-driven liver carcinogenesis in CLD.",

          "abstract": "Endocytosis generates life-essential vesicles via complex protein-lipid machinery, yet its initiation mechanisms remain elusive. Long thought to require full machinery spatiotemporal coordination to drive the flat-to-round vesicle transformations, we reveal a notably simple initiation mechanism in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells involving only the final step, the pore closure. During calcium-triggered exocytosis, calcium activates the phosphatase synaptojanin, rapidly converting PI(4,5)P 2 to PI4P. Elevated PI4P drives the fission enzyme dynamin to close the pores of preexisting and exocytosis-generated Ω-profiles, which are sufficient to generate slow, fast, ultrafast, overshoot, and bulk endocytosis, and kiss-and-run (fusion pore closure). These findings resolve the long-standing mystery of endocytosis and fission initiation and reveal PI4P, not the widely assumed PI(4,5)P 2 , as the key lipid for dynamin-mediated fission. This pathway is clinically important, as it is impaired by synaptojanin mutations associated with Parkinson’s disease and seizures, and is likely disrupted in other disorders involving PI4P or PI(4,5)P 2 dysregulation.",

Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from patients with glioma, NR4A family genes were identified as closely associated with T cell exhaustion and were coexpressed with dysfunctional genes HAVCR2 and TIGIT . Notably, CAR T cells with NR4A3 knockdown exhibited enhanced cytotoxic activity against tumors, leading to improved tumor clearance and prolonged survival in vivo. However, the promoted antiexhausted phenotype diminished with prolonged tumor burden. This decline in T cell function correlates with the compensatory down-regulation of FOS induced by chronic antigen exposure following NR4A3 knockdown. Overexpressing FOS alongside NR4A3 knockdown robustly boosted the antitumor responses of CAR T cells by skewing their phenotypes and transcriptional profiles away from exhaustion and toward increased effector function. These findings offer a promising strategy for the clinical modification of CAR T cell therapy.",

The resultant inactivation stabilizes regulators of G protein signaling (RGS4 and RGS5) that ADO normally marks for proteolysis, explaining the drug’s vasodilatory activity and comporting with observations of diminished RGS levels in both clinical preeclampsia and a mouse model thereof. Its inhibition of ADO suggested use of HYZ against glioblastoma (GBM); indeed, a single dose robustly senesces cultured GBM cells.

We addressed this issue by acquiring functional near-infrared spectroscopy data from infants aged 3 to 9 months with congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The SNHL infants showed efficient small-world characteristics within each hemisphere. However, unlike typically developing controls, who showed an age-related leftward lateralization of network efficiencies, SNHL infants did not exhibit the emergence of hemispheric asymmetry. Intriguingly, lateralization of frontal efficiency was preserved in SNHL infants with mild hearing loss but declined significantly with increasing severity of hearing impairment. These findings suggest that even SNHL infants with some residual hearing experience disruption in the development of functional lateralization. This underscores the importance of providing early auditory access to SNHL infants to support robust functional integration during early development.",

While this exchange is essential, the precise mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we discovered that the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC19 functions as a key regulator of mouse spermiogenesis. Loss of Zdhhc19 leads to male infertility and abnormal sperm morphology. Zdhhc19 -deficient sperm exhibit impaired histone-to-protamine exchange, leading to retention of histones and misdistribution of protamines. Similarly, the palmitoyltransferase catalytic site mutant Zdhhc19 C142S knock-in mice show reduced fertility, sperm abnormalities, and histone retention. Mechanistically, ZDHHC19 mediates histone H3 palmitoylation at cysteine-110, weakening H3-H4 interactions and increasing chromatin accessibility. Palmitoylation of H3 facilitates histone-to-protamine exchange. This study highlights the essential role of ZDHHC19’s palmitoyl-transferase activity in histone-to-protamine exchange during spermiogenesis and underscores the broader role of histone palmitoylation in chromatin remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits host-derived phosphatidylcholine (PC) to establish persistent lung infections, yet the mechanistic link between metabolic adaptation and pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that choline (Cho)–induced regulator (CodR), a GcvA-type transcriptional regulator, serves as a master regulator integrating virulence, antibiotic resistance, and PC catabolism during pulmonary infection. CodR directly binds Cho, the key metabolite of PC degradation, to activate pchP and norA , facilitating exogenous PC/Cho utilization. Genome-wide profiling reveals that CodR targets conserved motifs in promoters of mexA , pslA , and amrZ , synchronizing virulence and tolerance pathways. codR deletion attenuated biofilm formation, type III secretion system activity, siderophore production, and PC catabolism, reducing bacterial pathogenicity in a murine pneumonia model. Notably, Cho/PC pretreatment potentiates CodR-dependent transcriptional activation of antibiotic resistance genes, elevating tolerance to ciprofloxacin and meropenem. Our findings elucidate a paradigm wherein P. aeruginosa co-opts host-derived Cho via CodR to simultaneously potentiate virulence and antibiotic resilience, exposing CodR as a druggable node to break infection-resistance synergies.",

We demonstrate that shear stress generated by fluid flow beneath a rising bubble is the primary mechanism for cell detachment. This strategy, relying solely on physical forces and independent of cell or surface chemistry, can therefore work with a large range of the media, surfaces, and cells. We successfully implement this discovery at the lab-scale by designing a prototype for on-demand cell detachment that maintains high cell viability.

Resistance to radiation increases the expression of integrin β3 ( ITGB3 ), which promotes enhanced migration and invasion. Bioinformatic analysis and subsequent experimentation revealed an enrichment of RNA metabolism pathways that stabilize ITGB3 transcripts. Specifically, the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L ( HNRNPL ), whose expression is regulated by Nrf2, mediates the formation of circular RNAs that sponge the family of let-7 microRNAs that target ITGB3 .

Otoferlin is essential for IHC exocytosis, but how it binds Ca 2+ and the target membrane to serve synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking, and fusion remained unclear. Here, we obtained cryo–electron microscopy structures of otoferlin and employed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane binding. We show that membrane binding by otoferlin involves C 2 B-C 2 G domains and repositions C 2 F and C 2 G domains. Disruption of Ca 2+ -binding sites of the C 2 D domain in mice altered synaptic sound encoding and eliminated the Ca 2+ cooperativity of IHC exocytosis, indicating that it requires the binding of several Ca 2+ -ions by otoferlin.

This activity mode had important functional consequences to sound processing during task performance. We show that the slow firing rate modulations caused the ongoing activity just before sound presentations to be higher during task performance than during passive listening. Concurrently, during task performance, the responses to target stimuli were weaker but more informative about the task-relevant sounds. In a model, higher ongoing activity caused more synaptic depression of the cortico-cortical synapses, reducing the tendency of the network to produce population spikes and resulting in weaker but more informative responses to sounds.",

Unlike conventional approaches that avoid hysteresis, HasMorph intentionally exploits friction-induced shape hysteresis, the difference in robot shape during loading and unloading, to enable numerous reversible shape changes using only two sequentially controlled actuators via an inverted zigzag tendon-sheath mechanism. Integrated with tip growth, the robot achieves complex, reversible morphologies and frictionless follow-the-leader navigation. Mechanics and kinematics models reveal how friction and input sequences govern shape evolution and expand the robot’s configuration space. Experiments validate dexterous morphing and robust navigation in unstructured environments. HasMorph enables direct, fine-grained actuation of hyperredundant soft bodies with minimal actuation, offering a scalable approach to soft robot design.

They were genetically most similar to subsequent Neolithic individuals in the Irtysh region, while contemporaneous hunter-gatherers from the Tobol-Ishim and Upper Ob River regions had distinct genetic profiles, likely influenced by riverine geography. The Koken MLBA individuals were genetically similar to other MLBA steppe pastoralists, while genetic outliers provide evidence of two distinct trajectories of admixture with local hunter-gatherer populations.

          "abstract": "Time-resolved spectroscopy has long served as a cornerstone technique for investigating the photophysics of materials. However, conventional methods based on intense optical pulses and ensemble measurements often fail to resolve quantum dynamics due to spectral overlap, coherent artifacts, and multiphoton effects. To overcome these limitations, single-photon transient stimulated emission (SP-TSE) has been proposed as a femtosecond spectroscopy technique using quantum light and detection principles. Here, we theoretically demonstrate frequency-resolved SP-TSE. Unlike semiclassical techniques, SP-TSE reveals a strong dependence of the time-resolved spectrum on the frequency-resolving method. With a tunable optical filter, the observed spectrum reflects a quantum double-slit interference in the time-frequency domain. In contrast, interferometric detection produces spectra resembling semiclassical results, but the signal emerges specifically from the second harmonic frequency window due to quantum interference. This framework provides insight into ultrafast quantum processes and suggests a foundation for future applications in quantum spectroscopy and technologies.",

However, potential N m recognition by proteins has not been extensively explored. Here, we used RNA affinity purification, followed by mass spectrometry to identify N m -binding proteins. The N m -binding protein candidates exhibit enriched binding at known N m sites. Some candidates display nuclear localization and functions. We focused on the splicing factor FUBP1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay validated preference of FUBP1 to N m -modified RNA. As FUBP1 predominantly binds intronic regions, we profiled N m sites in chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA) and found N m enrichment within introns. Depletion of N m led to skipped exons, suggesting N m -dependent splicing regulation. The caRNA N m sites overlap with FUBP1-binding sites, and N m depletion reduced FUBP1 occupancy on modified regions. Furthermore, FUBP1 depletion induced exon skipping in N m -modified genes, supporting its role in mediating N m -dependent splicing regulation. Overall, our findings identify FUBP1 as an N m -binding protein and uncover previously unrecognized nuclear functions for RNA N m modification.",

          "abstract": "Self-control requires regulating actions over time, particularly suppressing impulsive actions to obtain future rewards. Using a delayed-response task in mice, we identified distinct cortical contributions to impulse control during waiting. Optogenetic inhibition revealed that the dorsomedial frontal cortex (dmFC) promotes patience, the anterior insular cortex (AIC) drives impulsivity, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) regulates temporal precision in waiting. Calcium imaging uncovered region-specific computations: PPC neurons predominantly encoded absolute elapsed time through time cell-like activity, tiling the waiting period independently of patience levels. Their activity predicted the waiting precision. Meanwhile, dmFC and AIC neurons exhibited opposing lick-related activity—dmFC neurons preferentially decreasing and AIC neurons increasing activity during licking. Furthermore, their activity changes during waiting predicted patience. These findings reveal distinct yet complementary mechanisms underlying impulse control during waiting: The PPC encodes temporal information crucial for regulating waiting behavior, while the dmFC-AIC circuit orchestrates a push-pull dynamic to regulate patience.",

Previous platforms have mainly focused on scalar computing with optical intensities, which is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance and has been primarily restricted to single or basic computations because of intrinsic fixed correlation between the input and output signals. To our knowledge, for the first time, we use polarization vectors for optical analog computing with a single-layered metasurface to overcome these restrictions. The underlying mechanism is on-demand polarization transformation on the dispersive Poincaré spheres, constructing intrinsic variable correlations between the incident polarization vectors and output signals. We choose the universal logical gates and mathematical function operations as two specific examples. Experimental results of our vector computing metadevices exhibit minimal errors relative to the target values.

This design enables large bending angles (&gt;100°) at multiple points along the robot’s length. We investigate the effects of internal pressure and actuator temperature as control inputs for steering and demonstrate the potential of our design for practical applications, such as surgical procedures and inspection tasks.

Through observational analysis and numerical model experiments, we demonstrate that positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) can intensify TSEA coastal MHWs during austral summer through two distinct processes. First, pIOD induces westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial Atlantic, causing thermocline deepening along the TSEA coast through oceanic Kelvin waves, favoring development of MHWs. Second, pIOD enhances rainfall over central Africa, increasing Congo River discharge and resulting in a shallower mixed layer in the TSEA coastal region, also promoting MHW formation. We further develop an empirical model using pIOD as the predictor for TSEA MHWs, demonstrating high predictive skill with a 3-month lead time. In a warming climate, the remote influence of pIOD on TSEA MHWs may be further exacerbated, underscoring critical need to incorporate this factor into marine hazard forecasting for the region.",

Its frontline treatment uses the BH3 mimetic venetoclax to trigger mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, drug resistance nearly always develops, calling for therapies to circumvent it. Advanced microscopy and genome-wide CRISPRi screen analyses pinpointed mitochondrial adaptations primarily mediated by the master regulator of cristae shape optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) as critical for BH3 mimetics resistance. Resistant AML cells up-regulate OPA1 to modify their mitochondrial structure and evade apoptosis. MYLS22 and Opitor-0, two specific and nontoxic OPA1 inhibitors, promote apoptotic cristae remodeling and cytochrome c release, synergizing with venetoclax in AML cells and xenografts derived from AML patients ex vivo and in vivo. Mechanistically, OPA1 loss renders AML cells dependent on glutamine and sensitizes them to ferroptosis by activating ATF4-regulated integrated stress responses. Overall, our data clarify how OPA1 up-regulation allows AML cells' metabolic flexibility and survival and nominates specific OPA1 inhibitors as efficacious tools to overcome venetoclax resistance in leukemia.",

The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height (&lt;0.15 r ⋆ , r ⋆ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e., starspots.

We show that NP decoration enhances MDSC immunomodulatory function, facilitates their trafficking to inflamed CNS regions, and increases NP accumulation within CNS. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, CITED exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy, resulting in reduced disease progression, improved motor function, and diminished myelin damage. Mechanistic studies reveal that CITED exerts its therapeutic effects by targeted reprogramming of both innate and adaptive immune responses in CNS.

Trends of longwave cooling and shortwave heating are 0.76 ± 0.48 and 0.64 ± 0.27 Wm −2 dec -1 , respectively. The longwave trend is a result of partial cancelation among contributions from increasing surface skin temperature, air temperature, and water vapor. Increasing shortwave absorption is caused by increasing water vapor. The trend of global mean diabatic heating by precipitation is 0.03 ± 0.61 Wm −2 dec −1 .

Here, we investigate ciliary metachronism in larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerelii , using whole-body high-speed imaging and physical and biological manipulations. The results reveal an unexpected wave structure featuring strong coupling within multiciliated cells that breaks down across cell boundaries. Using laser ablation to selectively remove parts of the ciliary band, we establish the necessity and sufficiency of ciliary band continuity for wave transmission and the importance of nonreciprocal steric interactions.

Disease progression was blunted in Lyn kinase-dead mice indicating a contribution for kinase-independent Lyn functions in restraining autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, Toll-like receptor signaling, and splenomegaly. Further comparative analyses identified an exclusive role for the kinase-dependent functions of Lyn in regulating B cell receptor signaling, dendritic cell phenotype, and type I interferon production.

          "abstract": "Exposure to outdoor air pollution results in millions of premature deaths and illnesses that are associated with substantial economic loss. According to the Global Burden of Disease, outdoor air pollution was responsible for 4.7 million deaths in 2021. Climate change mitigation policies could provide cobenefits by reducing air pollution. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR6 report explores scenarios using an updated carbon budget approach—the net-zero pathways—designed to avoid temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C temperature limit. We assess whether net-zero pathways consistently improve air pollution outcomes using a global source-receptor air pollution model to estimate concentrations, health impacts, and economic damages. To analyze key uncertainties, we apply multiple relative risk functions and economic damage models. Our findings show that stringent climate policies, avoiding overshoot and keeping below 2°C, offer substantial health and economic cobenefits, particularly for China and India, and avoid 207,000 premature deaths and 2269 billion USD2020 in damages by 2030.",

In this study, we analyzed over 1.1 million STRs in 7876 whole-genome sequencing samples, including 3808 newly sequenced Tibeto-Burman (TB) speakers and Han Chinese individuals inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and neighboring regions. We characterized more than 570,000 polymorphic STRs across coding/noncoding genomic and functional contexts, revealing distinct STR variation patterns specific to TB speakers. Notably, divergent STRs in TB speakers were predominantly located in high-altitude adaptive genes and frequently associated with gene expression levels. Additionally, we identified over 17,000 STRs strongly associated with environmental conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These STRs exerted multilevel gene regulation through modulating protein coding, fine-tuning cis-regulatory elements, and modulating biological pathways. Furthermore, we observed substantial contributions of functional and adaptive STRs to human phenotypic diversity. Collectively, our findings provide genomic STR resources of TB speakers and genetic insights into their roles in human adaptive evolution.",

In this study, we demonstrate the use of millimeter-scale magnetoelectric (ME) films as a direct neural interface for wireless neurostimulation, powered by static and alternating magnetic fields in the nonresonant regime (10 hertz). To accomplish this objective, electrical potential trends of the ME films under varying low-frequency magnetic fields are investigated and used to demonstrate neural stimulation by calcium imaging on primary neurons in vitro via a capacitive-like charge injection mechanism. In addition, electrical polarization orientation is revealed as a critical design parameter in direct neuron-ME interfaces. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of nonresonant powering of ME films as a promising minimally invasive wireless neural stimulation technique.",

          "abstract": "Medical catheters are essential in minimally invasive procedures, enabling precise navigation and treatment within complex anatomical structures. However, their rigidity and limited flexibility can exert excessive mechanical forces on fragile luminal tissues, causing abrasions, microtears, or perforations and increasing the risks of inflammation and other complications, ultimately compromising safety and efficacy. Inspired by foxtail grass, we developed a magnetically actuated liquid-infused slippery microcatheter (LISMC) with artificial cilia. Its soft magnetic cilia and hydrogel coating allow smooth traversal of luminal surfaces, reducing friction by two-thirds compared to conventional designs. Magnetic cilium oscillation enhances adaptability to complex pathways and minimizes friction during navigation. As a proof of concept, the LISMC precisely deployed helical microswimmers to the bile duct and actuated them downstream for x-ray–guided treatment of acute pancreatitis with rabbit models. This LISMC provides a transformative advancement in interventional medicine, offering a scalable and adaptively reconfigurable platform for next-generation therapeutic applications.",

To address this question, we analyzed the clumped isotopes of limestones from the North China Craton to reconstruct Mesoproterozoic seawater temperature and δ 18 O values. Our results indicate that the Mesoproterozoic seawater had a temperature of 26.9° ± 0.4°C and a δ 18 O value of −6.3 ± 0.2 per mil (relative to standard mean ocean water). This δ 18 O estimate aligns with previous inferences from geochemical modeling, marine iron oxides, and oxygen isotope ensembles, supporting the hypothesis that Mesoproterozoic seawater was isotopically lighter than its Phanerozoic counterpart.

The system has spectrally isolated and spatially dispersed topological synthetic modes with near-diffraction–limited mode volumes and appropriately designed high-quality factors. We achieve high-performance nanorainbow lasing with low threshold, broadband spectrum, large spontaneous emission factor (β), and milliwatt output power, simultaneously. These emission features are predetermined by the ultrasmall mode volumes and appropriately designed high-quality factors of the spectrally and spatially isolated topological synthetic modes. This work enables high-performance, spatially multiplexed multiwavelength emission for on-chip photonics, facilitating advances in broadband signal processing, optical computing, and beyond.",

To facilitate efficient DC migration, constant cross-talk between actin and microtubules is required to coordinate cytoskeletal networks and actomyosin contractility, but the related mechanisms have not been extensively characterized. We show that mouse DCs lacking Kif5b (the heavy chain of kinesin-1) exhibit a major impairment in cell migration in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, kinesin-1 coordinates cytoskeletal cross-talk between actin and microtubules during DC migration by modulating negatively RhoA activity through its interaction with GEF-H1, thereby limiting GEF-H1’s availability in the cytosol. The same mechanism operates in human primary monocyte–derived DCs and regulates efficient migration in a confined environment. Thus, our results highlight kinesin-1 as a key regulator of DC migration, through its coordinated control of cytoskeletal dynamics.",

RRM2 was identified as a critical driver of poor prognosis and Osi resistance in NSCLC. The 124 I/Cy5.5-sO@FCLs enabled real-time tracking of tumor targeting and biodistribution, and CRISPR-Cas9–mediated RRM2 disruption efficiently reversed Osi resistance and potentiated synergistic anticancer effects, which was attributed to counteracting TGF-β/Smad2/3–mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and amplifying cGAS/STING-induced ferroptosis. Furthermore, the nanovesicles triggered STING-dependent immunogenic cell death (ICD), stimulating tumor infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells; combination with anti–PD-L1 therapy augmented NSCLC regression.

Our results show that tectonic uplift, combined with declining CO 2 during the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, substantially reduced forest cover and promoted grassland expansion across East and Central Africa. These environmental transitions likely facilitated faunal dispersals and ecological turnover, including among large mammals and early crown hominoids.

Here, we find a giant single-step UC of ~200 milli–electron volts via sub–35-femtosecond phonon dynamics in two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in the nonlinear regime. The single-step UC approaches the phonon dynamics limit of ~23 femtoseconds and gains energy about eight times the room-temperature thermal energy (~25 milli–electron volts), enabling its synergistic integration into the nonlinear regime. Benefiting from the unique electron-phonon coupling between organic vibrations and excitons in inorganic lattices, the UC demonstrates distinctive signatures of Raman anisotropy and strong nonlinearity. This work opens new avenues for studying uncharted phonon dynamics and nonlinear optical mechanisms, offering substantial advantages in optical refrigeration, upconverting energy harvesting and optical microscopy.",

We develop a distributed carbon nanofiber (CNF)–based DAC air filter capable of adsorbing CO 2 downstream in ventilation systems. The DAC air filter not only has the potential to remove 596 MtCO 2 year −1 globally but can also decrease energy consumption in existing building systems. The CNF-based adsorbent has a capacity of 4 mmol/g and can be regenerated via solar thermal or electrothermal methods with low carbon footprints. Through life cycle assessment, the CNF air filter shows a carbon removal efficiency of 92.1% from cradle to grave.

Proton transfer reactions can mediate this coupling, as in proton-coupled electron transfer and excited-state proton transfer. Additional mechanisms involving proton dislocations may exist but remain undiscovered. Here, we present a femtosecond crystallographic movie of the phytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans . The structures reveal a space-conserving mechanism for rotation of the D-ring in the excited state. We observe rearrangement of a conserved hydrogen bond network within 300 fs, which precedes the isomerization reaction of the chromophore. Aided by molecular modeling and independently confirmed by femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we attribute these changes to a protonation shift of the strictly conserved histidine-260. Although this histidine lies close to the photoexcited π-orbitals of the chromophore, it is not directly part of them. We propose that this “remote-controlled” proton transfer relays photoexcitation near-instantaneously to the protein matrix.

Our analysis suggests widespread decline in ocean greenness, with chlorophyll a concentrations decreasing at a rate of (−0.35 ± 0.10) × 10 −3 milligrams per cubic meter per year (mg m −3  year −1 ). The decline is steeper in coastal regions [(−0.73 ± 0.22) × 10 −3 mg m −3  year −1 ]. The frequency of high chlorophyll a concentration events in coastal waters has decreased at a relative rate of −1.78% per year. These trends are predominantly driven by rising sea surface temperatures, which enhance ocean stratification, suppress nutrient upwelling, and limit phytoplankton growth.
