          "authors": "Amanda Hollis-Brusky",
          "abstract": "Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F. Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends. Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original concept into a “new fusionism” of authoritarian means to Christian nationalist ends . I investigate the extent to which this “new fusionism” has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after Trump.",

          "abstract": "I examine the tension between Donald Trump’s perception of the judiciary—marked by a form of legal realism—and the Supreme Court’s stated commitment to judicial bipartisanship and independence. I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",

          "abstract": "The Roberts court has long been characterized as a “probusiness” court, given the ostensible orientation of the court’s Republican-appointed majority and assumptions that President Trump’s appointments have magnified that orientation. But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",

          "abstract": "The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",

          "abstract": "The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",

Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",

          "abstract": "The current Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on issues of executive power differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",

          "abstract": "How a country’s apex court functions and how its justices decide cases is shaped by its institutional design and history and by the political and cultural context in which it sits. I compare the apex courts of 38 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finding that the power and role of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) makes it unique among them. SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",

          "abstract": "Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an “institutionalist,” indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing institution over his own political preferences. This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",

          "abstract": "Over the past half century, Republican leaders have had considerable success enlisting courts in their campaign to boost the party’s electoral prospects through the suppression of voting and the manipulation of election rules. Donald Trump has embraced this mission and escalated the assault on America’s electoral processes in new and dangerous ways. Has the Supreme Court supported or opposed this contemptible project? Its recent election law decisions offer a mixed verdict, though its performance mostly leans in an antidemocratic direction. The court’s decisions safeguarding democracy are fewer than those that undermine voting rights and elections, are typically handed down over the objections of Trump’s appointees, and often include doctrinal provisions that enable it to restrict democratic participation in the future. Whether the Supreme Court will abet or discourage the erosion of American democracy in the future is an open question.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s embrace of originalism, and particularly the “history and tradition” method of interpreting constitutional text, is often justified by its defenders as constraining judges from making up the law to match their preferences. This is a testable hypothesis. With the Bruen case in 2022, the Supreme Court moved away from a contemporary means-ends method of interpreting the Second Amendment to an originalist, “history and tradition” one. In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",

          "abstract": "The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling abrogating women’s long-established right to abortion affords an opportunity to better understand how people update their attitudes toward the court. The data analyzed here reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a substantial hit to the court’s institutional legitimacy. Why and how did this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",

It argues that these justices have failed to articulate a persuasive rationale as to why exactly the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings and that they have failed to adequately show that history supports their “no-coercion” construction of what constitutes a prohibited establishment. Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text. The court’s use, misuse, and nonuse of history cannot help but give the impression that policy preferences—more than history or the actual original understanding of the First Amendment—have determined recent church-state decisions.",

          "abstract": "The Roberts court’s immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",

EBV infects epithelial cells and B cells through interaction between viral glycoproteins and different host receptors4, but it has remained unknown whether a common receptor mediates infection of its two major host cell targets. Here, we establish R9AP as a crucial EBV receptor for entry into epithelial and B cells. R9AP silencing or knockout, R9AP-derived peptide and R9AP monoclonal antibody each significantly inhibit, whereas R9AP overexpression promotes, EBV uptake into both cell types. R9AP binds directly to the EBV glycoprotein gH/gL complex to initiate gH/gL–gB-mediated membrane fusion. Notably, the interaction of R9AP with gH/gL is inhibited by the highly competitive gH/gL-neutralizing antibody AMMO1, which blocks EBV epithelial and B cell entry. Moreover, R9AP mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion in cooperation with EBV gp42–human leukocyte antigen class II or gH/gL–EPHA2 complexes in B cells or epithelial cells, respectively. We propose R9AP as the crucial common receptor of B cells and epithelial cells and a potential prophylactic and vaccine target for EBV.",

Single-cell-level microscopy demonstrated a downstream effect on DNA replication. We determined the physiologically relevant concentrations of nucleobases in human and mouse lung tissue, showing that these levels were insufficient to salvage PurF inhibition. Indeed, proof-of-concept studies using a long-acting injectable formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the compound. Finally, we show that inclusion of JNJ-6640 could have a crucial role in improving current treatment regimens for drug-resistant tuberculosis.

          "abstract": "All contemporary Eurasians trace most of their ancestry to a small population that dispersed out of Africa about 50,000 years ago (ka) 1–9 . By contrast, fossil evidence attests to earlier migrations out of Africa 10–15 . These lines of evidence can only be reconciled if early dispersals made little to no genetic contribution to the later, major wave. A key question therefore concerns what factors facilitated the successful later dispersal that led to long-term settlement beyond Africa. Here we show that a notable expansion in human niche breadth within Africa precedes this later dispersal. We assembled a pan-African database of chronometrically dated archaeological sites and used species distribution models (SDMs) to quantify changes in the bioclimatic niche over the past 120,000 years. We found that the human niche began to expand substantially from 70 ka and that this expansion was driven by humans increasing their use of diverse habitat types, from forests to arid deserts. Thus, humans dispersing out of Africa after 50 ka were equipped with a distinctive ecological flexibility among hominins as they encountered climatically challenging habitats, providing a key mechanism for their adaptive success.",

Even within the well-studied context of US agriculture, some analyses argue that adaptation will be widespread and climate damages small3,4, whereas others conclude that adaptation will be limited and losses severe5,6. Scenario-based analyses indicate that adaptation should have notable consequences on global agricultural productivity7,8,9, but there has been no systematic study of how extensively real-world producers actually adapt at the global scale. Here we empirically estimate the impact of global producer adaptations using longitudinal data on six staple crops spanning 12,658 regions, capturing two-thirds of global crop calories. We estimate that global production declines 5.5 × 1014 kcal annually per 1 °C global mean surface temperature (GMST) rise (120 kcal per person per day or 4.4% of recommended consumption per 1 °C; P < 0.001). We project that adaptation and income growth alleviate 23% of global losses in 2050 and 34% at the end of the century (6% and 12%, respectively; moderate-emissions scenario), but substantial residual losses remain for all staples except rice. In contrast to analyses of other outcomes that project the greatest damages to the global poor10,11, we find that global impacts are dominated by losses to modern-day breadbaskets with favourable climates and limited present adaptation, although losses in low-income regions losses are also substantial. These results indicate a scale of innovation, cropland expansion or further adaptation that might be necessary to ensure food security in a changing climate.",

Consequently, FFA2 is a promising drug target for immunometabolic disorders1,2,3,4. Here we report cryogenic electronic microscopy structures of FFA2 in complex with two G proteins and three distinct classes of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), and describe noncanonical activation mechanisms that involve conserved structural features of class A GPCRs. Two PAMs disrupt the E/DRY activation microswitch5 and stabilize the conformation of intracellular loop 2 by binding to lipid-facing pockets near the cytoplasmic side of the receptor. By contrast, the third PAM promotes the separation of transmembrane helices 6 and 7 by interacting with transmembrane helix 6 at the receptor–lipid interface. Molecular dynamic simulations and mutagenesis experiments confirm these noncanonical activation mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the molecular basis for the Gi versus Gq bias, which is due to distinct conformations of intracellular loop 2 stabilized by different PAMs. These findings provide a framework for the design of tailored GPCR modulators, with implications that extend beyond FFA2 to the broader field of GPCR drug discovery.",

At the beginning of autumn, the same individuals make a return migration to their breeding grounds to reproduce and die. Here we show that Bogong moths use the starry night sky as a compass to distinguish between specific geographical directions, thereby navigating in their inherited migratory direction towards their distant goal. By tethering spring and autumn migratory moths in a flight simulator 3–5 , we found that, under naturalistic moonless night skies and in a nulled geomagnetic field (disabling the moth’s known magnetic sense 4 ), moths flew in their seasonally appropriate migratory directions. Visual interneurons in different regions of the moth’s brain responded specifically to rotations of the night sky and were tuned to a common sky orientation, firing maximally when the moth was headed southwards. Our results suggest that Bogong moths use stellar cues and the Earth’s magnetic field to create a robust compass system for long-distance nocturnal navigation towards a specific destination.",

However, given the array of PTSD-perturbed molecular pathways identified so far1, it is implausible that a single cell type is responsible. Here we profile the molecular responses in over two million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 111 human brains, collected post-mortem from individuals with and without PTSD and major depressive disorder. We identify neuronal and non-neuronal cell-type clusters, gene expression changes and transcriptional regulators, and map the epigenomic regulome of PTSD in a cell-type-specific manner. Our analysis revealed PTSD-associated gene alterations in inhibitory neurons, endothelial cells and microglia and uncovered genes and pathways associated with glucocorticoid signalling, GABAergic transmission and neuroinflammation. We further validated these findings using cell-type-specific spatial transcriptomics, confirming disruption of key genes such as SST and FKBP5. By integrating genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of credible variants that disrupt PTSD genes, including ELFN1, MAD1L1 and KCNIP4, in a cell-type-specific context. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of the cell-specific molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie the persisting effects of traumatic stress response on the human prefrontal cortex.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07518-6 (2024).\n\nGeologic faults exhibit a rich variety of slip behaviours, from ‘stick-slip’, in which faults remain locked most of the time and slip during earthquakes only, to slow slip events that last days to months, to quasi-steady creep1. Lee et al.2 proposed that slip behaviour may depend on the orientation of nearby faults: faults that are well aligned are argued to promote creep, whereas faults that have diverse orientations are argued to promote unstable slip. The statistical analysis of Lee et al.2 considers surface creep only and does not explain depth-dependent transitions in fault locking that are well resolved by geodetic observations. Furthermore, the inferred correlation between creep and fault alignment does not necessitate a causal relationship and can be readily explained in terms of regional variations in the state of stress. Existing evidence overwhelmingly indicates that transitions from stable to unstable slip are controlled by variations in lithology, effective normal stress and/or temperature, rather than the fault-network geometry.",

          "abstract": "Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply-demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy1,2. Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods—defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)—are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility. Our findings provide critical insights for building future climate-resilient power systems while reducing system costs.",

However, our limited understanding of their functional sequence features prevents the interpretation of enhancer mutations in disease2.

Focusing on seven enhancers that are active in the developing brain, heart, limb and face, we created over 1,700 transgenic mice for over 260 mutagenized enhancer alleles. Systematic mutation of 12-base-pair blocks collectively altered each sequence feature in each enhancer at least once. We show that 69% of all blocks are required for normal in vivo activity, with mutations more commonly resulting in loss (60%) than in gain (9%) of function. Using predictive modelling, we annotated critical nucleotides at the base-pair resolution. The vast majority of motifs predicted by these machine learning models (88%) coincided with changes in in vivo function, and the models showed considerable sensitivity, identifying 59% of all functional blocks. Taken together, our results reveal that human enhancers contain a high density of sequence features that are required for their normal in vivo function and provide a rich resource for further exploration of human enhancer logic.",

Over 20 classes of lncRNAs have been identified in bacteria and bacteriophages through comparative genomics analyses, but their biological functions remain largely unexplored1-3. Due to the large sizes, the structural determinants of most lncRNAs also remain uncharacterized. Here we report the structures of two natural RNA nanocages formed by the lncRNA ROOL (rumen-originating, ornate, large) found in bacterial and phage genomes. ~2.9 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal that ROOL RNAs form an octameric nanocage with a 28-nm diameter and 20-nm axial length, whose hollow inside features poorly ordered regions. The octamer is stabilized by numerous tertiary and quaternary interactions, including triple-strand A-minors that we propose to name “A-minor staples”. The structure of an isolated ROOL monomer at ~3.2-Å resolution indicates that nanocage assembly involves a strand-swapping mechanism resulting in quaternary kissing loops. Finally, we show that ROOL RNA fused to an RNA aptamer, tRNA, or microRNA retains its structure forming a nanocage with radially displayed cargos. Our findings therefore may enable the engineering of novel RNA nanocages as delivery vehicles for research and therapeutic applications.",

We present a fully computational workflow for designing efficient enzymes in TIM-barrel folds using backbone fragments from natural proteins and without requiring optimization by mutant-library screening. Three Kemp eliminase designs exhibit efficiencies greater than 2,000 M−1 s−1. The most efficient shows more than 140 mutations from any natural protein, including a novel active site. It exhibits high stability (greater than 85 °C) and remarkable catalytic efficiency (12,700 M−1 s−1) and rate (2.8 s−1), surpassing previous computational designs by two orders of magnitude1,2,3,4,5. Furthermore, designing a residue considered essential in all previous Kemp eliminase designs increases efficiency to more than 105 M−1 s−1 and rate to 30 s−1, achieving catalytic parameters comparable to natural enzymes and challenging fundamental biocatalytic assumptions. By overcoming limitations in design methodology11, our strategy enables programming stable, high-efficiency, new-to-nature enzymes through a minimal experimental effort.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction relies on meiotic chromosome pairing to form bivalents, a process that is complicated in polyploids owing to the presence of multiple subgenomes 1 . Uneven ploidy mostly results in sterility due to unbalanced chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis. However, pentaploid dogroses ( Rosa sect. Caninae ; 2 n = 5 x = 35) achieve stable sexual reproduction through a unique mechanism: 14 chromosomes form bivalents and are transmitted biparentally, while the remaining 21 chromosomes are maternally inherited as univalents 2,3 . Despite being studied for over a century, the role of centromeres in this process has remained unclear. Here we analyse haplotype-resolved chromosome-level genome assemblies for three pentaploid dogroses. Subgenome phasing revealed a bivalent-forming subgenome with two highly homozygous chromosome sets and three divergent subgenomes lacking homologous partners, therefore explaining their meiotic behaviour. Comparative analyses of chromosome synteny, phylogenetic relationships and centromere composition indicate that the subgenomes originated from two divergent clades of the genus Rosa . Pollen genome analysis shows that subgenomes from different evolutionary origins form bivalents, supporting multiple origins of dogroses and highlighting variation in subgenome contributions. We reveal that bivalent-forming centromeres are enriched with ATHILA retrotransposons, contrasting with larger tandem-repeat-based centromeres mainly found in univalents. This centromere structural bimodality possibly contributes to univalent drive during female meiosis. Our findings provide insights into the unique reproductive strategies of dogroses, advancing our understanding of genome evolution, centromere diversity and meiotic mechanisms in organisms with asymmetrical inheritance systems.",

These microbial shifts can exert systemic effects by altering the release of specific metabolites into the bloodstream5,6, and the gastrointestinal microbiota has also been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory activity through the activation of innate and adaptive immunity7,8. However, it remains unclear how the microbiota contributes to inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), where these microorganisms are typically absent. Here we report that T cells that recognize gut-colonizing segmented filamentous bacteria can induce inflammation in the mouse intestine and CNS in the absence of functional regulatory T cells. Gut commensal-specific CD4 T cells (Tcomm cells) that are dysregulated in the inflamed gut can become licensed to infiltrate into the CNS regardless of their antigen specificity and have the potential to be re-stimulated by host protein-derived antigens in the CNS via molecular mimicry, whereupon they produce high levels of GM-CSF, IFNγ and IL-17A, triggering neurological damage. These infiltrated Tcomm cells initiate CNS inflammation by activating microglia through their IL-23R-dependent encephalitogenic programme and their IL-23R-independent GM-CSF production. Together, our findings reveal potential mechanisms whereby perturbation of Tcomm cells can contribute to extraintestinal inflammation.",

Enhanced particle adhesion increases the filtration of airborne particulates while maintaining air permeability, providing longer filter lifetime and increased energy savings.

Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning. However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning. The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning.

          "abstract": "Kupffer cells (KCs) are tissue-resident macrophages that colonize the liver early during embryogenesis1. Upon liver colonization, KCs rapidly acquire a tissue-specific transcriptional signature, mature alongside the developing liver and adapt to its functions1,2,3. Throughout development and adulthood, KCs perform distinct core functions that are essential for liver and organismal homeostasis, including supporting fetal erythropoiesis, postnatal erythrocyte recycling and liver metabolism4. However, whether perturbations of macrophage core functions during development contribute to or cause disease at postnatal stages is poorly understood. Here, we utilize a mouse model of maternal obesity to perturb KC functions during gestation. We show that offspring exposed to maternal obesity develop fatty liver disease, driven by aberrant developmental programming of KCs that persists into adulthood. Programmed KCs promote lipid uptake by hepatocytes through apolipoprotein secretion. KC depletion in neonate mice born to obese mothers, followed by replenishment with naive monocytes, rescues fatty liver disease. Furthermore, genetic ablation of the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF1α) in macrophages during gestation prevents the metabolic programming of KCs from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, thereby averting the development of fatty liver disease. These results establish developmental perturbation of KC functions as a causal factor in fatty liver disease in adulthood and position fetal-derived macrophages as critical intergenerational messengers within the concept of developmental origins of health and diseases5.",

          "abstract": "The ability of materials to respond to stimuli with significant optical nonlinearity is crucial for technological advancement and innovation1,2,3. Although photon-avalanche upconversion nanomaterials with nonlinearities exceeding 60 have been developed, further enhancement remains challenging4,5,6. Here we present a method to increase photon-avalanche nonlinearity beyond 500 by reconstructing the sublattice and extending the avalanche network. We demonstrate that lutetium substitution in the host material induces significant local crystal field distortions. These distortions strengthen cross-relaxation, the key process governing population accumulation. As a result, the optical nonlinearity is significantly amplified, enabling sub-diffraction imaging through single-beam scanning microscopy, achieving lateral and axial resolutions of 33 nm (about 1/32 of λExc) and 80 nm (around 1/13 of λExc), respectively (where λExc is the excitation wavelength). Moreover, our research shows regional differentiation within photon-avalanche nanocrystals, in which photon-avalanche performance varies across different regions at the single-nanoparticle level. This effect, coupled with extreme optical nonlinearity, enables visualization of nanoemitters at resolutions beyond their physical size using simple instrumentation. These advancements open new possibilities for super-resolution imaging, ultra-sensitive sensing, on-chip optical switching and infrared quantum counting.",

Here we establish long-term, live light-sheet microscopy on unguided brain organoids generated from fluorescently labelled human induced pluripotent stem cells, which enables tracking of tissue morphology, cell behaviours and subcellular features over weeks of organoid development 4 . We provide a novel dual-channel, multi-mosaic and multi-protein labelling strategy combined with a computational demultiplexing approach to enable simultaneous quantification of distinct subcellular features during organoid development. We track actin, tubulin, plasma membrane, nucleus and nuclear envelope dynamics, and quantify cell morphometric and alignment changes during tissue-state transitions including neuroepithelial induction, maturation, lumenization and brain regionalization. On the basis of imaging and single-cell transcriptome modalities, we find that lumenal expansion and cell morphotype composition within the developing neuroepithelium are associated with modulation of gene expression programs involving extracellular matrix pathway regulators and mechanosensing. We show that an extrinsically provided matrix enhances lumen expansion as well as telencephalon formation, and unguided organoids grown in the absence of an extrinsic matrix have altered morphologies with increased neural crest and caudalized tissue identity. Matrix-induced regional guidance and lumen morphogenesis are linked to the WNT and Hippo (YAP1) signalling pathways, including spatially restricted induction of the WNT ligand secretion mediator (WLS) that marks the earliest emergence of non-telencephalic brain regions. Together, our work provides an inroad into studying human brain morphodynamics and supports a view that matrix-linked mechanosensing dynamics have a central role during brain regionalization.",

However, for all alloys developed thus far, including recent high-entropy alloys, those possessing good tensile ductility rarely approach 2-GPa yield strength at room temperature.

An example of this synergy delivers 1.8-GPa yield strength combined with 25% truly uniform elongation. We achieved strengthening by pushing microstructural heterogeneities to the extreme through unusually large volume fractions of not only coherent L12 nanoprecipitates but also incoherent B2 microparticles. The latter, being multicomponent with a reduced chemical ordering energy, is a deformable phase that accumulates dislocations inside to help sustain a high strain hardening rate that prolongs uniform elongation.",

          "title": "How your brain controls ageing — and why zombie cells could be key",
          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "There might be a paradox in the biology of ageing. As humans grow older, their metabolisms tend to slow, they lose muscle mass and they burn many fewer calories. But certain cells in older people appear to do the exact opposite — they consume more energy than when they were young.\n\nThese potential energy hogs are senescent cells, older cells that have stopped dividing and no longer perform the essential functions that they used to. Because they seem idle, biologists had assumed that zombie-like senescent cells use less energy than their younger, actively replicating counterparts, says Martin Picard, a psychobiologist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nHow to kill the ‘zombie’ cells that make you age\n\nBut in 2022, Gabriel Sturm, a former graduate student of Picard’s, painstakingly observed the life course of human skin cells cultured in a dish1 and, in findings that have not yet been published in full, found that cells that had stopped dividing had a metabolic rate about double that of younger cells.\n\nFor Picard and his colleagues, the energetic mismatch wasn’t a paradox at all: ageing cells accumulate energetically costly forms of damage, such as alterations in DNA, and they initiate pro-inflammatory signalling. How that corresponds with the relatively low energy expenditure for ageing organisms is still unclear, but the researchers hypothesize that this tension might be an important driver of many of the negative effects of growing old, and that the brain might be playing a key part as mediator2. As some cells get older and require more energy, the brain reacts by stripping resources from other biological processes, which ultimately results in outward signs of ageing, such as greying hair or a reduction in muscle mass (see ‘Energy management and ageing’).\n\nSource: Ref. 2\n\nPicard and his colleagues call this concept the ‘brain–body energy-conservation model’. And although many parts of the hypothesis are still untested, scientists are working to decipher the precise mechanisms that connect the brain to processes associated with ageing, such as senescence, inflammation and the shortening of telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes and protect them. This work, some researchers say, is also beginning to illuminate how psychological stress can accelerate ageing at a molecular level. Although once at the fringes of ageing research, this idea is now becoming mainstream, says Alessandro Bartolomucci, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “The science speaks for itself. The field cannot dismiss it.”\n\nWear and tear\n\nSome of the earliest pieces of evidence pointing to the brain’s role in ageing came from studies that revealed the effects of psychological stress on individual cells.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Elissa Epel, who was then a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), set out with her colleagues to examine whether chronic stress could leave behind a cellular signature. At the time, there was already a “very impressive literature” linking long-term stress to poor health, says Epel, who is now a health psychologist at UCSF. “But we didn’t know as much about what was happening at the cellular level.”\n\nSo, the researchers decided to look at telomere length. Telomeres progressively shorten over the lifespan of an organism, and this process has been linked to senescence and other forms of age-related changes in cells.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nThe team recruited a group of 58 healthy women: 19 of whom had a healthy child; and 39 of whom had a child with a chronic illness. The researchers reasoned that the latter group often experienced increased levels of stress compared with the women who had healthy children3. Epel’s team found that the women with a chronically ill child had shorter telomeres than those who did not — and that telomere length correlated with the number of years spent as a carer. These findings suggested that exposure to chronic stress can introduce molecular changes that are important for ageing, says biologist Noah Snyder-Mackler at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nSince then, teams have also found evidence of telomere shortening in people exposed to other stressors, such as adverse experiences in childhood and work-related exhaustion4. Although some of the results have been mixed when it comes to telomere length, researchers have also amassed evidence linking stress to other molecular markers of ageing.\n\nFor example, Anthony Zannas, a physician–scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his colleagues have shown, through studies of large cohorts of people, that high levels of stress throughout life were associated with signs of accelerated ageing in the epigenome, the patterns of chemical modifications to the genome, such as DNA methylation, that help to regulate what genes are expressed. These changes might be mediated by stress hormones such as cortisol. Zannas’s team found that, in women, higher levels of cortisol were linked to lower levels of DNA methylation, as well as an increase in the expression of the gene coding for tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a signalling molecule associated with inflammation5.\n\nExercise can help to mitigate some of the effects of stress on ageing. Credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty\n\nOthers have been studying these processes in animals. Although animal models of stress have their limitations — for one, humans stressors are much more complex and can include a variety of social, psychological and biological factors — this work has provided mechanistic insights that are difficult to obtain in human studies. Bartolomucci and his team have discovered that chronic social stress in rodents, such as being subjected to aggressive behaviour from a dominant animal, can damage heart health and lead to a shorter lifespan6. They’ve also found that exposure to this type of adversity is linked to an increase in age-related molecular changes, such as a build-up of signals associated with senescence.\n\nFor example, in one 2024 study of male mice, Bartolomucci’s team demonstrated that social stress during a relatively brief period in early life led to an increase in levels of a key marker of cellular senescence, called p16, in the brain, fat tissue and immune cells7. These changes occurred only in response to social stress: animals exposed to stress in the form of physical restraint, which involved placing them in small tubes for three hours per day for a month, did not experience a build-up of p16.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how\n\nSnyder-Mackler’s team have been conducting similar studies in rhesus macaques. These animals tend to form hierarchies within groups, with newcomers dropping to lower social ranks. So, by sequentially introducing animals into groups, the researchers were able to examine the effects of social status on health. They found that social stress affects the immune system in multiple ways. In the immune cells of monkeys with lower social status, it led to an increase in the expression of inflammation-associated genes8. These effects were at least partially reversible: when the animals’ social rankings were rearranged, the gene expression patterns in their immune cells also changed to match their standings. The team has yet to look at how these alterations affect lifespan — macaques can live for around 30 years, which makes it difficult to address this issue, Snyder-Mackler says.",

Kodachrome film, introduced in 1935, consisted of three layers of emulsion, sensitive to blue, green and red light, respectively. This meant that every point on the film captured the full colour spectrum. In a paper in Nature, Tsarev et al.1 translate that 90-year-old idea to a single chip. Their device is a stack of three light detectors made from crystals called perovskites that absorb red, green and blue light.

The discovery that they can find their way using only the stars — reported in an 18 June Nature paper1 — makes this moth the first invertebrate to be observed using celestial navigation for long-distance journeys.\n\nFlight simulator for moths reveals they navigate by starlight\n\n“The first time we saw them flying under the night sky with no other cue and flying in the right direction we had to hold on to the edge of the table,” says study co-author Eric Warrant, an entomologist at Lund University in Sweden.\n\nBogong moths emerge from their cocoons in southeastern Australia and some regions of New Zealand and begin the long flight to mountain caves that they have never previously visited. The following autumn these moths make the return flight to reproduce and die. “How on earth do they know how to find their way there?” Warrant says.\n\nWarrant and his team suspected the moths were guided by looking at the stars, an ability previously identified only in humans, birds, and possibly seals. To test this, they captured wild moths and placed them in a ‘flight simulator’ — a clear cylindrical box in which the insects were tethered and their movements recorded while being shown projections of the starry sky.\n\nThe researchers manipulated the magnetic field in the simulator to observe whether moths could navigate without this cue. They also recorded the activity of visual neurons in the moths’ brains to investigate whether they have an internal representation of the starry sky.\n\nCelestial compass",

The resulting enzymes catalyze a chemical reaction that no known natural protein can execute, achieving a reaction rate and efficiency similar to naturally occurring enzymes.\n\nThe proteins, described on 18 June in Nature1, open the door to an era in which bespoke enzymes can be rapidly designed to facilitate a variety of reactions.\n\n“They’re remarkable,” says Sílvia Osuna, a computational chemist at the University of Girona in Spain, who was not involved in the study. “It’s very hard to computationally design a highly efficient enzyme.”\n\nStreamlined enzymes\n\nThe ability to build synthetic enzymes could lead to new ways of making medicines and industrial chemicals. But attempts to use computer algorithms to design such enzymes have produced inefficient catalysts that researchers must later improve in the laboratory — an approach that “is very labourious”, says Sarel Fleishman, who studies computational protein design at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nFleishman and his colleagues sought a better approach. As a test case, they decided to construct a catalyst for a non-natural chemical reaction called the Kemp elimination, which involves the removal of a proton from a carbon atom in certain substrates.\n\nThe team assembled data on a group of natural enzymes to serve as a starting point, and computationally broke these protein sequences into fragments. The fragments were then shuffled and recombined into an array of all possible combinations.\n\nThe researchers fed these combinations into their computer algorithms. These used models of how the atoms in proteins behave to predict which of these combinations would serve as the ideal chemical 'backbone' for the new enzyme.\n\nAlgorithm with intuition\n\nThe team also tweaked the enzyme’s active site, where chemical catalysis takes place. For years, scientists have assumed that it was critical to have a ring-shaped amino acid in a key position near that site. But Fleishman and his colleagues asked their algorithm to predict what would happen if other amino acids were placed there.\n\nThe program favoured a non-ringed amino acid in that spot. With that change, the enzyme’s efficiency shot through the roof, says Fleishman: “I was shocked.”\n\nIn the end, the most efficient enzyme the team designed differed from its closest naturally occurring cousins by more than 140 amino acids. It was also 100 times more efficient than similar enzymes previously designed using artificial intelligence (AI).",

          "authors": "Benjamin Steyn",
          "abstract": "Novelty is often espoused as a virtue in science. But what does it mean, and how valuable is it, really? A manuscript written in gobbledegook might be considered novel, despite being useless. And studies that try to replicate previous work can be valuable without being novel.\n\nSome scientists argue that the current research system, driven by citation-based metrics, incentivizes researchers to play it safe. It’s easier to get citations for incremental work in established fields than to break out of silos. Others counter that the existing system demands novelty at the expense of depth and replication, and that what’s considered novel can be subjective.\n\n‘Disruptive’ science has declined — and no one knows why\n\nAs the co-leader of the UK Metascience Unit, I’ve grappled with this debate. It’s important to consider whether more novelty would make research more impactful. But I’ve been stumped by the fact that there are no good ways to measure novelty. Without good indicators, researchers can’t assess the prevalence of original papers or their value in scientific progress.\n\nMetascientists have tried to assign novelty scores to academic papers — and their authors — in various ways, none of which are foolproof. One identifies early users of certain key words, so we can see retrospectively who were pioneers of ideas. Another looks at how scientific papers cite each other; novel research often cites combinations of papers that had not been drawn together previously.\n\nIn the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have emerged that analyse the textual similarity between a paper and the existing research corpus. By ingesting large amounts of text from online manuscripts, these models have the potential to be better than previous models at detecting how original a paper is, even in cases in which the study hasn’t cited the work it resembles. Because these models analyse the meanings of words and sentences, rather than word frequencies, they would not score a paper more highly simply for use of varied language — for instance, ‘dough’ instead of ‘money’.\n\nPay researchers to spot errors in published papers\n\nBut these AI-based novelty indicators, and, to an extent, their predecessors, are yet to be robustly validated. Do they cohere with human judgements of what novel science is? Would they single out work that went on to win Nobel prizes or to be funded by novelty-focused programmes such as those by DARPA and ARIA, say? Without testing them at scale across multiple fields, we cannot trust them.\n\nThat’s why the UK Metascience Unit has partnered with the non-profit organization RAND Europe; the Sussex Science Policy Research Unit; and the publisher Elsevier, to launch MetaNIC (see go.nature.com/3hhsdp3) — a competition to produce and validate indicators for scientific novelty in academic papers. Running until November, MetaNIC is open to researchers all around the world.\n\nParticipants will design novelty assessments and test them over a set of 50,000 research papers, drawn from many fields. We will compare the algorithms’ scores against a huge ‘ground truth’ data set, gathered by asking more than 10,000 researchers to assess the novelty of the same set of papers, each being assigned only studies in their own field to judge. The team behind the indicator that best aligns with the human judgements will be awarded £300,000 (US$407, 000) to further develop their work.\n\nOnce we have an indicator that reliably matches human judgements, metascientists will be able to study the role of originality in scientific progress.",

In 2016, the resignation of feminist scholar Sara Ahmed from Goldsmiths College, University of London, in protest at the lack of action against sexual harassment rocked the UK higher-education community. I co-founded a campaigning organization, The 1752 Group, dedicated to redressing the situation. The group’s name reflects the meagre amount of money that Goldsmiths invested in our first conference on tackling the issue — £1,752 (US$2,380). This stopgap approach is emblematic of academia’s reluctance to engage with the problem.\n\nThe huge toll of PhDs on mental health: data reveal stark effects\n\nAt last, nearly ten years on, England is taking action. From 1 August, England’s national regulator for higher education, the Office for Students, will require institutions to protect students from harassment or sexual misconduct.\n\nThis is a welcome step. But the guidelines must include specific protective measures for PhD students. As researchers, they work in environments distinct from those of students in taught programmes. They are more likely to be targeted by staff members, both at their institution and outside it. This is partly because of their close relationship with advisers and mentors, and partly because of academia’s deeply hierarchical, gender-unequal culture.\n\nAny form of harassment can disrupt people’s lives, careers, professional networks, and physical and mental health. Some people report experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder or a loss of confidence. Those targeted sometimes change fields or leave academia altogether.\n\nMy research has shown that the main reason students report sexual harassment by a member of staff is to keep themselves and others safe. But too often, they receive little to no commitment from universities that they and others will be shielded from perpetrators.\n\nHow PhD students and other academics are fighting the mental-health crisis in science\n\nMany institutions are still building systems and expertise to address sexual harassment. A change in attitude is crucial. Even now, I hear that such misconduct is rare, or not that serious. Other barriers persist. In Europe, data privacy regulations can hinder efforts to keep people safe. Distinct disclosures about the same alleged perpetrator, for example, aren’t usually linked.",

          "abstract": "On 16 June at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston, a judge ruled that the Trump administration’s slashing of some research grants is illegal.Credit: Sean Pavone/Alamy\n\nA US judge has ordered hundreds of terminated research projects at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to be reinstated, calling the processes that led to their cancellation “bereft of reasoning — virtually, in their entirety”.\n\nCan NIH-funded research on racism and health survive Trump’s cuts?\n\nThe ruling came about two hours after a tense hearing in which lawyers representing US researchers and a coalition of 16 states presented arguments, for the first time, that the NIH’s massive cuts to research are illegal. Since Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the agency has cancelled funding for a long list of projects, including research on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) and COVID-19.\n\nIn a blistering 15-minute rebuke after issuing his ruling, judge William Young of the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston excoriated the Trump administration for targeting research on the health of LGBTQ+ individuals and people from minority ethnic groups.\n\n“This represents racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community. I would be blind not to call it out,” said Young, who was appointed by former US president Ronald Reagan, a Republican. “I’ve been on the bench for 40 years — I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.”\n\n‘We were ready for this’: meet the scientists suing the Trump administration to reinstate terminated grants\n\nThis ruling, which the Trump administration is likely to appeal, means that the NIH will begin disbursing billions of dollars of cancelled funding. “I’m thrilled and overjoyed,” Katie Edwards, an interdisciplinary public-health specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told Nature. Edwards had six NIH grants axed and was one of the researchers who sued the agency. “What the judge said today was spot on — and it highlights the crisis we’re facing right now, where racial and ethnic minorities are being erased,” she said.\n\nThe order will restore funding only to the scientists named in the lawsuits and in the 16 states that sued the government — or about 800 of the more than 2,400 NIH projects that have been cut. These lawsuits also did not touch on wholesale grant cuts at institutions, such as Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that the Trump administration has alleged did not protect their students from discrimination, including antisemitism, on campus.\n\nAndrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the NIH’s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), says the agency “stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigour and meaningful outcomes for the American people” and that it is “exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal”. Neither the HHS nor the NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, responded to Nature’s query about whether and when they would follow the court’s order.\n\nA question of procedure\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the NIH began to terminate research grants in late February because they no longer met “agency priorities”. (It typically cancels only a handful of projects each year, in response to serious concerns about misconduct or fraud — and does so only as a last resort, after taking other actions, such as suspension.)\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nLawsuits challenging these cuts were filed in early April, arguing that they were unlawful because the NIH did not follow proper procedures and did not give adequate reasoning for their cancellation.\n\nRepresentatives of the HHS and billionaire Elon Musk’s US Department of Government Efficiency issued directives to NIH staff members to slash grants on disfavoured topics, and they provided boilerplate language for the employees to use in termination letters to scientists, Nature previously reported. Today, the judge ruled that these directives were “arbitrary and capricious” and, thus, illegal.\n\nTermination letters sent to some scientists called their projects “often unscientific” or deemed them to support “unlawful discrimination”, without backing up the claims. At today’s hearing, Young asked the government’s lawyers whether they could provide any examples of grants that supported these claims. “There’s nothing I can point the court to,” a lawyer responded.",

          "title": "Why air-traffic controller shortages are not to blame for US airport chaos",
          "authors": "Ashley Nunes",
          "abstract": "As US airports get busier, some are struggling to cope. Ageing technology and bad weather are often blamed for cancelled flights. But shortages of air-traffic controllers are also coming under widespread criticism in the media.\n\nAt Newark airport in New Jersey, hundreds of flights have been delayed or cancelled since the start of May. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) — which regulates aviation in the United States — says that 22 controllers are currently handling air traffic at Newark, considerably fewer than the 38 recommended by the agency (see go.nature.com/4mzavxw). Nationwide, only 2 out of 313 air-traffic facilities meet the staffing targets set by both the FAA and the union that represents controllers.\n\nA cleaner future for flight — aviation needs a radical redesign\n\nConcerns about staffing levels have been raised since the mid-1980s. But, as demand grows, more planes require more air-traffic controllers to guide aircraft safely. The consequences of inadequate staffing levels are potentially serious. In June 2023, a US government report concluded that low numbers of staff pose “a risk to the continuity of air traffic operations” (see go.nature.com/4225jum).\n\nFAA officials, union representatives and independent government watchdogs all propose just one solution: raise staffing levels. On 1 May, the FAA unveiled efforts to supercharge recruitment. By the end of the year, the agency expects to have hired at least 2,000 extra controllers — just 1,000 shy of its staffing target of at least 14,000.\n\nHowever, having scrutinized how the FAA estimates staffing levels, there are reasons to question its assessment.\n\nFor one, the FAA ‘staffs to traffic’ — it bases staffing targets on forecasts of future flight volumes. The agency’s goal is to ensure that enough controllers are available to handle both peaks in air traffic and disruptions, such as bad weather.\n\nSevere turbulence ahead – how scientists can keep air travellers safe in a warming world\n\nYet, as a US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report (see go.nature.com/43xanb5) notes, “FAA’s traffic forecasts, at least since 2000, have consistently overestimated future levels of air traffic.” In other words, the forecasts lead to a surplus — rather than a shortage — of controllers.\n\nA more pressing concern is the mathematical model that the FAA uses to establish the staffing standard, which is defined as the number of controllers at each facility (of which there are more than 300) required to cover the 90th percentile of daily traffic (see go.nature.com/3tmacze). The model estimates, for each 15-minute period of the day, a controller’s ‘task load’, or the level of difficulty they encounter when doing the work.\n\nThe task load is assessed by scrutinizing the controller’s duties and calculating the time required to do them. A higher total indicates a higher, or more difficult, task load and thus requires more staff members. However, there are numerous problems with this approach.\n\nModel estimates of the time needed for each task have not been validated using data from either the laboratory or functioning air-traffic control rooms. According to the NAS report, durations for seven of the nine tasks modelled by the FAA are “not based on data from the field”, whereas those for the remaining tasks are “based on input from subject matter experts—that is, task times are not derived from observing or analyzing controllers performing the tasks in the field or in experiments”. But if the loads are inaccurate, then so are the FAA’s modelled staffing requirements.",

The neurons of the paraventricular nucleus release a hormone called corticotropin and have a role in regulating stress. But the neural mechanisms underlying the effect of stress on sleep and memory have remained elusive.\n\nFor co-author Shinjae Chung, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, the question of exactly how stress affects these processes is personal, because, she says, “I experience a lot of sleep problems when I’m stressed”. She adds that “when I have an exam deadline, I have a tendency to have bad sleep that really affects my score the next day”.\n\nLosing sleep\n\nTo study how neurons in the paraventricular nucleus translate stress into sleep and memory problems, the researchers put laboratory mice through a stressful experience by physically restraining the animals in a plastic tube. The team then tested the creatures’ spatial memory and monitored their brain activity as they slept.\n\nAs expected, the stressed mice showed difficulty sleeping and struggled with memory when tested the following day. Stimulating neurons in the paraventricular nucleus mimicked these effects, whereas blocking these neurons resulted in modest improvements in sleep, and more substantial gains in memory performance.",

Tougher rules around visas and border control in the United States have prompted some conferences to move elsewhere. But what are the best places to hold a scientific conference right now? Could a greater variety of host countries be good for science?\n\nConferences are currently heavily concentrated in the Western world, with the United States being the most common location, says Geert Somsen, a historian of science at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.\n\nIn 2023, he co-authored a paper examining the contribution of international conferences throughout history to the understanding and communication of science1. The location of conferences “reflects a certain idea of what the world order is like”, he says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s latest crackdown has made it more difficult for non-citizens to enter the United States and banned citizens of 12 countries from visiting. But even before then, it was difficult for people from low- and middle-income countries to get visas to attend conferences there, says Hazel Biana, a philosopher at De La Salle University in Manila.\n\n“It’s really been a challenge for us over the years,” she says. The United States ranks 81 — close to the bottom — on global financial-advisory firm Arton Capital’s Welcoming Countries Rank, which classifies countries according to the number of passports they accept visa-free or with relatively simple entry requirements. “I’ve known a lot of people who had encountered problems,” says Biana.\n\nThe current climate in the United States is prompting organizers to think deeply about how conference location affects who can attend and presents an opportunity to increase accessibility, which could be good for science, say researchers.\n\nConferences today tend to be “deeply shaped by Western and European traditions”, says Somsen. If they moved to a more diverse set of locations, a wider range of scientists could go, which would benefit science itself by integrating diverse knowledge and experience.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nSo, ideally, where should a conference be held? After the latest crackdown in the United States, several conferences relocated to Canada. The International Conference on Comparative Cognition, for example, will move to Montreal next year. But Canada also has onerous entry restrictions: it is only one place above the United States on the Welcoming Countries Rank.\n\nResearchers’ picks for conference locations include Thailand and Indonesia, which rank 38 and 50, thanks to their generous visa allowances. Both offer ‘visa on arrival’, which eliminates the complicated visa-application process for many people. Biana describes Bangkok as “the perfect place for a conference that’s really quite inclusive”.\n\nShe also mentions Budapest as a promising location outside North America and southeast Asia, owing to its affordability. Hungary scores 53 on the Welcoming Countries Rank.\n\nBudapest could be an attractive, affordable European option for a conference.Credit: Alexander Spatari/Getty\n\nVisas are not the only thing to consider: also important is freedom of expression, says Charlotte Bigg, a historian of science at the Alexandre-Koyré Centre in Paris and co-author of the 2023 paper on the history of conferences.\n\nHuman rights issues",

          "authors": "Abdullahi Tsanni",
          "abstract": "Working scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nMore than 300 people gathered at Senegal’s seaside Hôtel Terrou-bi for the centenary celebration of the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (IPD) last December, an event at which the Pasteur Network — which has 32 institutes in 25 countries — toasted the IPD’s achievements. The occasion drew a rich selection of African researchers, philanthropic leaders, policymakers and health ministers, many of whom flocked around virologist Amadou Alpha Sall. The IPD’s former chief executive was the first Black person to have run the institution since it was founded in 1924.\n\nWearing a long, sparkly Senegalese kaftan, Sall, aged 56, and 2 metres tall, seemed to be everywhere at once in the room.\n\nThe radical plan for vaccine equity\n\nIn West Africa’s scientific community, Sall is mostly known simply as Amadou. For more than three decades, he has worked as a virologist and public-health expert responding to epidemic outbreaks in dozens of countries, and persuading African government officials and policymakers to support scientific research and the manufacturing of health tools — diagnostics and vaccines — that Africans need in Africa. Solomon Zewdu, a former senior executive of the MasterCard Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in Toronto, Canada, describes Sall as “unusually approachable and fun”.\n\nDuring his years at the IPD, Sall built international partnerships and amassed support from foreign funders, investors, biotech companies and multilateral organizations. He played a crucial part in decolonizing the IPD, transforming it into a Senegalese non-profit foundation with a mostly Senegalese management staff. Until 2009, it was a private research entity owned by the Pasteur Institute in Paris. “The scientific standing of the institution has continued to improve under Amadou,” says Peter Piot, an Ebola and HIV virologist who chairs the IPD’s scientific advisory board.\n\nThe MADIBA manufacturing complex on the outskirts of Dakar.Credit: INSTITUT PASTEUR de DAKAR\n\nIn the last four years of his nine-year tenure as head of the IPD, Sall’s focus was a US$220-million project to build and staff a state-of-the-art vaccine-manufacturing facility in Senegal. The project, Manufacturing in Africa for Disease Immunization and Building Autonomy, known as MADIBA, aims to produce 300 million to one billion doses of high-quality vaccines annually against the most common diseases affecting Africans, including Ebola and measles. (The facility is partly named after Nelson Mandela’s Xhosa clan name, Madiba, as a nod to the former South African president and civil-rights leader’s fight for African independence.) To achieve this, Sall must also build the scientific workforce of his home country. He envisions an end-to-end vaccine-manufacturing hub that will help to ensure vaccine sovereignty for Africa. “We want to own our destiny and not rely on others,” he says.\n\nTrump’s cuts to international aid are stifling Africa’s HIV research\n\nHis vision has spurred young, talented Senegalese scientists to return from overseas to run MADIBA, and Sall encourages them by giving them leading roles in the initiative. “My dream is to have Africa become a leader in manufacturing and bring vaccines to the people where they are,” he says. Presidents, health ministers and billionaires, including Bill Gates and Strive Masiyiwa, a Zimbabwean business leader and philanthropist, have backed the project.\n\nThings come together\n\nThe MADIBA manufacturing complex lies on the outskirts of Dakar, amid carpets of grass and gleaming, newly paved roads. One of its large buildings, bearing the MADIBA name in bold, blue letters, houses high-performance NevoLine biomanufacturing platforms, consisting of bioreactors used for cell culture, virus manufacturing and the production of viral vaccines.\n\nOn a warm, sunny Friday in February, Sall and two site managers, Lamine Sène and Youssouf Balde, toured the five-hectare facility wearing hard hats and orange vests. Balde, a Senegalese bioengineer recruited by Sall from Canada, explains that the plant can handle various levels of production, from small bioreactors to large-scale manufacturing. And its multi-suite drug platforms, designed by the Stockholm-based company KeyPlants, mean that MADIBA has the ability to carry out pharmaceutical and biomanufacturing processes to produce drugs that go beyond viral-vaccine manufacturing. “The design includes modules for different technologies, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in case of disruptions,” such as a key supply becoming too costly, Balde says.\n\nScientists at work in a laboratory run by the Pasteur Institute of Dakar, where Amadou Sall launched his MADIBA project to support biomanufacturing in Africa.Credit: INSTITUT PASTEUR de DAKAR\n\nSall adds that, once operational, the facility will produce both liquid and freeze-dried vaccines against a range of epidemic-prone diseases, including measles, rubella, Rift Valley fever, Lassa fever and Ebola. AfricAmaril, a second plant, next to MADIBA, will use egg-based cell-culture techniques to boost the production of yellow-fever vaccine from 5 million to 30 million doses per year, to meet the needs of the continent.\n\nMADIBA’s arrival couldn’t be timelier. More people die from infectious diseases in Africa than anywhere else in the world, but the continent has lagged behind in developing the tools needed to address its health challenges. More than 90% of drugs and 99% of vaccines used by Africans are imported — a stark reality that was revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I find it so unfair that Africans are dying of some disease where there’s a solution,” Sall says.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed inequities in global vaccine distribution and highlighted the dangers of African countries relying on wealthier nations. As a result, African leaders and the African Union’s 55 member states pledged to increase the share of vaccines produced on the continent from 1% to 60% by 2040. For Balde, the pandemic was a painful reckoning. But it was also an opportunity: “Why couldn’t we have those hands [making vaccines] work within Africa?”\n\nThe end of AIDS is in sight: don’t abandon PEPFAR now\n\nAs the pandemic raged in 2021, Balde, who was working at ProMetic BioSciences in Laval, Canada, organized a virtual conference for Senegalese-diaspora scientists to discuss ways in which they could contribute to fighting the pandemic from abroad. There, he first met Sall, who presented the MADIBA concept and convinced Balde that progress can happen when Africa’s brightest minds abroad gain knowledge and then return home to build up capacity. “He didn’t claim to have all the answers, but I saw that he’s creating the space for talented individuals to contribute, to build something bigger than themselves,” says Balde. By May 2024, Balde was on the job in Senegal.\n\nThe MADIBA project kicked off in early July 2021. Such a big initiative needed hundreds of millions of dollars in international bank investments and private donations, and a land grant from Senegal’s government. Sall has won over more than a dozen major investing partners and donors, including the European Investment Bank, the European Union and the International Finance Corporation, by convincing them of the economic impacts of saving lives and building human capital.\n\nFor example, the Mastercard Foundation is bankrolling a US$45-million advanced vaccine-bioprocessing laboratory at the IPD’s campus in central Dakar; the lab also serves to train young Africans in vaccine manufacturing. The IPD’s vaccine-research centre currently has more than 50 scientists working on vaccine development, of whom about 60% have returned from overseas. Marie-Angélique Sène, the head of the centre, was recruited by Sall while completing her PhD at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. “It was a no-brainer for me. What you’ll get from the mission, you won’t get anywhere else.”\n\nHowever, getting MADIBA off the ground hasn’t been easy. As the facility tour comes to an end, Sall looks tired. “He is always working all the time,” Balde says. The job is hard, and Sall admits he has paid for it in lost sleep.\n\nBringing it home\n\nOver a lunch of yassa — a spicy Senegalese dish of braised chicken and rice, with copious onions — at a restaurant near the IPD, Sall recounts how his childhood in Dakar shaped his leadership skills.",

          "authors": "Michael Eisenstein",
          "abstract": "‘Blink and you’ll miss it’ is an understatement in the world of protein biology. A blink lasts hundreds of milliseconds. Proteins operate on a much shorter timescale — on the order of a millisecond, or even faster. “To capture many of the domain motions of proteins that are linked to function, you would have to be able to go down to a microsecond timescale,” says Ulrich Lorenz, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\nWorking on that timescale has long stymied biologists, but the rapid evolution of time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (TR cryo-EM) over the past several years has made it possible to reconstruct dynamic processes with near-atomic detail.\n\nHow protein-slayer drugs could beat some of the cruellest cancers\n\nBeyond fundamental biological insights, a deeper understanding of protein dynamics could guide the development of more effective medicines and boost protein-engineering efforts. “Time-resolved cryo-EM could be the natural choice — or only option — to capture [protein] conformations that could be potentially better targeted by drugs,” says Youdong Mao, a physicist at Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nBut the technique is niche: these methods require considerable expertise and specialized equipment, and researchers are still working out how to interpret the resulting data. “Nature is under no obligation to be simple,” cautions Radoslav Enchev, a biochemist at the Francis Crick Institute in London. And until more laboratories get the tools needed to perform TR cryo-EM, progress in this exciting field will continue to be sporadic.\n\nFrom stills to cinematography\n\nThe basics of cryo-EM are straightforward: researchers apply protein solutions to a ‘grid’ substrate and flash-freeze them into a glassy structure known as vitreous ice. Using a transmission electron microscope, they then image individual molecules in many orientations — imagine chunks of fruit embedded in jelly. Given enough examples, these 2D ‘projections’ can be reconstructed into a high-resolution 3D structure.\n\nSkilled users can produce structures sharp enough to resolve individual hydrogen atoms. But most experiments image just a single, relatively stable conformation. Structural biologist Stephen Muench at the University of Leeds, UK, struggled for years with the limitations of his cryo-EM studies of a protein known as vacuolar ATPase, a molecular motor that spins as it pumps protons across lipid membranes. “There were a lot of questions we just couldn’t answer with static structures,” says Muench.\n\nMore generally, says Lorenz, biologists have had to choose whether to achieve high resolution in time or in space. Live-cell ‘super-resolution’ experiments can visualize single proteins at millisecond timescales but cannot discern detailed structural features. Nuclear magnetic resonance can record relatively fast transitions between protein conformations with high resolution, but is limited to small targets. And although time-resolved X-ray crystallography can distinguish both atomic detail and incredibly rapid, femtosecond-scale movement, it does so in a highly constrained setting. “Protein dynamics don’t naturally occur in a crystal,” explains Lorenz.\n\nThese ‘movies’ of proteins in action are revealing the hidden biology of cells\n\nIn principle, cryo-EM provides an excellent fit for time-resolved experiments. Given enough particles, researchers could theoretically reconstruct every conformational state that a protein can assume. The trick is to get these dynamic processes to unfold in lockstep, such that the 3D reconstructions can be assembled into a molecular movie. This can be achieved by taking a sample of protein at equilibrium, introducing a ligand or other molecular trigger that initiates movement, and then rapidly freezing the sample at various times after the reaction starts.\n\nIn 1995, for instance, Nigel Unwin, a structural biologist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, prepared a grid with the receptor for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and sprayed it with a solution containing acetylcholine1. By quickly freezing the mixture, Unwin captured changes that occurred in the receptor within five milliseconds of acetylcholine binding. Cryo-EM spatial resolution was poor in those days, but other groups have subsequently leveraged similar ‘spray-and-mix’ approaches to produce detailed dynamic reconstructions with modern, high-resolution instruments.\n\nHowever, spray-and-mix methods can also introduce considerable uncertainty owing to inefficient mixing between protein and ligand. “Diffusion is happening, so nothing is really under control,” says Joachim Frank, a biophysicist at Columbia University in New York City, who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pivotal role in advancing cryo-EM for structural biology. “We wanted to develop a method in which we have control of everything.”\n\nAs an alternative, Frank’s group began working on polymer-based microfluidic chips containing tiny channels, within which a protein and its ligand can be precisely mixed before being sprayed onto a grid and frozen. They described their first-generation instrument in 20152, and several other groups have subsequently devised alternative ‘mix-and-spray’ systems.\n\nA microfluidic chip comprising three parts: a micromixer, a microreactor and a microsprayer.Credit: S. Bhattacharjee et al./Cell\n\nContemporary chips incorporate precisely engineered, zigzagging channels for rapid, efficient sample mixing and smooth fluid flow, and mix-and-spray has become the method of choice for many TR cryo-EM practitioners. Last year, for example, Frank and his colleagues used their latest-generation microfluidic design to study how ribosomes are recycled after protein synthesis to begin translation of a new polypeptide chain3. “We can see how the ribosome is opened up like a clam-shell upon the interaction with a particular molecule that pries the whole thing open,” says Frank. In April, Muench and his collaborators employed their own mix-and-spray system to study actomyosin complexes from muscle fibres, revealing crucial details about how the myosin protein stores and subsequently releases the energy that powers muscle contraction over the course of 120 milliseconds4.\n\nStill, there’s plenty of room for improvement. For one thing, microfluidics-based sample preparation requires a lot of material. “In freezing one time point, you consume several microlitres of sample, which normally is all the protein you can purify over several months,” says Mao. His team pursued an alternative approach to study the protein-degrading proteasome complex, using reaction conditions that slowed proteasome activity to a crawl so that time-resolved data could be collected using more conventional cryo-EM methods.\n\nAn evolving landscape\n\nResearchers led by Rouslan Efremov, a structural biologist at the VIB-VUB Center for Structural Biology in Brussels, have devised a mix-and-spray system that reduces sample-size requirements by an order of magnitude. Their microfluidic device mixes a protein and a ligand in tiny droplets, allowing them to rapidly react in a confined space before they are launched onto the grid using a laser-based mechanism5. “The main advantage is that this consumes only about 100 nanolitres per grid,” says Efremov, who has used this approach to study complexes that are responsible for protein folding and bacterial metabolism.\n\nFaster frame rates are also in demand. Existing microfluidic approaches have a ‘speed limit’ of around 5 milliseconds, and although many conformational changes occur in this time frame, others do not. Furthermore, millisecond-scale resolution preferentially captures major intermediates and endpoints for a protein conformational change but misses shorter-lived transition states that are essential for understanding the events leading up to that change.\n\nCatching proteins at play: the method revealing the cell’s inner mysteries\n\nLorenz’s group took a gamble in its bid to break the millisecond barrier6. First, the researchers freeze their protein sample on a grid in the presence of an inactive, chemically ‘caged’ ligand or activator. The frozen sample is then illuminated with a laser to release the activator compound, after which a second beam is used to quickly melt the ice. After an appropriate interval, the sample is rapidly refrozen, capturing conformational changes occurring in as few as 5 microseconds.\n\nRemarkably, this melting and revitrification strategy does not seem to negatively affect proteins, and Lorenz notes that it can even improve the resolution of the 3D reconstruction by knocking the protein particles into a wider range of orientations. His team is currently using this method to study a variety of viruses and investigate how rapid conformational changes by viral proteins aid host-cell infection. And even faster snapshots might be in reach. “I think 10 nanoseconds or so should be easily possible,” says Lorenz, adding that such resolution could capture ultra-fast events, such as the folding of protein structural domains.\n\nWhen it comes to TR cryo-EM, even minor details matter. For example, the ice layer on the grid needs to be thick enough to protect the proteins from air, which can damage molecules and render them uninterpretable, but also thin enough to maximize image contrast. In a preprint published in April, Enchev and his colleagues presented a platform called Chronobot to tackle this problem7. Here, samples are mixed in a reusable glass microfluidic chip and then sprayed onto the grid, which is imaged with a high-speed camera immediately before freezing. A deep-learning algorithm then assesses the ice quality in each sector of the grid while also optimizing future sample-preparation conditions on the basis of those results. This helps the team to avoid wasting valuable instrument time on bad samples. “This rapid iteration away from the expensive microscope allows us to make sure that we would get a high-resolution data set of any grid that passes this quality control,” says Enchev.\n\nGetting things in order",

          "abstract": "A residential area damaged by missile strikes in Rehovot, which also affected parts of the Weizmann Institute of Science.Credit: Abir Sultan/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nMissile attacks have damaged laboratories and hampered scientists’ ability to do research in both Israel and Iran, as the conflict between the two countries enters its fifth day. In Iran, at least 224 people have been killed; in Israel, 24 have been killed, according to media reports.\n\nIsrael launched strikes against several Iranian cities early on 13 June, targeting nuclear facilities and killing several Iranian commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran — which is in talks with the United States about its nuclear programme — retaliated later that day, launching drone and missile attacks at sites across Israel. Both countries have since continued strikes.\n\nBiologist Jacob Hanna was about to give a talk on a new technique for developing stem-cell-based mouse embryos at a conference in Hong Kong when his phone pinged with the news that Israel had attacked Iran.\n\n“That threw me off balance a little,” says Hanna. Hours earlier, he had been informed by his university, the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, to evacuate all facilities, while his students scrambled to finish an experiment requested during the review process for a paper.\n\nFlights to Israel had been canceled, so Hanna travelled to London to stay with a friend until he could work out how to get home. On that flight, he learnt from students that his lab had been damaged by a missile strike in retaliatory attacks launched by Iran. The Weizmann Institute is considered by Iran to be a military target.\n\nExtensive damage\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the strike, there was shattered glass everywhere, the computers weren’t turning on, incubators fell and the power went out. In one lab, the ceiling had collapsed, and the staircase had detached, Hanna was told. His students managed to save hundreds of frozen mouse and human cell lines by transferring them to back-up liquid-nitrogen tanks that Hanna had stored in the basement. “I was always worried that if a war actually happens, I don’t want to lose these.”\n\nHe now plans to fly to Jordan and then drive to Israel from there. The damage to the lab has probably set his research back about six months, he says.\n\nIn a message to researchers seen by Nature, the Weizmann Institute said the strike had caused “substantial damage” and affected most buildings. It advised that only authorized people are allowed on campus until further notice.\n\nA spokesperson for the institute says that it is “in contact with the relevant security and emergency agencies, and is taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety of employees and the campus”.\n\nSerious restrictions\n\nResearchers in Iran have also been affected by the escalating conflict. They are avoiding in-person meetings at universities and have taken their work online, out of fear that their universities and research institutes could become military targets, says Abbas Edalat, a British–Iranian computer scientist and mathematician at Imperial College London. “It is a serious restriction” because researchers won’t be able to continue their lab experiments, he says. The disruption comes on the back of years of on-and-off international economic sanctions that have hindered academics’ ability to do research and travel to conferences, says Edalat. Iranian science is “paying a high price”, says Encieh Erfani, an Iranian cosmologist now at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada.",

          "authors": "Julian Kirchherr",
          "abstract": "Looking for greater real-world impact as a circular-economy researcher, Julian Kirchherr now works across management consultancy and academia.Credit: Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty\n\nWhen I was growing up, many teenagers dreamed of becoming a chief executive, but I always wanted to be a professor. I imagined writing papers that would shape how businesses operate and how governments think. But roughly a decade later, as a 28-year-old assistant professor of business sustainability, I found myself standing for too long in the shower one day, feeling beaten down and generally out of control. I was caught in a system that demanded ever more grant applications and highly cited papers.\n\nIt was September 2017, nine months into my tenure-track position at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and I had just published an analysis of many of the ways in which the circular economy has been conceptualized1. The circular-economy model is broadly about using resources more efficiently to support sustainable development, although interpretations vary. Many praised my article as the most nuanced analysis of the concept so far. Yet, to me, it encapsulated everything I found frustrating about academia: scholars were applauding conceptual work, but I wanted to have real-world impact. There had to be a better way.\n\nCareers advice from scientists in industry\n\nEarlier in my career, I had worked as a management consultant at the Berlin office of a firm called McKinsey, which had helped to fund the PhD I needed for a career in academia. Despite some initial scepticism, I came to admire the company’s results-driven culture. Consultants, despite all the jokes, have to deliver impact, or they are not hired again. So, in early 2018, 14 months into my tenure-track post, I resigned and returned to McKinsey.\n\nBut my resignation from academia was only partial. I had secured research funding, which gave me the flexibility to negotiate a 10% academic role at Utrecht. And that is how my life as a ‘pracademic’ began.\n\nA foot in both camps\n\nA pracademic is someone with one foot in academia and the other in practice, and I stumbled across the term one day while procrastinating on LinkedIn. Although new to me then, the term has been around for at least 25 years.\n\nWhen I rejoined McKinsey, I started in a relatively junior role. At first, I kept my academic work mostly quiet. Consulting has an all-in culture, and I worried that a side gig might raise doubts about my commitment. Only in late 2022, after being elected a partner who holds equity in the firm, did I begin to speak openly about my dual path.\n\nThat shift helped to unlock synergies between my roles. Some ideas I explored at the university started to shape my consulting work — and vice versa. However, it did not start out this way. Originally, I had imagined carving out Fridays for research, hoping that insights from those days would inform my consulting work in the week that followed. But that plan quickly unravelled. Consulting is unpredictable, and Fridays rarely stayed free for research.\n\nAnd few clients were interested in my circular-economy work, so I developed expertise in a very different area. One of my first projects after returning to McKinsey involved helping a government to rethink how to attract and retain talent in the public sector — including how to design career paths. Unsurprisingly, I advocated greater flexibility. These topics stuck with me, and today I mostly specialize in what McKinsey calls ‘people and organizational performance’.\n\nBuilding a circular economy\n\nAlthough most of my consulting work has little to do with my academic research, I value being a pracademic. Above all, I appreciate the freedom to follow ideas that genuinely interest me — and I feel most alive as a scholar when writing about them. Some of my work is highly applied. For example, I have collaborated with the European Commission on making the hydrogen ‘value chain’ more circular2, which is integral for Europe’s decarbonization goals. The value chain covers everything involved in hydrogen production, including the equipment used along the way. The project explored measures such as setting recycling targets for rare metals — including iridium, which is essential for hydrogen production.\n\nLiving in two professional worlds also sparks fresh ideas for my research. At McKinsey, I frequently help organizations to develop skill taxonomies — frameworks that define the essential workplace competencies that employees need to perform effectively in their roles. That work inspired a research paper on skill taxonomies for businesses transitioning to a circular economy3. Several companies now use it to shape job ads and training programmes.\n\nTaking a prod at ‘productivity’\n\nBeing a pracademic has also allowed me to be more controversial. My most-read paper — titled Bullshit in the Sustainability and Transitions Literature: A Provocation4 — mocks the tendency of many scholars to chase citations over genuine insight. Numerous academics praised it, but some found it too harsh. Had I stayed on the conventional academic path, I might have been too wary of that criticism to write the article at all.\n\nPerhaps because of this freedom, I’ve also had academic success: my Google Scholar profile is approaching 20,000 citations, and Stanford University’s database ranks me in the top 1% of scientists globally in terms of citation impact. More meaningfully, my research has been featured in more than 200 policy reports by institutions including the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nI maintain that my academic work offers a strong return on investment for any university that keeps me on the payroll. At McKinsey, the value might be less obvious at times, given my content focus, although from time to time I develop consulting work that’s rooted in my research. For instance, some months ago, I proposed to the governing body of a large city a project to transform it into a ‘circular city’ — an idea that those involved have now agreed to pursue. The work will focus on reducing the use of resources and improving reuse and recycling, drawing on insights from a research project that I continue to lead.",

          "authors": "Tim Kalvelage",
          "abstract": "Eight hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, the research vessel Kronprins Haakon drifts quietly through a thick pack of ice floes. The sky and sea are bathed in purple morning light as Alexandra Stephens, a PhD student at the University of Toronto Mississauga, Canada, pilots a drone over the frosty expanse, hunting for heat.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t look like it, the Arctic waters are balmy in February, relative to the air temperatures, which can fall below −30 °C. On the screen of Stephens’s remote control, the pancake-shaped floes show up in the thermal images as dark circles, whereas open water and thin ice glow bright orange, indicating energy escaping from the ocean into the frigid polar air.\n\nThe transfer of heat from ocean to atmosphere is at the heart of one of the most important components of Earth’s climate — a system of currents that snakes across the entire length of the Atlantic Ocean and transports warm water from the tropics to high northern latitudes. Known by the unwieldy name of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), this network of currents affects weather conditions for billions of people around the world. It’s the reason that north-western Europe is relatively mild in the winter and much warmer than Labrador in Canada, which is at a similar latitude.\n\nAlexandra Stephens pilots a drone that collects data on heat escaping from the ocean.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nBut scientists are increasingly concerned that this crucial current system is weakening as the planet is getting hotter because of greenhouse-gas pollution building up in the atmosphere. Some computer climate simulations warn that the AMOC could reach a tipping point in the twenty-first century and lose much of its strength. This would have catastrophic impacts across the globe; one study published last year projects that temperatures in north-western Europe could drop by as much as 15 °C, plunging the region into a new ice age, while the southern hemisphere would suffer more severe warming1. It also suggests that a near-collapse of the AMOC would drive disruptive changes in rainfall in the Amazon basin. “The effects of an AMOC collapse will be so extreme that it will be difficult for us to adapt,” says physical oceanographer Henk Dijkstra at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, a co-author of the study.\n\nDespite its importance, the AMOC is one of the big unknowns in projections about Earth‘s future climate. Researchers have little information about how the current system is changing — particularly in the polar North Atlantic, a key region for the AMOC. That’s what brought the Norwegian ice-breaker RV Kronprins Haakon to the western Greenland Sea in February as part of a project known as ROVER, which is funded by the European Union. With its strengthened hull, the ship can venture into the ice-covered region to collect precious data on how the AMOC might evolve.\n\nOn the bridge of Kronprins Haakon at dawn, chief scientist Kjetil Våge (left) and captain Hallgeir M. Johansen discuss the route through the sea ice. Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\n“This is a very sparsely sampled area, especially in winter when hardly anyone ever goes out here,” says Kjetil Våge, a physical oceanographer at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway, who is leading the ROVER mission. He suspects the loss of sea ice near Greenland caused by global warming might actually help to stabilize the AMOC and prevent it from slowing as much as people fear.\n\nI joined the ROVER expedition in February as it collected data that will take the pulse of the AMOC and help researchers to assess how it will change in coming decades.\n\nCrossing currents\n\nAs the RV Kronprins Haakon left Norway’s Svalbard archipelago at the start of the expedition, the Arctic was still veiled in the perpetual darkness of the polar night. The far-reaching influence of the AMOC was obvious as we crossed Fram Strait, which separates Svalbard and Greenland (see ‘Winter journey’). On the first part of the journey, the ship passed through northward-flowing Atlantic waters that kept the ocean ice free. As we left that current, the Kronprins Haakon quickly encountered heavy pack ice from the Arctic Ocean drifting south.\n\nSources: Bathymetry: GEBCO; Ice extent and glaciers: NSIDC; Greenland ice sheet: ESA Glaciers CCI; Cruise data: Kjetil Våge\n\nThe AMOC is often described as a conveyor belt — a highly simplified but apt description because its upper currents and deeper ones move in opposite directions. In the Northern Hemisphere, the surface strands, which include the Gulf Stream, carry warm and salty water from the equator towards the pole. At high latitudes that water releases huge amounts of heat into the atmosphere that helps to warm parts of Europe in winter.\n\nWhen the surface water of the AMOC cools off, it becomes dense enough to sink into the abyss in the North Atlantic near Greenland, which locks away huge amounts of carbon dioxide and supplies oxygen to the deep sea. At depth, the water flows south until it resurfaces again near Antarctica (see ‘Heat flows’).\n\nSources: S. Rahmstorf Oceanography 37, 16–29 (2024)/R. Curry and C. Mauritzen Science 308, 1772–1774 (2005)\n\nComputer climate simulations suggest that global warming could disrupt the current system in several ways: as air temperatures in the Arctic and subarctic increase, the surface water doesn’t cool as much in winter, which keeps it from getting as dense as it normally would. Another factor at play is the melting of sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet. This melting adds fresh water to the uppermost ocean, reducing the density of the surface water even more. These changes inhibit the sinking that drives the AMOC2.\n\nIt’s not just a theoretical concern that this could happen: evidence from Earth’s past suggests that there were abrupt shifts in the strength of the AMOC between ice ages and warm periods3.\n\nConcerns about the future prompted scientists to start monitoring the Atlantic Ocean in the early 2000s. To track what is happening with the AMOC, international research consortia have anchored instruments to the sea bed at various latitudes across the ocean’s basin to measure water temperature, salinity and current speed. The longest-running programme, RAPID-MOCHA, has gauged the strength of surface and deep-ocean currents of the AMOC since 2004 in the subtropics at 26° N. Another effort, called OSNAP, monitors the AMOC at more than 50 sites from Labrador to South Greenland to Scotland.\n\nSo far, their records show considerable variability but no consistent changes in how much water the AMOC moves4,5. The time span of the observations is simply too short to make out a trend, says Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, and head of OSNAP. “We are in this messy middle of trying to understand what is happening with the overturning circulation.”\n\nThe ship travels through the pack ice of the Greenland Sea near 76° N at dawn.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nBecause researchers have only two decades of direct current measurements, they rely on indirect means of gauging the strength of the AMOC. For example, records of sea surface temperatures show that the subpolar North Atlantic has cooled since the 1950s while the ocean as a whole has warmed: some scientists interpret the cooling as a sign of a reduction in the amount of warm water from the subtropics reaching the region, which would correspond to a 15% decline in the strength of this current system6. Others, however, have found the AMOC to be stable for the past few decades7.\n\nSeveral modelling studies in the past few years warn that the AMOC could weaken drastically in the near future — up to the point of causing a near-shutdown. A collapse would not happen abruptly but would take 50–100 years, says Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany. Beyond a crucial tipping point, however, a further decline is unstoppable. “I think there is a 50–50 chance that we will pass the tipping point this century,” he says.\n\nThe idea that the AMOC is heading for collapse is controversial. The question is, can climate models realistically simulate the present and therefore produce reliable forecasts? To do so, scientists need observations to evaluate and refine their models, says Ben Moat, a physical oceanographer at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, and one of the heads of RAPID-MOCHA. “Observations are critical to our understanding of what‘s happening to the future AMOC.”\n\nScientists deploy a buoy in the Greenland Sea to study sea ice.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nVåge thinks that processes in the Nordic Seas north of Iceland, which are not well resolved by current climate models, could help to decide the fate of the AMOC. That’s why his team ventured into the icy waters of the Arctic in February.\n\nHidden heat\n\nEarly one afternoon, the Kronprins Haakon stops some 250 kilometres off the coast of Greenland. The ship’s crew opens a large hydraulic hatch in the hangar on the main deck and lowers a metal frame carrying 24 empty bottles and a suite of sensors, called a CTD rosette, into the ocean. Doctoral student Erika Giorgi at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research watches the data coming back from the CTD rosette as it sinks to a depth of 2,090 metres. “It’s exciting to be out here in winter and see these measurements in real time,” she says. The temperature of the water climbs from −1.8 °C at the surface — the freezing point of seawater — to about 2 °C at 200 metres, before dropping again to below zero towards the bottom.\n\nA device called a CTD rosette collects water samples and measures current flows and other properties.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\n\nThe layer of relatively warm and salty water is what interests the researchers the most. It is water that had previously flowed north through the Atlantic, taken a U-turn in Fram Strait or made a loop around the Arctic Ocean and is now travelling south in the East Greenland Current. As it continues west of Iceland, the dense subsurface water of this current crosses a marine mountain ridge and cascades down into the abyssal North Atlantic. This makes it a major source for the deep branch of the AMOC and one of the prime subjects that the ROVER project aims to study.\n\nIn the past, the East Greenland Current has been fully covered by sea ice in winter, which allowed little heat to escape from the ocean. But with rising temperatures in the past few decades, the wintertime ice cover in this region has been shrinking. This is exposing the East Greenland Current to extremely cold polar air, which could help to spur water to sink — a crucial part of the overturning circulation. For Giorgi, this possibility provides “a glimmer of hope” compared with the mostly gloomy future scenarios of the AMOC.\n\nVåge suggests that deep-water formation driven by intense heat loss in this region could make the AMOC more resilient to climate change than some researchers have assumed. He points to some pilot data from a previous study8 that support his hypothesis of enhanced heat loss along the East Greenland Current. “But we do not know how much or how important it is,” he says.\n\nChief scientist Kjetil Våge on deck in the ice-covered Greenland Sea.Credit: Tim Kalvelage\nInto the wild",

Director Steven Spielberg’s creation entertained and terrified in equal measure, and brought about an enduring change in how we perceive sharks.\n\nDavid Shiffman is a marine conservation biologist based in Washington DC, and the author of Why Sharks Matter (2022). He spoke to Nature about how Jaws influenced the public perception of sharks and the importance of protecting marine life.\n\nHow did Jaws affect the public’s opinion of sharks?\n\nThere are some people who were afraid to even go into ankle-deep ocean water the summer Jaws came out. My mom says she didn’t want to go swimming at a pool. Around the same time, Star Wars came out, and no one was afraid that the Death Star was going to blow up Earth.\n\nA colleague of mine coined the ‘Jaws effect’, which is now used in public-policy literature to explain how fictional portrayals of real-world issues impact what voters want leaders to do about those issues.\n\nHas public opinion changed in the 50 years since Jaws was released?\n\nMore people now love sharks, are aware of shark conservation and want to help sharks than ever before. But there’s still widespread fear, and in some cases it’s quite pseudoscientific in nature.\n\nHow do these negative perceptions influence shark conservation?\n\nSharks were swimming in the ocean before there were trees on land and before Saturn had its rings. And in the past 50 years, they’ve experienced some of the worst population declines in their 400-million-year-plus history.\n\nUnsustainable fishing practices are the largest threat to marine biodiversity. To save the ocean as a whole, including but not limited to sharks, we need to do more sustainable fisheries management. Scientists and environmental advocates in many cases know what we should do, but we're not the ones in charge. We need to convince policymakers to make changes to conservation policy, and that requires public support.\n\nWhen fear and panic aren’t ruling our emotions, it’s clear that we should be trying to protect these animals, not trying to eradicate them.\n\nThe film Jaws was released in the United States on 20 June 1975.Credit: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy\nWhy is shark conservation so important?\n\nHumans depend on the oceans, which provide billions of people with a major source of food and tens of millions with employment and job security. To have a healthy food chain, you need to have a healthy top of the food chain. When we lose predators, the whole system can unravel.\n\nHow can we change public opinion on sharks?\n\nPart of the problem is that most people hear about sharks only in the context of inflammatory media coverage or pseudoscientific nonsense.\n\nYearly, more people are bitten by other people on the New York City subway system than are bitten by sharks in the whole world.\n\nThe media and popular press definitely have a role to play. It would be great if they would educate about real things or at the very least stop saying nonsense.",

          "abstract": "The killswitch (bottom row) inhibits partitioning of an adenovirus protein (green) into condensates (magenta).Credit: Y. Zhang et al./Nature Comm.\n\nThey’re small, elusive and crucial to cellular organization. Now, scientists have found a way to jam the inner workings of biomolecular condensates — membrane-free droplets that coordinate key reactions in cells.\n\nA synthetic ‘killswitch’ protein, just 17 amino acids long, can be dropped into these liquid-like compartments to selectively disrupt their function and pause the molecular traffic within.\n\nDescribed on 4 June in Nature1, the approach gives researchers a previously unattainable handle on difficult-to-study cellular structures linked to cancer, viral replication, gene expression and more. Just as importantly, the tool could open the door to a new class of therapeutic strategies that target not just individual molecules in cells, but the dynamic environments that sustain them.\n\n“This offers a powerful tool to selectively affect dynamic properties at each individual condensate,” says Rick Young, a biologist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “That’s a frontier kind of thing — it’s going to be extremely valuable.”\n\nCondensate control\n\nBiomolecular condensates are a relatively recent addition to the cell-biology lexicon, emerging from a concept just 16 years old and terminology that is less than half that age. Unlike membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus or mitochondria, these compartments form spontaneously through a process known as phase separation — much like oil forming droplets in water.\n\nProteins and RNA molecules coalesce into viscous structures that concentrate specific molecules and exclude others. This organization lets cells choreograph complex tasks — transcribing genes, splicing RNA or orchestrating stress responses — with remarkable efficiency and spatial precision.\n\nYet, probing these structures has proved tricky. Most tools available to researchers either dissolve all condensates indiscriminately or involve manipulations that alter more than the targeted structure, often triggering compensatory changes across the cell.\n\nThe killswitch, by contrast, is more surgical. It doesn’t dissolve condensates or prevent them from forming. Instead, it infiltrates and fixes them in place, transforming dynamic assemblies into static ones.\n\n“You basically just superglue the targeted protein in condensates,” explains Denes Hnisz, a biochemist at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Genetics in Berlin, who co-led the study.\n\nStuck in place\n\nArmed with a nanobody-based delivery system, the killswitch can then be steered towards specific condensates in living cells, arresting proteins that once moved freely and revealing how the physical properties of these droplets shape their biochemical roles. “It enables us to really change the emergent properties of condensates,” Hnisz says.\n\nFocusing on the nucleolus — a droplet-like structure involved in producing the cell’s protein-making machinery — Hnisz and his colleagues showed that immobilizing one of its key scaffolding proteins disrupted its internal dynamics and molecular composition, unexpectedly causing some components to be excluded from the structure entirely.\n\nThe researchers also applied the killswitch in two disease-specific contexts. In leukaemia cells, targeting condensates formed by cancer-driving protein fusions rapidly reduced the proliferation of malignant cells in mice. In virus-infected cells, directing the killswitch to condensates involved in viral assembly sharply curtailed the production of infectious particles.\n\nDroplets to drugs\n\nSuch findings hint at therapeutic opportunities in the growing field of condensate-targeted drug discovery.\n\n“You can imagine using this rationale to design a cell-penetrating peptide that homes to a specific disease-driving condensate and changes its emergent properties,” says Isaac Klein, chief scientific officer of Dewpoint Therapeutics, a condensate-focused drug company in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAlternatively, notes Klein, the killswitch could serve as a drug-discovery tool — for example, to identify compounds that alter condensate properties in similar ways. “It sets the stage for it,” he says.",

Now scientists are taking what they have learnt from these animals and are applying that knowledge to human cells, thanks to advances in genomics, proteomics and imaging at the level of the single cell.\n\n“There’s a big push right now to exploit super-healing species and to try to see how quickly we can translate those findings,” says Albert Almada, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nSeveral research teams presented their latest findings at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong last week.\n\nZebrafish spines\n\nA zebrafish (Danio rerio) with a severed spinal cord can go from being paralysed to moving fluidly in eight weeks. Mayssa Mokalled, who studies tissue regeneration and stem-cell biology at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and her colleagues have identified a population of cells in the zebrafish that are important for this recovery — and these cells are similar to human fetal astrocytes. After an injury, astrocytes create a protective barrier around the damaged site, but can also inhibit neuronal repair.\n\nMokalled and her colleagues looked for molecules involved in the activation of the cells that induce regeneration in zebrafish. When the team introduced the same molecules into human astrocytes, the cells started to look and behave more like those of the zebrafish. In preliminary studies in which the researchers transplanted the transformed human cells into mice, the cells seemed more effective at creating the protective barrier, but the inhibitory post-injury response was reduced. “I would love to see this go all the way to therapy,” says Mokalled.\n\nLizard tails\n\nBut the evolutionary distance between zebrafish and humans is wide. Almada is instead looking at the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Lizards are the closest living relative to humans that is able to regenerate an entire appendage. Humans and lizards share many of the same genes. “We think it’ll be more translatable to human biology, because they have a lot of the same machineries at the DNA level,” says Almada.\n\nAt the conference, Almada described how a population of muscle stem cells in lizards regenerates the animal’s tail. The cells are similar to those found in mice and humans, except that the lizard version can make muscle tissue from scratch, which the mouse and human versions cannot, he says. Almada hopes to work out how the lizard cells achieve this feat and eventually apply that to muscle growth in humans to treat degenerative muscular diseases, strengthen muscles in older people and treat wounds.",

          "abstract": "Rao Yi is a leading reformer of science and education in China. Rao began his career in the United States in the 1980s. After he returned to China in 2007, he introduced practices that have revitalized life-sciences research in the country, including the use of tenure and of peer review to evaluate academics’ merits. Now based at Peking University in Beijing, he runs a leading brain-research laboratory, and holds other leadership positions.\n\nHe’s also famously outspoken. In 2008, Rao renounced his US passport to protest against policies brought in by former president George W. Bush after the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. Rao criticized US policies during the COVID-19 pandemic after his uncle died in New York, and vehemently rejected the lab-leak theory. And he is an energetic advocate for China’s talent-recruitment schemes.\n\nNature asked Rao how he sees China’s role in the life sciences — and what could make China into a biotechnology superpower.\n\nAccording to the Nature Index, China is less strong in life sciences than in physical sciences. Why is that?\n\nIn mathematics, physics and chemistry, Chinese funding has caught up with that of the United States, or almost. But the number of biomedical scientists supported by research funding in China is lower than in the United States, because the latter has the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest source of medical-research funding in the world. The lag in papers is almost proportional to the funding difference.\n\nHow China is vying to attract the world’s top scientific talent\n\nChina will remain behind the United States as long as it does not have an NIH equivalent. If the administration of US President Donald Trump keeps cutting funds for the NIH and NIH-supported institutions, including Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Columbia University in New York City, then China will catch up or surpass the United States soon.\n\nIn plant biology, China is now ahead of the United States, according to the Nature Index, again because of funding levels — in this case, much larger in China. The nation has long been worried about food security and has invested more in plant-related research than any other country has.\n\nHow can China become a leader in biotechnology innovation?\n\nIt will take both funding and real reform for China to surpass the United States in biomedical sciences. The main problem hindering Chinese science is that competing influences such as personal relationships go against merit, rigour and excellence. A system selecting and supporting the best scientists who are willing to work for Chinese development is key. If China allows mediocrity to prevail, then it might overtake the United States in quantity of papers, but not in quality.\n\nA researcher in Rao Yi’s brain lab at Peking University in Beijing.Credit: Andrea Verdelli\n\nFor example, in 1950, when the People’s Republic of China was new and internationally trained Chinese doctoral scholars were few, many of those in scientific and educational leadership positions — from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) to Peking and Tsinghua Universities in Beijing — had doctorates from other countries. After the Cultural Revolution in 1976, this remained the case.\n\nIf you look at the same leadership layer now, the number who obtained their PhDs abroad is low. At the CAS, the president and vice-presidents all have PhDs from Chinese institutes. Yet China is trying hard to get the best scientists, especially those with doctorates from top international universities.\n\nWhich biotech fields might China excel in by 2050?\n\nIf allowed to speculate, I would predict that Chinese biotech will take off in agriculture, with new kinds of seed. As for the biomedical sphere, my predictions would be gene therapy, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic diseases and cancer, helped by artificial intelligence (AI) and Chinese omics databanks.\n\nChina is lagging behind the United States in precision medicine because China is weak in human-genetics research, although overly abundant in less-meaningful DNA sequencing. Gene therapy is different: the United States is hesitating, which provides China with an opportunity.",

That’s the subject of a thought experiment published by researchers today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nThe answer: “As early as 1885,” says study co-author Benjamin Santer, an independent climate scientist based in Los Angeles, California. That’s when researchers could have “confidently disentangled” a human-caused signal of climate change from natural variations, or noise, in the data, he says.\n\nScientists Eunice Newton Foote and John Tyndall first discovered the heat-absorbing effects of carbon dioxide in experiments they ran independently in the 1850s. But it wasn’t until more than a century later that the scientific community agreed it was clear that rising emissions of CO2 and other gases were causing Earth to warm.\n\nSanter and his colleagues, however, now say that unmistakable signs of human-caused, or anthropogenic, climate change would already have been around before the end of the nineteenth century — a time when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were starting to rise because of the Industrial Revolution in Europe, but were still much lower than today. And such signs would have been detectable, if modern technology were available then.\n\nModelling the past\n\nWater vapour, CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels pump these gases into the air, warming the lower layer of the atmosphere. But greenhouse gases have the opposite effect on the layer above this one, which is called the stratosphere and starts around 7 kilometres above Earth’s surface. As the lower layer holds in Earth’s warmth, less infrared radiation reaches the stratosphere, and it cools.\n\nTo carry out their thought experiment, the authors decided to focus on the predicted cooling of the mid-to-upper stratosphere, which is less affected by fluctuations from weather patterns than the warming of the lower atmosphere. Temperatures in the stratosphere are typically measured using Earth-sensing satellites, such as those operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThree ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky",

The method resulted in baby mice with a sprinkling of human cells in their intestines, liver and brain. But researchers say that, for the technique to be useful, more work needs to be done to increase the proportion of human cells that grow in the organs.\n\nHuman–animal chimaeras are an exciting yet challenging area of research. Human cells are coaxed to grow in animal embryos, allowing researchers to study human tissue development. But the long-term goal of the work is to grow human organs that can be harvested for transplantation.\n\nThe latest technique, presented at the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting in Hong Kong on 12 June, could be “game-changing” for the field, says Hideki Masaki, a stem-cell scientist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, who attended the session. The data have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nTo create chimaeras, researchers typically introduce human stem cells into embryos of another species, often pigs or mice, growing in a dish. But one of the challenges with this technique is that not many human cells survive, and those that do, do not endure for long. And the injected cells are pluripotent, meaning that they could theoretically develop into any cell type in the body — a process that researchers have to find ways of controlling.\n\nXiling Shen, a biomedical engineer at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, wanted to look for ways of improving these techniques to ensure that more human cells survive the procedure, and that they target specific organs. He and Qiang Huang, a developmental biologist at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation in Los Angeles, California, and their colleagues thought that the human cells might be more resilient if they were allowed to mature into 3D human-tissue models, known as organoids, before injection.\n\n‘Crazy’ experiment\n\nThe team used reprogrammed stem cells to grow human organoids of the gut, liver and brain in a dish. Shen says the researchers then injected the organoids into the amniotic fluid of female mice carrying early-stage embryos. “We didn’t even break the embryonic wall” to introduce the cells to the embryos, says Shen. The female mice carried the embryos to term.\n\n“It’s a crazy experiment; I didn’t expect anything,” says Shen.\n\nWithin days of being injected into the mouse amniotic fluid, the human cells begin to infiltrate the growing embryos and multiply, but only in the organ they belonged to: gut organoids in the intestines; liver organoids in the liver; and cerebral organoids in the cortex region of the brain. One month after the mouse pups were born, the researchers found that roughly 10% of them contained human cells in their intestines — making up about 1% of intestinal cells. “You get sections of the intestine that originate from injected human organoids,” says Shen. The proportion of human cells was lower in the liver and brain. Overall, success rates were low, says Shen, who is seeking ways to boost them.\n\nThe human cells seemed to be functioning. For example, the human liver cells produced human albumin, a common liver protein. And the cells were still present two months after birth, says Shen. “These cells are pretty stable.”",

          "abstract": "Findings from clinical trials and other studies are summarized in systematic reviews, which guide policy decisions.Credit: Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty\n\nScientists say they have used artificial intelligence (AI) to reproduce 12 systematic reviews in two days — slashing the time it takes to produce these ‘gold-standard’ studies, which bring together the results of multiple publications and normally take many months to do.\n\nThe new system, described in a preprint posted on medRxiv last week1, could help to accelerate the production of influential reviews used by doctors and policymakers, its developers say. Using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate two laborious steps in the systematic-review process allowed the team to rapidly reproduce a dozen Cochrane reviews — a particularly rigorous type of study — and even to update a review in just 20 minutes, says co-author Christian Cao, a medical student at the University of Toronto, Canada.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\n“It’s crazy to see that in the time I get a coffee, a systematic review would be done,” says Cao. He and two of his collaborators have started a spin-off company called otto review to turn their methods into a commercial software platform.\n\nBut other researchers are sceptical that the technology can accelerate the process as much as its creators suggest. They point out that the team has not yet automated some major tasks, and that the system needs to be tested independently — which would require more details of the study to be released. “For a scientific paper, its claims need to be verifiable — and I can’t verify it,” says James Thomas, a systematic-review specialist at University College London.\n\nLengthy task\n\nSystematic reviews are important because they can make sense of many academic studies such as clinical trials by combining their results. They underlie the guidelines used in medical practice worldwide and are increasingly used to guide decisions in policy, education and elsewhere.\n\nBut doing a systematic review is a chore. It involves searching academic databases to find potentially thousands of relevant studies, screening them to pull out the handful of most pertinent ones, assessing if they could be biased or untrustworthy, and extracting and analysing the data, often using a statistical technique called a metanalysis. The process takes months — sometimes years — and costs well over $100,000 per review, according to one estimate, which is why many systematic reviews are not kept up to date.\n\nScientists are building giant ‘evidence banks’ to create policies that actually work\n\nResearchers have long used software to help, but the last few years has seen a surge of interest in using LLMs to automate parts of the task. “This field is awash with hypey claims from companies,” says Justin Clark, who builds automated review tools at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia.",

The current focus by practitioners on ‘social listening’ as the primary mechanism for detecting these harms is flawed, and we argue that mechanisms that effectively integrate and contextualize both offline and online data streams are required. We therefore outline a blueprint for a new model, the Community-Centered Exploration, Engagement, and Evaluation system. It draws on lessons learned from integrated epidemiological surveillance systems that merge multiple data streams. Such an approach can help detect and mitigate potential information harms, integrating community participation and response at its core. This community-driven model is designed to counteract the growing public distrust across a range of issues including public health, election integrity and climate.",

Counterintuitively, observers had more accurate beliefs about non-kin pairs, especially when the observers were popular, middle-aged, or educated. Observers were less able to accurately judge ties across different religions or wealth. Individuals in villages that cultivate coffee, requiring coordinated effort, demonstrated greater bias to view networks as connected.

Here we report excavation results from a high-altitude (1,073 m) cave, Dargan Shelter, in the upper Blue Mountains, which indicate that occupation first occurred ~20,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum, making this the highest elevation Pleistocene site identified in Australia so far. Findings include multiple in situ hearths and 693 stone artefacts, several of which were sourced from sites along the mountain range, providing evidence for previously undetected interactions to the north and south and the repeated use of this cold-climate landscape during the Late Pleistocene.

          "abstract": "Assessing model uncertainty is crucial to quantitative political science. Yet, most available sensitivity analyses focus only on a few modeling choices, most notably the covariate space, while neglecting to jointly consider several equally important modeling choices simultaneously. In this article, we combine the exhaustive and systematic method of the Extreme Bounds Analysis with the more multidimensional logic underpinning the multiverse approach to develop an approach to sensitivity analyses. This allows us to systematically assess the degree and sources of model uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including the control set, fixed effect structures, SE types, sample selection, and dependent variable operationalization. We then apply this method to four prominent topics in political science: democratization, institutional trust, public good provision, and welfare state generosity. Results from over 3.6 bn estimates reveal widespread model uncertainty, not just in terms of the statistical significance of the effects, but also their direction, with most independent variables yielding a substantive share of statistically significant positive and negative coefficients depending on model specification. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of three distinct approaches to estimating the relative importance of different model specification choices: nearest 1-neighbor; logistic; and deep learning. All three approaches reveal that the impact of the covariate space is relatively modest compared to the impact of sample selection and dependent variable operationalization. We conclude that model uncertainty stems more from sampling and measurement than conditioning and discuss the methodological implications for how to assess model uncertainty in the social sciences.",

          "abstract": "Regional collectivism has been observed to contribute to better coping with public crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study poses a reverse question: Does the eruption of public crises increase people’s conformity to the collective? To answer this question, we analyzed real-world transactions on Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China), each with a purchase decision and a list of candidates considered before purchasing. Conformity to the collective was measured using two indicators: whether the decision-maker opted for the A) most-sold and B) best-rated options within the candidate option set. The results reveal that both conformity variables were significantly higher in the 10 wk subsequent to January 19, 2020 (when the nationwide COVID-19 crisis erupted in China), than in the 8 wk prior. These shifts were common across subpopulations, regions, and product categories and remained significant after strictly matching across weeks and after using a within-person, longitudinal sample. These shifts were more confidently attributed to the pandemic by further conducting difference-in-differences analyses to compare pandemic-affected regions with their unaffected, comparable counterparts using data from six subsequent regional waves in China. Furthermore, regions with larger increases in conformity during the early stage of the pandemic achieved better antipandemic outcomes. These findings provide real-world evidence for previous theories on behavioral immune systems, terror management, and compensatory control. Additionally, cross-regional comparisons of effect sizes offer exploratory insights into cultural psychology. In summary, these findings capture how human societies dynamically adjust their values to better adapt to unanticipated survival challenges.",

Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is, therefore, important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated these questions by asking a range of LLMs to emulate or advise on people’s decisions in realistic moral dilemmas. In Study 1, we compared LLM responses to those of a representative U.S. sample ( N = 285) for 22 dilemmas, including both collective action problems that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost–benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In collective action problems, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: They usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 ( N = 474, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and documented an additional bias: Unlike humans, most LLMs were biased toward answering “no” in moral dilemmas, thus flipping their decision/advice depending on how the question is worded. In Study 3 ( N = 491, preregistered), we replicated these biases in LLMs using everyday moral dilemmas adapted from forum posts on Reddit. In Study 4, we investigated the sources of these biases by comparing models with and without fine-tuning, showing that they likely arise from fine-tuning models for chatbot applications. Our findings suggest that uncritical reliance on LLMs’ moral decisions and advice could amplify human biases and introduce potentially problematic biases.",

          "abstract": "Determining how people behave in contexts governed by social norms can clarify both how norms influence human behavior and how norms evolve. We examined cooperative farming harvest division among the Derung, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking horticultural society in southwestern China. In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution. They also accurately guessed that others shared this preference and would approve of such divisions. Nonetheless, they still followed the prevailing norm of dividing by household. Their self-reported explanation for this behavior was that they desired to follow their traditional practices. Such a normative decision-making algorithm can allow individually consequential norms to persist without costly policing by other group members.",

          "abstract": "In an era increasingly influenced by autonomous machines, it is only a matter of time before strategic individual decisions that impact collective goods will also be made virtually through the use of artificial delegates. Through a series of behavioral experiments that combine delegation to autonomous agents and different choice architectures, we pinpoint what may get lost in translation when humans delegate to algorithms. We focus on the collective-risk dilemma, a game where participants must decide whether or not to contribute to a public good, where the latter must reach a target in order for them to keep their personal endowments. To test the effect of delegation beyond its functionality as a commitment device, participants are asked to play the game a second time, with the same group, where they are given the chance to reprogram their agents. As our main result we find that, when the action space is constrained, people who delegate contribute more to the public good, even if they have experienced more failure and inequality than people who do not delegate. However, they are not more successful. Failing to reach the target, after getting close to it, can be attributed to precision errors in the agent’s algorithm that cannot be corrected amid the game. Thus, with the digitization and subsequent limitation of our interactions, artificial delegates appear to be a solution to help preserving public goods over many iterations of risky situations. But actual success can only be achieved if humans learn to adjust their agents’ algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Protein structure–function relationships are critical for understanding molecular mechanisms and the impacts of genetic variation. Mutational scanning approaches can deliver scalable analysis, usually through the study of loss-of-function variants. Rarer dominant negative and gain-of-function variants can be more information rich, as they retain a stable proteoform and can be used to dissect molecular function while retaining biological context. Dominant variant proteoforms can still engage substrates and interact with binding partners. Here, we probe the structure–function relationships of the Mus81 endonuclease by ectopic expression of deep mutational scanning libraries to find amino acid variants that confer dominant sensitivity to genotoxic stress and dominant synthetic lethality. Screening more than 2,200 MUS81 variants at 100 positions identified 13 amino acids that can be altered to elicit a dominant phenotype. The dominant phenotype of these variants required the presence of the obligate Mus81 binding protein, Mms4. The dominant variants affect amino acids in a contiguous surface on Mus81 and fall into two distinct classes: residues that bind the catalytic magnesium atoms and residues that form the hydrophobic wedge. Most of the variant amino acids were conserved across species and cognate variants expressed in human cell lines resulted in dominant sensitivity to replication stress and synthetic growth defects in cells lacking BLM helicase. The dominant variants in both yeast and human MUS81 resulted in phenotypes distinct from a MUS81 knockout. These data demonstrate the utility of dominant genetics using ectopic expression of amino acid site saturation variant libraries to link function to protein structure providing insight into molecular mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "The surface layer or “S-layer” is a two-dimensional lattice of proteins that coats a wide range of archaea and bacteria in place of a cell wall or capsular polysaccharides. S-layers are thought to play an important role in chemically and physically insulating cells from the external environment. Here, we show that the integrity of the S-layer in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius is maintained as cells grow via a process of self-assembly as SlaA monomers fill gaps in the lattice. Although this lattice which is physically tethered to the membrane might be expected to hinder cell division, we show that the S-layer flattens the membrane at cytokinesis to accelerate ESCRT-III-dependent cell division—and is important for robust, successful cell divisions under conditions of mechanical stress. Taken together, these results define the rules governing S-layer self-assembly and show how a flexible lattice coat that is coupled to the underlying membrane can both provide a cell with mechanical support and help to drive rapid and functionally important changes in cell shape.",

Using high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy, we determined the structures of Sus scrofa and Xenopus laevis GnRHRs bound to mammal GnRH, uncovering conserved and species-specific mechanisms of receptor activation and G protein coupling. The conserved “U”-shaped GnRH conformation mediates high-affinity binding through key interactions with residues such as K 3.32 , Y 6.51 , and Y 6.52 . Species-specific variations in extracellular loops and receptor–ligand contacts fine-tune receptor function, while ligand binding induces structural rearrangements, including N terminus displacement and TM6 rotation, critical for signaling. Structure–activity relationship analysis demonstrates how D-amino acid substitutions in GnRH analogs enhance stability and receptor affinity. Distinct binding modes of agonists and antagonists elucidate mechanisms of ligand-dependent activation and inactivation. These insights lay the groundwork for designing next-generation GnRHR therapeutics with enhanced specificity and efficacy for conditions like endometriosis, prostate cancer, and infertility.",

We identify 1,733 splice-disrupting mutations, with the most extreme variants likely being deleterious. We report that these variants are not distributed evenly across exons but are mostly concentrated in the ~8% of exons that are most susceptible to splicing mutations (i.e., hotspot exons). We demonstrate how multiple, splice-disrupting mutations in these exons can be reverted by the same ASOs targeting the splice sites of either their upstream or downstream flanking exons. This finding supports the feasibility of developing single therapeutic ASOs that could revert all splice-altering variants localized to a particular exon.",

These diseases, if left untreated, can be lethal within hours. Hyperinvasive N. meningitidis strains often express a genomically encoded filamentous bacteriophage called MDAΦ, which promotes colonization of mucosal host surfaces to facilitate bacterial invasion. How this phage is organized and how it promotes biofilm formation and infection at the molecular level is unclear. Here, we present an electron cryomicroscopy structure of the MDA phage, showing that MDAΦ is a class I filamentous inovirus, with the major capsid protein (MCP) arranged within the phage as a highly curved and densely packed α-helix. Comparison with other filamentous bacteriophages offers clues about inoviral genome encapsidation mechanisms, providing a framework for understanding the evolutionary diversity of inoviruses. A disordered, N-terminal segment in the MCP presents hydrophobic patches on the surface of assembled phage particles, which, together with electron cryotomography data of phage bundles, furnishes a structural rationale for phage–phage interactions that were seen previously in an epithelium adhesion infection model of N. meningitidis . Taken together, our results shed light on the structure, organization, and higher-order assembly of a biomedically relevant phage encoded in the genome of a human pathogen. Molecular insights gleaned from this study increase our understanding of phage evolution, phage-mediated bacterial adhesion, and pathogenicity.",

Here, we present carbon isotopic measurements on rare undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans that have preserved the isotopic signature of their mantle source. We find that Earth’s present-day convecting upper mantle has variable δ 13 C value from ~−10 to −4‰, significantly different from the δ 13 C value of peridotitic diamonds and with the highest values being restricted to the Atlantic. Evidence for significant mantle heterogeneity contrasts with previous assumptions and its origin remains puzzling being uncorrelated with geochemical markers associated with either subduction and surficial recycling processes or lower mantle contributions.

          "abstract": "Theories on group-bias often posit an internal preparedness to bias one’s cognition to favor the in-group (often envisioned as a product of evolution). In contrast, other theories suggest that group-biases can emerge from nonspecialized cognitive processes. These perspectives have historically been difficult to disambiguate given that observed behavior can often be attributed to innate processes, even when groups are experimentally assigned. Here, we use modern techniques from the field of AI that allow us to ask what group biases can be expected from a learning agent that is a pure blank slate without any intrinsic social biases, and whose lifetime of experiences can be tightly controlled. This is possible because deep reinforcement-learning agents learn to convert raw sensory input (i.e. pixels) to reward-driven action, a unique feature among cognitive models. We find that blank slate agents do develop group biases based on arbitrary group differences (i.e. color). We show that the bias develops as a result of familiarity of experience and depends on the visual patterns becoming associated with reward through interaction. The bias artificial agents display is not a static reflection of the bias in their stream of experiences. In this minimal environment, the bias can be overcome given enough positive experiences, although unlearning the bias takes longer than acquiring it. Further, we show how this style of tabula rasa group behavior model can be used to test fine-grained predictions of psychological theories.",

Despite the presence of static Nash equilibria, we demonstrate that MARL dynamics with heterogeneous learning rates can deviate from these equilibria, exhibiting instability and even chaotic behavior and resulting in increased social costs. Remarkably, even within these chaotic regimes, we show that the time-averaged macroscopic behavior converges to exact Nash equilibria, thus linking the microscopic dynamic complexity with traditional equilibrium concepts. By employing dynamical systems techniques, we analyze the interaction between individual-level adaptation and population-level outcomes, paving the way for studying heterogeneous learning dynamics in discrete time across more complex game scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Theories of the evolution of cooperation through reciprocity explain how unrelated self-interested individuals can accomplish more together than they can on their own. The most prominent theories of reciprocity, such as tit-for-tat or win-stay-lose-shift, are inflexible automata that lack a theory of mind—the human ability to infer the hidden mental states in others’ minds. Here, we develop a model of reciprocity with a theory of mind, the Bayesian Reciprocator. When making decisions, this model does not simply seek to maximize its own payoff. Instead, it also values the payoffs of others—but only to the extent it believes that those others are also cooperating in the same way. To compute its beliefs about others, the Bayesian Reciprocator uses a probabilistic and generative approach to infer the latent preferences, beliefs, and strategies of others through interaction and observation. We evaluate the Bayesian Reciprocator using a generator over games where every interaction is unique, as well as in classic environments such as the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. The Bayesian Reciprocator enables the emergence of both direct-reciprocity when games are repeated and indirect-reciprocity when interactions are one-shot but observable to others. In an evolutionary competition, the Bayesian Reciprocator outcompetes existing automata strategies and sustains cooperation across a larger range of environments and noise settings than prior approaches. This work quantifies the advantage of a theory of mind for cooperation in an evolutionary game theoretic framework and suggests avenues for building artificially intelligent agents with more human-like learning mechanisms that can cooperate across many environments.",

Three undescribed sea spider species (family Ammotheidae; genus Sericosura ) endemic to methane seeps were found along the eastern Pacific margin, from California to Alaska, hosting diverse methane- and methanol-oxidizing bacteria on their exoskeleton. δ 13 C tissue isotope values of in situ specimens corroborated methane assimilation (−45‰, on average). Live animal incubations with 13 C-labeled methane and methanol, followed by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry, confirmed that carbon derived from both compounds was actively incorporated into the tissues within five days. Methano- and methylotrophs of the bacterial families Methylomonadaceae, Methylophagaceae and Methylophilaceae were abundant, based on environmental metagenomics and 16S rRNA sequencing, and fluorescence and electron microscopy confirmed dense epibiont aggregations on the sea spider exoskeleton. Egg sacs carried by the males hosted identical microbes suggesting vertical transmission. We propose that these sea spiders farm and feed on methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria, expanding the realm of animals known to harness C1 compounds as a carbon source.

Recently, to overcome the challenge that genetic information of nonparticipants is unavailable, it is shown that by comparing the IBD (identity by descent) shared and not-shared segments between participating relative pairs, one can estimate the genetic component underlying participation. That, however, does not directly address how to adjust estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for phenotypes correlated with participation. Here, we demonstrate a way to do so by adopting a statistical framework that separates the genetic and nongenetic correlations between participation and these phenotypes. Crucially, our method avoids making the assumption that the effect of the genetic component underlying participation is manifested entirely through these other phenotypes. Applying the method to 12 UK Biobank phenotypes, we found eight that have significant genetic correlations with participation, including body mass index, educational attainment, and smoking status. For most of these phenotypes, without adjustments, estimates of heritability and the absolute value of genetic correlation would have underestimation biases.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation to novel environments requires genetic variation, but whether adaptation typically acts upon preexisting genetic variation or must wait for new mutations remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. For each of the causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1 ( teosinte glume architecture1 ), which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1 . We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 42,000 to 49,000 y ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating that the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.",

Our findings show that flies with depleted gut microbiota, either through axenic culture or antibiotic treatment, exhibited significant memory impairments. However, reintroducing the commensal bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum alone was sufficient to restore memory, while coinoculation with Acetobacter pomorum further enhanced memory performance. Hemolymph metabolomic analyses revealed reduced amino acid levels in antibiotic-treated flies, which were linked to impaired Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTOR) signaling. Additionally, genetic manipulation of dTOR or dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids either mimicked or rescued the memory deficits caused by antibiotic treatments. These results suggest that the gut microbiome is essential for regulating memory function by maintaining amino acid homeostasis and proper dTOR signaling, with profound implications for advancing knowledge of cognitive regulation.",

By delineating and appealing to the diffusion-limited regime wherein buoyancy effects due to mass adaptation dominate hydrodynamic drag, we derive a simple expression for the steady settling velocity of a sphere as a function of the density, size, and diffusivity of the solid, as well as the density gradient of the background fluid. In this regime, smaller particles settle faster, in contrast with most conventional hydrodynamic drag mechanisms. Furthermore, we outline a general mathematical framework for computing the steady settling speed of a body of arbitrary shape in this regime and compute exact results for the case of general ellipsoids. Using hydrogels as a highly porous model system, we validate the predictions with laboratory experiments in linear stratification for a wide range of parameters. Last, we show how the predictions can be applied to arbitrary slowly varying background density profiles and demonstrate how a measured particle position over time can be used to reconstruct the background density profile.",

While selective sweeps have been widely studied, polygenic responses are thought to be more prevalent but remain challenging to quantify. The infinitesimal model makes explicit the hypothesis about the dynamics of changes in allele frequencies under selection, where only allelic effect sizes, frequencies, linkage, and gametic disequilibrium matter. Departures from this, like long-range correlations of allele frequency changes, could be a signal of epistasis in polygenic response. We performed an Evolve &amp; Resequence experiment in Drosophila melanogaster exposing flies to a high-sugar diet for over 100 generations. We tracked allele frequency changes in &gt;3000 individually sequenced flies and population pools and searched for loci under selection by identifying sites with allele frequency trajectories that differentiated selection regimes consistently across replicates. We estimate that at least 4% of the genome was under positive selection, indicating a highly polygenic response. The response was dominated by small, consistent allele frequency changes, with few loci exhibiting large shifts. We then searched for signatures of selection on pairwise combinations of alleles in the new environment and found several strong signals of putative epistatic interactions across unlinked loci that were consistent across selected populations. Finally, we measured differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across treatments and show that DEGs are enriched for selected SNPs. Our results suggest that epistatic contributions to polygenic selective response are common and lead to detectable signatures.",

Our sample consisted of 8,396 children aged 8.9 to 11.1 y from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Through multiple correspondence analysis and factor analysis of mixed data, we distilled numerous pregnancy and birth variables into four overarching dimensions; maternal pregnancy complications, maternal substance use, low birth weight and prematurity, and newborn birth complications. Vertex-wise measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area (SA), and curvature were fused using linked independent component analysis. Linear mixed-effects models showed that maternal pregnancy complications and low birth weight and prematurity were associated with smaller global SA. Additionally, low birth weight and prematurity was associated with complex regional cortical patterns reflecting bidirectional variations in both SA and CT. Newborn birth complications showed multivariate patterns reflecting smaller occipital- and larger temporal area, bidirectional frontal area variations, and reduced CT across the cortex. Maternal substance use showed no associations with child cortical structure. By employing a multifactorial and multivariate morphometric fusion approach, we connected complications during pregnancy and fetal size and prematurity to global SA and specific regional signatures across child cortical MRI features.",

          "abstract": "Herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) – a human oncogenic virus and essential trigger of multiple sclerosis – must bypass host DNA-sensing mechanisms to establish lifelong, latent infection. Therefore, herpesviruses encode viral proteins to disrupt key host factors involved in DNA sensing and viral restriction. The first viral latency protein expressed, EBNA-LP, is essential for transformation of naïve B cells and establishment of viral gene expression, yet its role in evading host defenses remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of EBNA-LP Knockout (LPKO)-infected B cells, we reveal an antiviral response landscape implicating the “speckled proteins” as key cellular restriction factors countered by EBNA-LP. Specifically, loss of Sp100 or the primate-specific Sp140L reverses the restriction of LPKO, suppresses a subset of canonically interferon-stimulated genes, and restores transcription of essential latent viral genes and cellular proliferation. Notably, we also identify Sp140L as a restriction target of the herpesvirus saimiri ORF3 protein, implying a role for Sp140L in immunity to other diverse DNA viruses. This study reveals Sp140L as a restriction factor that we propose links sensing and transcriptional suppression of viral DNA to an Interferon-independent innate immune response, likely relevant to all nuclear DNA viruses.",

Similar pathologies have been observed in the mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This study hypothesized that inflammatory demyelination of the cerebellum alters overall mitochondrial function and is a contributor to axon degeneration and PC loss. Postmortem cerebellar tissue from MS patients, particularly those with secondary progressive MS, showed decreased mitochondrial complex IV (COXIV) activity and significant PC loss. Inflammation, PC axon demyelination, axon degeneration, and parallel fiber loss were also evident. These findings were mirrored in late-stage EAE mice, which also showed increased inflammation and demyelination, reduced PC COXIV activity, and overall PC loss. Further analysis of EAE mice revealed altered mitochondrial structure, modified mitochondrial respiration, and reduced levels of mitochondrial genes involved in energy production. These findings indicate that both human MS and mouse EAE share similar cerebellar changes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, late-stage EAE is a valuable model for studying MS-related cerebellar pathology, and mitochondria may be a potential therapeutic target for MS treatment.",

We use one of these models, the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model, to investigate how transient calibration impacts historical and projection simulations. Transient calibration is an emerging capability in ice flow models; it uses time series of surface observations and time-dependent physics to constrain uncertain model parameters—in this case, the basal friction coefficient in the sliding law. With more constraints than the common snapshot inversion method, transient calibration has been shown to better capture trends in ice dynamics. Here, we apply both methods to northwestern Greenland, a region undergoing rapid changes. For simulations initialized with the snapshot inversion, we find that subsequent modeled velocities are generally too slow, leading to an underestimation of the mass loss. With transient calibration, however, our simulation better matches a time series of observed velocities, bringing it within observational error for mass loss; however, the fit to observed surface elevation is slightly reduced. Together with the ISMIP results, our simulations show that reproducing the high rates of historical mass loss leads to greater projected sea-level contribution from this region over the coming century. Finally, we suggest a path forward for making transient calibration scalable to the entire Greenland Ice Sheet.",

The infant skull of the first African early hominin discovered at Taungs by Raymond Dart included a natural brain endocast. Natural endocasts as well-preserved as that of the Taungs infant are rare, but Holloway reasoned that if a way could be found to reproduce the endocranial morphology of early hominin crania then he would be able to track brain evolution within the human clade. Holloway realized that if liquid latex was introduced into the cranial cavity and left to cure, it could be extracted via the foramen magnum and then be used to make a facsimile of that individual’s brain. Modern imaging methods have made Holloway’s technique redundant, but for many years, it was the only way to access the endocranial morphology of fossil hominins.",

          "abstract": "A brief global warming event known as the Pre-Onset Excursion (POE) occurred just before the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 56 Mya). The deconvolution of the evolutionary consequences of these two hyperthermal events is puzzling because of their close temporal proximity and the lack of comprehensive, well-calibrated paleontological records, especially in terrestrial environments. As a consequence, the impact of the POE on mammalian evolution and its role in shaping PETM faunas remains unclear. Here, we report from France a mammalian fauna, named Albas, which is interpreted to postdate the POE and predate the PETM. The absence of artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and euprimates at Albas lends support to the controversial hypothesis that these “modern” mammal groups appeared in the European fossil record during the PETM. In contrast, Albas yielded the European first definitive Paleocene record of metatherians, paromomyid primates, “creodonts,” and rodents, challenging the assumption that these groups migrated into Europe during the PETM. Because the majority of them originated from North American pre-POE species, we tentatively suggest that these “precursor” dispersers entered Europe during the POE. Similar to the modern orders during the PETM, these “precursor” dispersers likely entered Europe through corridors in the continuous evergreen forest belt at high latitudes. Our findings highlight how a brief warming event in the Arctic during the latest Paleocene, such as the POE (which could result in a release of carbon into the atmosphere similar to cumulative ongoing anthropogenic emissions), significantly influenced the evolutionary dynamics of European mammals.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory (EGT) has been pivotal in the study of cooperation, offering formal models that account for how cooperation may arise in groups of selfish, but simple agents. This is done by inspecting the complex dynamics arising from simple interactions between a few strategies in a large population. As such, the strategies at stake are typically hand-picked by the modeler, resulting in a system with many more individuals in the population than strategies available to them. In the presence of noise and with multiple equilibria, the choice of strategies can considerably alter the emergent dynamics. As a result, model outcomes may not be robust to how the strategy set is chosen, sometimes misrepresenting the conditions required for cooperation to emerge. We propose three principles that can lead to a more systematic choice of the strategies in EGT models of cooperation. These are the inclusion of all computationally equivalent strategies; explicit microeconomic models of interactions, and a connection between stylized facts and model assumptions. Further, we argue that new methods arising in AI may offer a promising path toward richer models. These richer models can push the field of cooperation forward together with the principles described above. At the same time, AI may benefit from connecting to the more abstract models of EGT. We provide and discuss examples to substantiate these claims.",

Recent advancements in evolutionary game theory have identified a class of “zero-determinant” strategies, which confer an agent with significant unilateral control over outcomes in repeated games. Building on these insights, we present a comprehensive generalization of zero-determinant strategies to stochastic games, encompassing dynamic environments. We propose an algorithm that allows an agent to discover strategies enforcing predetermined linear (or approximately linear) payoff relationships. Of particular interest is the relationship in which both payoffs are equal, which serves as a proxy for fairness in symmetric games. We demonstrate that an agent can discover strategies enforcing such relationships through experience alone, without coordinating with an opponent. In finding and using such a strategy, an agent (“enforcer”) can incentivize optimal and equitable outcomes, circumventing potential exploitation. In particular, from the opponent’s viewpoint, the enforcer transforms a mixed-motivation problem into a cooperative problem, paving the way for more collaboration and fairness in multiagent systems.",

The resultant trade-off between cost of evaluation and quality of decisions can lead to undesired bias. Information-processing abilities mediate this trade-off, where individuals with higher ability choose better partners leading to higher performance. By altering the salience of features, technology can modulate the effect of information-processing limits, potentially increasing or decreasing undesired biases. Here, we use game theory and multiagent reinforcement learning to investigate how undesired biases emerge, and how a technological layer (in the form of a perceptual intervention) between individuals and their environment can ameliorate such biases. Our results show that a perceptual intervention designed to increase the salience of outcome-relevant features can reduce bias in agents making partner choice decisions. Individuals learning with a perceptual intervention showed less bias due to decreased reliance on features that only spuriously correlate with behavior. Mechanistically, the perceptual intervention effectively increased the information-processing abilities of the individuals. Our results highlight the benefit of using multiagent reinforcement learning to model theoretically grounded social behaviors, particularly when real-world complexity prohibits fully analytical approaches.",

          "abstract": "Despite over a century of studies, fundamental questions remain about the processes governing crystal nucleation from melts or solutions. Research over the past three decades has presented mounting evidence for kinetic pathways of crystal nucleation that are more complex than envisioned by the simplest forms of classical theory. Such observations have been presented for colloidal and elemental systems with covalent and metallic bonding. Despite the technological and geochemical importance of molten salts, similar studies for these ionically bonded systems are currently lacking. Here we develop a machine learning interatomic potential for a model ionic system: LiF. The potential features quantum-level accuracy for both liquid and multiple solid polymorphs over wide temperature and pressure ranges and accurately reproduces experimentally measured properties. Thanks to the efficiency of the potential, which enables microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, induction times for nucleation of LiF solids from their melts are computed over a range of undercoolings. With the aid of a set of robust local order parameters established here, the simulations reveal that homogeneous crystal nucleation in undercooled melts preferentially initiates from liquid regions showing slow dynamics and high bond orientational order simultaneously, and the second-shell order of both precritical nuclei and the surface of postcritical nuclei is dominated by hexagonal close packing and body-centered cubic local structure, even though the nucleus core is dominated by face-centered cubic structure corresponding to the stable rocksalt crystal structure. Finally, we establish a connection between the crystallization pathway and the equilibrium crystal–melt interface structure.",

          "abstract": "The utility of a pure population of highly regenerative satellite stem cells (SSCs) is a prerequisite for successful cell-based muscle therapies. Previous works have reported several methods for the SSC isolation. However, the majority of cells isolated using previous methods are fibroblasts and other nonmyogenic cell types, necessitating further expensive and time-consuming purification steps often affecting the regenerative quality of the isolated SSCs. Here, we describe a simple, time-effective, and robust protocol for the isolation of a pure population of SSCs in a single direct step, eliminating the need for further purification steps. By separating the muscle fascicles from the adjacent connective tissues (i.e., epimysium and perimysium) and utilizing a defined dissociation medium, a cell pool enriched in SSCs was successfully obtained. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the stemness and the myogenic purity of the isolated cells (~97%). Upon myogenic induction, SSCs gave rise to multinucleated myofibers that exhibited spontaneous contraction in the culture dish for up to 21 d. Efforts to optimize the culture conditions revealed that tissue culture plates (TCPs) coated with a tissue-specific extract significantly enhanced SSCs’ attachment, growth, and differentiation compared to collagen I, Matrigel-coated TCPs, or noncoated TCPs. Further studies confirmed the robust myogenic regenerative capacity of the isolated cells, as evidenced by their ability to display key regenerative characteristics, demonstrating the mild effects of our isolation protocol on their regenerative capacity. The isolation protocol presented herein can potentially be used to obtain SSCs with high myogenic purity for skeletal muscle regenerative engineering and clinical indications.",

          "abstract": "Antarctic krill is a keystone species in the Antarctic marine ecosystem and the target of a growing fishery. Given the ecological importance of krill, concerns have been raised about potential negative impacts of fishing on the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Resource-efficient approaches to fisheries monitoring are particularly valuable in this context due to the high costs associated with data collection in Antarctica. In this study, we trained a segmentation model (U-Net) to extract dives of air-breathing krill predators from more than 30,000 h of active acoustic data collected by three krill fishing vessels over six years. We were able to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamics of predator-vessel co-occurrences, which aligned well with the findings from more costly tracking studies. For example, we found that encounters with whales consistently peaked in autumn around the Antarctic Peninsula, when whales are building up fat reserves for their migration to breeding grounds. We also demonstrated that protection measures, introduced to protect breeding penguins at the Antarctic Peninsula, have simply shifted penguin-vessel encounters to the South Orkney Islands, where the affected colonies are not currently monitored. Our approach, results, and application example demonstrate how acoustic data from fishing vessels can provide important information to support fisheries management. As a by-product of fishing operations, these data are cost-effective, offering unique temporal and spatial coverage and providing a useful basis for rapid, low-level assessments of the fishery’s interaction with the wider ecosystem. This is particularly important given the unpredictable dynamics of krill fishery management decision-making.",

Previous studies mainly focus on physiochemically heterogeneous but electrically homogeneous surfaces, on which the presence of vapor pressure gradient between droplets is the predominant mechanism for interdroplet freezing bridging, propagation, and eventual frosting across the entire surface. An interesting yet unanswered question is whether electrostatic charge on surfaces affects freezing dynamics. Here, we find an interdroplet freezing relay (IFR) phenomenon on electrically heterogeneous surfaces that exhibits a three-dimensional, in-air freezing propagation pathway and an accelerated freezing rate. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that this phenomenon originates from the presence of surface charge gradient established between the frozen droplet and neighboring water droplet, which leads to a spontaneous shooting of desublimated ice needles from the frozen droplet and then triggers the freezing of neighboring water droplet in in-air manner. We further demonstrate its generality across various dielectric substrates, liquids, and droplet configurations. Our work enriches conventional perspectives on droplet freezing dynamics and emphasizes the pivotal role of electrostatics in designing passive anti-icing and antifrosting materials.",

Using representational interaction measures that link facial features with MEG activity and categorization behavior, we identified within each participant a functional social pathway extending from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal gyrus. This pathway selectively represents, communicates, and integrates facial movements that are essential for the behavioral categorization of emotion, while task-irrelevant identity features are filtered out in the occipital cortex.

The lac insect Kerria lacca (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha) is a phloem-feeding scale insect that is brightly colored due to the presence of natural polyhydroxy-anthraquinone pigments called laccaic acids. The deep red pigments possibly provide defense against pathogens and predators and are commercially important as dyes in textiles, lacquerware, and cosmetics. Laccaic acids are categorized as polyketides comprising an anthraquinone backbone decorated with tyrosine or its derivatives. However, the genetic basis of these pigments remains unknown, as insects are not known to produce aromatic polyketides or tyrosine de novo. Here, we sequence the genome of the lac insect and its two endosymbionts— Wolbachia and a hitherto unidentified, transovarially transmitted yeast-like symbiont (YLS). We found no evidence for the host or Wolbachia to be able to synthesize the pigments. The pigments and their precursors were also not detected in the host plant. Genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses combined with fluorescence microscopy identified and characterized YLS as the sole producer of the pigment’s polyketide backbone and tyrosine moiety, demonstrating an endosymbiotic origin of the lac pigments. A nonreducing polyketide synthase gene cluster encoding the laccaic acid backbone was identified. Furthermore, the YLS genome encoded essential amino acids and vitamins that are deficient in the insect’s phloem diet. Experimental fungicide-treated insects exhibited reduced concentrations of laccaic acids and tyrosine, along with decreased body size and weight, indicating a mutualistic association between the lac insect and its YLS.",

          "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous childhood cancer, characterized by the amplification of the MYCN oncogene in 40% of the high-risk cases. Our previous work demonstrated that MYCN drives metabolic reprogramming in NB, including upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Here, we identify peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) as a promising therapeutic target in NB. Pharmacological inhibition of PRDX6 reduces MYCN levels, induces apoptosis, and promotes neuronal differentiation accompanied by lipid droplet accumulation, essential for the phenotypic reprogramming. Moreover, combined inhibition of PRDX6 and glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1), a key antioxidant enzyme needed for PRDX6 activation, demonstrated synergistic effects both in vitro and in vivo. This strategy results in neuronal maturation as well as activity and initiates downstream pathways distinct from the ones triggered by retinoic acid, the differentiation-inducing agent currently used in clinical practice for NB. Notably, both PRDX6 and GSTP1 are highly expressed in the developing murine adrenal gland, as well as in high-risk, MYCN -amplified NB, correlating with an undifferentiated state and poor prognosis. Together, our results provide insights into the potential of PRDX6 and GSTP1 as therapeutic targets for differentiation induction for children with NB.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate scavengers play a critical role in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Through the cascading effects of their ecological role, scavengers can also alleviate the burden of zoonotic diseases on people. This importance to human health fuels a growing need to understand how vertebrate scavengers and their ecosystem services are faring globally in the Anthropocene. We reviewed the conservation status of 1,376 vertebrate scavenging species and examined the implications for human health. We uncovered that 36% of these species are threatened or decreasing in population abundance and that apex (large-bodied or obligate) scavengers are disproportionately imperiled. In contrast, mesoscavengers (small-bodied or facultative) are thriving from anthropogenic food subsidies and ecological release. We posit that this global shift in scavenger community structure increases carrion persistence enabling zoonotic pathogens to propagate. Our analysis also indicates that the release of mesoscavengers is associated with reservoir host proliferation, potentially further exacerbating human disease burdens. Urgently tackling the key threats to scavengers—intensive livestock production, land use change, wildlife trade, and the interactions among them—is critical to securing the long-term public health benefits of the world’s diverse scavenger communities.",

          "abstract": "How tick-borne pathogens interact with their hosts has been primarily studied in vertebrates where disease is observed. Comparatively less is known about pathogen interactions within the tick. Here, we report that Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with either Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causative agent of anaplasmosis) or Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) show activation of the ATF6 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Disabling ATF6 functionally restricts pathogen survival in ticks. When stimulated, ATF6 functions as a transcription factor, but is the least understood out of the three UPR pathways. To interrogate the Ixodes ATF6 transcriptional network, we developed a custom R script to query tick promoter sequences. This revealed stomatin as a potential gene target, which has roles in lipid homeostasis and vesical transport. Ixodes stomatin was experimentally validated as a bona fide ATF6-regulated gene through luciferase reporter assays, pharmacological activators, RNA interference transcriptional repression, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencing stomatin decreased A. phagocytophilum colonization in Ixodes and disrupted cholesterol dynamics in tick cells. Furthermore, blocking stomatin restricted cholesterol availability to the bacterium, thereby inhibiting growth and survival. Taken together, we have identified the Ixodes ATF6 pathway as a contributor to vector competence through Stomatin-regulated cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, our custom, web-based transcription factor binding site search tool “ArthroQuest” revealed that the ATF6-regulated nature of stomatin is unique to blood-feeding arthropods. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of studying fundamental processes in nonmodel organisms.",

However, investigating PPIs involving membrane proteins is challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of glycosylation. To tackle this challenge, we developed an approach termed glycan-dependent affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (GAP–MS), specifically designed to characterize changes in glycoprotein PPIs under varying glycosylation conditions. GAP–MS integrates metabolic control of glycan profiles in cultured cells using small molecules referred to as glycan modifiers with affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis (AP–MS). Here, GAP–MS was applied to characterize and compare the interaction networks under five different glycosylation states for four bait glycoproteins: BSG, CD44, EGFR, and SLC3A2. This analysis identified a network comprising 156 interactions, of which 131 were determined to be glycan dependent. Notably, the GAP–MS analysis of BSG provided distinct information regarding glycosylation-influenced interactions compared to the commonly used glycosylation site mutagenesis approach combined with AP–MS, emphasizing the unique advantages of GAP–MS. Collectively, GAP–MS presents distinct insights over existing methods in elucidating how specific glycosylation forms impact glycoprotein interactions. Additionally, the glycan-dependent interaction networks generated for these four glycoproteins serve as a valuable resource for guiding future functional investigations and therapeutic developments targeting the glycoproteins discussed in this study.",

          "abstract": "The nucleobase queuine (q) and its nucleoside queuosine (Q) are micronutrients derived from bacteria that are acquired from the gut microbiome and/or diet in humans. Following cellular uptake, Q is incorporated at the wobble base (position 34) of tRNAs that decode histidine, tyrosine, aspartate, and asparagine codons, which is important for efficient translation. Early studies suggested that cytosolic uptake of queuine is mediated by a selective transporter that is regulated by mitogenic signals, but the identity of this transporter has remained elusive. Here, through a cross-species bioinformatic search and genetic validation, we have identified the solute carrier family member SLC35F2 as a unique transporter for both queuine and queuosine in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Trypanosoma brucei . Furthermore, gene disruption in human HeLa cells revealed that SLC35F2 is the sole transporter for queuosine (K m 174 nM) and a high-affinity transporter for the queuine nucleobase (K m 67 nM), with the additional presence of second low-affinity queuine transporter (K m 259 nM). Ectopic expression of labeled SLC35F2 reveals localization to the cell membrane and Golgi apparatus via immunofluorescence. Competition uptake studies show that SLC35F2 is not a general transporter for other canonical ribonucleobases or ribonucleosides but selectively imports q and Q. The identification of SLC35F2, an oncogene, as the transporter of both q and Q advances our understanding of how intracellular levels of queuine and queuosine are regulated and how their deficiency contributes to a variety of pathophysiological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer.",

          "abstract": "Removing CO 2 from the atmosphere is emerging as a viable strategy to mitigate global warming, yet the responses of the climate system to CO 2 reduction remain uncertain. One of the most uncertain aspects of El Niño behavior is the change in periodicity in response to CO 2 forcing [O. Alizadeh, Earth-Sci. Rev. 235 , 104246 (2022)]. In this study, we show that climate models consistently project an abrupt shortening of El Niño periodicity once CO 2 reductions commence in ramp-up and ramp-down CO 2 experiments. Besides the contribution of slow mean state changes, this phenomenon is shown to be driven by a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [J.-S. Kug, et al. , Nat. Clim. Chang. 12 , 47–53 (2022)] and the consequent narrowing of El Niño’s spatial pattern, which enhances the effectiveness of ocean heat recharge/discharge processes, thereby shortening its periodicity. This suggests that the abrupt shift in El Niño periodicity results from a cascading reaction involving ITCZ dynamics and El Niño’s spatial configuration. These findings highlight the critical role of the global energy balance in shaping El Niño characteristics.",

In the visual system, this process is regulated by corticothalamic feedback during the experience-dependent phase of development. Yet the cortical circuits modulating this feedback remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate opposing roles for cortical somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in shaping retinogeniculate connectivity during the thalamic sensitive period (P20-30). Early in the refinement process, SST interneurons promote the strengthening and pruning of retinal inputs in the thalamus, as evidenced by disrupted synaptic refinement following their ablation. In contrast, PV interneurons, which mature later, act as a brake on this refinement, with their ablation leading to enhanced pruning of retinogeniculate connections. Notably, manipulating the relative balance between these inhibitory circuits can regulate sensory deprivation-induced retinogeniculate remodeling. Taken together, our findings show that cortical SST and PV interneuron circuits drive experience-dependent reciprocal antagonism that gates cortical feedback regulation of feedforward thalamic refinement.",

          "abstract": "Negative feedback of the cochlear efferent system plays a critical role in control of hearing sensitivity and protection from noise trauma. Type II auditory nerves (ANs) innervate outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea and provide an input to the cochlear efferent system to achieve hearing sensitivity controlling and protection; in particular, medial olivocochlear efferent nerves innervate OHCs to control OHC electromotility, which is an active cochlear amplifier in mammals. However, little is known about channel information underlying type II AN activity and consequent function. Here, we report that ATP-gated P2x7 receptor had a predominant expression at type II spiral ganglion (SG) neurons and the synaptic areas under inner hair cells and OHCs with lateral and medial olivocochlear efferent nerves. Knockout (KO) of P2x7 increased hearing sensitivity with enhanced acoustic startle response, auditory brainstem response, and cochlear microphonics by increasing OHC electromotility. P2x7 KO also increased susceptibility to noise and exacerbated ribbon synapse degeneration. Middle-level noise exposure could impair active cochlear mechanics resulting in hearing loss in P2x7 KO mice. These data demonstrate that P2x7 receptors have a critical role in type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent system to control hearing sensitivity; deficiency of P2x7 receptors can impair type II SG neuron’s function and the cochlear efferent suppression leading to increase of active cochlear amplification and hearing oversensitivity, i.e., hyperacusis, and susceptibility to noise, which may also associate with other hearing disorders, such as tinnitus.",

          "abstract": "The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO 2 were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO 2 levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. We assume that the capability to make accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature changes existed in 1860, and then apply a standard “fingerprint” method to determine the time at which a human-caused climate change signal was first detectable. Pronounced cooling of the mid- to upper stratosphere, mainly driven by anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, would have been identifiable with high confidence by approximately 1885, before the advent of gas-powered cars. These results arise from the favorable signal-to-noise characteristics of the mid- to upper stratosphere, where the signal of human-caused cooling is large and the pattern of this cooling differs markedly from patterns of intrinsic variability. Even if our monitoring capability in 1860 had not been global, and high-quality stratospheric temperature measurements existed for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes only, it still would have been feasible to detect human-caused stratospheric cooling by 1894, only 34 y after the assumed start of climate monitoring. Our study provides strong evidence that a discernible human influence on atmospheric temperature has likely existed for over 130 y.",

          "abstract": "The host–microbiome interface is rich in metabolite exchanges and exquisitely sensitive to diet. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is present at high concentrations at this interface and is a product of both microbial and host metabolism. The mitochondrial enzyme, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), couples H 2 S detoxification to oxidative phosphorylation; its inherited deficiency presents as Leigh disease. Since an estimated two-thirds of systemic H 2 S metabolism originates in the gut, it raises questions as to whether impaired sulfide clearance in this compartment contributes to disease and whether it can be modulated by dietary sulfur content. In this study, we report that SQOR deficiency confined to murine intestinal epithelial cells perturbs colon bioenergetics that is reversed by antibiotics, revealing a significant local contribution of microbial H 2 S to host physiology. We also find that a 2.5-fold higher methionine intake, mimicking the difference between animal and plant proteins, synergizes with intestinal SQOR deficiency to adversely impact colon architecture and alter microbiome composition. In serum, increased thiosulfate, a biomarker of H 2 S oxidation, reveals that intestinal SQOR deficiency combined with higher dietary methionine affects sulfide metabolism globally and perturbs energy metabolism as indicated by higher ketone bodies. The mice exhibit lower exploratory locomotor activity while brain MRI reveals an atypical reduction in ventricular volume, which is associated with lower aquaporin 1 that is important for cerebrospinal fluid secretion. Our study reveals the dynamic interaction between dietary sulfur intake and sulfide metabolism at the host–microbe interface, impacting gut health, and the potential for lower dietary methionine intake to modulate pathology.",

          "abstract": "The thymus is one of the most important organs of the immune system. It is responsible for both the production of T cells and the prevention of their autoimmunity. It comprises two types of tissue: The cortex, where nascent T cells (thymocytes) are generated; and the medulla, embedded within the cortex, where autoreactive thymocytes are eliminated through negative selection. In mice, the medulla exhibits a complex, convoluted morphology, which has raised the question of whether its form impacts its function. Intriguingly, experiments also reveal a reverse dependency: The interactions between medullary stroma and thymocytes shape the medullary structure. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of medulla morphogenesis emerging from these interactions remains elusive. Here, we present a conceptual theoretical model showing that central, experimentally verified signaling pathways suffice to shape the convoluted medullary structure. The mathematical analysis of the model explains the observed effects of chemotaxis on thymocyte localization, and the reported morphological changes resulting from the modulation of thymocyte production. Our findings reveal that the cross-talk between medulla growth and negative selection of thymocytes not only regulates medullary volume but also orchestrates the morphology of the thymus medulla. This mechanism of structure formation robustly organizes the medulla in a way that accelerates thymocyte negative selection by improving their chemotactic migration into the medulla. Thereby, we identify a feedback between the function of the thymus medulla and its form. Our theoretical study motivates further experimental analysis of the spatial distribution of thymic cell populations and predicts morphological changes under genetic perturbations.",

In the case of octoploid strawberry with four subgenomes designated ABCD, the identities of the diploid progenitors for subgenomes C and D have been subject to much debate. By integrating new sequencing data from North American diploids with reticulate phylogeny and admixture analyses, we uncovered introgression from an extinct or unsampled species in the clade of Fragaria viridis , Fragaria nipponica , and Fragaria nilgerrensis into the donor of subgenome A of octoploid Fragaria prior to its divergence from F. vesca subsp . bracteata . We also detected an introgression event from F. iinumae into an ancestor of F. nipponica and F. nilgerrensis. Using an LTR-age-distribution-based approach, we estimate that the octoploid and its intermediate hexaploid and tetraploid ancestors emerged approximately 0.8, 2, and 3 million years ago, respectively. These results provide an explanation for previous reports of F. viridis and F. nipponica as donors of the C and D subgenomes and suggest a greater role than previously thought for homoploid hybridization in the diploid progenitors of octoploid strawberry. The integrated set of approaches used here can help advance polyploid genome analysis in other species where hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting obscure evolutionary relationships.",

However, achieving controllable locomotion of such robots on terrestrial surfaces remains challenging because fluctuating adhesion on nonideal surfaces disrupts the necessary asymmetry for propulsion. Here, we present a microscopic robot composed of three-dimensional nanomembranes, which navigate diverse terrestrial surfaces with omnidirectional motion. We propose a general mechanism employing nonreciprocal shape morphing to generate stable asymmetric forces on surfaces. This nonreciprocal shape morphing is realized through a laser-actuated vanadium dioxide nanomembrane, leveraging the material's inherent hysteresis properties. We demonstrate that these robots can be fabricated in various shapes, ranging from simple square structures to bioinspired \"bipedal\" helical designs, enabling them to directionally navigate challenging surfaces such as paper, leaves, sand, and vertical walls. Furthermore, their omnidirectional motion facilitates applications in microassembly and microelectronic circuit integration. Additionally, we developed an artificial intelligence control algorithm based on reinforcement learning, enabling these robots to autonomously follow complex trajectories, such as tracing the phrase \"hello world\".

This framework has animated research on psychological phenomena ranging from habit formation to social learning, moral decision-making, and cognitive development. Here, we propose that model-based and model-free algorithms may not be as aligned with deliberate and automatic evaluative processing as prevailing theories suggest. Across three preregistered behavioral experiments involving adult human participants (total n = 2,572), we show that model-based algorithms shape not only deliberate but also automatic evaluations. Experiment 1 numerically replicates past findings suggesting that deliberate (but not automatic) evaluative responses are uniquely shaped by model-based algorithms but, critically, also reveals confounds that render interpretation of this evidence equivocal. Experiments 2 to 3 eliminate these confounds and reveal robust model-based contributions to automatic evaluative processing across two measures of automatic evaluation, supported by multinomial processing tree modeling.

          "abstract": "Cellular senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest, plays a pivotal role in development, aging, and tumor suppression. However, the fundamental pathway coordinating senescence and neoplastic transformation remains unclear. Here, we describe the tumorigenic involvement of ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 4 (UBR4), an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the N-degron pathway, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Public genome databases revealed high UBR4 expression in LUAD patients, associated with a dysregulated cell cycle and impaired mitochondrial homeostasis. UBR4 knockout (ΔUBR4) in A549 lung cancer cells induced cellular senescence with defective mitochondria. Restoration of UBR4 or antioxidant treatment reversed the ΔUBR4 phenotypes caused by impaired mitophagy. Mitochondrial stress exacerbated mitochondrial dysfunction in ΔUBR4 cells, contributing to diverse cellular phenotypes. Additionally, ΔUBR4 cells exhibited substantially slow tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. In LUAD patients, UBR4 levels correlated with tumor stage, mitophagy markers, and poor survival. These findings suggest a tumor-promoting function of UBR4 in LUAD by regulating mitochondrial quality control. Further research into the pharmacological inhibition of UBR4 could open promising avenues for developing effective antitumor therapies targeting LUAD.",

          "abstract": "We demonstrate a tripling in the frequency of planetary wave resonance events over the past halfcentury, coinciding with the rise in persistent boreal summer weather extremes. This increase aligns with changes in the underlying climate conditions favoring these events, including amplified Arctic warming and land–sea thermal contrast. We also observe increased prevalence of resonant amplification events following the mature phase of strong El Niño events, suggesting that such events may precondition the mean state conditions in ways that favor large-scale quasi-stationary wave patterns and quasi-resonant wave amplification. Since the impact of anthropogenic warming on quasi-resonant amplification is not well captured by current-generation climate models, it is likely that models are underpredicting the potential increase, indicating even greater risk of persistent extreme summer weather events with ongoing warming.",

          "abstract": "Circulating monocytes are recruited to the tumor microenvironment, where they can differentiate into macrophages that mediate tumor progression. To reach the tumor microenvironment, monocytes must first extravasate and migrate through the type-1 collagen rich stromal matrix. The viscoelastic stromal matrix around tumors not only stiffens relative to normal stromal matrix, but often exhibits enhanced viscous characteristics, as indicated by a higher loss tangent or faster stress relaxation rate. Here, we studied how changes in matrix stiffness and viscoelasticity impact the three-dimensional (3D) migration of monocytes through stromal-like matrices. Interpenetrating networks of type-1 collagen and alginate, which enable independent tunability of stiffness and stress relaxation over physiologically relevant ranges, were used as confining matrices for 3D culture of monocytes. Increased stiffness and faster stress relaxation independently enhanced the 3D migration of monocytes. Migrating monocytes have an ellipsoidal or rounded wedge-like morphology, reminiscent of amoeboid migration, with accumulation of actin at the trailing edge. Matrix adhesions were dispensable for monocyte migration in 3D, but migration did require actin polymerization and myosin contractility. Mechanistic studies indicate that actin polymerization at the leading edge generates protrusive forces that open a path for the monocytes to migrate through in the confining viscoelastic matrices. Taken together, our findings implicate matrix stiffness and stress relaxation as key mediators of monocyte migration and reveal how monocytes use pushing forces at the leading edge mediated by actin polymerization to generate migration paths in confining viscoelastic matrices.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation at scale is critical for achieving a sustainable future for humanity. However, achieving collective, cooperative behavior—in which intelligent actors in complex environments jointly improve their well-being—remains poorly understood. Complex systems science (CSS) provides a rich understanding of collective phenomena, the evolution of cooperation, and the institutions that can sustain both. Yet, much of the theory in this area fails to fully consider individual-level complexity and environmental context—largely for the sake of tractability and because it has not been clear how to do so rigorously. These elements are well captured in multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL), which has recently put focus on cooperative (artificial) intelligence. However, typical MARL simulations can be computationally expensive and challenging to interpret. In this perspective, we propose that bridging CSS and MARL affords new directions forward. Both fields can complement each other in their goals, methods, and scope. MARL offers CSS concrete ways to formalize cognitive processes in dynamic environments. CSS offers MARL improved qualitative insight into emergent collective phenomena. We see this approach as providing the necessary foundations for a proper science of collective, cooperative intelligence. We highlight work that is already heading in this direction and discuss concrete steps for future research.",

          "abstract": "Pure siderite [Fe II CO 3 ] was recently discovered in abundant quantities (4.8 to 10.5 wt.%) by the Curiosity rover at Gale crater, Mars. Diagenetic alteration of siderite likely caused the carbonate-sequestered CO 2 to be released back into the atmosphere and consequently produced ferric [Fe(III)] oxyhydr(oxide) minerals. Here, using laboratory experimentation, we demonstrate that while closed system acid diagenesis—as proposed for Gale crater—is incapable of effective siderite alteration in Mars-relevant fluids, oxyhalogen compounds (chlorate and bromate) can weather siderite not only at acidic pH but also in near-neutral Mars-relevant solutions. The ferric oxyhydroxide minerals produced as a consequence are controlled by the diagenetic fluid composition. While photooxidation is possible, the mutually exclusive products of alteration—magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) during ultraviolet irradiation and ferric oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) by oxyhalogens—demonstrate that siderite at Gale crater underwent chemical weathering by chlorate and bromate brines owing to the complete absence of magnetite in drill samples containing siderite. We propose a top–down oxyhalogen brine percolation model to explain the iron mineralogy of the sulfate-rich unit at Gale crater. We conclude that siderite alteration by acidic fluids alone cannot explain the redox disequilibrium witnessed in Gale crater sediments as promulgated before and siderite weathering by oxyhalogen brines is the most likely explanation. It is highly likely that the halogen cycle on Mars is interlinked to the iron and the carbon cycle on early and current Mars.",

Quantifying the aesthetic value of reef ecosystems and uncovering the conditions that enhance it could support NCP-based management. Here, we combine a global dataset of reef fish surveys, species-level aesthetic values, and causal modeling to assess the global status and drivers of reef fish assemblage aesthetic value. We find that aesthetic value is inherently linked to species richness, displaying a latitudinal gradient with peaks in the tropics, but varies strongly with the presence of exceptionally beautiful or less-beautiful species. Sea surface temperature, primary productivity, human gravity, and protection status are the strongest drivers of assemblage-level aesthetic value. Protection against human impacts consistently enhances aesthetic value by boosting taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity, and this effect is greatest in species-rich, tropical ecoregions. Economic development has little influence, indicating that low-income countries are not constrained from maintaining beautiful fish assemblages. Our results therefore suggest that marine protected areas (MPAs) can support multiple NCPs simultaneously, particularly in developing tropical countries. While we highlight the effectiveness of MPAs, given the low level of marine protection globally and the sensitivity of aesthetic value to environmental conditions, the beauty of the world’s reefs appears severely threatened. Aesthetic value should be immediately integrated into reef conservation and management plans.",

However, those current models of machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) consider no relevant physical constraints or global scaling and thus may owe intrinsic out-of-domain difficulty which underlies the challenges of model generalizability and physical scalability. Here, by incorporating the global universal scaling law, we develop an ultrasmall parameterized MLIP with superlinear expressive capability, named SUS 2 -MLIP. Due to the global scaling derived from the universal equation of state (UEOS), SUS 2 -MLIP not only has significantly reduced parameters by decoupling the element space from coordinate space but also naturally outcomes the out-of-domain difficulty and endows the model with inherent generalizability and scalability even with relatively small training dataset. The non-linearity-embedding transformation in radial function endows the model with superlinear expressive capability. SUS 2 -MLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art MLIP models with its exceptional computational efficiency, especially for multiple-element materials and physical scalability in property prediction. This work not only presents a highly efficient universal MLIP model but also sheds light on incorporating physical constraints into AI–aided materials simulation.",

          "abstract": "A charge density wave (CDW) is a phase of matter characterized by a periodic modulation of valence electron density coupled with lattice distortion. Its formation is closely tied to the dynamical charge susceptibility, χ ( q , ω ) , which reflects the collective electron dynamics of the material. Despite decades of study, χ ( q , ω ) near a CDW transition has never been measured at nonzero momentum, q , with meV energy resolution. Here, we investigate the canonical CDW transition in ErTe 3 using momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, a technique uniquely sensitive to valence band charge excitations. Unlike phonons, which soften via the Kohn anomaly, we find the electronic excitations exhibit purely relaxational dynamics well described by a diffusive model, with the diffusivity peaking just below the critical temperature, T C 1 . Additionally, we report for the first time a divergence in the real part of χ ( q , ω ) in the static limit ( ω → 0 ), a long-predicted hallmark of CDWs. Unexpectedly, this divergence occurs as T → 0 , with only a weak thermodynamic signature at T = T C 1 . Our study necessitates a reexamination of the traditional description of CDW formation in quantum materials.",

Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage, and a notable excess of protein changing substitutions points toward selection on neurosensory, physiological, and reproductive genes.

Here we report ninety-five endogenous proteins retrieved from a nearly complete cranium from Harbin, China, dating to at least 146,000 years ago and previous assigned to a new species, Homo longi . This individual has three Denisovan derived amino acid variants and clusters with Denisova 3, suggesting the Harbin individual belongs to a Denisovan population. This study fills the gap between morphological and molecular evidence, enhancing our understanding of Denisovans’ spatiotemporal dispersal and evolutionary history.",

For arbitrarily complex geometries, designing and printing vasculature capable of adequate perfusion poses a major hurdle. We introduce a model-driven design platform that demonstrates rapid synthetic vascular model generation alongside multifidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and three-dimensional bioprinting. Key algorithmic advances accelerate vascular generation 230-fold and enable application to arbitrarily complex shapes. We demonstrate that organ-scale vascular network models can be generated and used to computationally vascularize &gt;200 engineered and anatomic models. Synthetic vascular perfusion improves cell viability in fabricated living-tissue constructs. This platform enables the rapid, scalable vascular model generation and fluid physics analysis for biomanufactured tissues that are necessary for future scale-up and production.",

Here, we use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

          "abstract": "Jaundice is a common presentation of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which arises from the accumulation of circulating bilirubin. It is not understood whether it represents an adaptive or maladaptive response to Plasmodium spp. infection. We found that asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in humans was associated with a higher ratio of unconjugated over conjugated bilirubin and parasite burden compared with symptomatic malaria. Genetic suppression of bilirubin synthesis by biliverdin reductase A (BVRA) increased parasite virulence and malaria mortality in mice. Accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in plasma, through genetic inhibition of hepatic conjugation by UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1), was protective against malaria in mice. Unconjugated bilirubin inhibited P. falciparum proliferation in red blood cells by a mechanism that suppressed mitochondrial pyrimidine synthesis. Moreover, unconjugated bilirubin inhibited hemozoin crystallization and compromised the parasite’s food vacuole. Hence, jaundice appears to represent a metabolic response to Plasmodium spp. infection that limits malaria severity.",

We have developed massively parallel ribosome profiling (MPRP) to determine open reading frames (ORFs) across tens of thousands of designed oligonucleotides. MPRP identified 4208 unannotated ORFs in 679 human-associated viral genomes. We found viral peptides originating from detected noncanonical ORFs presented on class-I human leukocyte antigen in infected cells and hundreds of upstream ORFs that likely modulate translation initiation of viral proteins. The discovery of viral ORFs across a wide range of viral families—including highly pathogenic viruses—expands the repertoire of vaccine targets and reveals potential cis-regulatory sequences.",

          "abstract": "Climate forcings by greenhouse gases and aerosols cause an imbalance at the top of the atmosphere between the net incoming solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation from Earth. This Earth energy imbalance has strengthened over the period 2001 to 2023 with satellite data. Here, we show that low climate sensitivity models fail to reproduce the trend in Earth energy imbalance, particularly in the individual longwave and shortwave contributions to the imbalance trend. The inability to produce a strong positive shortwave and strong negative longwave Earth energy imbalance trend is found to be a robust feature in the low climate sensitivity models, especially for models with a climate sensitivity below 2.5 kelvin. The negative longwave contribution to Earth energy imbalance is driven by surface temperature increases and is therefore most pronounced in high climate sensitivity models, whereas the shortwave contribution is generally positive and amplified by greater surface warming.",

A long-held structure-property relationship is that centrosymmetric crystals cannot differentially absorb circularly polarized light. In this study, we demonstrate the design, synthesis, and characterization of the centrosymmetric material Li 2 Co 3 (SeO 3 ) 4 , which violates this relationship not by defying symmetry-imposed selection rules but by invoking a photophysical process not previously characterized for crystalline solids. This process originates from an interference between linear dichroism and linear birefringence, referred to as LD-LB, and involves strong chiroptical signals that invert upon sample flipping. In addition to enabling a chiroptical response under centrosymmetry, this process opens up photonic engineering opportunities based on crystalline solids.",

Here, we report that RNA transcripts govern G4 landscapes through coordinated G-loop assembly and disassembly. G-loop assembly involves activation of the ATM and ATR kinases, followed by homology-directed invasion of RNA opposite the G4 strand mediated by BRCA2 and RAD51. Disassembly of the G-loop resolves the G4 structure through DHX36-FANCJ–mediated G4 unwinding, which triggers nucleolytic incision and subsequent hybrid strand renewal by DNA synthesis. Inhibition of G-loop disassembly causes global G4 and R-loop accumulation, leading to transcriptome dysregulation, replication stress, and genome instability. These findings establish an intricate G-loop assembly-disassembly mechanism that controls G4 landscapes and is essential for cellular homeostasis and survival.",

          "abstract": "Continued greenhouse gas emissions will accelerate global warming and intensity of heat waves, which already harm crop productivity. From the stability of key enzymes to canopy processes, photosynthesis is affected by temperature. All crops suffer declines in photosynthetic rate when temperatures cross critical thresholds, with irreversible losses typically occurring above 40° to 45°C. Protective measures within plants can be induced by growth at elevated temperatures but not from the sudden temperature elevation of heat waves. Strategies to improve the heat resilience of photosynthesis include modifying surface energy balance, optimizing canopy architecture, improving enzymatic heat tolerance, and (re)engineering key metabolic pathways for greater efficiency or to remove bottlenecks. This Review summarizes present knowledge on the major mechanisms that underlie high-temperature inhibition of photosynthesis and explores opportunities for breeding and biotechnological interventions to overcome them.",

          "abstract": "While occupying an influential position within one’s social network brings many advantages, it is unknown how certain individuals rise in social prominence. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen ( N  = 187), we test whether “climbing the social ladder” depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure and then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",

          "abstract": "Competition among news sources over public opinion can incentivize them to resort to misinformation. Sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement but ultimately damages the credibility of the source, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind news sources sharing misinformation, we model the competition between sources as a zero-sum sequential game, where news sources decide whether to share factual information or misinformation. Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics. We analyze this game through the concept of quantal response equilibrium, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making. The analysis shows that the resulting equilibria reproduce the credibility-opinion distribution of real-world news sources, with hyperpartisan sources spreading the majority of misinformation. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote a more factual information landscape.",

In the ear, the receptor potential of presynaptic inner hair cells (IHCs) covers the entire intensity range, while postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) tile the range with their firing rate codes. IHCs vary the voltage dependence of Ca 2+ channel activation among their active zones (AZs), potentially diversifying SGN firing. Here, we tested this hypothesis in mice modeling the human Ca V 1.3 A749G mutation that causes low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation. We demonstrate activation of Ca 2+ influx and glutamate release of IHC AZs at lower voltages, increased spontaneous firing in SGNs, and lower sound threshold of Ca V 1.3 A749G/A749G mice. Loss of synaptic ribbons in IHCs at ambient sound levels of mouse husbandry indicates that low-voltage Ca 2+ channel activation poses a risk for noise-induced synaptic damage. We propose that the heterogeneous voltage dependence of Ca V 1.3 activation among presynaptic IHC AZs contributes to the diversity of firing among the postsynaptic SGNs.",

Our system contains eight four-kilobit memristor chips with embedded floating-point computing workflows and a heterogeneous training scheme, representing a heterogeneous CIM platform that leverages precision-limited analog devices to accelerate floating-point neural network training. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by solving the one-dimensional Burgers’ equation and modeling the three-dimensional thermal conduction phenomenon.

We found that fenpropathrin-resistant female mites (YN-FeR, with target resistance: F1538I kdr mutation) exhibited significantly enhanced adaptability to various stress conditions, including exposure to different acaricides and high-temperature (34°C) and low-humidity environments (40% relative humidity). This evolution was attributed to cuticle thickening in resistant female mites. Cuticle protein CPR25 was identified as a critical gene mediating cuticle thickening. CPR25 regulated its own overexpression by producing a circular RNA, named circCPR25 , which acted as a decoy to selectively sequester and bind to the miR-34~317 cluster. This study revealed a distinctive mechanism underlying the evolution of stress resistance in spider mites. Specifically, a cuticle protein in spider mites regulates its own overexpression by producing a decoy circRNA, thereby promoting cuticle thickening and facilitating rapid adaptation to adverse conditions.",

While remarkable progress has been made in catalysts, solution design, and system engineering, recent breakthroughs reveal that nitrogen-containing molecules—specifically sp 2 -hybridized structures (e.g., pyridine) and sp 3 -hybridized moieties (e.g., ethanolamine) —hold untapped potential to revolutionize both CO 2 capture and conversion. These structures have been demonstrated as the Holy Grail in facilitating CO 2 activation, stabilizing key intermediates, and streamlining reaction pathways—capabilities rarely achievable with conventional strategies. However, limited mechanistic understanding of their physicochemical properties and interactions with CO 2 hampers broader application. This review highlights recent advances in leveraging sp 2 /sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen structures, unpacks their molecular roles in electrochemical CO 2 management, and offers a unifying framework for their dual-functionality across capture and conversion. By illuminating these nitrogen-based motifs, we uncover practical design principles and open avenues for integrating expanded N-containing compounds into energy technologies—paving the way for next-generation carbon management strategies.",

Dust exported by the northeasterly trade (Harmattan) winds creates marine sedimentary records that have been long interpreted to show that northern African climate became drier and more variable across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary [2.58 million years ago (Ma)], when global climate cooled and high-latitude glacial-interglacial cycles intensified. However, questions about the impact of summer rainfall on winter dust fluxes and thus the history of the African summer monsoons remain. We present a leaf wax hydrogen isotope record from offshore northwestern Africa that demonstrates that rainfall regimes remained stable and varied solely in response to 21,000-year cycles in summer insolation from 3.5 to 2.5 Ma. We infer that the summer rains and winter winds respond to different climate forcings, with summer rainfall driven by solar radiation over the northern African landmass and the winter trades affected by high-latitude climate and meridional temperature gradients.",

The optical drive of coherent magnetic collective excitations, namely magnons, represents a promising route. The ability to arbitrarily and nonthermally increase the magnon frequencies with laser pulses could enable this progress. However, this effect has not been reported to date. To achieve it, here, we explore the optical resonant excitation of high-momentum magnons, which experimentally are observed to couple to low-momentum magnons, modifying the frequencies and amplitudes thereof. This evidence, not caused by laser heating, is explained with a resonant light-scattering mechanism coupling high- and low-momentum eigenmodes across momentum space. Our results disclose routes to inducing instabilities and phase transitions via mode softening and potentially even light-driven Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons and superconductivity mediated by high-momentum spin-fluctuations.",

Here, we demonstrate highly pure and stable single-photon emitters (SPEs) in h-BN by directly growing carbon-doped, centimeter-scale h-BN thin films using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. These SPEs exhibit room temperature operation with polarized emission, achieving a g (2) (0) value of 0.015, which is among the lowest reported for room temperature SPEs and the lowest achieved for h-BN SPEs. It also exhibits high brightness (~0.5 million counts per second), remarkable stability during continuous operation (&gt;15 min), and a Debye-Waller factor of 45%. First-principles calculations reveal unique carbon defects responsible for these properties, enabled by PLD’s low-temperature synthesis and in situ doping.

Our approach uses an enantioselective crystallization of racemic catalysts on a FM surface, using a small-scale crystallization vial connected to a bulk racemic solution. Racemic catalysts controllably crystallize into their respective enantiopure forms and are directly used in asymmetric reactions.

Our experimental results reveal the pressure-temperature conditions for amorphization, decomposition, and melting of labradorite and anorthite. The boundary between amorphous plagioclase and crystalline high-pressure phases in our phase diagram indicate diaplectic glass can form at 1300 to 1500 kelvin, and the melting line suggests that maskelynite can be generated above 3000 kelvin at high pressures.

An optimized chemical synthesis enabled preparation of diverse IAPP glycoforms with complex glycan structures, allowing systematic evaluation of their effects on aggregation, cytotoxicity, and solubility. Sialylated glycans at Thr 30 completely inhibited IAPP aggregation, eliminated cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β cells, and enhanced solubility by up to 280-fold. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations revealed that glycosylation impedes adoption of a four-stranded β-sheet conformation in IAPP dimers. These findings advance the understanding of the role of natural glycosylation in aggregation and highlight its potential as an evolutionarily inspired strategy to enhance the therapeutic utility of IAPP.",

Here, we present an on-chip, all-silicon implementation of deformed VPCs that enable robust transmission along arbitrary shapes and bends. Although the lattice is amorphous and lacks long-range periodicity, the topological protection is sustained by short-range order. Furthermore, we show an amorphous lattice functioning as a frequency-dependent router, splitting input signals into two perpendicular output ports. We also demonstrate on-chip terahertz communication, achieving data rates of up to 72 Gbps.

The residues Cys 26 , Asn 38 , and Cys 39 were critical for ATP binding with CfEC92, and mutations at these sites impaired the ability to suppress host immunity. CfEC92 interacted with MdNDPK2, a negative immune regulator in apple. The CfEC92-ATP complex altered the conformation of MdNDPK2, enhancing its affinity for ATP, and further increasing its autophosphorylation and kinase activity.

Intriguingly, GIPR agonism appears to induce antiemetic effects, potentially alleviating part of the nausea and vomiting side effects common to GLP-1R agonists like semaglutide. Here, we show in rats and shrews that GIPR agonism blocks emesis and attenuates other malaise behaviors elicited by GLP-1R activation while maintaining reduced food intake and body weight loss and improved glucose tolerance. The GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide induced significantly fewer side effects than equipotent doses of semaglutide. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of combined pharmaceutical strategies activating both incretin systems, leading to enhanced therapeutic index and reduced occurrence of nausea and vomiting for obesity and diabetes treatments.",

Gaia leverages gLM2, a mixed-modality genomic language model trained on both amino acid sequences and their genomic neighborhoods to generate embeddings that integrate sequence-structure-context information. This approach allows for the identification of functionally and/or evolutionarily related genes that are found in conserved genomic contexts, which may be missed by traditional sequence- or structure-based search alone. Gaia enables real-time search of a curated database comprising more than 85 million protein clusters from 131,744 microbial genomes.

Furthermore, through inoculating P. polymyxa in the natural rhizosphere microbiome and analyzing its antagonistic interactions against root microbes, we suggest that Pp-AIPs may influence the microbial community composition through modulating the antimicrobial spectrum. Global analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) reveal widespread co-occurrence of uncharacterized AIPs with secondary metabolite BGCs.

          "abstract": "Cell behavior emerges from the intracellular distribution of properties such as protrusion, contractility, and adhesion. Thus, characteristic emergent rules of collective migration can arise from cell-cell contacts locally tweaking architecture, orchestrating self-regulation during development, wound healing, and cancer progression. The Drosophila testis-nascent-myotube system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a role for the axon guidance factor Plexin A in collective cell migration: maintaining cell-cell interfaces at a precise point on the mesenchymal-to-epithelial continuum. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must maintain filopodial N-cadherin–based junctions and remain ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data further suggest Semaphorin 1b is a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. This reveals a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet integrity during migration, driving organ morphogenesis. This is relevant for mesenchymal organ sculpting in other migratory contexts such as angiogenesis.",

We identify spermidine as a key polyamine for Babesia duncani and Plasmodium falciparum for intraerythrocytic development. We demonstrate that spermidine is indispensable for regulating protein translation through hypusination of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A, and its depletion leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species. Disruption of spermidine biosynthesis or its conversion from spermine results in parasite death. We also show that B. duncani and other Babesia species use an ancestral spermidine synthase–like enzyme, highlighting a distinct evolutionary adaptation from P. falciparum . Our results reveal the spermidine’s dual role in oxidative stress defense and translation regulation, positioning spermidine biosynthesis as a critical vulnerability and a promising therapeutic target.",

Inspired by human cortical neurons that perform XOR through dendritic calcium spikes, the d-OECN leverages ion-tunable antiambipolarity in mixed ionic-electronic conducting polymers to mimic voltage-gated dendritic calcium dynamics. By integrating this dendritic component with a tunable spiking circuit representing the soma, the d-OECN achieves XOR classification through its inherent nonlinear activation profile, with decision boundaries that are both ionically and electrically tunable. Moreover, we demonstrate the d-OECN’s ability to perform edge detection using XOR in a tactile sensing system, showcasing its potential for event-based sensing and processing.

The MSRM’s rotatable tip design enhances accessibility and navigation speed through a rotation-assisted active steering strategy. Improved blood clot treatment efficiency is achieved through the MSRM’s multifunctionality: It can accelerate drug-blood clot interactions, mechanically break down blood clots, and retrieve clot debris. The low invasiveness is attributed to the soft material design and conservative actuation strategy.

We show that at the peak of acute inflammatory pain, superficial medullary dorsal horn projection neurons (PNs) that relay nociceptive information to the parabrachial nucleus reduce their intrinsic excitability and, consequently, action potential firing. When pain resolves, the excitability of these neurons returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current ( I A ) underlies the decrease in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn PNs in acute pain conditions. In chronic pain conditions, no changes of I A were observed, and medullary dorsal horn PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal a differential modulation of the excitability of medullary dorsal horn projection neurons in acute and chronic pain conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that, in acute pain conditions, tunes the output of the dorsal horn and, if lacking, could facilitate pain chronification.",

The stratigraphic data along with 26 additional radiocarbon dates on palustrine mud determined by two labs independent of the original investigations document an aggrading lake/wetland/stream record that includes the tracks and spans &gt;23.6 thousand years to ~17.0 thousand calibrated years before present, providing another line of evidence further supporting the validity of an LGM age for the tracks.",

          "abstract": "Predation is a major evolutionary driver of life history and morphology. However, whether these traits evolve directly via predation or indirect effects is largely unresolved. We used artificial selection to experimentally test the impact of adult predation on the evolution of life history and morphology in guppies ( Poecilia reticulata ). We found that, compared to control fish, predation-selected fish produced larger offspring and larger broods early in life. However, other life history parameters, such as interbrood interval and total number of offspring, showed no response. We also found that predation selected for smaller and lighter females and for shorter tails and gonopodia in males, with no effect on body coloration. Our results show that while several traits evolve fast under selection on adult predation, several “classic” predation-dependent traits seem unaffected by predation selection. By comparing our experimental results to those from natural populations, we can disentangle the contribution of direct and indirect effects on trait evolution under predation pressure.",

Here, we identify IL-17 as a novel driver of LKB1-dependent polyp growth. GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations in Stk11 (which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4 + T helper 17 (T H 17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory potential, as Stk11 /LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages (CD4 + T H 17 and CD8 + T c 17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic T H 17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. These findings establish LKB1 as a gatekeeper of inflammatory type 3 (IL-17–dependent) T cell responses and identify a CRTC2–IL-17 signaling axis that can be targeted therapeutically to block the growth of LKB1 mutant GI tumors.",

We demonstrate that the RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) drives glutamine reprogramming to support ccRCC growth and survival. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of FTO in ccRCC cells impaired glutamine-derived reductive carboxylation, depleted pyrimidines, and increased reactive oxygen species. This led to increased DNA damage and reduced survival, which could be rescued by pyrimidine nucleobases or the antioxidant N -acetylcysteine. Mechanistically, FTO demethylates the glutamine transporter solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5) messenger RNA to promote its expression. Restoration of SLC1A5 expression in FTO-knockdown cells rescued metabolic and survival defects. FTO inhibition reduced ccRCC tumor xenograft and PDX growth under the renal capsule. Our findings indicate that FTO is an epitranscriptomic regulator of ccRCC glutamine reprogramming and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting FTO for the treatment of ccRCC.",

Further, we demonstrate that multiple dynein motors tethered to rigid cargoes, such as HIV-1 capsids, display reduced motility, distinct from the behavior of multiple motors on membranous cargoes.

The interaction between the disordered amino-terminal domain of PXN and the carboxyl-terminal targeting domain of FAK (FAT) is necessary and sufficient for localizing FAK to focal adhesions. Furthermore, PXN serves as a platform for recruiting other proteins that together control the dynamic changes needed for cell migration and survival. Here, we show that the PXN N-domain undergoes significant compaction upon FAT binding, forming a 48-kilodalton multimodal complex with four major interconverting states. Although the complex is flexible, each state has unique sets of contacts involving disordered regions that are both highly represented in ensembles and conserved. PXN being a hub protein, the results provide a structural basis for understanding how shifts in the multistate equilibrium (e.g., through ligand binding and phosphorylation) may rewire cellular networks leading to phenotypic changes.",

The NHEJ function of senataxin is redundant with the RECQL5 helicase and the HLTF translocase and is epistatic with ATM. Co-inactivation of ATM, RECQL5, and HLTF results in an NHEJ defect similar to that from the combined deficiency of DNA-PKcs and senataxin or losing senataxin, RECQL5, and HLTF.

In the tissue, crimped, long, strong collagen fibers are embedded in a soft matrix. As a crack grows in the matrix, the fibers decrimp, reorient, slip, and bridge the crack. These microscopic processes enable the fibers to transmit high tension over a long distance. Using two types of experiments, we measure the bridging traction as a function of crack separation, σ(δ). The peak traction is σ 0  ~ 60 megapascals. The maximum separation is δ 0  ~ 6 millimeters, two to four orders of magnitude higher than that of hard tissues.

With the two features as the addressing indexes, the physical separation of subsets from a diverse pool of DNA files is achieved, thereby facilitating the selective retrieval of stored data. The interconnected nanopore arrays and uniformly distributed positive charges within the microspheres enhance DNA enrichment, achieving a storage density of up to 22.6 exabytes per gram, far exceeding that of previous random access storage methods.

Here, we demonstrate that, in mice, stressors shift the phase of the central pacemaker, housed in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), through glutamatergic inputs from the anterior paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (aPVT). Unlike light, which can phase delay or advance the central pacemaker, stressors consistently induce delays, effects attenuated by inhibiting aPVT neurons. Stressors robustly activate AVP-expressing neurons within the SCN and are associated with inhibition of VIP-expressing neurons, whereas light strongly activates VIP-expressing neurons with minimal effects on AVP-expressing neurons. Pairing stressors with light reveals distinct time-dependent interactions, enhancing phase delays at early night but abolishing phase advances at late night. Our findings uncover distinct SCN microcircuits that differentially encode light and stressors, providing insights into how environmental cues modulate circadian timing.",

Our unbinned diversity reconstruction reveals unexpectedly simple diversity dynamics in this exceptionally well-preserved clade. We identify two (and likely a third) truncated exponential diversifications and four major diversity declines.

Experimentally, ZC3H4 deficiency led to increased DNA damage, abnormal mitosis, and cellular senescence. Biochemical analysis and super-resolution microscopy revealed that the loss of ZC3H4 increased replication stress (RS)—a major driver of genome instability—by inducing a hypertranscription state that promoted R loop formation and transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), both of which drive RS. Further bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that ZC3H4 preferentially binds to genomic regions prone to TRCs and R loops, where it suppresses ncRNA bursts, functioning as part of the Restrictor complex. Our findings identify ZC3H4 as a crucial factor in maintaining genome integrity, strategically positioned at the critical intersection of DNA and RNA synthesis.",

When combined, collagen networks rigidify via synergistic mechanical interactions and stiffen only with higher mechanical loads. However, how cells respond to the nonlinear elasticity of collagen in hybrid networks remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that when collagen rigidifies by the interpenetration of a second polymer, the amount of force that initially stiffens the network (onset of stiffening, σ c ) increases and is sufficient to stimulate an increase in intracellular tension. We investigated this effect by precisely controlling the nonlinear elasticity of collagen with the synthetic semiflexible polymer, polyisocyanopeptides. We find that small increases in σ c induce a biphasic response in cell-matrix interactions, influencing how cells migrate, proliferate, and generate contractile force. Our results suggest that cells adaptively respond to changes in the nonlinear mechanics of collagen, which may be a mechanistic behavior used during tissue homeostasis or when collagen rigidifies during pathological conditions.",

We also identified the erosion of genes required for methylotrophic methanogenesis along with horizontal acquisition of multiheme cytochromes and other loci uniquely associated with ANME. The assembly and comparative analysis of multiple Methanovorans genomes offers important functional context for understanding the niche-defining metabolic differences between methane-oxidizing ANME and their methanogen relatives. Furthermore, this work illustrates the multiple evolutionary modes at play in the transition to a globally important metabolic niche.",

          "abstract": "Elevated levels of asparagine, catalyzed by asparagine synthetase (ASNS), have been identified as a prerequisite for lung metastasis in breast cancer. However, the roles and regulatory mechanisms of ASNS in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) are not well understood. Our study revealed that the family with sequence similarity 50 member A (FAM50A) gene substantially modulates the brain metastatic potential of breast cancer by up-regulating ASNS and promoting asparagine biosynthesis. We demonstrated that FAM50A forms a complex with chromosome 9 open reading frame 78 (C9ORF78), specifically at the S121 residue, to enhance ASNS transcription. This interaction accelerates the rate of ASNS-mediated asparagine synthesis, which is essential in facilitating metastatic cascades to the brain. From a therapeutic perspective, both the genetic suppression of FAM50A and pharmacological inhibition of asparagine synthesis effectively counteract BCBM. Our results highlight the importance of the FAM50A-ASNS signaling pathway in BCBM therapy.",

          "abstract": "Roadbed tribological energy (RTE) is a promising recoverable resource with an estimated potential on the terawatt scale, generated annually by the interaction between tires and road surfaces. However, RTE remains underutilized due to the lack of effective energy harvesting technologies that can address its high-entropy characteristics. Here, we present a revolutionary harvester formed by a freestanding layer triboelectric nanogenerator array embedded in the road. The harvester effectively converts low-grade vibratory RTE into electrical energy. It demonstrates the potential to achieve a peak power of 16.409 milliwatts and an average power of 2.2 milliwatts from a compact 78–square centimeter road area under a single tire impact, with a triboelectric conversion efficiency of 11.723%. In addition, we developed a self-powered intelligent and connected transportation system (SP-ICTS), integrating a five-in-one harvesting array. Experimental findings show that the system can meet the SP-ICTS’s electricity requirements along a 1-kilometer segment with a 50-meter harvester.",

          "abstract": "Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) is extensively used in medical implants for its excellent bioinertness. Existing methods to fix e-PTFE implants on host tissues mainly use invasive anchorage such as sutures, spiral tacks, or metal skeletons, which has limitations such as being time-consuming and causing leakage and tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a bioadhesive interface to realize the adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants. We integrate a hydrophilic and bioadhesive hydrogel layer on the hydrophobic and bioinert e-PTFE by designing a facile approach of freezing-induced micromechanical interlocking. The integration is robust enough as pulling hydrogel out of the interlocked pores on e-PTFE requires large energy dissipation. This bioadhesive interface enables instant (operating time &lt; 10 seconds) and secure (adhesion energy &gt;200 joules per square meter) adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants to wet tissue. The advantages for reducing inflammatory response, fibrogenesis, and the resultant postoperative adhesion are further demonstrated in a reconstructive surgery of an abdominal wall defect in rabbits.",

          "abstract": "The ecological and evolutionary success of multicellular lineages stems substantially from their increased size relative to unicellular ancestors. However, large size poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding nutrient transport: These constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations. Here, we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism—spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically generated density gradients—can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by ciliary actuation in extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a “biophysical scaffold” to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities before genetically encoded innovations.",

Starting from a chemical library, we evolved ST171, a bitopic 5-HT 1A R agonist that revealed highly potent and functionally selective G i/o signaling without G s activation and marginal β-arrestin recruitment. ST171 is effective in acute and chronic pain models. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of ST171 bound to 5-HT 1A R in complex with the G i protein compared to the canonical agonist befiradol bound to complexes of 5-HT 1A R with G i or G s revealed that the ligands occupy different exo-sites. The individual binding poses are associated with ligand-specific receptor conformations that were further studied by molecular dynamics simulations, allowing us to better understand ligand bias, a phenomenon that may be crucial to the discovery of more effective and safe G protein–coupled receptor drugs.",

A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to current therapies or experience intolerable side effects. Transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at bulk and single-cell resolution identified transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling as a key upstream regulator, driving aberrant basement membrane (BM) protein production by neoplastic Schwann cells and Fbs. Conditional TGFβ1 overexpression in Nf1 -deficient Schwann cells driven by Hoxb7- Cre promoted PNF growth and malignant transformation in vivo. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) reduced PNF tumor burden in Nf1 mutant mice. Proteomic characterization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) showed reduced BM proteins upon TGFβRI inhibition. These findings implicate TGFβ as a potential therapeutic target in PNF and provide insights into the role of TGFβ signaling in orchestrating ECM dynamics in the PNF microenvironment.",

          "abstract": "The Argonaute CSR-1 is essential for germline development in C. elegans . Loss of CSR-1 leads to the down-regulation of thousands of germline-expressed genes, supporting a model in which CSR-1 “licenses” gene expression via a poorly understood mechanism. In contrast, a small subset of genes is up-regulated in csr-1 mutants, including morc-1 , which encodes a conserved GHKL-type ATPase. We show that morc-1 is overexpressed in csr-1 mutants and accumulates over CSR-1 licensed targets, coinciding with aberrant gain of H3K9me3, reduced H3K36me3, and transcriptional repression. Notably, loss of morc-1 fully rescues these chromatin defects and partially restores gene expression and fertility in csr-1 mutants. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MORC-1 in the wild-type germ line is sufficient to repress CSR-1 licensed targets and severely compromise fertility. These findings support a model in which CSR-1 prevents MORC-1 overexpression and consequent misregulation of CSR-1 licensed genes.",
