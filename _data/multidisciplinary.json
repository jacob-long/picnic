          "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent difficulties in the labour market1,2,3,4,5,6, whereas their native-born children typically experience economic progress6,7,8,9. However, little is known about the extent to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labour market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Here, using data from nine European and North American countries, we show that the segregation of workers with immigrant backgrounds into lower-paying jobs accounts for about three-quarters of overall immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains notable for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that unequal access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of institutionally and demographically diverse contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language training10,11,12,13, job training13,14,15, job search assistance programmes13,15, improving access to domestic education13,16,17, recognizing foreign qualifications18,19, and settlement programmes aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks13,20,21. Policies that target employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely to be effective, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited scope for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap22,23,24,25,26,27,28.",

          "abstract": "The Standard Model of particle physics—the theory of particles and interactions at the smallest scale—predicts that matter and antimatter interact differently due to violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation transforms particles into their antimatter particles, whereas the parity transformation inverts spatial coordinates. This prediction applies to both mesons, which consist of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are composed of three quarks. However, despite having been discovered in various meson decays, CP violation has yet to be observed in baryons, the type of matter that makes up the observable Universe. Here we report a study of the decay of the beauty baryon $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b to the p K − π + π − final state, which proceeds through b → u or b → s quark-level transitions, and its CP-conjugated process, using data collected by the Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment 1 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The results reveal significant asymmetries between the decay rates of the $${\\varLambda }_{0}^{b}$$ Λ 0 b baryon and its CP-conjugated antibaryon, providing, to our knowledge, the first observation of CP violation in baryon decays and demonstrating the different behaviours of baryons and antibaryons. In the Standard Model, CP violation arises from the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa mechanism 2 , and new forces or particles beyond the Standard Model could provide further contributions. This discovery opens a new path in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model.",

          "abstract": "Non-antibiotic drugs can alter the composition of the gut microbiome 1 , but they have largely unknown implications for human health 2 . Here we examined how non-antibiotics affect the ability of gut commensals to resist colonization by enteropathogens 3 . We also developed an in vitro assay to assess enteropathogen growth in drug-perturbed microbial communities. Pathogenic Gammaproteobacteria were more resistant to non-antibiotics than commensals and their post-treatment expansion was potentiated. For 28% of the 53 drugs tested, the growth of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. ( S . Tm) in synthetic and human stool-derived communities was increased, and similar effects were observed for other enteropathogens. Non-antibiotics promoted pathogen proliferation by inhibiting the growth of commensals, altering microbial interactions and enhancing the ability of S . Tm to exploit metabolic niches. Drugs that promoted pathogen expansion in vitro increased the intestinal S . Tm load in mice. For the antihistamine terfenadine, drug-induced disruption of colonization resistance accelerated disease onset and increased inflammation caused by S . Tm.

          "abstract": "Climate change has significantly increased adverse effects on human health, and economic growth1–3. However, few studies have differentiated the impacts of extreme temperatures at the city level, and analysed the future implications for human health under various climate change scenarios.4–6 Here, data on historical relationship among six kinds of climate-sensitive diseases (CSD) hospitalizations and temperatures across 301 cities (over 90% of all cities) and more than 7,000 hospitals in China are leveraged, and a nonlinear distributed lag model is used. This study projects hospitalization risks associated with extreme temperatures through to the year 2100 and develops the Hospitalization Burden Economic Index to assess the burden under three carbon emission scenarios in cities. Five dimensions including spatial distribution, disease categories, population age groups, future time horizons, and carbon emission development pathways have been evaluated. Historical data specifically indicate more temperature-related risks among the CSDs in northwestern and southwestern China. Notably, gestation-related disease risk is associated with increased vulnerability to extreme heat in specific regions. The projections reveal that, under current thermal conditions with no adaptations, the excess hospitalizations from extreme heat will reach 5.1 million people by 2100 under the high emission scenario.These findings highlight the need for targeted climate change mitigation strategies to reduce uneven climate-related hospitalization risks and economic burdens while accounting for differences in city geography, extreme temperatures, population groups and carbon emission development pathways.",

          "abstract": "In microbial communities, viruses compete for host cells and have evolved diverse mechanisms to inhibit competitors. One strategy is superinfection exclusion, whereby an established viral infection prevents a secondary infection of the same cell1. This phenomenon has been shown to have an important role in the spread of eukaryotic viruses. Here we determine that superinfection exclusion proteins in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages, hereafter phages) perform a similar role, promoting viral spread through the bacterial community. We characterize a phage protein that alters the dynamics of a common phage receptor, the type IV pilus. This protein, known as Zip, does not abrogate pilus activity, but fine-tunes it, providing a strong phage defence without a fitness cost. Notably, Zip also prevents internalization and destruction of newly released phage progeny, a phenomenon that we call the anti-Kronos effect after the Greek god who consumed his offspring. Zip activity promotes the accumulation of free phages in bacterial lysogen communities, thereby enhancing viral spread. We further demonstrate that the anti-Kronos effect is conserved across diverse prophage-encoded superinfection exclusion systems. Our results identify the mechanistic basis of a superinfection exclusion system that safeguards phage progeny and provide insights into the conservation of viral defence mechanisms among bacterial and eukaryotic systems.",

Here we examine the impact of WGD on somatic evolution and immune evasion at single-cell resolution in patient tumours. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we analysed 70 high-grade serous ovarian cancer samples from 41 patients (30,260 tumour genomes) and observed near-ubiquitous evidence that WGD is an ongoing mutational process. WGD was associated with increased cell–cell diversity and higher rates of chromosomal missegregation and consequent micronucleation. We developed a mutation-based WGD timing method called doubleTime to delineate specific modes by which WGD can drive tumour evolution, including early fixation followed by considerable diversification, multiple parallel WGD events on a pre-existing background of copy-number diversity, and evolutionarily late WGD in small clones and individual cells. Furthermore, using matched single-cell RNA sequencing and high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that inflammatory signalling and cGAS-STING pathway activation result from ongoing chromosomal instability, but this is restricted to predominantly diploid tumours (WGD-low). By contrast, predominantly WGD tumours (WGD-high), despite increased missegregation, exhibited cell-cycle dysregulation, STING1 repression, and immunosuppressive phenotypic states. Together, these findings establish WGD as an ongoing mutational process that promotes evolvability and dysregulated immunity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.",

These networks sustain out-of-equilibrium regimes in which chemical energy is continually converted into controlled mechanical work and motion 1–3 . Out-of-equilibrium reaction networks have also enabled the design and successful development of artificial autonomously operating molecular machines 4,5 , in which networks comprising pairs of formally—but non-microscopically—reverse reaction pathways drive controlled motion at the molecular level. In biological systems, the concurrent operation of several reaction pathways is enabled by the chemoselectivity of enzymes and their cofactors, and nature’s dissipative reaction networks involve several classes of reactions. By contrast, the reactivity that has been harnessed to develop chemical reaction networks in pursuit of artificial molecular machines is limited to a single reaction type. Only a small number of synthetic systems exhibit chemically fuelled continuous controlled molecular-level motion 6–8 and all exploit the same class of acylation–hydrolysis reaction. Here we show that a redox reaction network, comprising concurrent oxidation and reduction pathways, can drive chemically fuelled continuous autonomous unidirectional motion about a C–C bond in a structurally simple synthetic molecular motor based on an achiral biphenyl. The combined use of an oxidant and reductant as fuels and the directionality of the motor are both enabled by exploiting the enantioselectivity and functional separation of reactivity inherent to enzyme catalysis.",

Processes that permit rapid and reversible transformations between these morphologies, however, have been difficult to realize because physical properties required for rapid shape change (for example, low interfacial tension or viscosity) provide pathways for relaxation that result in short-lived states. Fully reversible formation of long-lived microdomain states would expand the palette of properties that can be accessed dynamically using biphasic liquids (for example, tunable optical metamaterials). Here we report the discovery of shape-shifting and bistable microdomains of a biphasic liquid system consisting of an isotropic oil and a liquid crystalline oil. The isotropic oil forms stable wetting films (‘original’ shape) between solid surfaces and an overlying liquid crystal phase, and, when exposed to a transient (<1 s) a.c. electric field at low frequency (10 Hz), transforms into long-lived (>24 h) spherical domains (‘temporary’ shape) stabilized by topological defects in the liquid crystal1,4,5. Subsequent application of an a.c. electric field of high frequency (1 kHz) triggers solitons to form in the liquid crystal6,7,8, creating kinetic pathways that lead to remarkably rapid (<3 s) coalescence of the dispersed spherical domains and recovery of the original shape (wetting film)1,8,9. We show rapid and reversible switching between distinct optical states of the biphasic system, with each state persisting without continuous application of the field, thus providing a combination of optical properties long sought in thin liquid films10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.

With growing recognition of electrochemistry as a powerful tool to improve the scope and sustainability of organic synthesis1, increasing efforts have been directed towards developing asymmetric electrocatalytic reactions to access challenging chiral molecules2,3,4. However, many useful electrochemical reactions rely on direct electrolysis without a catalyst, making them inherently difficult to render enantioselective. Supporting electrolytes are integral to electrochemical systems and, in addition to ensuring sufficient solution conductivity, they can influence the rate and selectivity of electrochemical transformations5. Chiral supporting electrolytes can mediate asymmetric reactions via direct electrolysis, but their use in organic electrosynthesis remains largely unexplored6,7. Here we describe the use of substoichiometric chiral phosphate salts as supporting electrolytes to facilitate the oxidation of racemic trivalent phosphines to afford enantioenriched phosphine oxides. Our approach relies on a dynamic-kinetic-resolution strategy that exploits the rapid pyramidal inversion of an anodically generated phosphoniumyl radical cation8, while a high concentration of chiral phosphate at the electrode–electrolyte interface9,10 enhances enantioselective control during rate-limiting nucleophilic addition. Our results highlight the promise of chiral supporting electrolytes for promoting radical-ion-mediated asymmetric transformations.",

Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread.",

However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants.",

Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body 1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits 3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids 5 . The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow 6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion 8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons 14 , which augments their mitochondrial electron leak 7 . Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis 15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump 16 ) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing 17,18 , may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism.",

SXRS has been long predicted as a means to launch and probe valence-electron wavepackets and as a building block for nonlinear X-ray spectroscopies5,6. However, experimental observations of SXRS to date4,7,8 have not provided spectroscopic information, and theoretical modelling has largely implemented hard-to-realize phase-coherent attosecond pulses. Here we demonstrate SXRS with spectroscopic precision, that is, detection of valence-excited states in neon with a near Fourier-limited joint energy–time resolution of 0.1 eV–40 fs. We used a new covariance analysis between statistically spiky broadband incident X-ray and scattered X-ray Raman pulses. Using 18,000 single shots, we beat not only the incident (about 8 eV) bandwidth but also the approximately 0.2 eV instrumental energy resolution, thus creating super-resolution conditions, in analogy to super-resolved fluorescence microscopy9. Our experimental results, supported by ab initio propagation simulations, reveal the competition between lasing in the ion and stimulated Raman scattering in the neutral. We demonstrate enhanced signal collection efficiency and a broad excitation window, surpassing spontaneous Raman efficiencies by orders of magnitude. This stochastic SXRS approach represents a first step towards tracking elementary events that determine chemical outcomes10.",

Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis.",

However, these phenomena have been restricted to hyperbolic crystals, whose optical responses are confined to fixed spectral regions and lack tunability, thereby limiting their broader applicability4,5. Here we demonstrate the emergence of hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in a non-hyperbolic yttrium vanadate (YVO4) crystal. Using real-space nanoimaging combined with theoretical analyses, we visualize hyperbolic wavefronts of surface phonon polaritons on YVO4 crystal surfaces within its non-hyperbolic frequency range, where the permittivity tensor components of the material have the same negative sign. Furthermore, by varying the temperature from room temperature to cryogenic levels, we realize in situ manipulation of polariton dispersions, enabling a topological transition from hyperbolic to canalization and eventually to the elliptic regime. This temperature-controlled dispersion engineering not only provides precise control over polariton topology but also modulates their wavelength and group velocity, showing remarkable sensitivity alongside low-loss, long-range propagation. These findings extend the realm of hyperbolic nano-optics by removing the reliance on hyperbolic crystals, unlocking opportunities for applications in negative refraction6,7,8,9,10, superlensing11,12, polaritonic chemistry13, integrated photonics14,15,16 and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Early detection of structural heart disease is critical to improving outcomes, but widespread screening remains limited by the cost and accessibility of imaging tools such as echocardiography1,2. Recent advances in machine learning applied to heart rhythm recordings have shown promise in identifying disease3,4, although previous work has been limited by development in narrow populations or targeting only select heart conditions5. Here we introduce a deep learning model, EchoNext, trained on more than 1 million heart rhythm and imaging records across a large and diverse health system to detect many forms of structural heart disease. The model demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in internal and external validation, outperforming cardiologists in a controlled evaluation and showing consistent performance across different care settings and racial and/or ethnic groups. The models were prospectively evaluated in a clinical trial of patients without previous cardiac imaging, successfully identifying previously undiagnosed heart disease. These findings support the potential of artificial intelligence to expand access to heart disease screening at scale. To enable further development and transparency, we have publicly released model weights and a large, annotated dataset linking heart rhythm data to imaging-based diagnoses.",

          "abstract": "A lithium (Li)-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode is considered to be a combination that holds promise to surpass the 500 Wh kg−1 threshold1,2. Approaching such high energy density, electrolytes capable of stabilizing both anode and cathode interphases are of importance to secure safe and long-term cycling3,4. Although anion-derived inorganic interphases have shown remarkable success at the Li side5,6,7, developing intrinsic strategies to concurrently protect both electrodes remains a key challenge. Here we report a micro-emulsion strategy for electrolyte design that bypasses the Li+ solvation regulation and produces fluoride-rich interphases for both electrodes. Specifically, liquid–liquid interfacial tension between the micelles and carbonate solvents, rather than the electric field, propels the motion of fluorinated droplets towards the anode and the cathode. In this way, the interphase construction of both electrodes can be enhanced and decoupled from the solvation structure strategy. Through use of the micro-emulsion electrolyte, two pouch full cells with energy densities of 531 Wh kg−1 and 547 Wh kg−1 retain 81% and 79% of their capacity after 189 and 155 cycles, respectively. The introduction of liquid–liquid interfacial tension provides a perspective for interphase regulation and electrolyte design, and paves the way for the development of high-voltage Li-metal batteries.",

Here we show that this uncertainty is partly because of sampling bias, as field BNF measurements in natural terrestrial ecosystems occur where N fixers are 17 times more prevalent than their mean abundances worldwide. To correct this bias, we develop new estimates of global terrestrial BNF by upscaling field BNF measurements using spatially explicit abundances of all major biogeochemical N-fixing niches. We find that natural biomes sustain lower BNF, 65 (52–77) Tg N yr−1, than previous empirical bottom-up estimates3,4, with most BNF occurring in tropical forests and drylands. We also find high agricultural BNF in croplands and cultivated pastures, 56 (54–58) Tg N yr−1. Agricultural BNF has increased terrestrial BNF by 64% and total terrestrial N inputs from all sources by 60% over pre-industrial levels. Our results indicate that BNF may impose stronger constraints on the carbon sink in natural terrestrial biomes and represent a larger source of agricultural N than is generally considered in analyses of the global N cycle5,6, with implications for proposed safe operating limits for N use7,8.",

          "abstract": "A pervasive dilemma in brain-wide association studies 1 (BWAS) is whether to prioritize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan time or sample size. We derive a theoretical model showing that individual-level phenotypic prediction accuracy increases with sample size and total scan duration (sample size × scan time per participant). The model explains empirical prediction accuracies well across 76 phenotypes from nine resting-fMRI and task-fMRI datasets ( R 2 = 0.89), spanning diverse scanners, acquisitions, racial groups, disorders and ages. For scans of ≤20 min, accuracy increases linearly with the logarithm of the total scan duration, suggesting that sample size and scan time are initially interchangeable. However, sample size is ultimately more important. Nevertheless, when accounting for the overhead costs of each participant (such as recruitment), longer scans can be substantially cheaper than larger sample size for improving prediction performance. To achieve high prediction performance, 10 min scans are cost inefficient. In most scenarios, the optimal scan time is at least 20 min. On average, 30 min scans are the most cost-effective, yielding 22% savings over 10 min scans. Overshooting the optimal scan time is cheaper than undershooting it, so we recommend a scan time of at least 30 min. Compared with resting-state whole-brain BWAS, the most cost-effective scan time is shorter for task-fMRI and longer for subcortical-to-whole-brain BWAS. In contrast to standard power calculations, our results suggest that jointly optimizing sample size and scan time can boost prediction accuracy while cutting costs.

Combining epidemiological and experimental approaches thus provides an opportunity to uncover drug–host–microbiome–pathogen interactions that increase the risk of infections in humans.",

Understanding how soil metabolic activity responds to climate-driven environmental perturbations is a key challenge 2,3 . However, the ecological, spatial and chemical complexity of soils 4–6 impedes understanding how these communities respond to perturbations. Here we address this complexity by combining dynamic measurements of respiratory nitrate metabolism 7 with modelling to reveal functional regimes that define soil responses to environmental change. Measurements across more than 1,500 soil microcosms subjected to pH perturbations 8,9 reveal regimes in which distinct mechanisms govern metabolite dynamics. A minimal model with two parameters, biomass activity and growth-limiting nutrient availability, predicts nitrate utilization dynamics across soils and pH perturbations. Parameter shifts under perturbation reveal three functional regimes, each linked to distinct mechanisms: (1) an acidic regime marked by cell death and suppressed metabolism; (2) a nutrient-limited regime in which dominant taxa exploit matrix-released nutrients; and (3) a resurgent growth regime driven by exponential growth of rare taxa in nutrient-rich conditions. We validated these model-derived mechanisms with nutrient measurements, amendment experiments, sequencing and isolate studies. Additional experiments and meta-analyses suggest that functional regimes are widespread in pH-perturbed soils.",

          "abstract": "Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival.",

We use the thin film of this hybrid as the sole active emissive layer to fabricate deep-blue light-emitting diodes and subsequently enhance the device performance through a dual interfacial hydrogen-bond passivation strategy. This synergetic surface modification approach, integrating a hydrogen-bond-acceptor self-assembled monolayer with an ultrathin polymethyl methacrylate capping layer, effectively passivates both heterojunctions of the copper–iodide hybrid emissive layer and optimizes charge injections. We achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 12.57%, a maximum luminance of 3,970.30 cd m−2 with colour coordinates (0.147, 0.091) and an excellent operational stability (half-lifetime) of 204 hours under ambient conditions.

Much of what is known about ichthyosaur soft tissues derives from specimens with body outlines 4–6 . However, despite offering insights into aspects of biology that are otherwise difficult to envisage from skeletal evidence alone (such as the presence of a crescentic fluke), information on their soft parts has hitherto been limited to a taxonomically narrow sample of small- to dolphin-sized animals 2,4–6 . Here we report the discovery of a metre-long front flipper of the large-bodied Jurassic ichthyosaur Temnodontosaurus , including unique details of its soft-tissue anatomy. In addition to revealing a wing-like planform, the fossil preserves a serrated trailing edge that is reinforced by novel cartilaginous integumental elements, herein denominated chondroderms. We also document chordwise-parallel skin ornamentations and a protracted fleshy distal tip that presumably acted like a flexible winglet in life. By integrating morphological and numerical data, we show that the observed features probably provided hydroacoustic benefits, and conclude that the visually guided 7,8 Temnodontosaurus relied on stealth while hunting in dim-lit pelagic environments. This unexpected combination of control surface modifications represents a previously unrecognized mode of concealment, and underscores the importance of soft-tissue fossils when inferring aspects of palaeoethology and predator–prey palaeoecology.",

          "abstract": "The United States has for decades been a great benefactor of global science. Last year, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded hundreds of grants to researchers outside the country. In 2022–23, the country supplied about 42% of the overall donor-government assistance for global health and about 16% of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) funding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it bankrolled a fair share of the global public vaccine effort.\n\nAs the current US administration seeks drastic cuts to research funding at home and abroad, the dangers of depending so much on one nation are becoming clear. My own projects are among those at risk.\n\nI am based in Lisbon, where, since 2020, I have been working on preclinical and clinical studies of several cancer therapies in collaboration with US and UK pharmaceutical companies and investigators. Now that our US partners (which were bringing the greatest share) are struggling to secure funds, all these projects are under threat.\n\nA fresh approach is needed to prevent further shocks — changes in governance, wars, natural disasters — from undermining essential global research and education.\n\nTurmoil at US science academy as Trump cuts force layoffs\n\nFor starters, more countries must provide more of the funding. Wealthier nations should increase their share of contributions to WHO initiatives, the success of which they stand to benefit from, such as those on pandemic preparedness. Programmes such as Horizon Europe should allocate resources to multilateral initiatives. Its ‘Cancer Mission’, which involves collaboration with Canada, is an encouraging example. By enabling various research projects on cancer, the programme aims to improve the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030. Future initiatives should include a greater diversity of stakeholders.\n\nLower-income nations, such as Nigeria and South Africa, could be persuaded to contribute more to initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, if they were given influence over how the money is spent. (In October 2024, the United States provided about 36% of the pledges and roughly 33% of the funds allocated to the Global Fund.) In fact, a permanent global research-funding initiative could provide emergency short-term funds to keep collaborations that are disrupted by geopolitical events running.\n\nIn general, those providing the most funds have the greatest influence on priorities and agendas. Decision-making and management that shapes research must instead also be shared more equitably between nations, and research should be evaluated in ways that are not so dependent on one nation.\n\nThe Global Research Council already coordinates transnational funding and policy among dozens of national science-funding agencies, although, as a voluntary organization, it cannot impose standards. Lessons can also be learnt from the European Research Council’s (ERC’s) multilingual grant-review panels, piloted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, reviewers from multiple countries can join meetings remotely. And there is collaboration between a decentralized ethics committee and the ethics committees of individual countries, ensuring that appraisals align with national laws and regulations.\n\nAll this must be underpinned by more-resilient shared databases and research-management platforms.",

          "abstract": "New methods to revive and preserve donor hearts could increase the number of organs available for transplant.Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nSurgeons have developed two low-cost techniques to revive the hearts of people who wish to donate their organs after they die. The methods have been tested on only a small number of people, but they avoid ethical issues sometimes associated with current transplantation techniques.\n\nUsing one of the techniques1, surgeons received permission to remove the heart of a child who had been declared dead, restart it and transplant it into another child. The technique, described in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) today, could increase the number of hearts available for organ donation, particularly for children. Roughly 500 children per year in the United States get a new heart, but many will die while waiting for one.\n\nIn the second technique, also reported in the NEJM today2, researchers were able to freeze-preserve adult hearts inside the bodies of their donors, then transplant them successfully. The surgeons involved say this procedure could also be used in children.\n\n“These two techniques represent important new advances” in procuring hearts from some donors because they sidestep the ethical challenges of existing methods, says Robert Montgomery, a transplant surgeon at New York University (NYU) in New York City.\n\nCurrent challenges\n\nMost donated hearts come from people who have been declared brain dead but whose heart is still beating. However, there are not enough such cases to meet the demand for donor hearts.\n\nIn some cases, hearts can be obtained from donors who are declared dead once their heart has stopped beating for five minutes — for example, when a family decides to remove life support for an individual.\n\nFor these hearts to be suitable for transplantation, surgeons must typically either remove the organ from the body and restart it on a machine or get it to beat again while still inside the body. But the former option is expensive and can’t be used for donors weighing less than 40 kilograms, which excludes babies and most children, and the latter is not widely used because of potential ethical issues.\n\nThe main ethical concern raised by physicians is that jump-starting the heart while it is still in the body might require a change to the recorded cause of death, from circulatory death to brain death. Another issue is that the procedure could theoretically restore blood flow to the brain — although clamps are used to block this outcome.\n\nReviving tiny hearts\n\nTo avoid these potential issues, Joseph Turek, a paediatric cardiac surgeon at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues developed a system to revive children’s hearts outside the body1. This involves pumping oxygenated blood into the heart through a tube attached to the aorta. The blood is then drained out of the heart through a vent in the left ventricle, collected in a bag to be re-oxygenated and then pumped back into the heart.\n\nThe team tested the procedure in 12-week-old piglets before the first human trial earlier this year. In that case, surgeons removed the heart of a one-month-old baby who had died, restarted it outside their body then transplanted it into a three-month old baby.\n\nThree months later, the recipient’s heart continued to function normally with no signs of rejection, according to the NEJM report. The procedure could result in 100 more paediatric heart transplants a year in the United States, says Turek. It also offers a cost-effective alternative to out-of-body revival of adult hearts, he adds, because it doesn’t require equipment that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",

Agency staff from around the United States have signed their names to the Voyager Declaration, opposing cuts by the administration of US President Donald Trump.Credit: Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nMore than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration, released 21 July, also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.\n\n“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA’s workforce,” reads the employees’ letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump’s changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.\n\nOn 22 July, staff members at the US National Science Foundation (NSF) released their own appeal, which asks the US House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology to defend the agency and its employees from political attacks. It was signed by 48 named and 101 anonymous members of the NSF union.\n\nFive key climate and space projects on Trump’s chopping block\n\nThe Voyager Declaration and the NSF petition join similar documents by employees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump’s sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.\n\nThe NASA declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what’s happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA.\n\nKaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.\n\nThe agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, says NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what’s working and what’s not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”\n\nThe NSF declined to comment.\n\nStaff exodus\n\nThe Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump’s proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency’s science budget for next year.\n\nCongress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn’t finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration’s signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised.",

Credit: Getty\n\nMoving to a four-day work week without losing pay leaves employees happier, healthier and higher-performing, according to the largest study of such an intervention so far, encompassing six countries1. The research showed that a six-month trial of working four days a week reduced burnout, increased job satisfaction and improved mental and physical health.\n\nThe study’s authors had wondered whether a condensed working week would add to employees’ stress. “When workers want to deliver the same productivity, they might work very rapidly to get the job done, and their well-being might actually worsen,” says lead author Wen Fan, a sociologist at Boston College in Massachusetts. “But that’s not what we found.” Instead, staff members’ stress levels fell.\n\nThe study was published today in Nature Human Behaviour.\n\nPandemic upheaval\n\nLevels of employee stress and burnout soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading many workers to quit their jobs, the authors note. The result was large numbers of unfilled positions in some labour markets.\n\nTo see whether shorter weeks might be the antidote for poor morale, researchers launched a study of 2,896 individuals at 141 companies in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nFed up and burnt out: ‘quiet quitting’ hits academia\n\nBefore making the shift to reduced hours, each company that opted into the overhaul was given roughly eight weeks to restructure its workflow to maintain productivity at 80% of previous workforce hours, purging time-wasting activities such as unnecessary meetings. Two weeks before the trial started, each employee answered a series of questions to evaluate their well-being, including, “Does your work frustrate you?” and “How would you rate your mental health?” After six months on the new schedule, they revisited the same questions.\n\nOverall, workers felt more satisfied with their job performance and reported better mental health after six months of a shortened work week than before it.",

          "title": "Should we treat rivers as living things?",
          "authors": "Andrew Robinson",
          "abstract": "Is a River Alive? Robert Macfarlane Hamish Hamilton (2025)\n\nThirst: In Search of Freshwater Wellcome Collection, London 26 June 2025–1 February 2026\n\nThirst: In Search of Freshwater Foreword by Robert Macfarlane. Wellcome Collection (2025)\n\nWhen Robert Macfarlane, a nature writer, was walking with his son to school, the boy asked him the title of his current book project. “Is a River Alive?” Macfarlane replied. “Well, duh, that’s going to be a short book, then, Dad,” said his son, “because the answer is yes!”\n\nHow a vast digital twin of the Yangtze River could prevent flooding in China\n\nAs a boy, Macfarlane felt the same about rivers. But, as an adult, he developed doubts. In the book’s introduction, he describes how hard it was for someone like him, who had been raised on rationalism, to imagine that a river could be alive beyond the life it sustains. “It requires unlearning, a process much harder than learning,” he writes. “We might say that the fate of rivers under rationalism has been to become one-dimensional water. Rivers have been systematically stripped of their spirits and reduced to what Isaac Newton called ‘inanimate brute matter’.”\n\nHis childhood belief returned while he was researching the book. In it, he refers to rivers “who” flow, rather than rivers “that” flow. Macfarlane’s view seems akin to that of the political scientist and anthropologist James Scott: his last book, In Praise of Floods, published in February after his death in his eighties, argues controversially that crucial rivers, such as the Colorado River in the western United States and the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar, should not be damned by being dammed.\n\nIn Scott’s words: “Rivers, on a long view, are alive. They are born; they change; they shift their channels; they forge new routes to the sea; they move both gradually and violently; they teem (usually) with life; they may die a quasi-natural death; they are frequently maimed and even murdered. Each river, though subject to the same hydraulic laws, has its own unique personality and history.”\n\nRivers under threat\n\nMacfarlane ranges, compellingly, further afield than Scott’s relatively academic study — not only geographically, but also intellectually and emotionally. Driven by his concern over human damage to rivers in England, where he lives, he journeys at length alongside and along other rivers, in the company of scientists, environmental activists and diverse adventurers. Sometimes paddling by kayak, even dangerously over rapids, he experiences three, very different, threatened riverine landscapes — in Ecuador, India and Canada.\n\nThe Burning Earth: how conquest and carnage have decimated landscapes worldwide\n\nThe first is a cloud forest in the Andes Mountains: Los Cedros, the ‘Forest of Cedars’, which forms the headwaters of the Rio Los Cedros, which eventually reach the ocean through another river. Los Cedros is threatened by companies eager to pursue copper and gold mining.\n\nThe second includes the rivers, creeks, lagoons and estuaries of the city of Chennai on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. They are deeply polluted by toxic industrial products and exposed to a brutal cycle of droughts and floods caused by monsoons and cyclones.\n\nThe third is Nitassinan, homeland of the Innu people. It is a wild interior through which flows Mutehekau Shipu, the Magpie River, which reaches the sea at the Gulf of St Lawrence, some 1,000 kilometres northeast of Montreal. It is constantly at risk from dam-building.\n\nRivers in time\n\nAs a spin-off from his newly released book, Macfarlane also provides a foreword to a diverse collection of short writings about water. Thirst was commissioned by the Wellcome Collection in London, to accompany its exhibition of the same title.\n\nThe exhibition is divided into sections: Aridity, Rain, Glaciers, Surface Water and Groundwater. Surprisingly, rivers are not given their own space. But they flow through the exhibition, which begins with a Babylonian clay tablet from around 1900—1600 bc, on which the Epic of Gilgamesh is inscribed in cuneiform. It describes the first war waged over water in ancient Mesopotamia, the ‘land between rivers’ — the Tigris and Euphrates. Later comes a section on the Iraqi Marshes, including filmed interviews with their inhabitants. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the swamps were drained to about 10% of their original size by the regime of dictator Saddam Hussein, to evict the people living there — but have since been partially rejuvenated.\n\nVideos feature people across the globe wading speechlessly through their houses after flooding, exploring human experiences of the phenomenon. A satirical cartoon from 1828, entitled ‘Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water’, shows a horrified woman peering through her microscope, studying numerous creatures swimming about in a drop of drinking water from London’s River Thames. Another drawing, made in 1931, shows a cross-section of an artesian tube well drilled beneath the Wellcome Collection building into one of London’s many underground rivers.\n\nKayakers paddle through rapids in the Chehalis River in Canada. Credit: Christopher Kimmel/Getty\n\nOther contributors to the exhibition book, some of whom also feature in the exhibition, include science-minded thinkers — such as environmental activist Vandana Shiva, who founded Navdanya, an Indian non-governmental organization that promotes biodiversity conservation; Native American Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist at the State University of New York College in Syracuse; and Anthony Acciavatti, a scholar at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who works at the intersection of landscape and the history of science and technology. Writers and artists, including British-Turkish novelist Elif Shafak, Vietnamese-American poet Ocean Vuong and the Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective, provide vivid snapshots of freshwater and its behaviour. But, oddly, the book contains no photographs or maps of rivers, as crucially displayed in Macfarlane’s book.",

          "abstract": "One morning in 2014, a colleague asked whether I’d seen a new study linking concussion risk to altitude exposure. The work was part of a package of evidence promoting a device to prevent concussion in contact sports. I’m not a concussion researcher, but having trained in sports medicine, I felt that the scientific claims being put forward to justify using this device were implausible.\n\nColleagues agreed with my opinions, but were too busy with their duties to challenge the claims. So, I stepped away from my own research to do so. I collaborated with The New York Times on an investigation, and published papers showing that some of the work cannot be replicated.\n\nMove beyond ‘publish or perish’ by measuring behaviours that benefit academia\n\nSince then, I’ve responded to other issues that I view as being of urgent public interest — ranging from rapidly producing mpox guidance for athletes during a disease outbreak, to promptly writing a detailed analysis countering claims that the collapse, in 2023, of the American-football player Damar Hamlin was related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nI think it’s crucial that more academics get the chance to take this path, free from a rigid research agenda.\n\nRobust scientific progress requires not only original research, but also rigorous validation of findings, their adoption across disciplines and effective communication. Yet the dominant model of academic science is to secure grant funding, generate results and then get more funding. With promotions and career progression depending on this cycle, it can be hard to justify spending time on extracurricular projects. Instead of expecting agenda-focused laboratory heads to take on these tasks as side projects, as is often the case, universities should employ people who have complete scholarly autonomy to specialize in them.\n\nI’m fortunate that my department has an educational track that supports scholarship outside of conventional research agendas. My position provides dedicated time for scholarly work and the flexibility to pursue interdisciplinary questions as and when needed. Grants are treated as a tool to support projects when required, rather than as the hallmark of success. I can choose which issues to pursue — or stop pursuing — at will. Peer-reviewed publications are central, but the scholarly value of rigorous work disseminated through public communication and research-integrity efforts is also recognized.\n\nWill AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?\n\nI suspect that few other researchers have the same latitude. Yet research institutions would benefit from employing agenda-free scholars. These people are well placed to connect and integrate findings across disciplines, populations and methodologies, revealing connections, contradictions and redundancies between fields and thereby increasing research efficiency — work that is often undervalued in decisions about tenure and promotion. Some might think that principal investigators, as experts in their fields, are better placed to synthesize and contextualize research. But expecting one person to manage many responsibilities risks diluting their effectiveness in each.",

They also have similar personality traits, which suggests that a positive outlook leads to a shared way of interpreting experiences.\n\nYanagisawa and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 87 participants while they imagined future events that were categorized as positive, neutral or negative.

          "abstract": "The Scottish Cafe, now in Lviv, Ukraine, housed mathematical discussions in the 1930s.Credit: Сергій via Wikimedia (CC BY 3.0)\n\nOn a Monday afternoon in April, the Szkocka Restaurant and Bar in Lviv, Ukraine, seems empty, except for two waiters, a maintenance worker on a ladder and the ghost of Frank Sinatra, whose song asks us to hold him in our arms. He’s not the only ghost in the place, though.\n\nI’m in Ukraine, researching the history of Stanisław Ulam, a mathematician, physicist and computer scientist who was born in Lviv, then in Poland, in 1909. Ulam went on to work on the US Manhattan Project, designing nuclear weapons. He also developed the Monte Carlo method for solving computational problems and established many proofs in pure and applied mathematics.\n\nBut it was in this restaurant — known in the 1930s as the Scottish Cafe — that Ulam, along with other prominent mathematical figures such as Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, sat for hours, bandying about ideas. Together, the group contributed to many areas of mathematics, including set theory, probability, functional analysis, group theory and topology.\n\nWhy probability probably doesn’t exist (but it is useful to act like it does)\n\nThey would write their calculations in pencil on the marble tabletops. But Banach’s wife, Łucja Braus, dismayed that the work was getting wiped away by waiters, bought them a present: a lined notebook that would eventually be filled with mathematical challenges.\n\nAny cafe patron could propose a solution to a problem for the chance to win a prize —often something small, such as a cup of coffee or a bottle of wine, or sometimes something more opulent or strange, such as, famously, a live goose.\n\nThese oddities helped to spread the book’s fame. And the collection of 200 or so problems became known as The Scottish Book, a version of which can still be purchased today.\n\nIn its pages are workings that led Ulam to later co-author a paper elaborating on the ‘hairy ball theorem’, which shows that, on any sphere in n dimensions, if there is a hair-like substance or current on it that is ‘combed’ in one direction, there will always be a place where the directional combing cannot continue — a cowlick, in other words. Far from being a barbering quirk, the theorem has had applications in fields such as meteorology and fusion energy. The seeds of Banach’s general theory of functional analysis are also in the Scottish Book.\n\nLegendary atmosphere\n\nThus, in the 1930s, the Scottish Cafe became “the centre of [Lviv’s] — and for a while the world’s — mathematical universe”, as writer Chris Zielinski described in Histories of Computing in Eastern Europe (2019). Since then, universities, cities and companies have been trying, with varying success, to replicate this environment of a loose, productive exchange of ideas.\n\nThe spy who flunked it: Kurt Gödel’s forgotten part in the atom-bomb story\n\nWhen I returned to the cafe the next day, Iryna Banakh (no relation), a mathematician at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, a few blocks away, told me a little bit about what went right.\n\nBanach, who mentored Ulam and was the social centre of the group, “liked to work when it was very noisy”, she said, sitting at a table in the Szkocka. There was “a lot of music, a lot of conversations, and sometimes they played chess at the different tables”.\n\nHe “would spend most of his days in cafés, not only in the company of others but also by himself”, said the mathematician Andrzej Turowicz in Roman Kaluza’s book Through a Reporter’s Eyes (1996). “He liked the noise and the music. They did not prevent him from concentrating and thinking. There were cases when, after the cafés closed for the night, he would walk over to the railway station where the cafeteria was open around the clock. There, over a glass of beer, he would think about his problems.”\n\nThe Polish mathematician Stanisław Ulam, who frequented the Scottish Cafe.Credit: American Philosophical Society/Science Photo Library\n\nIf this emphasis on controlled chaos, social interaction and free-wheeling exploration sounds familiar, it’s because it is the basis for everything from child-led learning at Montessori schools to some courses at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, in which unconventional lecture-delivery models have been implemented.\n\nBut this is not necessarily a recipe for success in everyone’s hands. Although Ulam had wonderful things to say about environments full of genial geniuses in his autobiography, Adventures of a Mathematician (1976), he was scathing about the 1930s mathematical community at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He found it full of overdone formality, bloated egos and people performing the act of work, rather than working productively and informally. However, he did find a better environment at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he taught in the 1940s.\n\nThere are some steps to nudge an academic community towards this type of collaboration.\n\nIngredients for innovation\n\nRichard Florida’s 2002 urban-construction manual, Rise of the Creative Class, says that well-built communities — such as the walkable square around the Scottish Cafe — are more likely to provide people with places to exchange ideas than are automotive exurbs that encourage isolation. After traversing eight lanes of suburban traffic to reach a cafe, you’re unlikely to want to discuss Fourier transforms for five hours over coffees or beers.\n\nUniversities are beginning to see the importance of good infrastructure and quality of life for attracting students and faculty members. US college towns are increasingly working to replicate the pedestrian-accessible cafe environments found in Lviv and other European cities, such as Vienna and Prague. And some large institutions in small US cities, such as the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and the University of Maryland, College Park, have been encouraging the construction of tram and light-rail systems, viewing them as providing a competitive advantage.\n\nEven in modern-day Lviv, which is already vibrant, there have been moves — in the middle of war, no less — to enhance that vibrancy with even better urban-rail infrastructure.\n\nBorn secret — the heavy burden of bomb physics\n\nHowever, cities need to be positive, liveable places for everyone, not just those who can afford the latest Macbook. Indeed, the academics I talked with in Lviv made the point that the Scottish Cafe is now too expensive for late-night maths chats. Those have moved to a cheap pizza place elsewhere in the city, among other places, with Szkocka filling a more ceremonial niche for formal dinners in recent years.\n\nIn the 1930s, Banach chose the Scottish Cafe partly because it was cheap and would give him a lenient tab, unlike the cafe across the street, from which he fled when his debts grew too great. He was known to often linger over a single cup of coffee for hours at a time, spending barely any money.",

Later, I learnt that there was a word for that, too. A comedian.\n\nAnd still later, I learnt, along with everyone else, that there wasn’t just Earth. Fine. Greatest comedian in the Universe, then.\n\nThere was just one little problem. The Primulans didn’t laugh. As far as anyone could tell, they didn’t even have mouths. When they were amused — which didn’t happen all that often — their eye sacs would vibrate, making a sound like an angry bumblebee.\n\nHalf the time, no one could quite figure out what was making them laugh (well … vibrate), but it seemed to be some blend of irony, brutal honesty and self-deprecation. I had studied all the recordings, and the biggest punchline had been delivered — unknowingly and nervously — by a special envoy addressing a room full of Primulans. He looked tiny in the video, clutching the sides of a massive podium emblazoned with the golden rose of Primula. A slight tremor in his voice, he began his speech with “I am so happy to be here with you”. In the cacophony of vibrations that followed, he looked around, confused, until an assistant had to usher him off stage.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nActually, there was another little problem, too: Primula had started building military vessels. Big ones — no joking matter. Bigger and more advanced than anything we had on Earth, and people were getting nervous.\n\nNo one was quite sure where things had gone wrong, but we all knew it was our fault. Maybe it was when a cruiser full of tourists from Earth had accidentally knocked one of Primula’s halo satellites out of orbit, throwing the planet’s weather systems into chaos for weeks.\n\nOr maybe it had been the diplomatic delegation that came afterwards to offer profuse apologies. It had seemed like a good idea. And maybe it would have worked, except that someone on the delegation hadn’t followed proper quarantine protocols. No one knew exactly what triggered it, but within days, the treasured golden roses of Primula all started to turn black, and hadn’t changed back again.\n\nSubsequent apologies had been beamed to Primula from Earth, but had gone unanswered.\n\nSo, I was as surprised as everyone else when a Primulan emissary arrived out of the blue to deliver a message to the Earth Council; relieved when it wasn’t a declaration of war; and surprised all over again that the Primulans were proposing a cultural summit to promote understanding.\n\nI guess they were right about that. We really didn’t understand each other. Didn’t then. Don’t now. But sometimes you need to give it a try anyway, and I guess that was why I ended up getting the phone call. After all, a shared laugh is the fastest way to bring everyone together, right? Could it work for Primulans, too?\n\nThat had been three weeks ago, and now I was here, clutching the sides of the same podium as that nervous diplomat all those years ago. I looked out at the audience — the left side of the hall entirely occupied by dignitaries from Earth, the right side entirely by Primulans.\n\nI started my routine.\n\nSafe material first — I needed to take my time, build things up bit-by-bit. Sure enough, I was getting polite laughs from the humans, but complete silence from the Primulans. As I continued, the laughs started to fade, grow uneasy — people were nervous that nothing was working for the Primulans. Not a single buzz, not one vibrating eye sac. It was the moment I had been waiting for: no more safe material. I switched to jokes about mouthless aliens, about failed diplomats, about the absurdity of a cultural summit between Primula and Earth.\n\nSilence. Well, not silence exactly. Something more than silence.",

          "abstract": "Particles of SAR-CoV-2 (blue, artificially coloured) bud from a cell (pink). Study participants who became infected with the virus lost mental flexibility.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nThe brains of healthy people aged faster during the COVID-19 pandemic than did the brains of people analysed before the pandemic began, a study of almost 1,000 people suggests1. The accelerated ageing occurred even in people who didn’t become infected.\n\nThe accelerated ageing, recorded as structural changes seen in brain scans, was most noticeable in older people, male participants and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. But cognitive tests revealed that mental agility declined only in participants who picked up a case of COVID-19, suggesting that faster brain ageing doesn’t necessarily translate into impaired thinking and memory.\n\nThe study “really underlines how significant the pandemic environment was for mental and neurological health”, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist who studies ageing at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s unclear whether the pandemic-associated brain ageing is reversible, because the study analysed scans taken at only two time points, adds Moqri.\n\nThe findings were published today in Nature Communications.\n\nPandemic effect\n\nPrevious research has offered clues that SARS-CoV-2 infections can worsen neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in older people. But few studies have explored whether the pandemic period — a tumultuous time marked by social isolation, lifestyle disruptions and stress for many — also affected brain ageing, says study co-author Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad, a neuroimaging researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nCOVID’s toll on the brain: new clues emerge\n\nTo find out, Mohammadi-Nejad and his colleagues analysed brain scans collected from 15,334 healthy adults with an average age of 63 years in the UK Biobank (UKBB) study, a long-term biomedical monitoring scheme. They trained machine-learning models on hundreds of structural features of the participants’ brains, which taught the model how the brain looks at various ages. The team could then use these models to predict the age of a person’s brain. The difference between that value and a participant’s chronological age is the ‘brain age gap’.\n\nThe team then applied the brain-age models to a separate group of 996 healthy UKBB participants who had all had two brain scans at least a couple of years apart. Some of the participants had had one scan before the pandemic and another after the pandemic’s onset. Those who’d had both scans before the pandemic were designated the control group. The models estimated each participant’s brain age at the time of both scans.\n\nNearly six months more\n\nThe models predicted that the brains of people who had lived through the pandemic had aged 5.5 months faster on average than had those of people in the control group, irrespective of whether those scanned during the pandemic had ever contracted COVID-19. “Brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment,” says Mohammadi-Nejad.",

There have been many efforts to validate individual studies and key findings, some with shocking results.\n\nFor example in 2015, it was reported that more than half of 100 psychology studies fail reproducibility tests3, and earlier this year, a coalition of 56 research teams surveyed dozens of Brazilian biomedical studies and could replicate the results of less than half of the tested experiments.\n\nHuge reproducibility project fails to validate dozens of biomedical studies\n\nIn the latest preprints, Hanson, with Bruno Lemaitre, a geneticist who studies fruit-fly immunity at the Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL), and their colleagues tried to assess the reproducibility of their entire research field.\n\n“This started with the observation that there was no follow-up of a number of big claims in big papers,” says Lemaitre, who led the study.\n\nThe team looked at 1,006 results from 400 papers published in the field between 1959 and 2011 — up until Jules Hoffmann won a share of the 2011 medicine Nobel prize for work on the Drosophila immune response.\n\nThey then went through the published literature looking for later work that either supported or refuted each claim. Rather than looking for studies that exactly replicated the methods of an experiment behind a result, or reproduced an identical effect, they searched to see if the claims were successfully built on by other studies, were broadly reproduced using more-modern techniques or still stood up to scrutiny now that knowledge of the field has moved on.\n\nUsing their expertise of the field, the researchers classified claims as either verified, unchallenged by other papers, challenged or partly verified.\n\nThey found that 61% of the 1,006 claims were verifiable, whereas only 7% had been challenged and weren’t reproducible.\n\nReplication games: how to make reproducibility research more systematic\n\nOf the 240 claims that had never been independently tested, the team could further categorize a subset of 111 as consistent with current knowledge and 22 as inconsistent with it. They performed experiments to test a further 45 claims, and found 38 of them to be inconsistent with current knowledge. “These were claims that I knew were a bit fragile,” says Lemaitre.",

The research community has long sought such a system to help us understand the humble beginnings of our own. Using both ground- and space-based telescopes, the team zeroed in on the young star HOPS-315, 420 parsecs from Earth, at the start of a most exciting time: its planet-forming era.\n\nThe researchers report their discovery today in Nature1.\n\n“What we’ve been trying to do is find a baby version of our Solar System somewhere else,” says Merel van’t Hoff, an astronomer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe team originally focused its attention on HOPS-315 after detecting crystalline silicate minerals around it — a telltale sign of early planet formation. (Planets form as mineral grains condense and then clump together in the hot disks of gas and dust swirling around newborn stars.)\n\nLocated in the Orion constellation, the baby, or protostar, also stood out because it was oriented such that astronomers could get a glimpse of its surrounding disk of gas and dust. This view is rare because jets of gas emitted by a newborn star, known as outflow, often block the disk, but HOPS-315’s was on full display.\n\nThis video describes how astronomers detected and interpreted chemical signatures from the HOPS-315 system. Credit: European Southern Observatory\n\nThe researchers used the James Webb Space Telescope to probe the chemical make-up of material around the star, and found the first-ever traces of warm silicon monoxide (SiO) in such a disk. They also noticed that the silicate minerals they detected were rich in SiO, and that the midsection of the star’s disk was ultra-hot.\n\nAlongside observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array in Chile, these findings suggest that HOPS-315’s scorching midsection vaporized rock surrounding the star, and that the gas cooled and condensed into planet-forming minerals. “This hot mineral is the first feedstock that you have to start growing things in the disk,” says lead author Melissa McClure, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nFresh insight",

          "abstract": "Adriana Bankston at Capitol Hill in Washington DC.Credit: Adriana Bankston\n\nIn September 2024, two months before the US presidential election returned Donald Trump to power for a second term, I secured a congressional fellowship to work for Bill Foster, a former physicist who was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat for an Illinois district.\n\nThe year-long science and technology policy fellowship, based at the US Congress in Washington DC, allows scientists and engineers to learn about and contribute to national policymaking. It is sponsored by the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy as part of the Science and Technology Policy Fellowships programme of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nOn a typical day, I work on science and research policy, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, among other topics. This includes defending scientific research and the STEM pipeline — through letters, speeches and legislation — attending meetings with Foster’s constituents, collaborating with other congressional offices that share these interests, and contributing to the advancement of US science at a national level.\n\nAction on salaries\n\nMy path into research policy dates back almost a decade, beginning in 2016, when, after a postdoctoral position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, I joined the non-profit organization Future of Research, based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nOur research into postdoc salaries revealed that many fell below US$45,000 a year, although a federal labour law mandated a minimum of $47,476. Postdoctoral salaries increased as a result of our work.\n\nMore roles in science advocacy followed, including as a fellow with the Society for Neuroscience, and principal legislative analyst with the University of California’s Office of Federal Governmental Relations, both in Washington DC.\n\nBoth roles involved lobbying Congress to increase federal funding for scientific research. I then moved on to helping universities and scientific organizations engage with Congress on science issues, and enabling graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to discuss their work with members of Congress.\n\nFavourite projects\n\nIn my current role, four favourite projects spring to mind. The first was reintroducing a resolution to designate 14 March as National Pi Day, which is an opportunity to highlight and recognize the need for investments in mathematics and science education, and getting students interested in STEM subjects.\n\nThe second was the Keep STEM Talent Act, which would enable international STEM students to contribute to the workforce and our economy by giving them permanent-resident status.\n\nThe third was drafting a speech by Foster from the floor of the House of Representatives, expressing concern with the Trump administration’s cut to the Graduate Research Fellowship Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The reduction in funding is preventing outstanding graduate students from pursuing research-based master’s or doctoral degrees in STEM fields.\n\nAnd finally, I enjoyed writing research talking points for the National Lab Research SLAM, which showcases the contributions to the innovation ecosystem of early-career scientists at the national laboratories — defined as any government-operated or sponsored laboratory.\n\nThis year is the 75th anniversary of the NSF. As part of Foster’s team, I contributed to multiple projects defending science funding and federal agencies, and Foster gave a speech from the floor during a Special Order Hour — time set aside for speeches or debates that are not part of the ordinary legislative agenda — which was focused on standing up for science. The speech highlighted how Trump’s proposed budget cuts at the NSF and other science agencies are impairing US competitiveness and the development of the STEM workforce. Along with other members of Congress, Foster introduced a resolution commemorating the NSF’s science and engineering accomplishments over the past 75 years. Our team also initiated and helped to coordinate letters from Congress to the Trump administration expressing concern over the firing of 168 NSF workers, and over the administration’s directive to freeze all NSF grant funding.\n\nGratification and heartbreak\n\nThis has been the most gratifying year of my career so far.\n\nAlthough I sometimes am heartbroken by what is happening to scientific research in this country, I increasingly find myself encouraged by the resilience of this community to continue fighting for what matters. Being part of this cause is extremely rewarding.\n\nI have heard from scientists, including early-career trainees, about the impacts of cuts to federal science funding. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who are just starting out describe feeling uncertain. And those halfway through or close to finishing their degrees are struggling to find the funds to continue their work, and have shared their worries about academic job prospects.\n\nI encourage US scientists to continue talking to Congress, especially to members who care about these issues and have the power to change things. If a scientist is also a constituent of that member of Congress, the connection can go a long way, because members are supposed to listen and work to address the issues. And by participating in national rallies or local demonstrations, researchers can make the case for the importance of science for their communities and the country’s future.",

          "abstract": "China has rapidly increased its interest in Antarctica over the past decade, opening its fifth Antarctic station last year. Scientists are hopeful that this will help ensure research of global significance continues on the continent, despite the US government’s proposal to slash spending on polar science.\n\nChina’s latest station, Qinling, kicked off its first winter mission in March. Situated on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay, Qinling is China’s first station in southern Antarctica, not far from stations run by Italy and South Korea. In time, the station will run studies on marine and terrestrial ecology, sea ice, geophysics, wildlife and other topics, says Shen Jun, a director at the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration in Beijing.\n\nQingling is “well-placed for research into a huge range of contemporary challenges in Antarctic research”, says Christina Hulbe, a geophysicist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\nOne of them is determining how cold, dense waters form on the continental shelf, Hulbe says. These waters are the precursor to Antarctic bottom water, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the ocean’s ability to store heat and capture carbon. The region is also important for studying marine biodiversity, including krill, penguins and whales.\n\nChina does not reveal how much it spends on Antarctic research each year, but researchers say that there has been growing government funding for overall research and development over the past decade. Since 2018, China has also built two new icebreakers, Xue Long 2 and Ji Di, and is planning a new summer station in southwest Antarctica, which is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nUS pulls away\n\nAs China’s interest in the region increases, US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting all polar research from $86 million to $25 million, and Antarctic-specific infrastructure renewal from $60 million to $24 million in 2026. US scientists fear that they might not be able to continue some of their research and fieldwork in Antarctica. There are also concerns that the US polar databases will not be maintained or updated. The US is seen by many as the global leader in Antarctic research.\n\nDeniz Bozkurt, a climatologist at the University of Valparaíso in Chile, expects “some shift in the scientific leadership” for Antarctica and climate-change studies owing to the question marks surrounding US commitment.\n\nKim Yeadong, the chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research, based in Incheon, South Korea, says that Antarctic study benefits all of humanity. “If the US walks away, somebody should continue on this very important endeavour,” he adds. Kim says that he will be “very happy” if China increases its activity regardless of what the United States will do.\n\nThe need for data\n\nBozkurt thinks that the biggest risk from the US government cuts is the potential loss of continuous data, such as those hosted by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which are crucial for understanding climate trends and extreme weather.\n\nQinling’s global significance will depend partially on how China shares its data. “Sharing data, sharing findings, sharing issues of critical ecosystems, this is absolutely vital,” says Daniel Kammen, an energy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He hopes that the station’s data will be shared with scientists in real time to help them to understand and respond to changes.",

It aims to prevent babies from inheriting harmful mutations from maternal mitochondrial DNA, which can cause debilitating diseases that particularly affect power-hungry tissues such as those of the heart, brain and muscles.\n\n“This is a landmark study on preventing mitochondrial disease,” says Dietrich Egli, a stem-cell scientist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nThe procedure has been dubbed three-person in vitro fertilization (IVF), because the resulting children carry nuclear DNA from their biological mother and father, as well as mitochondrial DNA from a separate egg donor.\n\nRare procedure\n\nThe United Kingdom became the first country in the world to explicitly regulate mitochondrial donation in 2015, after more than a decade of research, discussion and debate. So far, just one UK clinic, the Newcastle Fertility Centre, has been licensed by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, to carry out the procedure.\n\nThe latest studies — published in The New England Journal of Medicine1,2 — provide the first detailed reports of the Newcastle team’s efforts. In 2023, The Guardian newspaper revealed that up to five UK children had been born using mitochondrial donation. However, few details were revealed about the children’s health or questions surrounding the technique’s effectiveness.\n\nFirst UK children born using three-person IVF: what scientists want to know\n\nIn total, 22 women carrying disease-causing mitochondria went through a mitochondrial-donation procedure called pronuclear transfer, leading to the birth of eight babies (including a pair of twins) and one ongoing pregnancy, report reproductive biologist Mary Herbert, now at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and her team.\n\nThe children — four girls and four boys — were all born healthy and are developing normally. The oldest child is now over two years old; the youngest is under five months. Five children have had no health problems at all, one experienced muscle jerks that went away on their own, another was successfully treated for a high level of fat in their blood and a heart-rhythm disturbance, and a third had fever due to a urinary-tract infection.\n\n“We’re cautiously optimistic about these results,” Robert McFarland, a paediatric neurologist at Newcastle University, who co-led one of the studies, said at a press briefing. “To see babies born at the end of this is amazing, and to know there’s not going to be mitochondrial disease at the end of that.”\n\nMitochondrial donations have been performed in several other countries without explicit regulation — mostly as a fertility treatment, but, in at least one case, to prevent mitochondrial disease.",

          "authors": "Oliver P. Hauser, Miriam Light, Lizzie Shelmerdine, Jack Blumenau",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a transformative force in science, society and the economy. However, much remains unknown about the broader implications of widespread AI use.\n\nFor instance, AI technologies can enhance as well as impede the performance of knowledge workers. They can boost productivity for routine tasks, such as idea generation and writing, but might introduce bottlenecks and errors in more-complex tasks when AI advice is adopted blindly1. Chatbots can aid individual people’s creativity, yet overreliance on them might reduce the overall diversity of original ideas2.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nUnderstanding how users engage with the technology — and the outcomes that follow — requires careful, systematic study to differentiate between the positive and negative impacts. For instance, in education, it’s crucial to test whether students use AI tools to deepen their understanding of a topic, or whether they simply use the technology as a crutch, hindering real learning.\n\nControlled studies can reveal areas to which AI truly adds value and when its risks outweigh the benefits. Randomized controlled trials — in which a randomly selected group of participants receives an intervention while a control group operates under business-as-usual conditions — might be particularly valuable for assessing AI’s impact in public-sector settings. For example, can a chatbot deliver factual and actionable advice to citizens seeking tax-related information, ultimately promoting accurate and timely tax filing? Will partially automating eligibility assessments for social benefits lead to fair, efficient outcomes at reduced cost? Understanding when, how and for whom AI works is crucial to ensuring positive results and a meaningful return on investment.\n\nHere, we introduce an AI impact-evaluation framework3 developed for the UK public sector, providing a potential blueprint for public organizations as well as the private sector.\n\nThe need to test\n\nWhat do we mean by evaluating AI? Evaluation refers to assessing an intervention’s design, implementation and impact4 — in other words, understanding how and to what extent it changes the outcome of interest.\n\nAI companies currently undertake model evaluations — testing the performance of large language models (LLMs) against benchmarks to assess their capabilities in areas such as language, mathematics, reasoning and problem-solving. Furthermore, over the past 18 months, leading AI-security institutes in the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan have advocated for testing frontier AI models to ensure they are safe to use before public release. However, although model evaluation and safety protocols are necessary, they are not sufficient.\n\nThis is because evaluating a model’s technical performance is not the same as assessing its real-world economic and societal impacts. For instance, many organizations now use customized LLMs as internal chatbots to help employees to access organization-wide materials or summarize large volumes of information — from meeting notes and market research to sector-wide consultations. Others are using AI tools to create slide decks, reports and business plans.\n\nMedical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches\n\nConventional AI-model evaluation will ensure that the outputs are reasonably accurate and safe. But such assessments do not tell us whether these tools to improve users’ decision-making, increase their efficiency or redirect their time towards more-useful activities. Or, in the public sector, whether they lead to improved services and better outcomes for citizens.\n\nAlthough some organizations conduct small pilot studies and collect user feedback, such tests rarely have the quality, scale and independence required. Our guidance recommends incorporating evaluation into the design of the AI tool itself.\n\nBecause most AI tools are hosted online, it’s relatively easy to test new features by comparing how various user groups respond5. For example, a government website might randomly show some users a new LLM-powered interactive chatbot, whereas others continue to use a simpler, rules-based one. The new tool’s impact can then be assessed by tracking whether users in the LLM group are less likely to request human assistance or call the help centre — signs that their queries are being resolved more effectively than those of the other group.\n\nPeople can monitor their blood glucose levels continuously using a smartphone app.Credit: Getty\n\nSurveys can provide useful feedback on user experience for both groups, helping evaluators to understand what worked and why. But it’s important to not rely on self-reports alone. Observing actual behaviour — what people do, not just what they say — provides stronger evidence of impact.\n\nMore-complex AI projects require proportionately scaled evaluation designs. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which the UK National Health Service provides people with an AI-powered wearable device to help them to manage a chronic condition. The technology monitors the person’s health and sends automated alerts to their physician if it detects signs that medical attention might be needed. A robust evaluation could randomly assign the AI-enabled wearable to some people, whereas others (serving as a control group) could receive a version without such features.\n\nKey outcomes might include a reduction in the number of hospital admissions through more timely preventative care. But the evaluation should also explore potential unintended consequences — for instance, whether physicians become overly reliant on the AI tool and reduce the frequency of in-person consultations or other standard care practices.\n\nContinuous evaluation\n\nOur AI-evaluation guidance not just builds on the UK government’s Magenta Book4, which outlines its evaluation standards, but calls for updating conventional approaches. Most policies are typically evaluated only once. For AI, however, this needs to change.\n\nAI models are fast-evolving, and their output and performance can change quickly. Many AI systems adapt through user interactions, meaning that their behaviour can change over time — or differ across user groups. Evaluation strategies must therefore be as dynamic and responsive as the technology itself.\n\nOur guidance highlights the need for continuous, iterative evaluation. Instead of relying on a single assessment, setting up regular checkpoints — or better yet, adopting a system that continuously updates the evidence base as data become available — can be much more effective. This kind of flexible approach enables decision makers to adapt quickly and make informed choices as the technology and its impacts evolve.",

          "authors": "Yihe Xu",
          "abstract": "As summer arrives in China, the country’s 2023 heatwave springs to mind. A period of extreme heat in June and July that year didn’t just scorch the land — it exposed a hard truth about China’s energy future. Temperatures in Xinjiang province shattered records at 52 °C and nationwide sales of air-conditioning units spiked by about 40% (see go.nature.com/452ckya; in Chinese).\n\nThe illusion of a stable, renewables-led grid collapsed: in Jiangsu, solar farms sputtered at low capacity as sunlight was dimmed by weeks of industrial smog. In Inner Mongolia, wind turbines stood still under a rare, suffocating heat dome. Hydropower generation fell to a historic low, whereas national carbon emissions hit a record high, as surging electricity demand and frequent power outages revived calls to expand fossil-fuel power (J. Dinneen New Scientist 3 April 2025).\n\nFaced with the prospect of power-grid failure, China had no choice but to fall back on the dirtiest tool in its energy arsenal: coal. During peak demand, thermal power plants were shouldering more than two-thirds of national electricity needs (see go.nature.com/4gth7zr; in Chinese). The power sector’s coal consumption grew in 2023 by 9% relative to 2022, to 2.9 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/3gnfk35; in Chinese).\n\nThe heatwave was a stark reminder that, despite its world-beating solar and wind facilities, China is still tethered — almost helplessly — to fossil fuels (see ‘China’s fossil-fuel reliance’). From steel mills to semiconductor plants, the engines of China’s growth are fuelled by coal, oil and gas. Yet clinging to the status quo risks accelerating both environmental degradation and geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nSources: China Petroleum Econ. and Tech. Res. Inst.; CNOOC Energy Econ. Inst.; Natl Bureau of Statistics\n\nAs the world’s largest energy consumer, China cannot simply abandon fossil fuels without jeopardizing the industrial base and social fabric that underpin its economic rise. What’s needed is realism. China’s energy future is not a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables — it is a high-stakes balancing act between economic resilience, environmental responsibility and social stability.\n\nAt the heart of its energy strategy must be carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). If the world is to meet its climate targets, China must lead not only in building green energy, but in cleaning up the energy it cannot yet replace with renewables.\n\nIndustry needs a lot of energy\n\nIn 2024, fossil fuels supplied almost 82% of China’s total energy consumption (59.6 billion tonnes of coal equivalent). Coal accounted for 53%, oil for 17%, and natural gas for 11% (see go.nature.com/3tjpe7r; in Chinese). To understand their centrality, consider three sectors that contribute 25% of national gross domestic product (GDP): steel, chemicals and construction materials . Power generation and coal-to-chemical industries alone consume around 2 billion tonnes of coal annually (see go.nature.com/4kdx9hm; in Chinese). These processes demand extreme heat: blast furnaces cannot run on solar power, and cement kilns need temperatures of 1,450 °C, which today’s renewables cannot yet reliably supply.\n\nTo end coal, adapt to regional realities\n\nEven high-tech industries depend on fossil fuels. In 2022, data centres across China consumed a total of 270 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a 25% increase compared with 2021. This accounted for roughly 3% of the country’s total electricity consumption, much of it generated from coal (see go.nature.com/4kcz99y; in Chinese). According to a report by climate researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the coal industry directly supported 2.6 million jobs in 2023. In Inner Mongolia, a region with a population of 23.8 million, coal contributes about 16% of its GDP and nearly half of its industrial profits, employing more than 180,000 people (see go.nature.com/3tsrfxs; in Chinese).\n\nAbandoning coal without a strategy would trigger social unrest, as Germany discovered during its phase out of coal mining in the Ruhr Valley, starting in 2018. On losing a sector that once employed about 600,000 people, the region saw mass lay-offs and economic decline, sparking waves of protest and discontent (see go.nature.com/3ufk6wd).\n\nAs of 2024, China’s capacity in solar and wind energy (887 and 521 gigawatts, respectively; see go.nature.com/3gjfdwf; in Chinese) is world-leading, yet last year these renewable sources met just 18% of the country’s total electricity demand. The problem isn’t scale — it’s intermittency. For instance, during a 2022 winter cold snap, the generation capacity of Inner Mongolia’s wind farms dropped to nearly zero for 24 hours because there was so little wind. Grid operators learnt the hard way and now require coal plants in major coal-producing areas to maintain 15-day coal stockpiles — not as a fallback to the past, but as a necessity of the present.\n\nOil and gas are equally entrenched. China’s transportation sector alone consumes 177 million tonnes of petrol annually (see go.nature.com/4keewqm; in Chinese). Petrol and diesel still power almost 80% of China’s roughly 450 million vehicles, despite electric vehicles accounting for 41% of new car sales in 2024, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nOil is also the feedstock of China’s petrochemical empire. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company — one of Asia’s largest integrated refineries, run by the Chinese state firm Sinopec — processes up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Its output feeds China’s vast plastics and chemical industries, which together employ more than 12 million people nationwide.\n\nThree ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky\n\nNatural gas, once peripheral, is now a geopolitical and environmental linchpin. As part of the Blue Sky campaign, tens of millions of rural households have replaced coal stoves with gas boilers — slashing urban smog but driving gas imports up to 43% to cover the increased consumption (see go.nature.com/4nvkkss; in Chinese). China’s gas supply map is also a map of its foreign policy. A pipeline from Siberia delivers 38 billion cubic metres per year from Russia. In Guangdong, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals offload cargo from Qatar to feed factories that help to produce 70% of the world’s air conditioners.\n\nThis dependency isn’t just economic — it’s strategic. China still imports 11 million barrels of oil per day, yet 80% of it is transported by sea through the narrow, US-patrolled Strait of Malacca, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation. Gas pipelines snake through restive regions near Afghanistan, and LNG ships from Australia navigate contested waters in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response, China is doubling down on domestic exploration. In 2024, Sinopec announced it had discovered 140 million tonnes of shale oil in Shandong province, and PetroChina’s Gulong shale-oil field in Daqing is targeting a reserve of 1 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/4kj3g5r; in Chinese). These projects — in three national shale demonstration zones — should help to cut China’s oil import reliance and replicate the US revolution in fracking, or hydraulic fracturing.\n\nThe price of fossil-fuel use is paid in carbon dioxide. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were projected to reach a record 41.6 billion tonnes — most of which came from coal burning (see go.nature.com/4rpu6qq). China contributed a staggering 16 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, according to the UN Environment Programme’s 2024 emissions gap report (see go.nature.com/4gzuyza), with coal alone responsible for more than 60% of CO2 emissions. Without urgent and comprehensive decarbonization, the climate crisis will only accelerate.\n\nUse carbon-capture technologies\n\nChina’s solution cannot be renewables alone. It must include CCUS, not as an afterthought, but as central infrastructure, similar to roads or railways. Currently, CCUS is the only proven technology with the potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and chemicals, if it can be made to work at scale.\n\nChina has backed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, a global pact launched in 2023 at the COP28 UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates to cut emissions from the fossil-fuel sector. In July 2024, PetroChina joined the initiative, aligning with more than 50 oil companies responsible for 44% of global oil output. The charter mandates real action: no routine flaring of gas from fossil-fuel operations by 2030 and the adoption of industry best practices for emissions reductions and transparent emissions reporting.\n\nA nationwide heatwave in China in June 2023 caused a 40% surge in sales of air-conditioning units. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nBut progress remains slow. China’s national carbon market, the China Emissions Allowance, trades at 68–90 yuan (US$9.50–12.50) per tonne — well below carbon prices in the European Union, which exceed €70 (US$82) per tonne. Such low levels in China offer little incentive for companies to invest in deep decarbonization.\n\nChina emits more than 10 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, yet current CCUS projects, mostly in the Junggar Basin in northwest China, capture just 4 million tonnes and store 2 million tonnes (see go.nature.com/3tfkpye; in Chinese). The disparity is staggering. Without a sweeping scale-up, CCUS is symbolic at best. Closing the gap will require a huge and concerted effort to make carbon capture count.\n\nUrgent actions\n\nFirst, China must drive down CCUS costs through sustained research and development and standardization. Technical standards should cover the entire CCUS life cycle: capture, transport, injection, monitoring and closure. These must include engineering protocols, environmental risk assessments and leakage detection systems.",

          "authors": "Laurie Udesky",
          "abstract": "Credit: Getty\n\nScientists overwhelmingly recognize the value of sharing null results, but rarely publish them in the research literature, according to a survey. The findings suggest that there is a need for increased awareness of how and why to share such data, as well as for changes in how research productivity is assessed.\n\nThe survey drew responses from 11,069 researchers in 166 countries and all major scientific disciplines. It found that 98% recognize the value of null results, which the survey defined as “an outcome that does not confirm the desired hypothesis”. Eighty-five per cent of respondents said it was important to share those results. However, just 68% of the 7,057 researchers whose work had produced null results had shared them in some form, and just 30% had tried to publish them in a journal.\n\nThe results were released on 22 July. The survey was conducted by Nature’s publisher, Springer Nature. (Nature is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nReluctance to publish\n\nThat only 30% of respondents with null results had attempted to publish them is not surprising to Ritu Dhand, Springer Nature’s chief scientific officer in London.\n\n“Researchers are taught to write research papers referencing positive advances, so null results are rarely cited,” she says. That means that even if null results are published, they won’t have an impact, she adds.\n\nSome 1,489 respondents had generated null results and agreed that they are important to share but had not yet done so. Most of that group expressed concerns about publishing them: 69% didn’t think null results would be accepted for publication; 52% didn’t know which journals would consider publishing research with null results; 19% worried that their institution or funder wouldn’t cover publishing costs; and 21% were concerned that they’d be viewed negatively by their peers.\n\nThis reputational concern reflects a disconnect in science, says Marcus Munafò, a biological psychologist and executive director of the UK Reproducibility Network, which aims to improve the trustworthiness of research.\n\n“The day-to-day life of most scientists is null results. Most of our studies don’t work. Most of our experiments don’t work,” says Munafò. “One of the reasons for publishing null results is to create a more honest denominator in the version of record” — a more accurate picture of the research landscape.\n\nCommunity service\n\nOf the 1,228 respondents who were able to publish their null results, 39% said that the process helped to inspire a new hypothesis or methodology and 28% said it prevented the duplication of unnecessary research.\n\nSuch efforts would have been appreciated by one anonymous respondent, who described how null results that could have changed the trajectory of their work were only “briefly mentioned” in a couple of journal articles that they stumbled on years later, “buried among other information in the articles”.\n\n“If it had been widely disseminated in my field,” they lamented, “it would have saved me 2+ critical research years!”",

          "authors": "Caroline Seydel",
          "abstract": "Synthetic biology is poised to tackle a range of challenges, from cleaning up pollutants with designer bacteria to the creation of bespoke gene therapies. But the transition from the laboratory to commercial use will require advances in DNA-synthesis technology.\n\nFor decades, the only way to make industrial volumes of custom DNA has been phosphoramidite synthesis, an organic-chemistry process that can construct nucleic acids up to 350 nucleotides or so in length. To produce longer fragments, DNA manufacturers build thousands of oligonucleotides, or oligos, in parallel, and then assemble them. This technique can pump out large volumes of DNA at low cost, but it struggles with sequences that are highly repetitive or complex.\n\nThe race for enzymatic DNA synthesis heats up\n\nNow, advances in both enzymatic and chemical synthesis are clearing those hurdles.\n\nEnzymatic synthesis is inspired by the method that living cells use to replicate DNA. Usually, cells copy DNA from a template rather than creating it from scratch. But that works only if the template exists, which is not the case for the custom DNAs that synthetic biologists need. An enzyme called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) can join nucleotides together without a template, and several companies have begun commercializing enzymatic methods that exploit it.\n\nDNA Script, based in Paris, couples TdT with chemically modified nucleotides that prevent elongation by more than one monomer at a time. After each base is added, the protective cap is removed and washed away, another base is added and the cycle repeats. Ansa Biotechnologies takes a similar approach, but rather than using a blocking group to restrict elongation, the company, in Emeryville, California, tethers the base to TdT so that the enzyme stays bound to the growing oligo. A second enzyme cleaves the linker after elongation, allowing the cycle to continue.\n\nThomas Ybert, chief scientific officer at DNA Script in Paris.Credit: ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty\n\nAccording to Daniel Lin-Arlow, Ansa’s chief scientific officer, the approach can handle sequences with highly complex secondary structures, including repeats, hairpins or high guanine–cytosine content, which are otherwise difficult to produce. In August 2024, the company launched its first commercial product, a 600-base custom service, which can be assembled into constructs of up to 5 kilobases. “We found a lot of interest from people who were working on non-coding sequences, like promoters,” Lin-Arlow says, which cannot be changed to make them easier to manufacture. And the technology continues to advance: early-access customers can now request DNAs as long as 750 bases, and clonal assemblies up to 50 kbp in length.\n\nEnzymatic synthesis is also making benchtop DNA synthesizers more accessible. Phosphoramidite-based DNA synthesizers require specialized training and infrastructure to safely handle toxic organic reagents and waste. By contrast, enzymatic synthesizers require only basic liquid-handling skills. In 2023, DNA Script began selling its SYNTAX system, a device that researchers can use to synthesize 96 oligos in parallel, with up to about 120 nucleotides per oligo, per day. “It’s as easy to use as your office printer,” says Thomas Ybert, the firm’s chief scientific officer.\n\nChemical improvements\n\nNew organic-chemistry methods are also emerging to tackle long-DNA synthesis.",

          "authors": "Ananyo Bhattacharya",
          "abstract": "One of the biggest stories in science is quietly playing out in the world of abstract mathematics. Over the course of last year, researchers fulfilled a decades-old dream when they unveiled a proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture — a key piece of a group of interconnected problems called the Langlands programme. The proof — a gargantuan effort — validates the intricate and far-reaching Langlands programme, which is often hailed as the grand unified theory of mathematics but remains largely unproven. Yet the work’s true impact might lie not in what it settles, but in the new avenues of inquiry it reveals.\n\n“It’s a huge triumph. But rather than closing a door, this proof throws open a dozen others,” says David Ben-Zvi at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved with the work.\n\n‘Mind blowing’: quantum computer untangles the mathematics of knots\n\nProving the geometric Langlands conjecture has long been considered one of the deepest and most enigmatic pursuits in modern mathematics. Ultimately, it took a team of nine mathematicians to crack the problem, in a series of five papers spanning almost 1,000 pages1–5. The group was led by Dennis Gaitsgory at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, and Sam Raskin at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who completed his PhD with Gaitsgory in 2014.\n\nThe magnitude of their accomplishment was quickly recognized by the mathematical community: in April, Gaitsgory received the US$3-million Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and Raskin was awarded a New Horizons prize for promising early-career mathematicians. Like many landmark results in mathematics, the proof promises to forge bridges between different areas, allowing the tools of one domain to tackle intractable problems in another. All told, it’s a heady time for researchers in these fields.\n\n“It gives us the strongest evidence yet that something we’ve believed in for decades is true,” says Ben-Zvi. “Now we can finally ask: what does it really mean?”\n\nThe hole story\n\nThe Langlands programme traces its origins back 60 years, to the work of a young Canadian mathematician named Robert Langlands, who set out his vision in a handwritten letter to the leading mathematician André Weil. Over the decades, the programme attracted increasing attention from mathematicians, who marvelled at how all-encompassing it was. It was that feature that led Edward Frenkel at the University of California, Berkeley, who has made key contributions to the geometric side, to call it the grand unified theory of mathematics.\n\nLanglands’ aim was to connect two very separate major branches of mathematics — number theory (the study of integers) and harmonic analysis (the study of how complicated signals or functions break down into simple waves). A special case of the Langlands programme is the epic proof that Andrew Wiles published, in 1995, of Fermat’s last theorem — that no three positive integers a, b and c satisfy the equation an + bn = cn if n is an integer greater than 2.\n\nRobert Langlands discussed his ideas in a letter to André Weil in 1967. On the cover page to the letter (left), Langlands says, “If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not — I am sure you have a waste basket handy.”Credit: Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton, N.J.) Shelby White and Leon Levy Archives Center\n\nThe geometric Langlands conjecture was first developed in the 1980s by Vladimir Drinfeld, then at the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Like the original or arithmetic form of the Langlands conjecture, the geometric conjecture also makes a type of connection: it suggests a correspondence between two different sets of mathematical objects. Although the fields linked by the arithmetic form of Langlands are separate mathematical ‘worlds’, the differences between the two sides of the geometric conjecture are not so pronounced. Both concern properties of Riemann surfaces, which are ‘complex manifolds’ — structures with coordinates that are complex numbers (with real and imaginary parts). These manifolds can take the form of spheres, doughnuts or pretzel-like shapes with two or more holes.\n\nMany mathematicians strongly suspect that the ‘closeness’ of the two sides means the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture could eventually offer some traction for furthering the arithmetic version, in which the relationships are more mysterious. “To truly understand the Langlands correspondence, we have to realize that the ‘two worlds’ in it are not that different — rather, they are two facets of one and the same world,” says Frenkel. “Seeing this unity requires a new vision, a new understanding. We are still far from it in the original formulation. But the fact that, for Riemann surfaces, the two worlds sort of coalesce means that we are getting closer to finding this secret unity underlying the whole programme,” he adds.\n\nObesity-drug pioneers and 13,508 physicists win US$3-million Breakthrough Prizes\n\nOne side of the geometric Langlands conjecture concerns a characteristic called a fundamental group. In basic terms, the fundamental group of a Riemann surface describes all the distinct ways in which loops can be tied around it. With a doughnut, for example, a loop can run horizontally around the outer edge or vertically through the hole and around the outside. The geometric Langlands deals with the ‘representation’ of a surface’s fundamental group, which expresses the group’s properties as matrices (grids of numbers).\n\nThe other side of the geometric Langlands programme has to do with special kinds of ‘sheaves’. These tools of algebraic geometry are rules that allot ‘vector spaces’ (where vectors — arrows — can be added and multiplied) to points on a manifold in much the same way as a function describing a gravitational field, say, can assign numbers for the strength of the field to points in standard 3D space.\n\nBridgework in progress\n\nWork on bridging this divide began back in the 1990s. Using earlier work on Kac–Moody algebras, which ‘translate’ between representations and sheaves, Drinfeld and Alexander Beilinson, both now at the University of Chicago, Illinois, described how to build the right kind of sheaves to make the connection. Their paper (see go.nature.com/4ndp5ev), nearly 400 pages long, has never been formally published. Gaitsgory, together with Dima Arinkin at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made this relationship more precise in 20126; then, working alone, Gaitsgory followed up with a step-by-step outline of how the geometric Langlands might be proved7.\n\n“The conjecture as such sounds pretty baroque — and not just to outsiders,” says Ben-Zvi. “I think people are much more excited about the proof of geometric Langlands now than they would have been a decade ago, because we understand better why it’s the right kind of question to ask, and why it might be useful for things in number theory.”\n\nOne of the most immediate consequences of the new proof is the boost it provides to research on ‘local’ versions of the different Langlands conjectures, which ‘zoom in’ on particular objects in the ‘global’ settings. In the case of the geometric Langlands programme, for example, the local version is concerned with the properties of objects associated with discs around points on a Riemann surface — rather than the whole manifold, which is the domain of the ‘global’ version.\n\nRobert Langlands in 2016.Credit: Dan Komoda, Institute for Advanced Study\n\nPeter Scholze, at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, has been instrumental in forging connections between the local and global Langlands programmes. But initially, even he was daunted by the geometric side.\n\n“To tell the truth,” Scholze says, “until around 2014, the geometric Langlands programme looked incomprehensible to me.” That changed when Laurent Fargues at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris proposed a reimagining of the local arithmetic Langlands conjectures in geometrical terms8. Working together, Scholze and Fargues spent seven years showing that this strategy could help to make progress on proving a version of the local arithmetic Langlands conjecture9 concerning the p-adic numbers, which involve the primes and their powers. They connected it to the global geometric version that the team led by Gaitsgory and Raskin later proved.\n\nThe papers by Scholze and Fargues built what Scholze describes as a “wormhole” between the two areas, allowing methods and structures from the global geometric Langlands programme to be imported into the local arithmetic context. “So I’m really happy about the proof,” Scholze says. “I think it’s a tremendous achievement and am mining it for parts.”\n\nQuantum connection\n\nAccording to some researchers, one of the most surprising bridges that the geometric Langlands programme has built is to theoretical physics. Since the 1970s, physicists have explored a quantum analogue of a classical symmetry: that swapping electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell’s equations, which describe how the two fields interact, leaves the equations unchanged. This elegant symmetry underpins a broader idea in quantum field theory, known as S-duality.\n\n‘Grand unified theory of maths’ nets Abel Prize\n\nIn 2007, Edward Witten at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, and Anton Kapustin at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena were able to show10 that S-duality in certain four-dimensional gauge theories — a class of theories that includes the standard model of particle physics — possesses the same symmetry that appears in the geometric Langlands correspondence. “Seemingly esoteric notions of the geometric Langlands program,” the pair wrote, “arise naturally from the physics.”\n\nAlthough their theories include hypothetical particles, called superpartners, that have never been observed, their insight suggests that geometric Langlands is not just a rarefied idea in pure mathematics; instead, it can be seen as a shadow of a deep symmetry in quantum physics. “I do think it is fascinating that the Langlands programme has this counterpart in quantum field theory,” says Witten. “And I think this might eventually be important in the mathematical development of the Langlands programme.”\n\nAmong the first to take that possibility seriously was Minhyong Kim, director of the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, UK. “Even simple-sounding problems in number theory — like Fermat’s last theorem — are hard,” he says. One way to make headway is by using ideas from physics, like those in Witten and Kapustin’s work, as a sort of metaphor for number-theoretic problems, such as the arithmetic Langlands conjecture. Kim is working on making these metaphors more rigorous. “I take various constructions in quantum field theory and try to cook up precise number-theoretic analogues,” he says.\n\nSam Raskin (left) and Dennis Gaitsgory led the team that proved the geometric Langlands conjecture.Credit: Dan Renzetti/Yale University, Lester Cohen/Getty Images for Breakthrough Prize",

          "abstract": "Annie and Ilan Ganot (pictured with their children) tapped into their networks to start a firm focused on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Credit: Ilan Ganot\n\nFor most parents of children with serious medical conditions, the date of the diagnosis is seared into their memory. For Terry Pirovolakis, it was 2 April 2019. After an 18-month diagnostic odyssey, he was told that his son, Michael, had a progressive neurodevelopmental condition called spastic paraplegia 50 (SPG50), and would probably never walk or talk.\n\nBut, unlike most parents, Pirovolakis began a journey to find a cure, which ultimately led to setting up a biotechnology company. He is not alone. Pirovolakis, chief executive of Elpida Therapeutics in Encino, California, says there is a small but growing number of parents doing the same. Four years ago, he started a channel for them on the online communication platform Slack, which now has more than 400 members.\n\nMajor advances in life-science tools over the past 20 years, and the increasing number of ways to produce therapies mean that finding cures is not just wishful thinking, although the road to clinical success is still daunting. Some of these parents have backgrounds in finance or business, but most have no formal scientific training. However, all share a determination to keep going. They describe what it took to get their firms off the ground, and how they deal with the highs and lows of being both a parent and a company founder.\n\nHow a midwife became a neuroscientist to seek a cure for her son\n\nIn 2012, after their two-year-old son, Eytani, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Ilan and Annie Ganot gave up their previous careers. Realizing that the networks they had developed could help them to raise the necessary capital to start a biotech firm, the family relocated from London to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2013. By the year’s end, they had US$17 million in seed funding for the company, Solid Biosciences. “I didn’t know if it was going to succeed or fail,” says Ilan Ganot, “but it didn’t feel like there were a ton of reasons not to try.”\n\nDaniel Fischer had been an e-commerce entrepreneur and a management consultant before Natasha, one of his twin daughters, was diagnosed in 2009 with Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy caused by a genetic mutation. Unlike his wife, who immediately began to read the literature, Fischer felt there was little he could do, but a series of serendipitous meetings with other parents changed his mind.\n\nAt one, a computational biologist explained his work on drug repurposing — finding new uses for existing medications. Then Fischer received a call from another parent, who was looking to support work towards a cure. The three of them started Intellimedix in Atlanta, Georgia, which uses computational modelling to screen existing drugs for anti-seizure activity. Eventually, they opened a laboratory in Boston to screen the top hits in a zebrafish model of the disease.\n\nDaniel Fischer (with daughter Natalie, left) started companies to work on Dravet syndrome.Credit: Karina Fischer\n\nJill Wood had a career in fashion retail, when. in 2010, her son Jonah was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), a rare genetic disorder that causes damage to the brain and nervous system. “We were told that he had an incurable, ultra-rare disease, no treatment. It was terminal,” says Wood. She “flipped out” and started fundraising as a non-profit foundation, but “quickly realized that wasn’t going to cut it”.\n\nWood immersed herself in the scientific literature and started seeking out the key researchers who work on the disease. She quit her job to go to conferences, sometimes taking Jonah, as well as her sister or husband to help. She recalls waiting for one researcher outside the men’s toilets so she could ask questions. Following the example of another mother of a child with Sanfilippo syndrome, who set up a company called Lysogene in Paris in 2009, Wood transformed her foundation into a biotech company called Phoenix Nest, based in New York City, and won a US National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research grant to pursue therapies for Sanfilippo syndrome. So far, the company has been awarded more than $13 million and has a preclinical pipeline that includes a peptide, an enzyme replacement therapy and a gene therapy.\n\nPromotion pathways: how scientists can chart their industry career trajectory\n\nAt the time of his son’s diagnosis, Pirovolakis, who is based in Toronto, Canada, had spent 25 years in information technology. He knew nothing about genetics and was reluctant to move into biotech, but concluded, “if I don’t do this, who will?” Within a couple of months, he hired a team at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to start work on a gene therapy for his son. “We liquidated our life savings, and we knew that even if we sold everything, we wouldn’t have enough money.” He embarked on an exhausting fundraising campaign of galas and golf tournaments and, over four years, raised US$4.5 million. In December 2021, Health Canada gave the gene therapy, Melpida, the go-ahead for use in a single-patient clinical trial, and Michael was treated in March 2022. Since then, seven other children have been treated. Preliminary results suggest that the therapy can stabilize the disease (J. J. Dowling et al. Nature Med. 30, 1882–1887; 2024).\n\nHe then wanted to hand over the programme to any organization for free and return to his previous career, but found no takers; the market for the treatment was too small, with fewer than 100 people known to be affected worldwide. So he set up the non-profit company Elpida, with the help of two investors.\n\nStart-up company or charity?\n\nFor those with business or finance backgrounds, setting up a company seemed the obvious choice. “I basically went with what I knew how to do,” says Fischer. Wood says the constant need to fundraise for the charity that she and her husband initially set up was harder than running a biotech firm. “It’s like having to plan three weddings a year for 300 people, and it is soul-sucking. After a while, you are hitting up the same people over and over — you wear everybody thin.”\n\nGanot realized that it would take hundreds of millions of dollars to find a cure for DMD, and that raising that amount would need a for-profit company. But creating profit isn’t so easy for rarer diseases. Brad Margus was faced with this problem in 1993, when two of his sons, Jarrett, then aged four, and Quinn, then aged two, were diagnosed with ataxia–telangiectasia (AT). This genetic disease causes loss of muscle control and problems with the lungs and immune system, as well as heightening the risk of cancer, and often leads to death by early adulthood.\n\nHe and his wife poured their energy into a foundation while he continued to run a shrimp-processing business. But he found it increasingly difficult to care about supplying restaurants, and instead focused on how to accelerate research on AT. His knowledge of and focus on drug discovery drew several venture capitalists to him in 2000, looking for executives who knew about genetics. That same year, he co-founded Perlegen Sciences, a company based in Mountain View, California, that sought to identify patterns in genetic differences that underlie disease.\n\nParents who want to start a company to find a cure for their child’s disease should take the plunge, says Brad Margus, who has founded several biotechnology firms.Credit: Brad Margus\n\nAlthough he wasn’t working on an AT cure, “now I could think about science all the time,” he says. He has since founded two more biotech companies, Envoy Therapeutics, which was sold to Takeda Pharmaceuticals, based in Tokyo, in 2012, and Cerevance in Boston, which has a therapy for Parkinson’s disease in a phase III trial. All the while, Margus says, he has been leveraging his experience to benefit the AT mission. “You really can’t work for me at a company and be smart and not expect to have me ask you a lot of questions” about the disease, he says. Cerevance has helped to analyse brain-tissue samples from children who died from AT.\n\nLimited scientific knowledge hasn’t been a barrier for some parents who have founded companies. Arjun Natesan, senior vice-president of translational research and portfolio management at Ultragenyx in Novato, California, which focuses on rare diseases, runs an entrepreneur bootcamp to help them, and says he is impressed by their scientific literacy. “It’s like they have a PhD in their specific indication. They can talk the talk, and they truly understand a lot of the biology.” Fischer took some courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and says, “I’m at a stage where I can talk smartly about the science, but don’t ask me to do it or to work out too many details!” Wood picked up what she needed to know but “a lot of times I just nod my head and go with it”, she says. They both trust the scientists they hired to provide the expertise they lack.\n\nAfrica’s chief diplomat for vaccine manufacturing\n\nHaving a personal stake in the company’s pipeline matters. “Your motivation is going to guide many of the decisions,” says Fischer. But, as a chief executive, he sometimes has to make choices that go against his personal interests. “Sometimes we have to prioritize the programmes where you have a bigger probability of succeeding in the market.” If this helps the company to succeed, he thinks, in the long run it puts him in a better position to find a treatment for Dravet syndrome. Ganot, who now runs Alesta Therapeutics in Boston, another firm with a focus on rare diseases, has a similar ethos. “It was important to me that this would not be about my son. This would be because of him,” he says. The approach has helped him to make decisions in the interests of stakeholders as well as those being treated.\n\nThe personal mission can make you “less patient” and “more blunt and candid”, says Margus, which might not always be easy for colleagues. But, he adds, a large proportion of people in biotech have a personal connection to the field: “They’ve got a mother who’s cognitively declining or they’ve got a kid with something.” At Tevard Biosciences in Boston, which Fischer co-founded in 2017 together with another Dravet parent, the leadership thinks hard about being patient-focused, he says, by bringing families in to talk to the team, for example. “I always tell our employees, ‘I know we’re working with cell lines and mice, but in the end, remember we’re working for kids and I have one at home.’”\n\nHighs and lows\n\nAs with any biotech endeavour, parents who launch companies go through highs and lows, and sometimes a steep learning curve. Wood experienced the departure of a principal investigator (PI), which meant that the $2-million NIH grant that was funding employees, including herself, was frozen. She ended up borrowing money from her brother to keep the company afloat, and did not take a salary for six months until she could find another PI willing to take on the grant. “That was almost a year by the time it all got back on track,” she says. “I cried every day.”\n\nPirovolakis says he learnt to remove his emotions from stressful situations. In 2021, he lost a gene-therapy product worth $800,000 because of snowstorm shipping delays. He felt like screaming at people, but quickly moved on to thinking about fixing the situation. Ganot also experienced severe disappointments, such as unexpected safety challenges during clinical trials of a candidate molecule. “When it’s personal, it hits you much harder,” agrees Fischer.\n\nTerry Pirovolakis with his son, Michael.Credit: Terry Pirovolakis",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Data-visualization researcher Lonni Besançon hopes young scientists will get involved in scientific sleuthing.Credit: Julie G.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lonni Besançon was far away from home and, like most of us, spending a lot of time online.\n\nIn September 2020, six months into the pandemic, Besançon moved from southern Sweden to Melbourne, Australia, to start a new postdoc at Monash University. In an unfamiliar place and in need of a new activity, the data-visualization researcher was struck by the outlandish things he was seeing online.\n\nHe also wanted to feel useful during this turbulent time. Besançon, originally from Paris, found a way to make use of his experience in statistics and research methods: by examining controversial and preliminary papers on COVID-19.\n\nIt quickly became a preoccupation. During lockdown, he would post his findings on Twitter (now called X) even in the middle of the night. Besançon was accustomed to seeing a misuse of statistics, which he blamed on structural problems in scholarly publishing and academia, such as the career pressure to publish quickly and frequently.\n\nBut research that he felt was problematic seemed to ramp up during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pace and scale of scientific publishing drastically intensified, with preprints (papers published online before peer review) becoming more prominent than ever. And this speed posed a challenge to quality control. All this galvanized Besançon “As I sat at home watching shoddy science, poor quality control and opaque research being published and discussed, I felt more and more inspired to become a scientific sleuth,” he says.\n\nChain retraction: how to stop bad science propagating through the literature\n\nThe Internet was both harmful and helpful in terms of attacking false information. He put out a call on Twitter for researchers who could help to analyse papers that had been published after short review periods. In June 2021, Besançon and his collaborators, who were working at various institutes and in several areas of health research, analysed the publication metadata of 8,455 papers related to COVID-19, published by 1 July 2020. They found that 699 (8.3%) of the papers had been accepted by a journal the same day or the following day. For 42.5% of those papers, at least one of the authors had an editorial role at the journal they were published in1.\n\n“Look, maybe there’s not a universally agreed definition of what an editorial conflict of interest is,” Besançon says. “But it’s a red flag, and the lack of transparency about peer-review processes when there’s a potential conflict of interest, that’s the problem, plus the very quick peer review.” He stresses that he didn’t consider this fraud, but he did question whether such papers could have been properly peer reviewed; in instances in which reviewers’ comments were published, some were just one sentence long. This made him wonder about both the rigour of the review process, and the implications for busy clinicians relying on such papers. Besançon says he understood the desire to expedite clinically relevant research during the pandemic, but he thinks that if journals had relaxed their peer-review policies, this should have been disclosed. In August 2020, for example, The FASEB Journal, published by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, announced which types of article, at the discretion of the editor, could be fast-tracked without peer review2.\n\nInvestigating a high-profile COVID-19 treatment\n\nAmong the papers that were published unusually quickly was a March 2020 work assessing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment3. This was published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents within days of being posted as a preprint. In this paper, French microbiologist Didier Raoult and his colleagues concluded that hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant reduction of viral load in a small sample of 20 people (16 further participants formed a control group). The paper immediately attracted a huge amount of interest, including from US President Donald Trump, then in his first term. It would go on to be cited almost 3,400 times, according to the Web of Science database, before being retracted in December 2024. Raoult was lauded by many as a hero of the pandemic.\n\nBesançon saw hydroxychloroquine gain traction and attention in French media and politics. In late March, just a week after the paper was published, the French health minister authorized hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment under supervision in some severe cases. This authorization was withdrawn in May, yet Raoult continued administering hydroxychloroquine to people with COVID-19.\n\nFrench microbiologist Didier Raoult co-authored a 2020 research paper that tested a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The paper was later retracted. Credit: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty\n\nPolicymakers weren’t the only ones paying attention. Besançon continued working with other research-integrity sleuths in response to the hydroxychloroquine paper. This was ad hoc, generally in their free time, he says. One collaborator was Alexander Samuel, a secondary-school maths and physics teacher in Nice, France, and an open-science activist with a PhD in molecular biology. Samuel had been disseminating findings through his blog and social media, but Besançon helped to bring their work to an audience of scientists. “He connects people and then makes a paper. He was kind of like a PI for me,” Samuel says. “I think he brings the scholarly level to the activism.”\n\nBesançon and his fellow investigators pointed out major concerns with the hydroxychloroquine study’s design, such as the fact that 6 people treated with the drug (out of 26 participants) dropped out of the study and were disregarded in the analysis. Of those six, one person died and three were moved into intensive care.\n\nThe sleuths’ scrutiny extended past the single paper, to other research published by University Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection (IHU) in Marseille, France, which was at that time led by Raoult. They found what they considered to be significant ethical breaches, including failure to follow research-ethics guidelines regarding human participants. They realized that Raoult had co-authored more than 200 papers with the same ethics-committee approval number, which represented a single application, including studies involving children in African countries. Raoult has justified the lack of individual ethical review by arguing that research involving human faeces, for instance, did not require unique ethical approval in France.\n\nThe IHU did not respond to questions from Nature's journalists about the culture of the institute and the alleged ethical breaches by the time this article went to press.\n\nHowever, Raoult did make concessions. In January 2021, he and the other authors of the original hydroxychloroquine paper confirmed in a letter to the editor of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents that, in view of the urgency during the COVID-19 pandemic, they had not conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They maintained that “despite its limitations, weaknesses and imperfections, our study provided preliminary evidence that allowed us to treat a large number of patients with HCQ-AZ [hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin] combination that was confirmed to be effective against COVID-19”4.\n\nA separate analysis of 26 trials of hydroxychloroquine, published in April 2021, concluded that this drug was associated with increased mortality in people with COVID-195 .\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic drived huge online attention to science and birthed many vaccine conspiracy theories. Credit: Sylvain Lefevre/Getty\n\nA Nature journalist contacted the authors of the retracted hydroxychloroquine paper to ask about allegations of misconduct and the impact of the paper on people with COVID-19. Most didn’t reply, but Philippe Brouqui, Philippe Parola and Bernard La Scola shared an open letter challenging the retraction, written by Brouqui and Raoult.\n\nElisabeth Bik, a microbiologist based in San Francisco, California, who has become a leading authority on research-integrity issues, shared concerns online about the paper’s data, peer-review timeline and ethical review. Raoult called her a “witch-hunter” and in April 2021, along with one of his co-authors, structural biologist Eric Chabrière, he filed a criminal complaint against Bik, citing moral harassment, attempted blackmail and attempted extortion. The French prosecutor dropped the case in 2024. Chabrière did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRaoult defended himself vigorously. On YouTube in June 2021, he expressed his frustration at the slow pace of ethical clearance during the pandemic and compared criticisms of his research to the persecution faced by many during the Second World War.\n\nAlso in the YouTube video, Raoult speculated about whether Bik and Besançon had been recruited from psychiatric hospitals. Besançon was one of the scientists who wrote an open letter supporting Bik.\n\nIn posts on Twitter, Besançon’s harassers wrongly accused him of Nazism, sexual harassment and responsibility for thousands of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines. He has also received death threats for his science advocacy.\n\nAll this not only affected his sense of safety, but also made him worry about protecting his family and friends. Online trolls speculated about his family’s location. And the stress from the harassment and legal proceedings affected his relationship with his then-partner, he says, because of the strain on his time and mental energy.\n\nPeople around him have suggested that he should not reply to trolls, and Besançon acknowledges, “I’m reading trolling comments, and I’m trolling back, which may not be the best use of my time.” And he notes that some of his colleagues have questioned whether sleuthing could distract him from his academic responsibilities. But as an evening activity, he says, sleuthing isn’t affecting his main research, and he’s kept up a steady stream of publications in his research field, data visualization.\n\nIn August 2021, Besançon brought a case against Raoult for defamation in the French courts in response to the June 2021 YouTube video in which Raoult had made the comment about psychiatric hospitals and also claimed that Besançon suggested sending a ‘suicide car’ to the IHU.\n\nExplaining his decision, Besançon says, “My aim was to prevent direct attacks on my scientific credibility and reputation, both by him and his colleagues.” Raoult’s lawyer told Victor Garcia, a journalist at the French newspaper L'Express, that his client had probably made a mistake while under strain. His legal team also argued that the case exceeded the limitation period, a time limit in which a party can bring a claim, because of a lengthy period between investigative actions. Finally, in April this year, the public prosecutor agreed with Raoult’s team on the limitation period. Thus, the case was dismissed.\n\nMeanwhile, official investigations into Raoult’s research continued. In September 2022, the General Inspectorate of Education, Sport and Research (IGESR), a French public agency that inspects public services, called the IHU’s governance under Raoult “damaging”. It referred to a “contentious and sometimes vindictive atmosphere” at the institute, which included “censorship”. The IGESR also reported that the IHU had a culture of speedy publication of science that put pressure on researchers, and led some to massage their data, sidestep participant consent and disregard regulations. The IGESR stated that in treating people with COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, years after the French ban, the IHU’s “practices are likely to be deemed a criminal offence”. (The IGESR also expressed concern about the institute’s off-protocol use of azithromycin, zinc and ivermectin in people with COVID-19.) The public prosecutor has not announced an investigation.",

Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty\n\nExcitement is growing among researchers about another powerful artificial intelligence (AI) model to emerge from China, after DeepSeek shocked the world with its launch of R1 in January.\n\nThe performance of Kimi K2, launched on 11 July by Beijing-based company Moonshot AI, matches or surpasses that of Western rivals, as well as some DeepSeek models, across various benchmarks, according to the firm. In particular, it seems to excel at coding and scoring high in tests such as LiveCodeBench.\n\nScientists flock to DeepSeek: how they’re using the blockbuster AI model\n\nAs with DeepSeek’s models, Kimi K2 is open-weight, meaning it can be downloaded and built on by researchers for free. It can be accessed through an application programming interface (API) for a fraction of the price of leading proprietary models, such as Claude 4 from Anthropic in San Francisco, California.\n\n“The community can freely use it, fine-tune it and build on it without training their own model from scratch,” says Adina Yakefu, an AI researcher at the open-science platform Hugging Face in New York City. Just one day after its launch, Kimi K2 was downloaded at a rate higher than that for any other model on the platform, Hugging Face data show. Its release is “another ‘DeepSeek moment’”, Yakefu says.\n\nUnlike many other powerful models, K2 is not a ‘reasoner’ — a model trained to approach queries using step-by-step logic. Instead, it specializes in being an agentic large language model (LLM), meaning that it promises to carry out multi-step tasks using a variety of tools, such as browsing the web or calling on mathematics software. Some models, including some versions of ChatGPT, can already do this, but they are proprietary. AI researchers are still checking whether they can replicate examples of agentic behaviour that Moonshot AI says Kimi K2 can do.\n\nThe next top model\n\nHaving a second impressive model emerge from China in six months suggests that the feat was not an anomaly. “The DeepSeek R1 release earlier this year was more of a prequel than a one-off fluke in the trajectory of AI,” wrote Nathan Lambert, a machine-learning researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, Washington, in his newsletter, Interconnects. Kimi K2 is “the new best open model in the world”, he posted on the social-media site Bluesky.\n\nMoonshot AI, founded in March 2023, is a start-up organization that, until now, has been little known in the West. But its Kimi chatbot, based on a previous LLM, was already the third-most-used in China by November, according to Counterpoint, a marketing-research firm in Hong Kong. Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent are reportedly among its investors.\n\nNEWS 10 July 2025 OpenAI’s o3 tops new AI league table for answering scientific questions",

          "title": "How your research can survive a US federal grant termination",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Seven weeks after being awarded a US$12.9-million grant to assess dementia risks in vulnerable populations, Briana Mezuk received an e-mail informing her that it was being terminated.\n\nMezuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, had honed her federal grant application over two years to take advantage of the National Survey of American Life — a seminal study of 7,000 participants that examined racial, ethnic and cultural influences on mental health1. Started by Mezuk’s mentor, James S. Jackson, a former director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, it is the only nationally representative sample of the mental health of Black Americans, who are twice as likely as their white counterparts to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Mezuk planned to follow up with those participants 25 years after the first interviews took place and examine how their life experiences and mental health had contributed to their dementia risk.\n\nThe five-year grant was awarded on 1 February by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 21 March, it fell foul of the disdain that the administration of US President Donald Trump has expressed for projects including the terms diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAccording to Grant Watch, a database tracking terminated grants from the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — the country’s independent federal science-funding agency — more than 4,500 NIH grants awarded to US institutions have been terminated, representing some $6.1 billion of lost funding. And according to its 27 May account, a total of 1,752 grants, amounting to roughly $1.5 billion, had by then been terminated at the NSF.\n\n“The largest studies on dementia risk only have 800 Black participants. We were going to have 3,000,” says Mezuk, who appealed through the NIH against her grant cancellation. “It is critically important that a diverse set of experiences are represented. If we keep asking the same question in the same populations, we will get the same answer.” Her planned research aimed to glean fresh insights to help ‘baby boomers’, referring to the generation born between 1946 and 1964, to manage dementia risks.\n\nEpidemiologist Briana Mezuk’s grant to study dementia risk in older Black people was reinstated after her appeal. Credit: University of Michigan School of Public Health\n\nBut such terminations don’t just affect the research team involved. Many grant cancellations affect community research partners. Adelia Cooley is a member of the community advisory board for the Healthier Black Elders Center, an outreach programme that includes researchers at three Michigan universities working to improve the health of older Black adults in Detroit and Flint. Cooley says her biggest concern is the impact that the cuts will have on Black Americans, a demographic in which the risk of dementia (in those aged 55 or over) is roughly 45%2. “To say this is irrelevant or not necessary is horrible.”\n\nAgency appeals, however, as well as multi-complaint lawsuits, are getting some terminations reversed. On 16 June, a judge in Maryland ruled that NIH grants in two lawsuits — one filed by 16 state attorneys-general, the other by four researchers and three organizations with scientific members — were terminated unlawfully. The ruling reinstates roughly 800 grants and subawards named in the lawsuits. A follow-up ruling on 2 July suggests that the NIH cannot use discriminatory directives to terminate grants. But the Trump administration is likely to appeal against the decision, extending delays and confusion over terminated grants.\n\nMezuk’s grant was not part of any lawsuit, but she received a 19 June memo from the NIH stating that her appeal “has convinced them that, with revision, the grant is likely allowable”. The vaguely worded correspondence offered her a piece of guidance: remove participant-survey questions about experiences of discrimination. On 10 July, she received notice that her grant had been fully reinstated.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to 20 researchers who have lost grants from the NIH, the NSF, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NASA. Mezuk, for one, is lucky in that her institution supported her appeal. Some universities forbid such attempts.\n\n#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers\n\nDuring the reporting of this article, several interviewees had their grants reinstated, offering hope amid the chaos — although only about one-fifth of NIH-terminated grants have been flagged by Grant Watch as possibly reinstated through appeals or court cases so far. Many researchers are spending the bulk of their time frantically applying for grants to secure enough funding just to keep their work going. But the amounts they can hope to gain pale in comparison with the money lost through the federal-government cuts. Others are exploring new fund-raising strategies altogether – including campaigning through GoFundMe, the world’s largest fundraising platform.\n\nCollateral community damage\n\nMara Freilich, an environmental scientist who started her research group at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2023, lost her first federally funded grant from NASA on 21 March because it was considered “radical and wasteful DEI” spending, according to the e-mail she received from the agency. The funding had been helping a multi-institutional team working with community advocates and citizen scientists to analyse air quality around the Salton Sea, a large, landlocked and highly saline lake in southern California. “One of my big concerns is that the trust in science and in scientists is broken,” says Freilich. It weighs on her that scientists might not be able to follow through on the promises they made to community partners, such as sharing the air-quality findings in a timely manner.\n\nThe Salton Sea field site in California, where Mara Freilich’s group studied air-pollution emissions; the project was funded by a now-terminated NASA grant. Credit: Ryan Sinclair, Loma Linda University\n\nIn a study published on 31 May3, Freilich and her collaborators identified hydrogen sulfide emissions from the Salton Sea as an air pollutant of concern. The research was funded, in part, by the terminated NASA grant, which was also intended to develop innovative ways of using satellite data to predict hydrogen sulfide emissions. Freilich’s appeal against the cancellation was unsuccessful.\n\nThe grant terminations for Mezuk, Freilich and others have had a domino effect. Big studies often involve collaborations between several institutions. Freilich’s grant termination compromises funding for research partners at the University of California, Los Angeles; Loma Linda University in southern California; and Alianza Coachella Valley, a community group that aims to improve environmental conditions in the region.\n\nAlida Cantor, a geographer at Portland State University in Oregon, is also trying hard to maintain ties with community partners. Cantor lost two grants, from the NSF and the EPA, because her research included the banned term “environmental justice”, as related to the intersection between energy development and water availability in the western United States. The funding loss affects four academic institutions, as well as community partners. “Out of respect for our research participants, I’m not going to chuck the data,” says Cantor. “My priority is just being ethical in my relationships with research collaborators, participants, community partners and students.” Oregon was one of 16 states that sued the government to get terminated grants reinstated, and although Cantor is hopeful, she hasn’t heard anything more.\n\nAppeals for some\n\nAppealing against a grant termination usually entails assembling a dossier of evidence to submit to the funder. But success rates have been difficult to determine. The University of Utah’s $38 million Clinical and Translational Science Award, a seven-year grant first awarded by the NIH in 2023, was reinstated on 29 March. Grant Watch states on its website that it thinks the government “has restored a limited number of NIH grants that it previously terminated, often without providing public notice”.\n\nCharles DeCarli, director of the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center, is another of the few people known to have succeeded in an appeal. DeCarli was in the fifth year of a $36-million NIH grant programme to study the vascular factors that lead to dementia in a diverse population. Currently, he and his team have around 1,700 participants enrolled out of a hoped-for total of 2,250. (They lost around 100 participants in the weeks after the grant was initially terminated). DeCarli says his wife summarized the recipe for success best: support from university, peers, the NIH, the Alzheimer’s Association and the American Heart Association, and a dash of pixie dust. “We don’t really know why our appeal was successful,” he says.\n\nDeCarli took three weeks to put together a 41-page appeal that contained 16–18 pages of justification, with 50 references; the rest he describes as “legalese”. He emphasized all the ways in which his work furthered NIH priorities to study chronic illness as promoted by Make America Healthy Again, Trump’s populist campaign tailored to promote the aims of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. DeCarli also pointed out that he had been awarded the grant in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He received a grant-reinstatement notification just a few days after he submitted his appeal.\n\n“If at all possible, push back,” he advises. “Seek the support of your institution. Seek the support of the free press, colleagues, programme officers. Researchers are “a small group”, he adds. “We should organize.”\n\nEarly-career researchers who appeal against the termination of training awards earmarked for diverse candidates are on particularly uncertain terrain – especially if the funding mechanism is terminated. For example, the NIH’s F31 training grants are coveted awards designed to support an individual’s PhD training and research. Since 2002, there have been two options: a standard F31 and a diversity-focused F31, designed to bolster candidates from marginalized or low-income backgrounds. About 30% of the 1,000 or so F31 training grants awarded in 2024 were funded by the diversity mechanism. Patrick Kelly, a third-year PhD candidate at Brown University, was awarded one of them. Kelly’s grant was cancelled in May, along with other diversity-specific F31 awards. Still, he wrote an appeal emphasizing how his dissertation research focused on drug use and drug-related harm from fentanyl, a priority of the HHS.\n\nKelly, a white man, qualified for the award because he is a first-generation student from a low-income background. On 27 June, he was notified that his grant had been reinstated and that funds were available for him to continue the research proposed in the grant. “I remain cautiously optimistic that the remaining years of the fellowship will also be awarded,” he says, but he acknowledges there’s no guarantee of that.\n\nScientists who might be political targets themselves — notably those at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at Columbia University in New York City — also hold out little hope for appeals. Trump has cut federal funding and contracts at both institutions, claiming that student protests in support of Palestinian people are evidence that the establishments “tolerate antisemitism”. On 16 June, a judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty members at Columbia University over Trump-administration funding cuts — because the university itself was not a plaintiff.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nColumbia pulmonologist Jeanine D’Armiento had one time point left to collect data related to diagnosing a rare genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. But on 28 March, she lost her NIH funding for the study. Without those final data “everything we’d done for the last four years was wasted”, she says. At the same time, she lost funding for research on another rare lung disease; both grants were terminated weeks after the initial wave of $400 million in grant losses at Columbia in mid-March.\n\nD’Armiento, who chairs the executive committee of Columbia’s university senate, says her grants have none of the “bad” phrases, such as DEI, that are red flags for the Trump administration. Her trial was designed to recruit individuals in often-overlooked rural settings, among others, she says. She thinks she’s been targeted because the senate supported due process for student protesters. “I’m saddened by the loss of so much of my work,” she says. As it stands, she hopes that patient advocacy groups will help to raise money for her to finish the research. In fact, one trial participant asked her wedding guests to donate to D’Armiento’s research — and raised roughly $13,000.\n\nPhilanthropic life support\n\nBeyond federal funding sources, many turned immediately to philanthropic institutes — notably, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) in Princeton, New Jersey, which is the largest such organization focused solely on health in the country. So far, the RWJ has put together several pools of money to keep terminated research “on life support”, says Alonzo Plough, the foundation’s chief science officer and vice-president for research evaluation and learning.\n\n“What philanthropy can do is important, but it is orders of magnitude less than the billions in federal funding,” says Plough. “We fund in the serious millions, but what has been cut has been serious billions,” he adds.",

          "abstract": "Study finds that some women carry genetic variants that are associated with having children of a particular sex.Credit: Jennie Hart/Alamy\n\nIn families with several children of the same sex, the odds of having another baby of that sex are higher than of having one of the opposite sex, according to a large study1 that investigated the maternal and genetic factors that influence the sex of offspring.\n\nThe results, published in Science Advances today, find that in families with three boys, there is a 61% chance that the next sibling is male. For families with three girls, there was a 58% chance that the next child would be female.\n\nThe findings challenge what people have been told about their baby’s sex, which is that for each pregnancy, there is an equal chance of having either a boy or a girl, says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “Based on these findings, you have to tell couples that their chance of having a different-sex child from what they already have is actually less than 50:50,” he says.\n\nAge influences sex\n\nResearchers at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, looked at the sex of children born to 58,007 female nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015, and the different factors that might explain why some had only boys and others only girls.\n\nThey found that in two-child families, having one child of each sex was more common than two boys or two girls, but in families with three or more children, siblings of the same sex were more common than a mix of both. In their analysis, the researchers excluded the last birth of each woman to reduce the influence of parental choice — for instance, some people choose to stop having children once they have both boys and girls.\n\nThe team also found that women aged 29 or older when they had their first child had a 13% higher chance of giving birth to only male or only female children than did women younger than 23.\n\nThe authors note that changes in vaginal pH as women age could explain this phenomenon. For instance, the changes could influence the sex of the child by affecting whether sperm carrying the X chromosome or the Y chromosome are more successful at fertilizing the egg, says Polyakov.\n\nGenetic influence\n\nA genomic analysis also showed that some women had one of two common genetic variants that were associated with having children of a particular sex. A change in chromosome 10, in a gene called NSUN6, was associated with a higher probability of having only girls, whereas women with a change in a single DNA letter on chromosome 18, near a gene called TSHZ1, were more likely to have only boys.",

Researchers in LMICs often have limited funds, lack trained technicians and have difficulties in recruiting participants.\n\nWhat’s so special about the human brain? A graphical guide\n\nTo address some of these problems, researchers trained non-specialists in each country — 12 people in Tanzania, 12 in India — to record the brain’s electrical activity using portable headsets fitted with 16 electrodes that are placed on the scalp, a technique known as electroencephalography (EEG). Over 30 weeks, the trainees collected data from a wide range of people in their countries with different lifestyles and socio-economic backgrounds, ranging from urban office workers to members of Tanzania’s Hadzabe hunter-gatherer group. Participants also responded to surveys about factors including their medical history, mental health, sleep, diet, lifestyle and use of technology. The study describes recordings from 3,413 people in India and 2,418 people in Tanzania.\n\nEEG recordings “offer the opportunity to look very easily across diverse populations, because it’s a technique that’s portable, it’s cost efficient, it doesn’t take a huge amount of time”, says co-author Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs, a non-profit neuroscience centre based in Arlington, Virginia. The information collected in the study will allow researchers to explore “how the environment impacts the population’s brain physiology, and how diversity of brain physiology relates to different kind of mental outcomes”, she adds.",

When successfully implemented, employees are better off (with the same salary and more leisure time) and there is no reduction in employers’ output1.

Then, using two large datasets, we demonstrate that BEAST-GB predicts more accurately than neural networks trained on extensive data and dozens of existing behavioural models. BEAST-GB also generalizes robustly across unseen experimental contexts, surpassing direct empirical generalization, and helps to refine and improve the behavioural theory itself. Our analyses highlight the potential of anchoring predictions on behavioural theory even in data-rich settings and even when the theory alone falters. Our results underscore how integrating machine learning with theoretical frameworks, especially those—like BEAST—designed for prediction, can improve our ability to predict and understand human behaviour.",

Classifications of ‘male’ or ‘female’ occupations are shaped by required skills, whereas distinctions between ‘White’ and ‘Black’ occupations reflect socio-economic status and historical inequalities. Women and men are segmented by gender-associated skill sets, such as engineering versus caregiving skills. Within these skill sets, strong hierarchical segregation persists, with Black individuals disproportionately concentrated in positions of lower socio-economic status. Despite recent socio-economic changes, occupational specialization patterns have remained stable.

Phasic activations corresponding to speech production and auditory feedback were observed, but also sustained neural activity that persisted throughout all task phases including the target presentation, the delay period and production of the sequence. Furthermore, sustained activity in a specific area, the middle precentral gyrus (mPrCG), was both modulated by sequence complexity and predicted reaction time, suggesting a role in speech-motor sequencing. Electrocortical stimulation of the mPrCG caused speech disfluencies resembling those seen in apraxia of speech.

          "abstract": "The neurophysiological mechanisms supporting brain maturation are fundamental to attention and memory capacity across the lifespan. Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analysed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (that is, attention to to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93–54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5,691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of neural noise, where steeper slopes indicate less noise and flatter slopes indicate more noise. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in grey matter volume are similarly associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.",

          "abstract": "Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at a remarkable scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: In lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual’s tenure year. Overall, these findings provide an empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.",

          "abstract": "Cellular DNA is wrapped about an octamer composed of four histone proteins forming the fundamental unit of chromatin structure, the nucleosome core particle (NCP). The intrinsically disordered tails of the histones serve as scaffolds for binding an array of proteins that regulate the fidelity of the genome and gene expression. A variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the tails have been characterized, including some that alter their overall charge; however, per-residue changes in tail electrostatic potentials for different PTMs have not been reported. Here, using a solution NMR approach in which enhancements of transverse relaxation rates of tail amide and methyl group protons are quantified through the addition of paramagnetic cosolutes, we examine how acetylation and PARylation modulate histone tail electrostatic potentials. Notably, even though both PTMs decrease the net positive charge carried by each tail, their electrostatic potentials either increase or decrease in a tail-specific manner relative to an unmodified NCP. A simple model of tail–DNA interactions is presented to explain these results.",

          "abstract": "As a key passivation film that governs battery operation, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has long been credited for enabling high-performance batteries or blamed for their eventual death. However, qualitative descriptions of the SEI often found in the literature (e.g., “conductive,” “passivating”) highlight our incomplete understanding of this layer, where even the most basic properties foundational to SEI function remain difficult to measure. Here, we quantify SEI conductivities and SEI transference numbers using a separator-free Cu|SEI|Li architecture that treats the SEI as a functional solid-state electrolyte (SSE). We find that while any SEI property alone (e.g., electronic conductivity) is weakly correlated (R 2 &lt; 0.67) with battery performance (e.g., Coulombic efficiency), a strong correlation (R 2 &gt; 0.99) can be achieved by defining the “SEI cT number” as a product between the SEI transference number ( T ) and the ratio of SEI conductivities ( c ). Analogous to the thermoelectric figure of merit (i.e., zT ), SEI cT quantitatively benchmarks the holistic impact of SEI properties on battery performance and underscores the pitfalls of citing such properties in isolation. Perhaps most strikingly, we demonstrate that Li metal deposition and stripping at room temperature is possible in our separator-free Cu|SEI|Li cell, confirming that the SEI can function precisely as an SSE. Together, these results enrich our understanding of the SEI, not just as a passivation layer but as a functional structure that can potentially have important implications for solid-state batteries.",

          "abstract": "Barrier tissues such as the intestine are constantly challenged by environmental stressors and must adapt to maintain integrity and prevent excessive inflammation. Although traditionally viewed as a proinflammatory effector of interferon (IFN) signaling, STAT1 is shown here to play a protective role in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) by promoting resilience to damage and restraining IFN-induced cytotoxicity. We identify phosphorylation of threonine 748 (Thr748) on STAT1 as an evolutionarily selected adaptation—highly conserved between humans and mice—that reciprocally regulates IEC integrity and IFN responsiveness. Mice expressing a phospho-deficient T748A Stat1 mutant exhibit severe colitis-induced tissue damage comparable to Stat1-deficient littermates, underscoring the critical role of Thr748 phosphorylation in mediating Stat1-driven protection during intestinal inflammation. Bone marrow transfer experiments further demonstrate that this protective effect is nonhematopoietic. Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that Thr748 phosphorylation modulates STAT1 DNA binding, directly activates the Itgb4 promoter, and enhances integrin β4 expression in IEC following inflammation. In intestinal organoid models, gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Thr748 phosphorylation drives integrin β4 expression and epithelial resilience independently of IFN-induced Tyrosine 701 (Tyr701) phosphorylation. In contrast, IFN stimulation via Tyr701 induces Zbp1—a cytotoxic nucleic acid sensor—while repressing integrin β4, resulting in epithelial injury that is mitigated by Thr748 phosphorylation. Together, these findings reveal a modular architecture of STAT1 signaling in which Thr748 phosphorylation functions as a molecular rheostat that safeguards epithelial integrity while tempering IFN-driven cytotoxic responses.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the drivers of spatial patterns in fossil communities is fundamental to paleoecology, yet direct evidence for biological mechanisms regulating interindividual spacing remains elusive. Brachiopod setae, hypothesized to function in feeding or defense, are exceedingly rare in the fossil record, especially among post-Cambrian taxa. Here, we present the report of exquisitely preserved setae from an exceptional in situ fossil assemblage of the early Silurian rhynchonelliform brachiopod Nucleospira calypta . Multiproxy analyses (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and microcomputed tomography) revealed intricate ultrastructural details and diverse taphonomic pathways, leading to a reinterpretation of apparent calcitic preservation as primarily iron oxides with subsequent coating. Critically, the undisturbed nature of this aggregation allowed rigorous spatial point pattern analysis (Nearest-Neighbor Analysis, Thiessen polygons). This revealed a statistically significant, nonrandom, checkerboard-like distribution among individuals within the studied fossil deposit, indicative of active spacing regulation. Strikingly, the measured average interindividual spacing quantitatively relates to the length of the preserved setae. This provides the direct paleontological evidence demonstrating that these subtle morphological structures could have actively mediated spatial organization within a dense benthic community. Our findings illustrate a biological mechanism capable of shaping community structure, operating beyond passive environmental constraints or initial larval settlement preferences, and highlight the potential for subtle anatomical features to exert significant ecological influence in deep time.",

The causative gene TMEM63A encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel whose role in myelination is largely unexplored. Our study shows that TMEM63A is a major regulator of oligodendrocyte (OL)-dependent myelination in the CNS. In mouse and zebrafish, Tmem63a inactivation led to early deficits in myelination, recapitulating the HLD19 phenotype. OL-specific conditional mouse knockouts of Tmem63a exhibited transient reductions in myelin, indicating that TMEM63A regulates myelination cell-autonomously. We show that TMEM63A is present at the plasma membrane and on lysosomes and modulates myelin production in the presence of mechanical cues. Intriguingly, HLD19-associated TMEM63A variants from patients blocked trafficking to cell membrane. Together, our results reveal an ancient role for TMEM63A in fundamental aspects of myelination in vivo and highlight two exciting models for the development of treatments for devastating hypomyelinating leukodystrophies.",

          "abstract": "Most breast cancers depend on hormone-stimulated estrogen receptor alpha (ER) activity and are sensitive to ER inhibition. Resistance can arise from activating mutations in the gene encoding ER ( ESR1 ) or from reactivation of downstream targets. Newer ER antagonists occasionally show efficacy but are largely ineffective as single agents in the long term. Here, we show that ER translation is eIF4E/cap-independent yet sensitive to inhibitors of the translation initiation factor eIF4A. EIF4A inhibition reduces the expression of ER and cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1. This leads to growth suppression in ligand-independent breast cancer models, including those driven by ER mutants and fusion proteins. Efficacy is enhanced by adding the ER degrader, fulvestrant. The combination further lowers ER expression and blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In an early clinical trial (NCT04092673), the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin was combined with either fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus CDK4 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in patients with acquired resistance to these agents. Multiple clinical responses including a handful of durable regressions were observed, with little toxicity. Thus, eIF4A inhibition could be useful for treating ER+ breast cancer resistant to other modalities.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten many wildlife populations, yet the impacts of pathogens vary considerably both within and among host species. The environmental tolerance mismatch hypothesis (ETMH) suggests that this variability stems in part from differences in the relative performance of hosts and pathogens under varying environmental conditions. According to the ETMH, pathogen impacts should be more severe in environments where pathogen performance is high and host performance is low, and vice versa. However, testing the ETMH with field data is challenging due to the difficulty of measuring host and pathogen performance among locations and quantifying performance mismatches. Here, we demonstrate that a measure of thermal mismatch, based on species realized thermal niches derived from species occurrence data, can reliably predict variation in the prevalence of the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd—chytrid fungus) within and among 42 frog host species in Australia. Specifically, we show that 1) within species, more warm-adapted host species show a steeper decline in Bd prevalence with increasing mean annual temperature, potentially reflecting greater host advantage at warmer temperatures; and 2) among host species, mean pathogen prevalence declines as the thermal affinity of hosts diverges from that of the pathogen. Our findings strongly support the ETMH and, importantly, offer a promising approach to predicting pathogen outcomes both spatially and temporally using species occurrence data. This approach enhances our understanding of variability in pathogen impacts and could inform management actions to mitigate these effects.",

          "abstract": "Biota could be ecosystem engineers in generating an intrinsic heterogeneous landscape through scale-dependent feedbacks. Thereby, they can form resource-enriched patchiness or islands of fertility, comprising self-organizing spatial patterns. Research so far has largely focused on the self-organized spatial patterns of plant communities in drylands. It, however, remains unclear whether and how biocrusts having distinct morphology and life history from plant communities could self-organize themselves and form unique spatial patterns. Here, we conducted field observations of biocrusts across successional stages and employed a probabilistic cellular automaton model to investigate the distinct self-organized spatial patterns exhibited by mosaic patches of mosses and lichens with different patch size distributions (PSDs). Our study demonstrates that short-range positive feedbacks initially promote the development of patches, featured with a heavy-tailed PSD, while long-range negative feedbacks subsequently curtail further expansion of big patches, thereby establishing a characteristic patch scale with regular PSDs. Strikingly, only lichens reverted back to the heavy-tailed PSD in the late succession stage, presumably implying self-organized critical fragmentation of lichen patches. Field measurements of biocrust performance at the center and edge of patches of varying sizes along succession stages further support the classic scale-dependent feedback mechanism for Turing pattern formation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate the capability of the biocrust communities to self-organize themselves to form distinct spatial patterns governed by the spatial and temporal scale–dependent feedbacks, potentially impacting dryland ecosystem functions and resilience.",

In two functional MRI (fMRI) studies, participants were scanned during an episodic future thinking task in which they were presented with a series of episodic scenarios with different emotional valence and prompted to imagine themself (or their partner) in the situation. Intersubject representational similarity analysis revealed that more optimistic individuals had similar neural representations in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while less optimistic individuals exhibited more idiosyncratic neural representations in the MPFC. Additionally, individual difference multidimensional scaling of MPFC activity revealed that the referential target and emotional valence of imagined events were clearly mapped onto different dimensions. Notably, the weights along the emotional dimension were closely linked to the optimism scores of participants, suggesting that optimistic individuals imagine positive events as more distinct from negative events. These results suggest that shared neural processing of the MPFC among optimistic individuals supports episodic future thinking that facilitates psychological differentiation between positive and negative future events.",

          "abstract": "The self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins into biomolecular condensates depends on their primary sequence, leading to sequence-dependent phase separation. Computational methods to study this behavior often rely on residue-level interaction potentials that estimate the propensity of amino acids to partition between the dilute and dense phases. While distribution coefficients would provide the most direct measure of these potentials, their unavailability has led to the use of proxies, most notably, hydropathy. However, recent studies have highlighted limitations in hydropathy-based models. Here, we address this fundamental gap by calculating the transfer free energies for amino acid side chain analogs moving from the dilute phase to the dense phase of biomolecular condensates. We find that, net transfer free energies arise from a balance between favorable protein-mediated and unfavorable water-mediated interactions, with a striking asymmetry between the contributions of positive and negatively charged residues. This asymmetry originates from the stronger solvation of negatively charged species, and extends to modified amino acids. We further demonstrate that the sequence features of the condensate-forming protein modulate these transfer free energies in a context-dependent, but qualitatively similar manner. These findings help explain nontrivial experimental trends and provide a foundation for interpreting the sequence-dependent driving forces underlying condensate formation.",

          "abstract": "Land-use changes are reshaping the distribution of aboveground species worldwide. However, the impact of land-use changes on the distribution of soil organisms remains poorly understood. In particular, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors reshaping the distribution of soil microbiota in response to global biological homogenization. Here, we used metabarcoding to investigate the biogeography of protists and their relationships with prey and hosts in three human-dominated ecosystem types, i.e., farmlands, residential areas, and parks, along with natural forests, in subtropical and temperate climatic regions across China. We found that human land-use systems extended the distribution range of habitat-generalist protists compared to forests. This human-facilitated spread of protists was highly directional and mainly driven by temperate to subtropical range expansion of soil taxa. Put simply, increases in soil pH associated with human land uses mitigate the natural acidity barrier typically found in subtropical ecosystems, facilitating the temperate to subtropical range expansion of protist species. However, in temperate regions, the northward expansion of subtropical species is likely restricted by a more arid climate with even higher soil pH. The cross-region spread of soil protists was more pronounced in phagotrophs than phototrophs and parasites, reflecting codispersal of phagotroph protists and microbial prey (especially bacteria) related to tight predator–prey specialization and/or similar responses to environmental changes. Our findings indicate that land-use changes create hotspots of potential microbial invasions, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, highlighting that understudied regions are likely to be strongly affected by biological homogenization related to introduction of exotic species.",

          "abstract": "The link between form and function of an organism’s morphology is usually apparent or intuitive. However, some clades of organisms show remarkable diversity in their form, often exhibiting extreme morphologies, but with no obvious functional explanation. Treehoppers (Membracidae) are a family of insects that exemplify this, displaying an astounding morphological diversity, resulting in a plethora of extreme forms. The function of these morphological extremities and the reasons for their evolution have thus far remained largely enigmatic. However, this mystery can be considered in light of the capacity of many animals to detect electric fields in air via electrostatic actuation of mechanosensory structures on their body. Importantly, the strength of the electric field experienced by these mechanosensory structures is expected by physics to depend on the animal’s geometry, with sharp and elongated features producing the highest electric fields. Therefore, we hypothesize that the extreme morphologies of treehoppers increase their electrical sensitivity. Here, we show that treehoppers, along with their predators and mutualists, produce electric fields and that the treehopper Poppea capricornis can detect electric fields, responding behaviorally. We also demonstrate that predatory wasps and mutualist bees differ significantly in their electrostatic profiles, pointing to the sophistication of electrical information potentially available to treehoppers. Biophysical, computational, and mathematical techniques are then utilized to provide evidence that the pronotum of treehoppers is the site of electroreception and that its extreme shapes may enhance its sensitivity to electricity.",

Much less is known about the extent to which these novel crops were consumed and incorporated into everyday culinary practices. In Japan, agriculturalists moving from Korea would have encountered large, sedentary Final Jomon populations who had well-established hunting, foraging, and cultivation strategies for exploiting indigenous fauna and flora. The degree to which these encounters hindered or enhanced the emergence of agriculture is a key question. To investigate potential changes in food exploitation, we analyzed the contents of pottery through lipid residue analysis of 260 vessels from Bronze Age (Mumun) Korea and contemporary Jomon and Yayoi pottery from Northern Kyushu. A lipid biomarker for broomcorn millet was only found in samples from Korea, suggesting that this crop was not routinely prepared in early agricultural pottery from Japan, despite some botanical evidence for its cultivation. Instead, aquatic products continued to be used in early agricultural pottery, pointing to continuity from the Jomon period despite the arrival of new “continental” ceramic forms. Rice remains difficult to identify conclusively, but by modeling carbon isotope values, we were able to determine the maximum extent that rice may have contributed.

          "abstract": "Aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), exhibits enhanced mechanical properties due to crystal defects such as twins, which are particularly prevalent in biogenic aragonite and can inhibit crack propagation. Despite the importance, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of aragonite {110} twins in marine organisms have remained poorly understood. Identifying a key inducer for {110} twins could help us understand how crystal defects are controlled in biomineralization. In this study, we explore the role of a protein, twip1, in inducing a high density of {110} twins within the aragonite layers of the limpet Cellana rota shell. Through a combination of layer-specific protein profiling and in vitro aragonite binding assays, twip1 is identified as a potential protein preferentially binding to the aragonite (110) plane. Gene expression analysis via quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that twip1 is specifically expressed in the mantle tissue. To further investigate its function, recombinant twip1 (rtwip1) is produced using an Escherichia coli expression system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy observations reveal that rtwip1 significantly increases {110} twin density during in vitro aragonite synthesis. Moreover, in vivo knockdown shows that reducing twip1 expression results in abnormal shell growth and {110} twin boundary reduction. Enhancing the formation of {110} twins in aragonite can improve its toughness and elasticity. This research highlights the crucial role of specific proteins in regulating crystal defect formation, offering a promising direction for future biomineralization studies and advanced material design.",

          "abstract": "Removal of dead and damaged cells is critical for organismal health. Under stress conditions such as nutritional deprivation, infection, or temperature shift, the clearance of nonessential cells becomes a universal strategy to conserve energy and maintain tissue homeostasis. Typically, this task is performed by professional phagocytes such as macrophages. However, nonprofessional phagocytes (NPPs) can also adopt a phagocytic fate under specific circumstances. Similar to professional phagocytes, NPPs undergo transitions from immature to mature states and activation, but the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms governing their maturation, induction, and phagocytic execution remain largely unknown. A notable example of stress-induced phagocytosis is the removal of germline cells by follicle cell–derived NPPs during oogenesis in Drosophila . In this study, we report that the transformation of follicle cells (FCs) into NPPs is dependent on Notch signaling activation during mid-oogenesis. Moreover, Notch overactivation is sufficient to trigger germline cell death and clearance (GDAC). We further show that polyploidy, driven by Notch signaling-induced endoreplication, is essential for the transformation of FCs into NPPs. Polyploidy facilitates the activation of JNK signaling, which is crucial for the phagocytic behavior of these cells. Additionally, we show that polyploidy in epidermal cells, another type of NPPs, is important for their engulfment of dendrites during induced degeneration. Together, these findings suggest that polyploidy is a critical factor in the transformation of epithelial cells into NPPs, enabling their phagocytic functions, which are essential for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis during stress conditions.",

          "abstract": "Ras has traditionally been regarded as a positive regulator and therapeutic target due to its role in cell proliferation, but recent findings indicate a more nuanced role in cell migration, where suppressed Ras activity can unexpectedly promote migration. To clarify this complexity, we systematically modulate Ras activity using various RasGEF and RasGAP proteins and assess their effects on migration dynamics. Leveraging optogenetics, we assess the immediate, nontranscriptional effects of Ras signaling on migration. Local RasGEF recruitment to the plasma membrane induces protrusions and new fronts to effectively guide migration, even in the absence of GPCR/G-protein signaling, whereas global recruitment causes immediate cell spreading halting cell migration. Local RasGAP recruitment suppresses protrusions, generates new backs, and repels cells, whereas global relocation either eliminates all protrusions to inhibit migration or preserves a single protrusion to maintain polarity. Consistent local and global increases or decreases in signal transduction and cytoskeletal activities accompany these morphological changes. Additionally, we performed cortical tension measurements and found that Ras activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors generally increase cortical tension while Ras activity is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins decrease it. Our results reveal a biphasic relationship between Ras activity and cellular dynamics, reinforcing our previous findings that optimal Ras activity and cortical tension are critical for efficient migration.",

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we characterized the brain’s response to critical in-game events, focusing on the response magnitude and adaptation. Data from a large participant cohort (n = 140 for game tasks, n = 200 for nongame tasks) revealed a clear, definite, and consistent temporospatial structure of brain response patterns triggered by critical in-game events. Most notably, this response displayed unusually large magnitudes and a lack of adaptation over repeated exposures—markedly different from the observed neural responses to typical events in lab-based tasks (e.g., regarding novelty, unexpected events or errors). The identification of this distinctive response component in gaming contexts may inspire further research into fundamental cognitive systems, such as motivation, reward, emotional engagement, and their dynamic interplay in gaming environments.",

          "authors": "James B. Dewey",
          "abstract": "Mammalian hearing sensitivity depends on the amplification of sound-induced cochlear vibrations by outer hair cells (OHCs). OHCs transduce deflections of their stereociliary bundles into receptor potentials that drive changes in cell length. While fast, phasic OHC length changes are thought to generate the forces that underlie cochlear amplification, OHCs also exhibit large tonic length changes in response to sound. These tonic length changes could theoretically arise from asymmetries in the mechanotransduction process that lead to tonic changes in membrane potential, though their exact origins and functional significance are uncertain. Here, in vivo cochlear vibration measurements reveal that sound can elicit tonic OHC motility in mice with stereociliary defects that eliminate cochlear amplification and presumably impair mechanotransduction. Tonic OHC motility in impaired mice was physiologically vulnerable but only weakly correlated with any residual phasic motility, suggesting a possible dissociation between the underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, a simple model demonstrates how realistic changes to the OHC mechanotransducer function in impaired mice can lead to small but strongly asymmetric receptor potentials, producing sizable tonic length changes in the absence of any detectable phasic motility. Tonic OHC motility is therefore not a unique feature of sensitive ears and is the dominant active mechanical response in ears with certain types of deafness. Whether such tonic responses play a functional role in the normal or impaired cochlea remains to be determined.",

          "abstract": "Polyphenic traits in animals often exhibit nonlinear scaling with body size. Static allometries (i.e., scaling relationships) themselves can exhibit plasticity, such that individuals of the same size and genotype differ in body proportions across different environments. In ants, both larval environment and genotype regulate the expression of caste-associated traits, including body size and ovariole number. However, it remains untested whether caste-associated traits are independently regulated by environmental variables or whether they covary due to coupled developmental mechanisms. If caste traits are regulated independently, developmental plasticity should affect both trait expression and the scaling relationships between traits. Using the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi , we tested this by manipulating the rearing environment of genetically identical larvae. We found that caregiver genotype, temperature, and food quantity influenced caste morphology strictly in tandem with body size, producing similar static allometries across rearing conditions (i.e., no allometric plasticity was detected). In contrast, clonal genotypes differed in average body size and their static allometries. Thus, size-matched individuals of the same genotype from different rearing environments exhibited no differences in mean caste trait expression, while those of different genotypes did. This absence of plasticity in the static allometries of different caste traits suggests that they are developmentally coupled due to systemic regulatory factors. Our findings contrast with reports of allometric plasticity in other insects, suggesting that ant caste traits are exceptionally integrated and therefore constrained in their independent responses to environmental variation. We discuss how these results inform contemporary hypotheses for ant caste development and evolution.",

          "abstract": "8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), the most frequent form of oxidative-DNA-base lesion caused by ROS, is recognized and repaired by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) through base excision repair (BER) pathway. Beyond its role in DNA repair, OGG1 has been shown to promote transcriptional activation of proinflammatory mediators and contribute to both acute and chronic lung inflammation. However, pioneering studies have shown an anti-inflammation role for OGG1 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we unveiled that OGG1 plays an important role in the differentiation of inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs). Binding of OGG1 to 8-oxoG facilitated the recruitment of Smad3 to the Foxp3 promoter, leading to the transcriptional activation. Moreover, OGG1 binding promoted demethylation of CpG sites in the conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2) region of Foxp3 by decreasing Dnmt1 occupancy and enhancing recruitment of Tet1/2. Notably, the S326C variant—a naturally occurring polymorphism in humans—was more effective than the wild-type protein in promoting iTreg differentiation and showed a negative correlation with IBD incidence. Furthermore, treatment with O8, a selective OGG1 inhibitor that blocks base excision activity without affecting substrate binding, significantly alleviated IBD in a mouse model, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy. Together, these findings extend the understanding of OGG1’s epigenetic role in transcriptional regulation and highlight its protective function in inflammatory diseases, potentially shaped by aerobic evolution.",

Here, we report the growth of spontaneously bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals induced by the keto–enol tautomerism of the urate molecule. The major tautomer is native to biogenic crystals, whereas the minor tautomer functions as an effective crystal growth modifier to induce naturally bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals. We show that the degree of curvature can be tailored based on the judicious selection of growth conditions. A combination of state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy techniques are used to characterize the origin of bending. Spatially resolved nano-electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy of naturally bent crystals show nearly single crystallinity with local lattice deformations generated by a combination of screw and edge dislocations. These observations are consistent with photoinduced force microscopy and contact resonance atomic force microscopy, which confirmed spatially resolved changes in the intermolecular interactions and the mechanical properties throughout the cross-sectional and axial regions of bent crystals. A mechanism of bending involving the generation of regionally specific dislocations is proposed as an alternative to more commonly reported models. These findings highlight a unique characteristic of tautomeric crystals that may have broader implications for other biogenic materials.",

Within these communities, polymer degraders facilitate the growth of nondegraders by breaking down polymers through extracellular enzymes. However, the contributions of nondegraders to community dynamics, as well as the mechanisms that limit their access to degradation products, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate EMSD5, a lignocellulose-degrading microbial community that efficiently converts corncob into isopropanol. We demonstrate that nondegraders, such as Escherichia coli , enable the growth of degraders (e.g., Lachnoclostridium sp. and Clostridium beijerinckii ) by creating anaerobic conditions and supplying biotin. Within such expanded niches, lignocellulose degradation proceeds sequentially, and the availability of breakdown products to E . coli is constrained by two interlinked processes. Specifically, Lachnoclostridium sp. produces oligosaccharides that are largely inaccessible to E . coli . A subset of these oligosaccharides is utilized by C . beijerinckii to produce monosaccharides that support E . coli growth, while glycosidase secretion by C . beijerinckii is reduced under coculture conditions. Building on these findings, we designed a synthetic consortium by coculturing C. beijerinckii with an engineered E . coli strain that expresses xylanase genes from an unculturable Lachnoclostridium . This consortium achieved isopropanol production from hemicellulose without requiring anaerobic conditions. Our findings reveal the niche-expanding role of nondegraders and the processes that constrain their access to degradation products, offering insights into maintaining stable cooperation in biopolymer-degrading communities and designing efficient consortia for biopolymer conversion.",

These enzymes oxidize aldehydes to the corresponding acids while reducing the redox protein ferredoxin. They have been structurally characterized mainly using WORs from hyperthermophilic archaea. The WORs of some bacteria contain three additional subunits of the BfuABC family and these chimeric WorABCSL enzymes catalyze an electron-bifurcating reaction in which aldehyde oxidation is coupled to the simultaneous reduction of ferredoxin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In human gut microbes, electron bifurcation by WorABSL is proposed to enable the detoxification of aldehydes generated from cooked foods and in the tungstocentric production of beneficial short chain fatty acids from lactate, potentially impacting health. Herein we present the high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the WorABCSL purified from the bacterium Acetomicrobium mobile. The structure reveals a surprising 1:3 stoichiometry between WorABC and WorSL, with the WorSL units forming a nanowire-like architecture leading from three Tuco-containing catalytic sites in WorL via strings of multiple iron-sulfur clusters in WorS to a single bifurcating WorABC core.

In roots, cell elongation executes the movement of the root tips through the soil. This process is tightly controlled by numerous signaling pathways. Among these, gibberellin and auxin signaling stand out for their contrasting effects on root growth, interacting through complex cross talk at multiple regulatory levels. Here, we reveal the molecular basis of the auxin–gibberellin cross talk in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . We show that the auxin signaling pathway steers the expression of GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASES (GA2OXs) , key gibberellin-deactivating enzymes in the root elongation zone (EZ). GA2OXs are negative regulators of root cell elongation; GA2OX8 overexpression decreases gibberellin levels and inhibits root cell elongation; in contrast, the ga2ox heptuple mutant roots show elevated gibberellin levels in the EZ and grow longer roots. Intriguingly, shoot-derived auxin can regulate GA2OX6 and GA2OX8 expression in roots, linking systemic auxin signaling to local gibberellin level modulation. Together, our findings identify GA2OX6 and GA2OX8 enzymes as key mediators of auxin–gibberellin cross talk, providing insights into their roles in root elongation. These results expand our understanding of how auxin integrates with gibberellin signaling to coordinate root development and growth dynamics.",

Here, we show that forest disturbance due to fire is growing globally, with the most dramatic increases in intact forest landscapes, highlighting an existential threat to remaining high biomass, high biodiversity forests. The global annual area of forest disturbance due to fire for 2023 and 2024 was highest since the beginning of monitoring in 2001. Compared to 2002–2022 average annual forest disturbance due to fire, the 2023–2024 average was 2.2 times higher globally and 3 times higher in the Tropics. More than ¼ of all 2024 forest disturbance from fire occurred in tropical forests. We found a statistically significant increasing trend of forest disturbance due to fire from 2002 to 2024 in all climate domains except Subtropical. High forest, low deforestation tropical countries were not exempt, with Guyana and the Republic of the Congo experiencing record forest disturbance due to fire. Our results agree with recently estimated increases in global forest fire emissions and active fire detections. The unprecedented scale of fires in the world’s most remote forests is a potential harbinger of ecosystem tipping points. Protecting these remaining unfragmented high conservation value forests from this threat poses a daunting and as yet undeveloped policy and capacity challenge.",

          "abstract": "Central memory CD8 + T cells (T cm ) represent the prominent memory T cell subset in human blood, yet the persistence of T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypic and transcriptional features of epitope-specific T cm pools across the human lifespan remains unknown. We analyzed T cm CD8 + T cells specific for HLA-A*02:01-M1 58–66 (A2/M1 58 ; a prominent influenza epitope) in newborns, children, adults, and older adults directly ex vivo. Our data provide evidence that epitope-specific T cm CD8 + pools dominate influenza-specific memory A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cell responses from the early childhood until old age. T cm gene signatures were largely maintained across the age groups, although self-renewal genes defined T cm pools in children, while older adult T cm A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cells displayed detoxication and stress profiles. TCRαβ diversity within T cm A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cell pools was greater in children and older adults, when compared to adults. The key public-associated TCRαβ clonotypes largely persisted across the human lifespan, although their highest frequency was detected in adults, reflecting lower TCRαβ diversity in this group. Older adults displayed increased TCRαβ heterogeneity, underpinned by large TCRαβ clonotype expansions of private TCRαβ clonotypes. Our study highlights the importance of largely preserved virus-specific T cm pools across the human lifespan and advocates for boosting persistent TCRαβ clonotypes within this key peripheral blood subset.",

          "abstract": "Sex determination has been investigated across vertebrate lineages to reveal the stepwise evolution of sex chromosomes and the diversity of responsible molecular mechanisms. However, these studies rarely include cartilaginous fishes, which diverged from the other vertebrates 450 Mya, hindering the comprehensive view of vertebrate sex determination. Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerated Y chromosome harboring no detectable male-specific genes. Orthologs of documented sex-determining genes were identified, but not on these sex chromosomes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expression of X-linked genes—including those implicated in the TGF-β and IGF signaling pathways—attributed to incomplete dosage compensation. Our findings indicate that sharks and rays share the oldest sex chromosomes among vertebrates that originated around 300 Mya and the dosage-dependent sex determination mechanism composed of distinct molecules from other vertebrates. This study highlights the antiquity of sex chromosomes and the uniqueness of sex determination mechanisms in sharks and rays, which advances our understanding of evolutionary plasticity in vertebrate sex determination.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit a remarkable resilience to cytotoxic stress, often adapting through transcriptional changes linked to alterations in chromatin structure. In several types of cancer, these adaptations involve epigenetic modifications and restructuring of topologically associating domains. However, the underlying principles by which chromatin architecture facilitates such adaptability across different cancers remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of chromatin in this process, we developed a physics-based model that connects chromatin organization to cell fate decisions, such as survival following chemotherapy. Our model builds on the observation that chromatin forms packing domains, which influence transcriptional activity through macromolecular crowding. The model accurately predicts chemoevasion in vitro, suggesting that changes in packing domains affect the likelihood of survival. Consistent results across diverse cancer types indicate that the model captures fundamental principles of chromatin-mediated adaptation, independent of the specific cancer or chemotherapy mechanisms involved. Based on these insights, we hypothesized that compounds capable of modulating packing domains, termed Transcriptional Plasticity Regulators (TPRs), could prevent cellular adaptation to chemotherapy. We conducted a proof-of-concept compound screen using live-cell chromatin imaging to identify several TPRs that synergistically enhanced chemotherapy-induced cell death. The most effective TPR significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in a patient-derived xenograft model of ovarian cancer. These findings underscore the central role of chromatin in cellular adaptation to cytotoxic stress and present a framework for enhancing cancer therapies, with broad potential across multiple cancer types.",

          "abstract": "Aging induces substantial structural and functional decline in the retina, yet the molecular drivers of this process remain elusive. In this study, we used heterochronic parabiosis (HP) combined with single-cell RNA sequencing to generate comprehensive transcriptomic profiles of murine retinas from young, aged, and HP pairs, aiming to identify antiaging targets. Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging. Mechanistically, AdipoR1-AMPK activation promoted mitochondrial function, contributing to the restoration of youthful cellular phenotypes. Together, our study identifies AdipoR1 as a therapeutic target for retinal aging and provides insights into the molecular programs driving retinal rejuvenation.",

Flow cytometry and in vitro cytokine responses were used to characterize immune profiles from 93 school-aged twin pairs. Using an established twin pair analytical strategy, the genetic and environmental influences on immunological traits were evaluated, along with their association with atopy. Our findings suggest strong genetic influence on several traits, particularly B cell abundance. In contrast, cytokine responses from in vitro stimulations appeared mainly shaped by environmental exposures. Regarding associations with atopy, greater abundance of both B cells and basophils were observed in atopic individuals as well as increased expression of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor. Genetic influence appeared central to regulating IgE receptor expression on basophils, whereas expression on dendritic cells instead appeared sensitive to environmental exposures.

We investigate the design of a compliant mechanism based on nonlinear mechanics and its mechanical integration with a muscle ring and motor neurons. We find that within a range of anchor stiffnesses around 1 micronewton per micrometer, the homeostatic tension in muscle is insensitive to stiffness, offering greater design flexibility. The proximity of motor neurons results in a fourfold improvement in muscle contractility. Improved contractility and nonlinear design allow for a peak swimming speed about two orders of magnitude higher than previous biohybrid flagellate swimmers, reaching 0.58 body lengths per minute (86.8 micrometers per second), by a mechanism involving inertia that we verify through flow field imaging. This swimmer opens the door for a class of intermediate–Reynolds number swimmers.",

This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8 + T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency. These results indicate that metabolic adaptation to MYC inhibition exposes a targetable weakness at complex I and provide a rational strategy for combination therapy with emerging MYC inhibitors.",

We demonstrated that a Notch signaling center is required for the formation of this novelty and identified enhancers of the ligand Delta , which allowed us to track the evolutionary history of this signaling center. Unexpectedly, we found that the posterior lobe signaling center emerged from a preexisting role in genital disc eversion. We provide a likely mechanism by which Delta contributes to genital eversion through a network of apical extracellular matrix, which also became integrated into the posterior lobe program. This work demonstrates that novelties may be formed in the context of already complex developmental processes, by appending new roles to preexisting signals.",

Traditional methods, such as electromyography, cannot measure passive muscle contraction states, while optical and ultrasonic techniques suffer from motion artifacts due to their rigid transducers. To overcome these limitations, we developed a flexible multichannel electrical impedance sensor (FMEIS) for noninvasive detection of skeletal muscle contractions. By applying an imperceptible current, the FMEIS can target multiple deep muscles by capturing electric-field ripples generated by their contractions. With an ultrathin profile (~220 micrometers), a low elastic modulus (212.8 kilopascals) closely matching human skin, and engineered adhesive sensor surfaces, the FMEIS conforms nicely to human skin with minimized motion artifacts. The FMEIS achieved high accuracy in both hand gesture recognition and muscle force prediction using machine learning models. With demonstrated performance across multiple HMI applications, including human-robot collaboration, exoskeleton control, and virtual surgery, FMEIS shows great potential for future real-time collaborative HMI systems.",

To overcome the low data writing rate in the conventional systems, we present a parallel five-dimensional optical data writing method by projecting arrays of depth-resolved voxels of different shapes via a digital micromirror device and temporally focusing a femtosecond laser amplifier. This is more efficient than the conventional approach that serially creates birefringent voxels in glass (e.g., nanogratings or oblate nanopores) via scanning an ultrafast laser while varying its polarizations. We demonstrated parallel writing of 16 by 16 birefringent voxels with eight different slow-axis azimuths by controlling the shapes of the projected light spots. Next, we demonstrated five-layer parallel data writing with 100% readout accuracy and a 1.5-terabyte storage capacity per disc.

Using a proximity labeling approach, we found that osmotic stress promotes the association of WNK1 with the NRBP1 pseudokinase and TSC22D2/4 adaptor proteins, results that are confirmed by immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting studies. NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components. We demonstrate that recombinant NRBP1 can directly induce the activation of WNK4 in vitro. AlphaFold-3 modeling predicts that WNK1, SPAK, NRBP1, and TSC22D4 form a complex, in which two TSC22D4 RΦ-motifs interact with the CCTL1 domain of WNK1 and the CCT domain of NRBP1. Our data indicate that NRBP1 and likely its close homolog NRBP2 function as an upstream activator of the WNK pathway.",

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method. In vitro, Ti-mitoEV treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced mitochondrial damage in recipient cells, and these effects occurred at least partly via mitochondrial genome transfer. In vivo, Ti-mitoEV treatment attenuated diverse types of tissue injury (e.g., muscle and kidney) by rescuing mitochondrial injury and its associated inflammation. As natural nanovesicles, the therapeutic potency of mitoEVs can be further improved by integrating them with other engineering methods. This study highlights the promising role of Ti-mitoEVs in boosting mitochondrial biogenesis, positioning them as potential therapies for treating various types of tissue injury characterized by mitochondrial damage.",

          "abstract": "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has become the essence of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. While enabling smaller feature sizes, EUV lithography imposes increasingly stringent requirements on the comprehensive performance and stochastic defect suppression of photoresist. The widely recognized strategy to minimize these defects is a material that integrates high EUV absorption and energy utilization into a homogeneous system based on molecular building blocks—the ideal formulation for EUV photoresist. However, achieving these integrated characteristics within a single molecule has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, we address all these requirements by polytelluoxane using an organic telluride monomer polymerized via Te─O bonds. This polymeric photoresist, operating through a main chain scission mechanism, demonstrates high-performance positive-tone lithography. Attributed to this ideal formulation, our photoresist achieves a comprehensive 18-nm line width at a dose of 13.1 mJ/cm 2 with a line edge roughness of 1.97 nm. We believe that this strategy establishes a framework for the design of next-generation EUV photoresists.",

The peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae is a generalist, feeding on many plant species and capable of transmitting numerous pathogens. This study reveals how host-responsive cathepsin B (CathB) proteins in the oral secretions of M. persicae facilitate aphid survival by modulating plant immune responses. Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids. These findings highlight an unexpected role for p-bodies in plant immunity and uncover a plant resistance mechanism to aphid infestation.",

These designs enable the creation of three-dimensional structures with spatially varying mechanical properties, ranging from tissue-like compliance to rigid, bone-like load-bearing capabilities.

Here, we demonstrate that topological bubble domains (BDs) can be induced in Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT)–based thin films via lattice distortions. We establish a positive correlation between the density of BDs, macroscopic polarization, and strain response. The BDs in BNT-based thin films leads to a remarkable enhancement in the strain response, reaching ~400% of the virgin state. This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response. These findings advance our understanding of BDs in electromechanical materials and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance piezoelectrics with polar topologies.",

Their sol-gel transition during curing enables mold casting and layer-by-layer manufacturing, allowing the fabrication of fully elastomeric and hybrid soft-rigid devices.

This study introduces a framework that relates adhesion strength to a dimensionless reaction coordinate coupling time and temperature. This reaction coordinate can be used to predict the transition from bulk fracture to adhesive failure, which is crucial to create robust devices with strong interfaces. Using this framework, we fabricated elastomeric robotic actuators and demonstrated 3D printing with direct ink writing. The actuators achieved 50% higher curvature with the same design, and the 3D-printed parts exhibited over 200% improvement in interlayer adhesion.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents reward attributes, such as delay and magnitude, alongside expected uncertainties about upcoming rewards, serving its established role in both value- and risk-based behaviors. However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control.",

Here, we explored the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22Ds on WNK signaling in vitro and in the DCT. TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 are localized in DCT WNK bodies, which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates associated with WNK activation. In HEK293 cells, long TSC22D isoforms and NRBP1 increase WNK4 activity. DCT-specific NRBP1-knockout mice have reduced NCC phosphorylation and activate a compensatory response. Thus, NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins are positive modulators of WNK signaling and modulate Na + reabsorption in the kidney.

This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform.

Leveraging the photosynthetic activity of C. reinhardtii , our microalgae-empowered muscle (MAM) constructs exhibited superior contractility and almost three times higher active force generation compared to conventional muscle constructs. MAM showed higher cellular viability and reduced tissue damage, attributed to in situ oxygenation and nutrient supply provided by microalgal photosynthesis. In addition, improved myotube alignment was observed in MAM, which contributed to enhanced force generation. Our findings showcase the potential of photosynthetic microalgae as a functional component in engineered skeletal muscle, offering a solution to longstanding challenges in muscle engineering.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric methane concentration (AMC) surged by ~50% during the last deglaciation, with northern (&gt;30°N) sources accounting for ~40% of the rise. However, hypothesized sources including expanding lakes, peatlands, and destabilized permafrost or hydrates fail to explain this rapid increase. We use biomarkers, isotopes, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct temperature change, methane cycling, and permafrost thaw from a Tibetan thermokarst lake. Radiocarbon evidence and ultradepleted δ 13 C values (−80.3 per mil) of methane-diagnostic lipids indicate intense cycling of ancient (~2500-year-old) methane during the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition, coeval with the AMC surge and the most rapid warming. By contrast, methane cycling was weak during the Holocene Climatic Optimum despite peak temperatures. These findings imply that anomalously high rates of warming, rather than absolute temperature alone, may play an important role in triggering enhanced paleo-methane cycling. Rapid warming likely intensified emissions from existing northern lakes, fueling the elusive yet clearly amplified northern methane source that contributed to the deglacial abrupt rise in AMC.",

          "abstract": "Biohybrid actuators leveraging living muscle tissue offer the potential to replicate natural motion for biomedical and robotic applications. However, challenges such as limited force output and inefficient force transfer at tissue interfaces persist. The myotendinous junction, a specialized interface connecting muscle to the tendon, plays a critical role in efficient force transmission for movement. Engineering muscle-tendon units in vitro is essential for replicating native musculoskeletal functions in biohybrid actuators. Here, we present a three-dimensionally bioprinted system integrating skeletal muscle tissue with tendon-mimicking anchors containing fibroblasts, forming a biomimetic interdigitated myotendinous junction. Using computational models, we optimized muscle geometries to enhance deformation and force generation. The engineered system improved mechanical stability, myofiber maturation, and force transmission, generating contractile forces of up to 350 micronewtons over a 3-month period. This work highlights how biomimetic designs and mechanical optimization can advance bioactuator technologies for applications in medicine and robotics.",
