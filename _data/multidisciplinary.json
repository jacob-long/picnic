          "abstract": "The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the 4D nucleome) is linked to genome function. Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project 1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.",

          "abstract": "Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems1, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave’s cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs2. Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks3, our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning4 and lattice protein folding5—benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP—traditionally used in optical communications—within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Spared regions of the damaged central nervous system undergo dynamic remodelling and exhibit a remarkable potential for therapeutic exploitation1. Lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), which interact with viable neurons and glia, undergo reactive transformations whose molecular and functional properties are poorly understood2. Here, using multiple transcriptional profiling methods, we investigated LRAs from spared regions of mouse spinal cord following traumatic spinal cord injury. We show that LRAs acquire a spectrum of molecularly distinct, neuroanatomically restricted reactivity states that evolve after spinal cord injury. We identify transcriptionally unique reactive LRAs in degenerating white matter that direct the specification and function of local microglia that clear lipid-rich myelin debris to promote tissue repair. Fuelling this LRA functional adaptation is the secreted matricellular protein CCN1. Loss of astrocyte-derived CCN1 results in excessive, aberrant activation of local microglia, characterized by abnormal molecular specification, impaired debris processing reflected by the intracellular accumulation of myelin and axon debris, and dysregulated lipid metabolism with distinctive attenuation in lipid droplet accumulation. Mechanistically, we find that CCN1 binds microglial SDC4 to augment lipid storage, linking this signalling axis to a vital repair-associated lipid buffering response in debris-clearing microglia. Accordingly, microglial deficits resulting from astrocyte CCN1 depletion culminate in blunted clearance of white matter debris and impaired neurological recovery from spinal cord injury. Ccn1-expressing white matter astrocytes are induced by local myelin damage and are generated in diverse demyelinating disorders in mice and humans, pointing to their fundamental, evolutionarily conserved role in white matter repair. Our findings show that context-specific cues shape regionally distinct LRA reactivity states with functional adaptations that orchestrate multicellular processes underlying neural repair and influence disease outcome.",

          "abstract": "Mazdutide is a once-weekly glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) 1. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of mazdutide versus dulaglutide in participants with T2D on background oral anti-diabetic drugs. In this randomised phase 3 study, 731 participants with T2D were randomised 1:1:1 to receive mazdutide 4 mg, mazdutide 6 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg for 28 weeks. Both mazdutide doses demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to dulaglutide 1.5 mg in mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28, with the least squares (LS) mean treatment difference of −0.24% (p=0.0032) for mazdutide 4 mg and −0.30% (p=0.0003) for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Significantly greater weight reductions were achieved with mazdutide versus dulaglutide, with LS mean treatment difference of −3.78% for mazdutide 4 mg and −5.76% for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide (both p<0.0001). Moreover, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7.0% with ≥5% weight reduction vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg at week 28 (both p<0.0001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Our findings showed that 28-week treatment with mazdutide (4 mg and 6 mg) provided superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in Chinese participants with T2D. Mazdutide was generally safe, with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than dulaglutide.",

          "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and facilitate the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by exchanging GDP for GTP1. This exchange function is not unidirectional2. Here we demonstrate that an agonist can show selective affinity for an active state that prefers the release of GTP. Specifically, for the mu opioid receptor, we show that several agonists have state-selective affinities for promoting GTP release versus GTP binding. We identify two agonists that show a marked preference for promoting release. In mice, marginally efficacious doses of the release-preferring agonist enhance and prolong the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl without enhancing the respiratory and cardiac effects of fentanyl. Although these observations are limited to simple measures of thermal nociception, they may point to a way to bifurcate physiological responses to such agonists. We propose that the active-state selectivity of an agonist may determine the preferred direction of the receptor GEF function, which may affect the kinetics and selectivity of the engagement of the receptor with downstream effectors; this may ultimately present a means to disentangle multifaceted drug-induced physiological responses.",

          "abstract": "The development of complex multicellular human in vitro systems holds great promise for modelling disease and advancing drug discovery and tissue engineering 1 . In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration 2,3 , in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids 4–6 , we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.",

          "abstract": "The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics1,2. Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons and nuclei3. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches4, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, 227AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for 227AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by 3 orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of 227AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.",

          "abstract": "The science of metabolic profiling exploits chemical compound byproducts of metabolism called metabolites1 that explain internal biological functions, physiological health and disease, and provide evidence of external influences specific to an organism’s habitat. Here we assess palaeometabolomes from fossilized mammalian hard tissues as a molecular ecological strategy to provide evidence of an ancient organism’s relationship with its environment. From eastern, central and southern African Plio-Pleistocene localities of palaeoanthropological significance, we study six fossils from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, one from the Chiwondo Beds, Malawi, and one from Makapansgat, South Africa. We perform endogeneity assessments by analysing palaeometabolomes of palaeosols and the effects of owl digestion on rodent bones to enable prudent ecological inferences. Diagenesis is indicated by metabolites of collagenase-producing bacteria2, whereas the preservation of peptides including those of collagen are identified by proteomics. Endogenous metabolites document biological functions and exogenous metabolites render environmental details including soil characteristics and woody cover, and enable annual minimum and maximum rainfall and temperature reconstructions at Olduvai Gorge, supporting the freshwater woodland and grasslands of Olduvai Gorge Bed I3,4,5, and the dry woodlands and marsh of Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II6. All sites denote wetter and/or warmer conditions than today. We infer that metabolites preserved in hard tissues derive from an extravasated vasculature serum filtrate that becomes entombed within developing mineralized matrices, and most probably survive palaeontological timeframes in the nanoscopic ‘pool’ of structural-bound water that occurs in hard tissue niches7.",

          "abstract": "Ageing erodes human immunity, in part by reshaping the T cell repertoire, leading to increased vulnerability to infection, malignancy and vaccine failure 1–3 . Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility 1,3–5 . Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8 + infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments 6,7 . These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations.",

          "authors": "Richard Wolff, Nandita R. Garud",
          "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts 1,2 . The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures.",

However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 ± 4 (refs. 2,3,4,5). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H2 use under future hydrogen economies3,5. A comprehensive accounting of H2 sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H2 sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020. H2 sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H2 production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H2. Estimated global H2 sources and sinks averaged 69.9 ± 9.4 Tg yr−1 and 68.4 ± 18.1 Tg yr−1, respectively, for 2010–2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H2, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H2 between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 ± 0.006 °C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H2 in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01–0.05 °C, depending on H2 usage, leakage rates and CH4 emissions that influence photochemical H2 production.",

          "abstract": "Distinct ligands for the same G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activate intracellular signaling partners to varying extents, but the molecular mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gαiβγ heterotrimer by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor1. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor’s transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule fluorescence assays, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a ‘kinetic trap’ during G-protein activation.",

          "abstract": "The growing demand for advanced materials, miniaturized devices and integrated microsystems calls for the reliable fabrication of complex, multiscale, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, a need increasingly addressed through light-based and laser-based processes. However, owing to the field-of-view (FOV) limitations of conventional imaging optics, existing 3D laser nanofabrication techniques face fundamental challenges in throughput, proximity error and stitching defects on the path to scaling. Here we present a scalable 3D nanofabrication platform that uses a metalens-generated focal spot array to parallelize two-photon lithography (TPL)1 beyond centimetre-scale write field areas. Metalenses are ideally suited for producing submicron-scale focal spots for high-throughput nanolithography, as they uniquely feature large numerical apertures (NAs), immersion media compatibility and large-scale manufacturability. We experimentally demonstrate a printing system that uses a 12-cm2 metalens array to produce more than 120,000 cooperative focal spots, corresponding to a throughput exceeding 108 voxels s−1. By programmatically patterning the focal spot array using a spatial light modulator (SLM), an adaptive parallel printing strategy is developed for precise greyscale linewidth modulation and choreographed printing of semiperiodic and fully aperiodic 3D geometries. We demonstrate parallel printing of replicated microstructures (>50 M microparticles per day), centimetre-scale 3D architectures with feature sizes down to 113 nm, and photonic and mechanical metamaterials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D nanolithography towards wafer-scale production, showing how TPL could be used at scale for applications in microelectronics2, biomedicine3, quantum technology4 and high-energy laser targets5,6.",

Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases1,2, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for co-propagating modes and induce unexpected edge valley polarization, which differs from the bulk. Although some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes scanning tunnelling microscopy as a promising tool for exploring the edge physics of the rapidly expanding group of two-dimensional topological phases, including recently realized fractional Chern insulators.",

Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of the dual glucagon receptor (GCGR)/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist mazdutide monotherapy versus placebo in Chinese adults with T2D inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. In this phase 3 trial, 320 participants (mean HbA1c of 8.24%, BMI of 28.2 kg/m2, and diabetes duration of 1.9 years) were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of mazdutide 4 mg, 6 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week extended mazdutide treatment. At week 24, mazdutide significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (primary endpoint): -1.57% with mazdutide 4 mg and -2.15% with mazdutide 6 mg, versus -0.14% with placebo, with treatment differences of -1.43% and -2.02% (both p <0.0001). Significant weight loss at week 24 occurred with -5.61% (4 mg) and -7.81% (6 mg) versus -1.26% (placebo) (both p<0.0001). Additionally, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved clinically relevant HbA1c target (<7.0%), weight loss goal (≥5%), and composite endpoints (HbA1c <7.0% and weight loss ≥5%) versus placebo (all p <0.0001). The most common adverse events—diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and nausea—were consistent with GLP-1R agonists. These results establish mazdutide monotherapy as an effective intervention providing clinically meaningful glycaemic control and weight reduction alongside a favourable safety profile in this population.",

          "abstract": "The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-bound factor with essential yet incompletely understood roles in protein biogenesis1. Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, initial NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NAC’s chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices, thus promoting cytonuclear folding. NAC also supports mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations.",

          "abstract": "Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds 1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control 3 . By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control 4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms 5 . An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.",

          "abstract": "The Cassini mission provided unprecedented insights into Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from its atmosphere to the deep interior1. The moon’s large measured response to the tides exerted by Saturn was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a subsurface ocean2,3. This response, twice the value predicted in pre-Cassini studies, has escaped complete explanation. Here we show that the signature of tidal dissipation in Titan’s gravity field is not consistent with the presence of an ocean. Our results arise from the detection of this signature through a reanalysis of the radiometric data acquired by Cassini with improved techniques. We found that substantial energy is being dissipated in the interior (approximately 3–4 TW, corresponding to a tidal quality factor Q ≈ 5), consistent with recent studies of Titan’s rotational state4. Because the presence of a liquid layer reduces the tidal dissipation generated below it5, these new measurements preclude the existence of a subsurface ocean on Titan and are explained by a model in which dissipation is concentrated in a high-pressure ice layer close to its melting point. This model also reproduces Titan’s observed rotational state and static gravity field self-consistently, reconciling all available geophysical measurements. Efficient ice shell convection can prevent widespread melting and ocean formation, but a slushy high-pressure ice layer is consistent with expectations6, indicating that it probably hosts liquid water pockets. The forthcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan will provide a further test of whether a subsurface ocean exists.",

Sensory circuits support higher plasticity at younger ages during critical periods—times of circuit refinement and maturation—and limit plasticity in adulthood for circuit stability1,2. How astrocytes, a glial subtype, maintain these differing plasticity levels, and whether they stabilize the properties of sensory circuits in adulthood, remain largely unclear. Here we take a comprehensive approach to address these questions and establish astrocytes as key orchestrators of circuit stability. Combining a transcriptomic approach with ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo imaging, we identify that astrocytes release CCN1 (refs. 3,4) to maintain synapse and circuit stability in the adult visual cortex. Overexpressing CCN1 in astrocytes during the critical period promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons, limits ocular dominance plasticity and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Conversely, knocking out astrocyte CCN1 in adults destabilizes binocular circuits and reduces myelination. This establishes CCN1 as an astrocyte-secreted factor that stabilizes neuronal circuits by coordinating the maturation state of multiple cell types, and demonstrates that the composition and properties of sensory circuits require ongoing maintenance in adulthood, and that these maintenance cues are provided by astrocytes.",

Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility 1–5 . Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.",

          "authors": "Dalmeet Singh Chawla",
          "abstract": "The difficulty of detecting AI-tool use in peer review is proving problematic.Credit: BrianAJackson/iStock via Getty\n\nIt’s almost impossible to know whether a peer-review report has been generated by artificial intelligence, according to a study that put AI-detecting tools to the test.\n\nA research team based in China used the Claude 2.0 large language model (LLM), created by Anthropic, an AI company in San Francisco, California, to generate peer-review reports and other types of documentation for 20 published cancer-biology papers from the journal eLife1. The journal’s publisher makes papers freely available online as ‘reviewed preprints’, and publishes them alongside their referee reports and the original unedited manuscripts.\n\nThe authors fed the original versions into Claude and prompted it to generate referee reports. The team then compared the AI-generated reports with the genuine ones published by eLife.\n\nThe AI-written reviews “looked professional, but had no specific, deep feedback”, says Lingxuan Zhu, an oncologist at the Southern Medical University in Lianyungang, China, and a co-author of the study. “This made us realize that there was a serious problem.”\n\nThe study found that Claude could write plausible citation requests (suggesting papers that authors could add to their reference lists) and convincing rejection recommendations (made when reviewers think a journal should reject a submitted paper). The latter capability raises the risk of journals rejecting good papers, says Zhu. “An editor cannot be an expert in everything. If they receive a very persuasive AI-written negative review, it could easily influence their decision.”\n\nThe study also found that the majority of the AI reports fooled the detection tools: ZeroGPT erroneously classified 60% as written by a human, and GPTzero concluded this for more than 80%.\n\nDiffering opinions\n\nA growing challenge for journals is the fact that LLMs could be used in many ways to produce a referee report. What is deemed an ‘acceptable’ use of AI also differs depending on whom you ask. In a survey of some 5,000 researchers conducted by Nature earlier this year, 66% of respondents said it wasn’t appropriate to use generative AI to create reviewer reports from scratch. But 57% said it was acceptable to use it to help with peer review by getting it to answer questions about papers.\n\nAnd although AI-detection tools are improving, they struggle to determine how much of a document has been generated using AI. An analysis published last year of referee reports that were submitted to four computer-science conferences estimated that 17% had been substantially modified by chatbots2. It’s not clear, however, whether the referees used AI to improve the reports or to write them entirely.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nJeroen Verharen, a neuroscientist at the firm iota Biosciences in Alameda, California, says he is surprised that the AI detectors used by Zhu and his team weren’t better at spotting the AI-written referee reports.\n\nBut he adds that AI-written reports and associated materials are unlikely to become a widespread problem. If reviewers don’t want to review, he says, “they would just say no”.\n\nConversely, Mikołaj Piniewski, a hydrologist at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, argues that it is a growing issue. He says he has already received referee reports that he suspects were written by AI.\n\n“LLMs are increasingly being used by peer reviewers, although this is rarely disclosed,” he says. “When I spoke to my colleagues in the field of hydrology, it became clear that each of us had encountered at least one such case as an author in the past two years. At least one of the review reports we received looked very suspicious, and the AI-detection tools we used flagged it as potentially generated by LLMs.”\n\nPiniewski adds that he is sure some journal editors are accepting AI-generated referee reports, unwittingly or otherwise. He suggests that a global shortage of peer reviewers could be causing some editors to be more lenient than they should be. “I’m afraid it is largely driven by convenience,” he says.",

The subsequent eruption killed 1,680 islanders. This is one of many global examples of the public’s appreciation of nature in Earth scientist Anjana Khatwa’s enticing book. “Awakening yourself to the whispers of rock”, she says, “can transform the way you connect with and understand the world”.\n\nLo—TEK Water\n\nJulia Watson Taschen (2025)\n\nWater is “not a resource to be extracted or managed, but a living relative, a system of memory, intelligence, and reciprocity”, says landscape designer Julia Watson.

Next year, it will observe the Sun during its peak activity phase.Credit: Indian Space Research Organisation via AP/Alamy\nAI for science\n\nResearch powered by artificial intelligence made leaps this year, and it is here to stay. AI ‘agents’ that integrate several large language models (LLMs) to carry out complex, multi-step processes are likely to be used more widely, some with little human oversight. The coming year might even bring the first consequential scientific advances made by AI. But heavier use could also expose serious failures in some systems. Researchers have already reported errors that AI agents are prone to, such as the deletion of data.\n\nNext year will also bring techniques that move beyond LLMs, which are expensive to train. Newer approaches focus on designing small-scale AI models that learn from a limited pool of data and can specialize in solving specific reasoning puzzles. These systems do not generate text, but process mathematical representations of information. This year, one such tiny AI model beat massive LLMs at a logic test.\n\nGene-editing momentum\n\nNext year could see the launch of two clinical trials to develop personalized gene therapies for children with rare genetic disorders. The efforts expand on the treatment of KJ Muldoon, a baby boy with a rare metabolic disorder who received a CRIPSR therapy tailored to correct his specific disease-causing mutation.\n\nThe team that treated Muldoon plans to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to run a clinical trial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that will test gene-editing therapies in more children with rare metabolic disorders. These conditions are caused by variants in seven genes that can be addressed with the same type of gene editing as was used in Muldoon’s therapy. Another team hopes to begin a similar trial for genetic disorders of the immune system next year.\n\nArtemis II crew members Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen with the Orion crew module.Credit: NASA\nMassive trial\n\nA UK clinical trial of a single blood test that detects around 50 types of cancer before symptoms begin is expected to report results next year. The test screens for bits of DNA that cancer cells release into the blood, and can home in on the tissue type or organ that the signal comes from. The trial involved more than 140,000 participants, and if the results are promising, UK health authorities plan to roll out the tool across hospitals.\n\nIn April, the biggest regulatory update to clinical trials in the United Kingdom in two decades will come into force. Under the new rules, researchers can seek ethics and regulatory approval in one application. But the law also mandates that all trials involving medicines be publicly registered before recruiting their first participant and that a summary of results be published within 12 months of the end of the trial. The goal is to speed up research, boost the diversity of trial participants and reduce the time it takes for promising treatments to reach the people who need them.\n\nMeanwhile, changes proposed by the FDA this month that would require a single clinical trial, rather than two, for new drugs to be approved will continue to unfold in 2026.\n\nHeavy lunar traffic\n\nNext year is set to be another busy one for Moon missions. NASA’s Artemis II will send four astronauts to fly around the Moon aboard the Orion spacecraft. The ten-day flight is the first crewed lunar mission since the 1970s and will help to prepare for subsequent missions to land on the Moon.\n\nChina is also preparing to launch the next in its series of lunar probes, Chang’e-7, in August. The mission will use a hopper spacecraft with shock-absorbing capabilities. It aims to arrive near the south pole — a rock- and crater-strewn region known for being challenging to land on. In 2023, India’s Chandrayaan-3 was the first spacecraft to successfully touch down near the lunar south pole. If it achieves a successful landing, Chang’e-7 will hunt for water ice and study moonquakes.\n\nThe payload module of ESA’s PLATO spacecraft — due to launch in 2026 — undergoes tests in a thermal vacuum chamber.Credit: ESA-Remedia\nMartian moons and beyond\n\nResearchers are also turning their eyes to Mars, with Japan planning to launch its Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission to visit the red planet’s two moons, Phobos and Deimos. The spaceship will collect samples of Phobos’s surface and return them to Earth in 2031, which has never been done before.\n\nThe European Space Agency is planning to launch its planet-hunting satellite PLATO towards the end of next year. Equipped with 26 cameras, PLATO will monitor more than 200,000 bright stars and identify ‘Earth twin’ planets with temperatures that allow liquid water to form.\n\nIndia’s first solar mission, Aditya-L1, will observe the Sun during solar maximum, the peak of a roughly 11-year activity cycle, marked by the highest rates of sunspots, flares and solar storms. The satellite has been sitting in a halo orbit, which allows continuous observation of the Sun, about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, since last year. Its data will help researchers to build a better picture of the Sun’s surface during the solar maximum.\n\nDrill, baby, drill\n\nNext year, China’s ocean-drilling ship Meng Xiang is expected to embark on its first scientific expedition. The vessel is designed to drill up to 11 kilometres through oceanic crust into Earth’s mantle and collect samples. The work will help researchers to learn about how the ocean floor forms and what drives its tectonic activity.\n\nThe Meng Xiang, China’s deep-ocean drilling vessel, is designed to drill through Earth’s crust into the mantle.Credit: Liu Dawei/Xinhua via Alamy",

Neves Valente, who was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, on 18 December, is also thought to have killed two students and injured nine others at Brown University on 13 December. Foley said Neves Valente attended Brown University in the early 2000s and attended the same academic programme in Portugal as Loureiro between 1995 and 2000.\n\nScientists have expressed their shock and sadness following the death of plasma physicist Nuno Loureiro, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who was shot at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday.\n\nThe scientist died from his injuries on Tuesday morning after being shot multiple times. Police say they are investigating his death and treating it as a homicide. Loureiro’s death is the second US university-related tragedy in a week, after two people were killed and nine others were injured in a shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.\n\nAt the time of his death, Loureiro had been the head of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, a position he held since May last year. The laboratory hosts more than 250 scientists. This year, Loureiro was given the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which is bestowed on researchers who show exceptional potential for leadership.\n\nLoureiro was a “brilliant scientist”, who was sharp, kind and had a smart sense of humour, says Stanislav Boldyrev, a plasma physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who began working with Loureiro in 2017. “It’s a privilege to have a friend like him,” Boldyrev adds. “He was so interested in science, it was almost contagious.”\n\n“He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner,” said Dennis Whyte, former director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, in a statement.\n\nLoureiro was passionate about the potential for fusion as a clean power source and about teaching a new generation of scientists, say colleagues. He thought “that we are really progressing towards finally having electricity from fusion”, says Bruno Soares Gonçalves, a plasma physicist and president of the Institute of Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion in Lisbon, where Loureiro worked until he moved to MIT in 2016.\n\n“People in the community are so shocked and extremely saddened,” he says.\n\nNuno Loureiro was a theoretical physicist who was helping to develop clean-energy fusion devices. Credit: Jake Belcher/MIT\n'Doing what he loved'\n\nLoureiro grew up in Portugal and obtained his PhD in physics at Imperial College London in 2005. He worked in the United Kingdom and Portugal before starting at MIT in 2016. The move was a huge opportunity for Loureiro, which he was eager to take, says Gonçalves. He was “doing what he loved in the place where he was really keen to be”.\n\nLoureiro’s work focused on modelling and understanding turbulence in plasma, the super-hot, exotic state of matter composed of charged particles that makes up stars and could one day power fusion reactors on Earth. He studied how plasma behaves inside fusion chambers, particularly its tendency to become unstable, to optimize the operation of future devices.",

          "abstract": "A quantum computer. The administration of US President Donald Trump has announced sizable spending prorammes for quantum information science and artificial intelligence.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nFor much of US science, 2025 was a year of cancelled grants and budget anxiety — but a few fortunate fields came out ahead. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, artificial intelligence and quantum-information science have sat at the top of his administration’s scientific priorities. And they don’t seem to be leaving any time soon.\n\nTrump has ordered his advisers to ensure that the nation is “the unrivaled world leader” in AI and quantum information. The subjects are listed first and second on the administration’s list of research and development priorities. And on 11 December, Trump signed an executive order preventing US states from regulating AI, with the goal of speeding up the technology’s development.\n\nBut some researchers question the effectiveness of the administration’s programmes to promote quantum science and AI. And some argue that the administration’s strategies might be hampered by some of its other policy changes.\n\nHere Nature examines three ways in which the administration aims to move quantum science and AI forwards.\n\nFunding opportunities\n\nTrump’s budget proposal for the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2026 largely spared quantum science and AI, with a 3% increase in AI funding and a 0.4% increase in spending on quantum science — in contrast to cancelled research grants and proposals for steep cuts in many other areas. And throughout 2025, both the NSF and the Department of Energy (DoE) have announced new investments in AI and quantum science, including $100 million for AI projects at five US universities.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nSteven Rolston, a quantum physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park and chair of the university’s physics department, says that the disparity between fields is visible there: faculty members in fields such as particle astrophysics face deep uncertainty about how much funding they’ll receive and how often they’ll have to reapply for awards. For quantum research, however, the biggest change is that the grant cycle has slowed down because of a US government shutdown and agency staffing changes. “I sort of have survivor’s guilt here,” Rolston says.\n\nBut quantum science and AI have not been immune to grant cuts. According to data from the non-profit website Grant Witness, the NSF has cancelled 101 grants that mention ’artificial intelligence’ in their abstracts, and 68 grants that mention ‘quantum’ in their abstracts.\n\nAnd although AI and quantum science escaped massive cuts, the administration’s funding increases for these areas “are negligible in scope”, says David Schatsky, an AI-policy researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The 2026 budget doesn’t reflect — in dollar terms — an increase in focus or commitment to AI and quantum.” The NSF declined Nature’s request for comment, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) did not respond.\n\nJoining forces\n\nTo pursue its priorities, the administration is also promoting both new and existing public–private partnerships, most prominently through an initiative, called the Genesis Mission, that was announced in November. The project, headed by the DoE, will make scientific data sets from the 17 US national laboratories available to private companies and academic researchers, who will use those data to build AI models to accelerate scientific research. Among the companies that have signed up to collaborate with federal researchers are Microsoft, IBM and OpenAI.\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, what will it mean for research?\n\nThe administration has promoted public–private partnerships in quantum science as well. Under the National Quantum Initiative, which began during the first Trump administration, quantum-information research centres at five national labs partner with private quantum companies to create prototypes and test new technology. The DoE made an extra $625-million investment in the programme this year, and an executive order outlining the administration’s overarching approach to quantum science is expected soon, says Constanza Vidal Bustamante, a quantum-technology policy researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC.",

Credit: Chen Kun/VCG via Getty\n\nThe biggest science story this year was the political upheaval in the United States. Funding cuts, academic lay-offs and vaccine-sceptic policies have widely been seen as an attack on science, according to critics of President Donald Trump’s administration. The resulting damage to science could last way into the future.\n\nBut, there were also plenty of positive developments in 2025 that offer hope for the coming years. “From a non-US scientist, it’s somewhat business as usual. You just keep doing your job,” says Glen Peters, a climate-policy researcher at the Cicero Center for International Climate Research in Oslo.\n\nOur recent Nature’s 10 package includes many good news stories — and there were many more. From gene-editing firsts to rapid disease containment and policy victories, Nature takes a look at some positive science stories of 2025.\n\nNature’s 10: Ten people who shaped science in 2025\n\nSpecies recovery\n\nThis year saw populations of some endangered and near-extinct species bounce back owing to strong conservation efforts.\n\nThe green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), which has been endangered since the 1980s, has now moved to ‘least concern’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Efforts to protect the turtle’s eggs and measures to prevent their accidental capture in fishing nets have allowed populations to recover.\n\nThe ampurta (Dasycercus hillieri), a rat-sized Australian marsupial, moved from near-extinction to ‘least concern’ this year. Between 2015 and 2021, ampurta territory expanded by more than 48,000 square kilometres, despite dry conditions and food shortages.\n\nLastly, nations reached a historic milestone for marine conservation in September with the United Nations High Seas Treaty receiving approval from more than 60 countries. The treaty, which will come into effect in January, aims to legally protect biodiversity in international waters and conserve at least 30% of land and sea areas.\n\nOzone hole shrinks\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since 2019, indicating the continued recovery of Earth’s protective upper atmosphere.\n\nThe ozone hole was first discovered in 1985 and is a result of human-emitted ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as coolants in refrigerators and aerosol sprays. The Montreal Protocol in 1987 phased out the production and use of CFCs, which has successfully curbed emissions1. Since 1987, the average size of the ozone hole throughout the year has been gradually decreasing in size, with the smallest so far in 2019.\n\nThe ozone hole is on track to recover completely in the late 2060s, provided efforts to find climate-friendly alternatives to CFCs continues.\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has continued to shrink.Credit: CAMS\nGene-editing successes\n\nThis year “was a breakthrough year for gene editing”, says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “In 2025, these technologies have achieved a number of medical milestones.”\n\n“I view this year as an outstanding one, marked by the launch of many clinical trials,” adds Annarita Miccio, who studies gene therapy at the Imagine Institute at the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.\n\nHuntington’s disease treated for the first time using gene therapy\n\nThe first gene therapy for Huntington’s disease proved striking, slowing the rate of cognitive decline in participants by 75%. Another gene-therapy trial — for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia — showed promise with the majority of 11 participating children and adults entering remission2. The new type of CAR-T-cell therapy uses base-editing technology to modify several genes in T cells, helping them to target the cancer cells.\n\nResearchers also trialled the first use of a CRISPR technology tailored to an individual this year. Other successes include the first clinical trial for a gene therapy to treat a rare immune disorder called chronic granulomatous disease3, and another that corrected a pathogenic mutation that can cause lung damage and liver disease4.\n\nThese clinical trials paved the way for developing mutation-specific strategies for rare diseases and demonstrated that collaboration between academia and industry can lead to cures for people with such diseases, says Miccio.\n\nRenewable-energy boost\n\nRenewable energy surpassed coal as the largest energy source for the first time globally this year. The achievement was helped by China becoming the first country in the world to install 1 terawatt of solar power capacity in May. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity of 256 gigawatts — twice as much as the rest of the world combined. The country plans to add a further 200–300 gigawatts of capacity for solar and wind energy in its five year plan beginning in 2026.\n\nWhat happened at COP30? 4 science take-homes from the climate summit\n\n“China and many developing countries are deploying solar and wind [and] electric vehicles at pretty breakneck pace,” says Peters.\n\nAround half of the European Union’s demand for electricity came from from renewables in the second and third quarters of this year. Renewable-energy capacity is projected to increase by almost 4,600 gigawatts between 2025 and 2030 — double the capacity deployed between 2019 and 2024.\n\nHowever, greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels reached a new high this year. It remains to be seen whether renewable energy can replace fossil fuels as the dominant global energy sources.\n\nEbola contained",

Credit: Simon Maina/AFP via Getty\n\nThe United States is rolling out bilateral health agreements across Africa under its America First Global Health Strategy. Its announcement on 4 December of a US$1.6-billion health agreement with Kenya was the first, and signals a shift in how the United States intends to engage with African health systems. Rather than strengthening relevant continental bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the strategy leans towards one-to-one agreements between governments.\n\nThe timing could not be more delicate. It follows the United States’ withdrawal of funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the WHO, two international health institutions that African governments rely on for vaccines, coordination and technical support, and the importance of which in the region has grown since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfrica finally has its own drug-regulation agency — and it could transform the continent’s health\n\nDuring the pandemic, countries across Africa faced devastating delays in accessing vaccines, medical supplies and diagnostic tools. Front-line responders and laboratories struggled. Surveillance systems had uneven coverage. Outbreak information moved too slowly. Countries negotiated alone for tools they needed but could not secure.\n\nIn 2022, led by the Africa CDC, African leaders endorsed a New Public Health Order to build continent-wide systems to protect everyone, not just the states with the most leverage. One example is the Continental Cholera Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa. Developed by the Africa CDC and the WHO, and endorsed by heads of state in August, it outlines how countries should respond to cholera as a single coordinated unit.\n\nThe plan establishes one team, one plan, one budget and one monitoring framework. It describes how responders can deploy from one country to another rapidly; how national laboratories with sequencing capacity can support testing for neighbours with fewer resources; and how information should flow seamlessly across borders so that no outbreak is hidden by a lack of capacity.\n\nCould Africa be the future for genomics research?\n\nAnother example is Africa’s Health Security and Sovereignty Agenda, which was outlined by the Africa CDC in November. It includes stronger mandates for the CDC, harmonized regulatory pathways, expansion of regional manufacturing and cross-border surveillance systems built on shared data.\n\nBy contrast, the America First Global Health Strategy prioritizes bilateral health agreements with individual governments, with limited reference to the role of continental bodies. It creates space for parallel systems that might not connect to Africa’s surveillance networks or regulatory structures. This shift raises three concerns.",

Blood-based markers can be helpful for physicians treating people with dementia and for answering research questions, but they aren’t ready to be rolled out widely as health screening tools.\n\n“It is the kind of test that, in the wrong hands, could cause a lot of harm,” says Karlawish, who was not involved in the study.\n\nFrom blood to brain\n\nTo assess the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an international team of researchers turned to the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study, a prospective research study that started in 1984 and that has collected health data and biological samples from 250,000 Norwegians.\n\nUsing blood samples from 11,486 individuals in the study aged 58 and above, the team looked at levels of a protein, called tau, that has been phosphorylated at a specific site. Known as pTau217, this blood marker serves as a proxy for the build-up of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of AD. HUNT-study participants over the age of 70 have undergone cognitive testing, enabling the researchers to compare pTau217 levels with the presence of dementia.\n\nAround 10% of participants over the age of 70 had dementia and AD pathology, showing both cognitive impairment and high pTau217, they report. Another 10% had mild cognitive impairments and high pTau217. And 10% had high pTau217 but no signs of cognitive impairment, which the authors refer to as preclinical AD.\n\nThese findings are broadly in line with expectations, but there were surprises, too.\n\nSome 25% of people aged 85–89 had dementia and AD pathology, up from previous estimates of around 7% for men and 13% for women in this age group in Western Europeans3. And the incidence of preclinical AD in younger individuals was 8% in those aged 70–74, down from a previous estimate of around 22%.\n\nAnders Gustavsson, a member of the team that compiled the earlier estimates, welcomes the latest data. “I’m not surprised that this study gets somewhat different numbers,” says Gustavsson, who is an adviser to the health-economics consultancy Quantify Research in Stockholm.\n\nAlzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day\n\nThe discrepancies probably reflect selection bias, says study co-author Anita Lenora Sunde, a physician and dementia researcher at Stavanger University Hospital in Norway. Previous estimates were made by recruiting participants for brain scans, and people with dementia might not have wanted to or been able to participate.\n\nBut other factors could also be at play, says Villain. The latest study uses a high pTau217 threshold to define its preclinical AD population, and so excludes people with intermediate levels of the protein and emerging pathology.\n\n“If you lower the threshold, the prevalence suddenly increases,” says Villain.\n\nThe value of education\n\nThe study also found that people with lower education levels have higher pTau217 levels.",

          "abstract": "The Hungarian-born physicist Leo Szilard was the inspiration behind the idea of the Szilard point, a term used in cost–benefit analyses of grant proposals.Credit: Bettmann/Getty\n\nCompetition is a constant fixture of academic life. We compete for positions, promotions, publications and presentations. And we also compete for money, a necessary requirement if we are to continue taking part in the academic endeavour.\n\nI spent the early years of my PhD at an Austrian non-academic research institute, where competing for grants was the only way that my colleagues and I could secure funding for our research. Everything else we did, from publishing papers to presenting at conferences, felt designed, ultimately, to help secure the next grant. The system seemed back to front: surely it should be about the science first?\n\nFive important financial moves for PhD students\n\nIn science, there are many more people with ideas than there are public resources to support those ideas, which raises an unavoidable question about how to allocate scarce resources. Determining the best way to do so is extremely difficult. In an egalitarian approach, everyone would receive an equal share, even if that was only a fraction of what their projects would need. An alternative would be to use strict merit criteria, or to allow institutions to decide how they want to distribute resources. Yet the approach that has become most widespread is competition, which is presented as efficient, fair and reliable.\n\nMillion-dollar questions\n\nMy main research focuses on using computational tools to analyse intelligent systems, but I have found myself increasingly questioning how the ways in which we fund science shape its outcomes1. Which funding schemes encourage researchers to pursue high-risk research? How do different funding schemes affect scientists themselves, and what ethical issues arise from them?\n\nI suspect that because competition had been a constant companion on my path to becoming a professor at the Vienna University of Technology (perhaps even paving the way), I developed a particular interest in analysing its implications. These questions are core topics in metascience, which takes a bird’s-eye view of how research is done and aims to improve its quality, integrity and efficiency. Like many of my colleagues, I work on these topics alongside my main research.\n\nLink Introducing the j-metric: a true measure of what matters in academia\n\nA concept known as the Szilard point helps to contextualize the issues arising from excessive competition for grants. Named after the Hungarian-born physicist Leo Szilard, who wrote a short story satirizing the bureaucratic nature of scientific funding, this metric describes the threshold at which the total cost of competing for a grant equals (or surpasses) the value of the available funding. These costs are incurred by scientists in writing proposals, by their peers in reviewing them and by the administrative systems that run the process. The question is, which costs more: the research being funded, or the application process itself?\n\nGenAI for Africa, a funding call from the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme, probably crosses that threshold. The initiative aims to use generative artificial intelligence to address the societal challenges that many African countries are facing. With a total budget of €5 million (US$5.8 million), the call, which closed in October, invited proposals across four vast domains — agriculture, health care, urban planning and education. Out of 215 submissions, only two projects are expected to be funded, giving a success rate of under 1%.\n\nTo approximate the overall costs associated with the application process, I used two scenarios. See ‘GenAI for Africa: estimated grant-application costs’.\n\nScenario A\n\nIn 2023, group of researchers at the University of Lübeck in Germany developed a simulation tool for estimating the costs of grant funding. To arrive at cost estimates for GenAI for Africa applications, I fed this simulation with data from the Interim Evaluation of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021–2024). The key inputs are:\n\nTime investment. According to the report, “the median consortium coordinator spends … 36 to 45 person-days per proposal. The effort for contributing consortium partners is typically lower, spending 16 to 25 person-days.”\n\nConsortium size. The average consortium size for Horizon projects is likely to be between 12 and 16 partners, according to statistics published by the European Commission.\n\nHourly payment rate of applicants. Hourly rates vary considerably depending on country, sector (industry versus academia), seniority and applicable overheads. To reflect this diversity, I drew on several reference sources from across Europe. To account for differences, I assumed the average cost of an hour’s work to be between €20 and €60.\n\nThe variation in input values enabled me to produce two cost estimates for GenAI for Africa grant applications: a lower estimate (Scenario A1) and a higher estimate (Scenario A2).\n\nThe tool automatically accounts for decision-making and administrative costs.\n\nScenario B",

Credit: National Institutes of Health, NIAID/SPL\n\nA twice-weekly cocktail of three messenger RNAs can rejuvenate the weary immune systems of aged mice and boost responses to vaccination and cancer treatments, a study has found1.\n\nThe treatment provides a needed boost to immune cells called T cells, which coordinate immune responses and kill infected cells. As people age, their ability to produce T cells wanes, and the ones they have become less effective.\n\nT-cell ageing helps to explain why vaccines are sometimes less effective in older people than in young adults, and why cancer treatments that unleash the immune system against tumours don’t work as well in older adults, says María Mittelbrunn, an immunologist at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. Flagging T-cell immunity is also linked to the chronic inflammation associated with many age-related diseases, including some forms of cardiovascular disease.\n\nHow to make an old immune system young again\n\n“T cells, in particular, are one of the cell types that change the most during ageing,” says Mittelbrunn, who was not involved in the study. “To rejuvenate them could have immense consequences.”\n\nThe work was reported in Nature on 17 December and earlier this month at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\nTargeting T cells\n\nT cells are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to a tiny gland called the thymus to mature. In the thymus, they learn to recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. They also learn not to attack the body’s own healthy cells.\n\nBut the thymus degrades with age: it begins to shrink and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Attempts to reverse this using hormone treatments and other drugs have not worked, says Mirco Friedrich, a haematologist and oncologist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, and first author of the study.\n\nSo, Friedrich and his colleagues decided to take a different approach: rather than treating the thymus directly, they targeted T cells by delivering an experimental therapy to the liver. “Most T cells are in the blood,” Friedrich says. “And the liver receives the body’s whole blood volume.”\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nThe team began by characterizing the effects of ageing on T cells in mice, cataloguing differences in gene activity and molecular signalling pathways from shortly after birth until the animals were old and frail, at about 20 months of age.",

          "abstract": "The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, has been targeted for breakup by the Trump administration.Credit: John Greim/LightRocket/Getty\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump intends to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), a world-leading Earth-science centre in Boulder, Colorado. The centre’s modelling and Earth observations underpin a wide range of US and global research, especially on climate.\n\n“This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” wrote Russell Vought, Trump’s budget director, announcing the planned closure in a post yesterday on the social-media platform X. In a statement, the White House called NCAR “the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy”. The plan was first reported by USA Today.\n\nThe White House said that the National Science Foundation (NSF), which provides funding for the centre, “will be breaking up NCAR to eliminate Green New Scam research activities. Any vital functions, such as weather modeling and supercomputing, will be moved under the purview of another entity or location.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) — the non-profit consortium of more than 130 colleges and universities that runs NCAR — received a letter of intent from the NSF regarding the planned break-up of NCAR, consortium president Antonio Busalacchi told Nature. The letter requested information regarding divesting, transferring or restructuring the various components of NCAR. It mentioned NCAR’s research aircraft fleet and its supercomputing center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as components that might be relocated. “Morale is terrible,” Busalacchi says.\n\nUS environmental agency halts funding for its main science division\n\nAny such action will be challenged by members of Congress. “I for one am not going to let this take place on my watch,” Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the US House of Representatives, said Wednesday in a virtual address to the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Congress sets the federal budget and can direct the US government to fund NCAR.\n\nThe most recent agreement between the NSF and UCAR, which was signed in 2023, provides US$938 million to run NCAR for five years. Cancelling that award would eliminate the majority of NCAR’s annual budget. The rest of the budget comes from an array of federal and non-federal sources.\n\nCentral resource\n\nNews of the intended closure rippled quickly through the Earth-science community, with many starting a #SaveNCAR discussion across social-media platforms. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” wrote Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, on social media, adding that the laboratory is the “global mothership” of atmospheric science.\n\n“To me personally, it’s just another unbelievably reckless blow to American science”, says Dawn Wright, an oceanographer and geographer at Esri, a geographic-information-system company in Redlands, California. “If the NSF does follow through with these plans to break up NCAR, that’s just going to decimate a huge chunk of the US climate research that we all depend on.”\n\nThe NSF established NCAR in 1960 to support US atmospheric-science research that requires computing or other resources beyond the means of any single institution. “If you cancel this, you will devastate atmospheric science,” says a researcher who formerly worked at the NSF and requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. “That’s different from other sciences that are more distributed.”\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\nWork at NCAR played a key part in the rise of modern weather and climate forecasting. For instance, the lab pioneered the modern dropwindsonde, a weather instrument that can be released from an aircraft to measure conditions as it plummets through a storm. The technology reshaped the scientific understanding of hurricanes, says James Franklin, an atmospheric scientist and former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.",

You sure you’re up for it?” The bartender spoke in a low voice, locking eyes with two of Spooky’s. Such a typical human habit — this compulsive need to make eye contact. It would have been far more practical to focus on the tentacles he used to communicate rather than struggling to pick which eye to look at.\n\n“Alright, alright, no need for the whole colour show — you really don’t look good in black. A fifth shot it is!” The bartender backpedalled quickly as Spooky’s displeasure became obvious. Quadrinocularis were usually a quiet, docile species, more accustomed to basking in the sun for hours than arguing. Spooky, however, had cultivated a reputation for being irascible. When he got annoyed enough to change colour, most knew to keep their distance.\n\nSoon, a small glass of clear liquid was placed before him. The bartender struck a match, and blue flames licked the surface. Spooky flared his pores, greedily absorbing the rising fumes. His entire body shivered in pleasure. Immersed in the heady haze of Smokey Blast, he could almost believe he was back in his reef — rooted, at peace, at home.\n\nLife had been simple then. Days spent weaving colour-shows with his brethren, not for profit or spectacle but simply for the joy of creating something beautiful. Occasionally, a predator would stir things up, but the Quadrinocularis’ eyes were excellent at spotting danger. More importantly, life had been static. It was so hard to remember what the reef had been like, now that he had been gone for so long. Only after a few Smokey Blasts could he recall the feeling of the warm currents flowing around him, the hum of his brethren blending into a harmony that resonated deep in his bones. His reef had been small — 20, maybe 30, Quadrinocularis — but their synchronization had been unmatched. Even in the dead of night, there was always a soft pulse of colour, a quiet song of belonging. Then the humans came — driven by greed, curiosity, and their ceaseless need for movement and expansion — and everything fell apart. His homeworld, once serene, was now forever tainted by activity. His reef had lasted longer than most. It wasn’t one of the great northern reefs, where thousands of Quadrinocularis moved as one, their collective shimmer making the sea itself vibrate with colour. There, the ocean was alive with a never-ending symphony. But humans needed space for their buildings, their entertainment, their noise. Like many of his friends, Spooky had left to chase the Universe’s vaunted beauty — only to learn that beauty was a relative concept in the endless expanse of space.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Sa’amm pretty, right?

Discrimination, man, it’s all discrimination!” Spooky ranted.\n\nThe bartender was fluent in Quadrinocularis tentacle language, but even he struggled to parse the avalanche of signs the wobbly appendages were throwing at him all at once.\n\n“Yes, mate, it’s all discrimination,” the bartender nodded sagely. “You’ll get another chance. I’m sure there’s a brand out there looking for a pretty little thing like you.”\n\n“All I jus’ wanted was to stay in one place ’n’ look all pretty, ya know? Ain’t that what life’s ’bout?

His head began to vibrate, producing a resonant buzz.\n\nThe bartender sighed, humming noncommittally as he focused on mixing drinks for another customer.

Credit: Netflix/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nThroughout its five seasons, the Netflix show Stranger Things follows a ragtag group of teenagers and their parents as monsters from another universe — unleashed by the secret work of a government laboratory — wreak havoc on a quaint, fictional town in Indiana.\n\nDon’t worry, Demogorgons, Shadow Monsters and psychokinetically gifted 12-year-olds are strictly fictional creations. But the ‘parallel universe’ concept at the core of the show — which is set to conclude its nearly decade-long run at the end of this year — comes from a real scientific theory. And it’s been hotly debated by physicists over the past 75 or so years.\n\n‘Many worlds’ interpretation\n\nAlthough the series is as much in the realm of fantasy as science fiction, Stranger Things nods to many concepts of basic physics. Principles of electromagnetism explain haywire compasses, as well as magnets that spontaneously fall off a refrigerator. And in the third season, the characters save the world by using Planck’s constant during their quest to close a gate to the other universe, called the Upside Down (although the show uses the 2014 value for Planck’s constant, which wouldn’t have been standard in the 1980s setting).\n\nPhysicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows\n\nPerhaps the most prominent physics phenomenon mentioned in the programme, however, is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. After deducing that their friend might be stuck in the Upside Down, three pre-teen-boy protagonists ask their science teacher how they could travel there. He responds, “You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, haven’t you?”\n\nIn the 1950s, the US physicist Hugh Everett really did propose such an explanation for modern physics, and his theory has been collecting devotees ever since. Everett’s work makes sense of a concept that has long baffled quantum physicists: the measurement problem. The question is how a quantum system can seem to be in two states at once — an electron that is simultaneously in two different locations, for example — until the moment the system is observed or measured, when all at once it’s in only one of those states.\n\nThe most popular explanation for this conundrum, called the Copenhagen interpretation, says that the unobserved electron exists in a hazy quantum state of both options, described only by probabilities, until suddenly, on measurement, it ends up in one. Everett poses an almost fantastical alternative: the electron really exists in both states at once, and after the measurement, an observer sees only one state because the universe branches in two, with each outcome existing in a different world. The countless quantum states of all the world’s particles create an infinite number of universes: hence, many worlds.\n\nControversial theory\n\nFor many physicists, this idea is a bit far-fetched, particularly because if these many worlds can’t interact, then there’s no way to prove or falsify the theory, says Jorge Pullin, a theoretical physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\n\nBut for others — including Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has worked as a science adviser for science-fiction films — the many-worlds interpretation is the most elegant explanation out there. “There are a lot of people who think this is the simplest version of quantum mechanics, and it fits all the data,” he says. Of the many explanations of quantum theory, many worlds is currently the third most popular among quantum physicists, a Nature survey found earlier this year.\n\nThe sci-fi films that physicists love to watch — from Interstellar to Spider-Man",

But chromosomes take this shape only during cell division; the rest of the time, they adopt a structure that looks amorphous when viewed under a standard microscope. At the molecular level, however, chromosomes are folded in a highly non-random manner, enabling the proper execution of crucial processes such as gene expression, DNA replication and DNA repair. In their flagship paper in Nature1, members of the 4D Nucleome Consortium report the outcome of the first phase of a project that aims to systematically catalogue the 3D organization of human chromosomes in the nucleus and how this changes over time.",

          "title": "I’ve earned my PhD — what now?",
          "authors": "Miles Lizak",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nIn December 2024, I finished my PhD in biomedical chemistry in Italy, and I now find myself in that all-too-familiar early-career crisis, struggling to work out what to do next.\n\nResearch is important to me as a way to contribute meaningfully to a better, healthier world. But I have other life goals, such as becoming financially stable and starting a family, that seem incompatible with the reality of academic life. The cost of living is rising everywhere, and early-career research jobs come with low pay and short contracts.\n\nTrying to transition out of academia brings its own frustrations. After years of dedication, I’m treated by those hiring in industry as if I have no real work experience. It feels like starting from zero again.\n\nIs this early-career crisis an inevitable part of life after a PhD? How do I navigate a career when my goals and values conflict? Does my passion for research have to be all-consuming? Do I have to choose between research and a reasonable work–life balance? — A melancholy chemist\n\nThe advice\n\nYou’re not alone. These are big questions, echoed by newly minted PhD graduates around the world. This is a notoriously challenging time in the career of any young scientist, and it doesn’t mean you’re failing if you’re struggling. Nature’s careers team sought advice from three researchers on how to resolve your problem.\n\nPeter Hanenberg, vice-rector for research and innovation at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon, says: “The first step is to recognize that this crisis is something which comes with what it is to be a researcher. An academic career is, to a certain point, a matter of passion, which means it might not be just a job. But the balance should be healthy.”\n\nWhen she completed her neuroscience PhD at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, last year, Maria del Mar Cajiao Manrique knew that she didn’t want to continue in academia, but she didn’t have a clear idea of the alternatives.\n\n“From the time we start university,” she says, “we are shown there’s only one path: bachelor, master, PhD, postdoc, and then more postdocs until you become a principal investigator. It becomes internalized. If someone doesn’t feel like they fit that one path, that’s when they start having this existential crisis: What is it that I’m good at? Have I wasted the past four years on this PhD?”\n\nCajiao Manrique took a three-month contract as a visiting researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, then found a position as a medical writer in August this year. She says that going to talks at other research institutions and connecting with PhD holders who have been in similar situations has helped her to broaden her perspective and discover fresh possibilities.\n\nAn ‘agony aunt’ for working scientists\n\nLynn McAlpine, whose higher-education research at the University of Oxford, UK, focuses on PhD and post-PhD career trajectories, points out that research career paths are not as straightforward as they once were. “Now we see a shift to what we’re calling self-authored careers,” she says, “where people have to take more responsibility for figuring out what they want, what kinds of jobs there are, and find ways to integrate their life–career goals.”\n\nMcAlpine has investigated how researchers navigate their careers and personal lives after finishing their doctorates. She observed that personal life aims, such as the desire to live close to a partner, have children and achieve financial security, tend to have greater influence in shaping career paths in the long term than do professional aims — such as reaching for a prestigious job title or a dream research project.\n\n“There are myriad factors coming into play in the life journey of early-career researchers,” says McAlpine. Your priorities and your opportunities will be affected by variables such as location, age, international mobility and personal values.\n\nSometimes, she says, people seek academic careers, but realize that what they really love is the academic environment. “So maybe they find a job in academia — not as a professor, but working in a museum or university archives, or as a communications officer in a research centre.”\n\nOne PhD holder, interviewed as part of McAlpine’s research, wanted to relocate with her partner, who was also an academic, but she knew that it would be difficult for both of them to get posts in the same place. “When she got a postdoc in another country, they both moved there, and he took a professional position working in the university museums as a curator. There, he could apply his academic knowledge — until they moved again.”\n\nPerseverance\n\nMcAlpine points to perseverance as a crucial skill from a PhD programme that can be applied at the job-seeking stage. Getting a job is itself a job, she says. In her observations, whether they were looking for an industry job or an academic grant, “the people who were most successful just kept applying. They weren’t put off by not getting an answer or getting a no.” In other words, “it’s a race against your own frustration”, says Cajiao Manrique. After her PhD, she spent months applying for jobs. “I was sitting at my desk nine to five. I sent over 1,000 job applications.” She estimates that she received a response for only about one in every 50 that she sent.\n\nThen, Cajiao Manrique went on LinkedIn and started finding communities of PhD graduates who were dealing with the same issues. Through these connections, she learned that her CV was probably being discarded by AI tools. After more research and more conversations, she rewrote her CV to make it ‘industry-ready’, focusing on results rather than technicalities. For example, she changed “performed in vivo experiments to assess A using technique B” to “planned, managed and performed more than X studies, leading a team of Y people, which resulted in the publication of article Z”.",

Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving.",

Drawing from empirical data including scientific collaborations and contact networks, we demonstrate how higher-order structures reveal mechanisms of group formation, social contagion, cooperation and moral behaviour that are invisible in dyadic models. By moving beyond dyads, this approach offers a transformative lens for understanding the relational architecture of human societies, opening new directions for behavioural experiments, cultural dynamics, team science and group behaviour as well as new cross-disciplinary research.",

We use publicly available information to develop a dataset comprising 3,534 academy member profiles spanning 1905 to 2023. Using this dataset, we examine the evolving composition of China’s academic elite. Here we show that despite increasing globalization, the proportion of foreign-educated academy members has declined, while scholars from underrepresented regions—Western China and developing countries (or the Global South)—have benefited from preferential inclusive policies. Some elite-level returnee academics experience research underperformance upon returning. These trends reflect a broader shift towards academic indigenization and have wider implications for meritocracy, mobility and the sustainability of China’s talent strategies.

Participants from the Middle East and North Africa reported the lowest subjective well-being (mean 4.78, s.d. of 2.70), followed by Eastern Europe and Central Asia (mean 5.22, s.d. of 2.13). The Structural Homophobic Climate Index (β = −1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.38 to −0.99) and family-level homophobia (β = −0.84, 95% CI −0.87 to −0.81) were negatively related to LGBTQ+ well-being. Economic precarity significantly interacted with the negative association between homophobia and participants’ well-being. The weight of a country’s homophobic climate on well-being was nearly halved for economically secure participants compared with those economically deprived. Participants unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus status reported the lowest well-being (β = −0.20, 95% CI −0.23 to −0.16) controlling for homophobia.

It has recently been suggested that serial dependence can improve perceptual decision-making by mitigating uncertainty and reducing variability in perceptual estimates—leading to a superiority effect. However, this claim remains largely untested. Here we present a large-scale analysis, compiling the most extensive dataset of serial dependence studies from the past decade. Contrary to the proposed superiority effect, our findings indicate that serial dependence deteriorates rather than improves perceptual decision-making. These results challenge prevailing models and emphasize the need to rethink serial dependence and its role in human perception, cognition and behaviour.",

At test, we measured ‘in-context’ learning (generalize the rule to novel queries) and ‘in-weights’ learning (recall past experiences from memory). Manipulating the diversity and redundancy of examples in the training distribution, we found that humans and transformer networks respond in very similar ways. In both types of learner, redundancy and diversity trade off in driving in-weights and in-context learning, respectively, whereas a composite distribution with a balanced mix of redundancy and diversity allows the two strategies to be used in tandem. However, we also found that while humans benefit from dynamic training schedules that emphasize diverse examples early, transformers do not. So, while the same data-distributional properties promote learning in humans and transformer networks, only people benefit from curricula.",

          "abstract": "Organisms in nature and humans in socioeconomic systems alike face tradeoffs between selfish consumption of resources and investment in the welfare of their offspring. Previous work across the disciplines of biology and economics has sought to elucidate this process, develop a theoretical framework to solve for the optimal life history strategy, and deduce implications of these microscopic interactions for the distribution of resources at the macroscopic level. Such theory, however, has failed to account for heterogeneous conditions that various individuals and groupings of kin enjoy, like growth rate advantages for those with greater resource abundance. Furthermore, such emergent trends at the macroeconomic scale lack reconciliation with observations of power law distributions of wealth and income in vivo. We modify and extend an analytical framework here to allow for heterogeneity, and consider the long-term consequences for resource distributions with Pareto initial values. We find that power law phenomena are robust to such processes and, due to sensitivity to the form of the utility curve, higher-order uncertainty may not affect the optimal tradeoff. This stresses the impact of mechanistic choices when translating sociological findings to ecological and economic theory, and suggests future work must consider how social norms and other microscopic complexity can explain emergent patterns or disrupt trends of inequality at the macrolevel.",

          "authors": "Irina Miodownik, Ruben Solozabal, Michael P. O’Hagan, Shira Albeck, Yoav Peleg, Martin Takac, Ariel Afek",
          "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression. While most current understanding of methylation-sensitive TF binding derives from studies focused exclusively on fully methylated CpG sites, alternative forms—such as non-CpG and hemimethylation—are increasingly recognized as widespread and functionally important, particularly in embryonic stem cells and neurons. However, the direct impact of these alternative methylation contexts on TF–DNA interactions remains poorly defined, largely because current binding assays introduce methylation enzymatically, which precludes strand-specific and position-resolved measurements. Here, we systematically profile the methylation sensitivity of 18 human TFs spanning 11 structural families using chemically synthesized DNA libraries containing position-specific 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in CpG, non-CpG, and hemimethylated contexts, measured via high-throughput protein-binding microarrays. Our results reveal extensive TF sensitivity to methylation state, position, and strand orientation, including strong binding of several TFs to non-CpG and hemimethylated sites. The presence of 5mC can dramatically alter TF–DNA interactions: transforming low-affinity sites into high-affinity ones by enabling new contacts or silencing otherwise favorable motifs through steric hindrance. Genomic analyses further show that the methylation-sensitive sequences identified in vitro are represented within enhancers and regulatory elements, exhibiting distinct methylation patterns across cell types. Together, our findings uncover a previously hidden layer of methylation-dependent TF–DNA recognition, broadening the understanding of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Despite great success in certain cancers, immunotherapy made little progress in treating immune cold tumors, largely attributed to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment with elusive mechanisms. Here, we report in prostate cancer cells a positive feedback loop driven by phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) that could be targeted to render effective cytotherapy by natural killer (NK) cells. In the loop, PSAT1 increases Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) phosphorylation by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate PSAT1 transcription. Meanwhile, YBX1 also promotes human leukocyte antigens E (HLA-E) transcription to inactivate NK cells. Consequently, the PSAT1 loop serves as a buff sustaining YBX1/HLA-E expression, suppressing NK killing of prostate cancer cells. Targeting loop molecules, such as PAST1, effectively potentiates tumor suppression by NK cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Thus, our study uncovered a heretofore unrecognized nonautonomous mechanism for PSAT1, as well as a molecular buff for YBX1, to drive tumor growth by evading NK immunity, providing a promising target for NK cytotherapy of immune cold tumors.",

          "abstract": "The spring-loaded spontaneous seed dispersal mechanism known as dehiscence, has been a critical plant feature for the successful colonization of land by angiosperms. Although advantageous for seed dispersal, spontaneous dehiscence is largely an unfavorable agronomic trait which historically was selected against during selective breeding of crops to increase seed retention. In canola ( Brassica napus ), a major global oil seed crop, spontaneous or harsh weather-induced fruit shattering at maturity could lead to yield losses from 3 to 50%. Here, we show an extraembryonic role for the ABA-responsive transcription factor, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE-3 (ABI3) in controlling seed dispersal through mediating lignification of the endocarp b (en b ) layer and the lignified layer (LL) of the valves. The resistance created by these lignified layers is critical for valve opening at maturity as the tensile forces generated during silique drying converge on these fortified cell layers to trigger shatter. We further show that ABI3 functions independent of the patterning genes and functions through transcriptional regulation of NAC-domain transcription factors, NST1 and NST3 , to mediate lignin biosynthesis. Our results show that both excessive and complete absence of lignification could prevent the tensile drying forces from breaking open the pod, leading to fruit indehiscence. As a proof-of-concept, we show that BnABI3 overexpression in canola results in highly lignified, robust siliques that are shatter tolerant. Besides uncovering an extraembryonic role for ABI3, this study has identified spatial distribution and abundance of lignin in the silique valve tissue as the key determinants for silique dehiscence.",

Despite their ubiquitous presence in human populations, little is known about the anellovirus mechanism of replication in host cells. We identified the protein coded by ORF2/3 as necessary and sufficient to initiate replication from the minimal origin of replication for viruses of both the Beta- and Alphatorquevirus genera. Supporting this observation, we identified components of the polymerase alpha and BTR (Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM), topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1, and RMI2) complexes as interacting with the viral replication initiation protein (Rip) during DNA replication, suggesting a recombination-dependent mechanism of replication that uses host cell machinery to mediate dissolution of replication intermediates. Furthermore, we mapped a 92-bp minimal origin of replication sequence for the Betatorquevirus genus composed of an adenine and thymine (AT)-rich stretch and a portion of the guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich region. Altogether, this study provides insight into the mechanism by which anelloviruses manipulate host cell machinery to facilitate viral genome replication and represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex processes underlying anellovirus replication and persistent infection of these important commensal viruses.",

          "abstract": "Multidrug efflux pumps are dynamic molecular machines that drive antibiotic resistance by harnessing ion gradients to export chemically diverse substrates. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular principles underlying multidrug promiscuity and energy efficiency remain poorly understood. Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: Highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport.",

          "abstract": "Channelrhodopsins are light-gated ion channels that are used in modern neurosciences for the precise control of cellular ion fluxes by light. With a peak absorption at 585 nm, Chrimson is the most red-shifted cation-conducting ChR. It is frequently employed in multicolor experiments alongside blue light–sensitive optogenetic tools and is so far the only light-gated ion channel successfully applied in human vision restoration. However, its photoresponses to different wavelengths have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we identify multiple interconvertible dark states of Chrimson with distinct absorption and photokinetic properties. Combining electrophysiology and spectroscopy with optogenetic experiments in neurons, we unveil that this dark state heterogeneity is based on distinct protonation dynamics of the counterion complex and alternative retinal isomerization. In neurons, prolonged red illumination reduces Chrimson’s red light sensitivity, which is reflected by a blue shift of the action spectrum. Blue light pulses reverse this shift and increase the excitability in subsequent red-light flashes. This understanding of wavelength-dependent photoreactions in Chrimson will improve the design of multicolor optogenetic experiments and inform strategies for optimizing Chrimson for therapeutic applications.",

Here, we establish a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and biological scaffold-mediated tissue repair. Utilizing a conventionalized germ-free mouse, we demonstrate that scaffold implantation induces compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiome, particularly affecting amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, in a model of antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion, we show that dysbiosis disrupts key immune regulators of type 2 immunity, including reductions in eosinophils, proregenerative macrophages, and interleukin-4 (IL-4)-producing CD4 + T cells. At 6 wk post–scaffold implantation, we observed a significant decrease in myocytes with centrally located nuclei alongside an upregulation in profibrotic gene expression with antibiotic treatment.

          "abstract": "Directional sensing enables eukaryotic cells to detect spatial gradients of extracellular ligands, allowing them to orient and migrate within complex environments. Prevalent models explain this computation through a circuit where signaling species with distinct diffusion constants act incoherently on a downstream readout. Here, we propose a fundamentally different mechanism of directional sensing based on simple receptor-level processes. Our model integrates three ubiquitous receptor processes-lateral diffusion, basal ligand-independent activation, and active receptor degradation, THAT together synergize to generate robust directional sensing. In the absence of diffusion, active receptor degradation and basal activity implement an integral feedback that adapts active receptor levels to a ligand-independent set point while depleting receptors in relatively ligand-rich regions. Diffusion then redistributes receptors from regions of relatively low ligand exposure to regions with higher ligand exposure. This creates a spatial mismatch between activity and feedback that drives asymmetric receptor activity relative to the set point. The model predicts an optimal diffusion constant that maximizes polarization, reveals that receptors can encode relative rather than absolute ligand concentrations, and identifies the optimal basal activity that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in stochastic regimes. A survey of kinetic parameters across receptor families suggests that this diffusion-degradation synergy constitutes a broadly applicable, receptor-level mechanism for directional sensing.",

Fishermen are increasingly recognized as marine apex predators, and there are extensive satellite-based geolocation data on fishing vessel activities. Despite this potential, the utility of fishermen as ecosystem sentinels remains unexamined. Using one million vessel positions from 600 U.S. vessels, we assess the effectiveness of fishermen as sentinels for the ecological impacts of Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves on tuna distribution and availability. Fishermen were skillful predictors of extreme northward shifts for albacore and bluefin tunas, and extreme inshore shifts for albacore. Fishermen signaled low albacore availability over a year in advance of a formal fisheries disaster declaration request. Notably, fishermen also indicated true negatives during marine heatwaves: periods of anomalous warming but stable tuna distribution and availability. This information could aid management of transboundary shifts during marine heatwaves of albacore from U.S. to Canadian waters and bluefin from Mexican to U.S. waters. Advanced warning of fisheries disasters could expedite the delivery of relief funds for struggling communities. The number of Earth-orbiting satellites is exponentially rising, generating a wealth of geospatial information on fishing vessels. This rich and growing resource can signal otherwise unobserved ecological impacts, aiding rapid management responses to climate extremes.",

          "abstract": "The ability to synthesize essential molecules is sometimes lost in evolution. A classic example is ascorbate (vitamin C), which is synthesized in most animals by L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), an enzyme lost multiple independent times in animal evolution. This event is thought to be evolutionarily neutral; however, GULO- deficient animals including humans need to obtain ascorbate from their diet and are prone to ascorbate deficiency and scurvy. We therefore hypothesized that this disadvantage of GULO loss is offset by physiological benefits. Here, we show that ascorbate deficiency benefits mice infected with schistosome parasites, which cause schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease that afflicts 250 million people. Schistosoma mansoni worms required host ascorbate to produce eggs in vivo. Consequently, ascorbate-deficient mice were protected from schistosomiasis pathologies and transmission. Intermittent ascorbate deficiency protected Gulo -deficient mice from both scurvy and schistosomiasis mortality. The effects of ascorbate on schistosome reproduction were mediated by ascorbate-dependent histone demethylation which promoted vitellocyte development in female schistosomes. We propose that vitamin deficiencies are not always detrimental but can protect animals from pathogens which need to obtain vitamins from their host.",

Past research has emphasized particle entrainment by raindrop splash at impact. Here, we report lab and field observations, that uncover a surprisingly rich and efficient postimpact phase. Raindrops impacting a dry, sloping, granular bed spontaneously form “sandballs;” drops of dense suspensions that can grow in mass to a jammed state by sediment entrainment, as they roll downhill like snowballs and magnify soil erosion. Careful control of drop conditions reveals two stable sandball morphologies: peanut-like shapes linked to hydrodynamic instabilities and toroidal forms that undergo mechanical locking from extreme sediment loading, which have potential implications for related problems in bioengineering, pharmaceuticals, and snow physics.",

          "abstract": "Continuous biomarker monitoring and on-demand therapy are essential for chronic disease management, with diabetes being a key example. Although continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps are moving toward a closed-loop system, it remains difficult to predict how device design influences system performance. Traditional optimization methods are inefficient and empirical: Data-driven algorithms lack interpretability, trial-and-error design is time-consuming, and first-principle models are difficult to integrate at the system level. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-based framework which integrates microneedle (MN) designs for sensing and therapy with a physiological model of glycemic control. The framework builds compact relationships showing how material, chemical, and geometrical features affect key metrics such as response time, extraction flux, and insulin delivery rate. Specifically, we develop a theory for three sensing MN types (hollow, porous/swellable, and nanostructured MNs) and one therapeutic patch (electro-termo-mechanical device) to create a predictive model for glycemic regulation. By linking device design to system behavior across time and spatial scales, we examine the framework in three cases: How disease progression, MN design, and MN sensitivity affect plasma glucose levels and time-in-range metrics. This work establishes the foundation for a physics-based digital twin for diabetes management, complementing ML, experiments, and numerical models. More broadly, it streamlines patch design, minimizing glycemic events and trial-and-error in next-generation CGM technology.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is distributed across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that behaviors relying on WM arise from interactions between these regions. In a recent study, we found that during delayed comparison tasks, the first stimulus is not represented veridically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but instead is encoded in a systematically warped manner–biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. This neural distortion, which emerges already during the stimulus presentation and persists throughout the delay period, closely mirrors a contraction bias observed in behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral responses could be explained by a Bayesian observer model, in which the observer integrates prior expectations with noisy sensory inputs. These results suggest that the geometry of PFC neural trajectories embodies Bayesian estimates that underlie biased decisions. Here, we investigate whether the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)–a lower-level sensory area also implicated in tactile WM–exhibits a similar encoding structure. Our analyses reveal that although WM-related signals in S2 are less robust than in PFC, the neural state space in S2 shares key geometric features with that of PFC, including a similarly warped representation of stimulus values. These findings suggest that perceptual biases may originate early in the cortical processing stream and are not exclusively shaped by higher-order associative areas. More broadly, our results support a distributed organization of representational warping, in which even sensory areas contribute to the formation of bias-prone representations that guide behavior.",

          "abstract": "Surgery remains the mainstay treatment for many kinds of solid tumors, while tumor recurrence frequently occurs. Adjuvant therapy can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve the prognosis of surgery. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy can be leveraged as an alternative adjuvant therapy to clear residual cancer cells and prevent tumor recurrence. However, systemic administration of CAR-T often results in insufficient tumor infiltration and side effects to normal organs. Given that platelets can preferentially accumulate at postsurgical wounds, we proposed that conjugating platelets to CAR-T cells may enhance the accumulation of the CAR-T cells within the surgical bed after the resection of solid tumors. In this study, we conjugated platelets to B7-H3.CAR-T cells via click chemistry. In postsurgical human pancreatic cancer mouse models, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced tumor infiltration and elevated antitumor cytokine levels, resulting in superior suppression effects on tumor recurrence, compared with CAR-T cells. Additionally, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting metastasis and prolonging the survival time of the mice in postsurgical triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. Mechanistic studies revealed that platelet activation could improve the CAR-T cell activity and persistence, as evidenced by an upregulation of genes associated with T cell infiltration and a downregulation of genes related to T cell exhaustion. Finally, we further validated the biosafety profile and efficacy of platelet-CAR-T in a postsurgical patient-derived xenograft TNBC-bearing humanized mouse model. The results suggested that the CAR-T cell strengthened by platelet engineering is a promising adjuvant therapy against postsurgical tumor recurrence.",

While the spatial scale of masting synchrony is well documented, it remains unclear how synchrony differs between years of seed abundance and failure, and how such dynamics extend across species and space. These gaps are important to resolve, as they determine the magnitude and spatial extent of masting effects on food webs. Using a 36-y dataset from 431 sites spanning seven dominant tree species in temperate Europe, we provide evidence that seed failures are more spatially synchronized than mast peaks, indicating that regional coherence in seed production is structured primarily by reproductive failure. Among-species synchrony was localized. This suggests that in temperate forests, mobile seed consumers are unlikely to experience coordinated starvation–satiation cycles, in contrast to highly synchronous tropical dipterocarp systems. From an applied perspective, failure years affect seed availability over broad regions, limiting sourcing options for afforestation and restoration, and underscoring the value of spatially explicit masting forecasting. Because mast peaks and failures differ fundamentally in their food web consequences, our findings highlight the need to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of synchronized seed scarcity.",

          "abstract": "The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is characterized by poorly understood complex multiannual cycles. The origins of these cycles have long been debated, and multiple explanations of varying complexity have been suggested. Using Bayesian methods, we fit a dynamical model to half a century of M. pneumoniae surveillance data from Denmark (1958 to 1995, 2010 to 2025) and uncover a parsimonious explanation for the persistent cycles, based on the theory of quasicycles. The period of the multiannual cycle (approx. 5 y in Denmark) is explained by susceptible replenishment due, primarily, to loss of immunity. While an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, unable to reproduce the persistent cycles. We find that environmental stochasticity (e.g., varying contact rates) stabilizes the multiannual cycles and so does demographic noise, at least in smaller or incompletely mixing populations. The temporary disappearance of cycles during 1979 to 1985 is explained as a consequence of stochastic mode-hopping. The circulation of M. pneumoniae was recently disrupted by COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), providing a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations for long-term prediction. More generally, our findings provide further evidence for the role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Aducanumab, a human IgG1 antibody with plaque-clearing effects and modest clinical benefit, binds selectively to aggregated Aβ via the N-terminal region. Yet, the molecular details of how the antibody engages Aβ 1-42 fibrils remain unresolved. Using magic-angle spinning NMR, we show that binding of aducanumab preserves the overall architecture of the Aβ 1-42 fibril core while inducing significant structural and dynamic perturbations in the N-terminal region. Antibody binding markedly reduces flexibility in this domain, with the appearance of side-chain resonances from residues D1, E3, and histidine (likely H6) in dipolar-based experiments. These side chains—previously observed in scalar-coupling spectra of the unbound state—indicate rigidification of residues that were dynamic. The interaction extends to S8 and Y10, indicating broader fibril engagement than the minimal epitope (residues 3 to 7) defined in fragment-based studies. Perturbations in the C-terminal segment (G37–A42) are consistent with its spatial proximity to the antibody-bound N termini of neighboring monomers. Cryo-TEM images reveal fibrils bundling in the presence of aducanumab, consistent with lateral association via antibody cross-linking, supporting a model where surface coating and steric hindrance suppress secondary nucleation. This mode of action restricts monomer access to catalytic sites on the fibril surface, resulting in partial inhibition (~threefold reduction) of secondary nucleation. The effect depends on high avidity and relatively high stoichiometry but is ultimately limited by antibody size relative to N-terminal spacing along the fibril. These findings provide atomic-level insights into aducanumab’s binding mode and supply a structural framework for understanding antibody-mediated fibril recognition and for guiding next-generation therapies targeting Aβ aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Rabies, caused by the neurotropic lyssavirus rabies virus (RABV), is nearly 100% fatal after symptom onset. A fundamental challenge for rabies therapy is that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents peripherally administered neutralizing antibodies from entering the central nervous system (CNS) to clear the infection. In this study, we initially generated four human–mouse chimeric antibodies with preserved neutralizing potency against RABV to increase its translational potential. To achieve brain antibody delivery, we conjugated a lead chimeric antibody (7A3-H) to different cell-penetrating peptides with potential BBB-penetrating capacity (RVG, TGN, THR, and SynB1). In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that SynB1 conjugation significantly outperformed conjugation with the other peptides in terms of BBB penetration for brain antibody delivery. Furthermore, a triple-antibody cocktail (targeting epitopes II/III/IV of RABV-G) conjugated to SynB1 resulted in 80% survival in mice infected with lethal challenge virus standard (CVS) or dog-originated rabies virus (DRV) strains when it was administered at 5 dpi (when CNS invasion and symptoms were evident). In contrast, the unconjugated cocktail provided only 20% (CVS) or 0% (DRV) survival. Together, these data demonstrated that SynB1-mediated BBB penetration dramatically improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti-RABV antibodies, enabling post-symptom rescue of rabies. This antibody–peptide conjugation strategy provides a proof of concept for advancing rabies therapy, specifically by leveraging peptide-mediated enhancement of BBB penetration.",

          "abstract": "The vertebrate nervous system is traditionally parceled topographically into central and peripheral divisions. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) in turn is commonly viewed functionally as a set of nerves and ganglia transmitting input and output signals between the central nervous system (CNS) and other bodily systems to regulate physiology and behavior. Here, we collate and analyze neuroanatomical data on putative directed and weighted axonal connections between peripheral ganglia in a mammal (rat). The resulting network reveals a sparse but broad intra-PNS neuronal architecture with over 100 connections among 52 of the 84 sensory and autonomic ganglia identified. Local network differentiation of the associated 52×52 connection matrix (connectome) was examined with cluster analysis. It identified 22 modules (subsystems or subnetworks) within a six-level nested hierarchy, including seven first-order modules and 14 end modules, spatially distributed from rostral to caudal along the CNS–body axis. Global features of the intra-PNS neuronal network based on node (ganglion) centrality measures identified two hubs (the bilateral myenteric plexus ganglia that control digestive tract functionality), no rich club, and small-world properties comparable to those reported for the rat brain. These findings suggest that the PNS is not merely a series of parallel nerves and associated ganglia but instead forms a structured and recurrently connected neuronal network. Its full extent and functional relevance remain to be elucidated using contemporary structure–function neuroscience approaches.",

          "abstract": "Primate societies rely on the production and interpretation of social signals, in particular those displayed by the face. Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here, we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional MRI (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multichannel recordings from key facial motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial facial motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all facial motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral facial motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, whereas during voluntary chewing, coupling occurs at lower frequencies. These functional interactions varied across facial movement types. Thus, at the cortical level, the control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an interacting sensorimotor network.",

The receptors colocalize widely at inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord and in the brainstem due to their interaction with an overlapping binding site of the synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, pointing to a direct competition between the different receptor types. We have put this hypothesis to the test using single-molecule approaches to measure receptor–gephyrin interactions in cells and in vitro. We explored the effects of receptor competition at inhibitory synapses in living neurons by measuring the change in the accumulation and effective stabilization energy of glycine receptors in the presence of interfering GABA receptor complexes through single-molecule tracking and diffusion analysis. Second, using molecular tweezers, we quantified the thermodynamic properties of receptor–gephyrin binding, demonstrating direct and reversible competition through the addition of interacting peptides in solution. The relatively low affinity of GABA receptor subunits for gephyrin compared to the glycine receptor raises interesting questions about the role of this competition in synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that GABA and glycine receptor competition constitutes a molecular system designed to reconcile synapse stability and plasticity at mixed inhibitory synapses.",

It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between net buoyancy and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and net buoyancy is a mechanism driving pattern formation.",

Previous studies have linked the function of a single Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KZFP), ZFP189, in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the regulation of transposable elements (TEs), immune genes, and social behaviors. Here, we expand the scope of inquiry to explore the relationship between collective PFC KZFP function and social behaviors by altering the function of the cognate KZFP interacting protein TRIM28 within the PFC of male and female mice. We reprogrammed natural TRIM28 WT by replacing the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive domain with a synthetic, enhanced transcriptional activation domain VP64-p65-Rta (TRIM28 VPR ) or by excising the transcriptional regulatory domain (TRIM28 NFD ). Upon intra-PFC viral-mediated delivery of TRIM28 variants, we observed that inversion of TRIM28 transcriptional control via HSV-TRIM28 VPR selectively produced deficits in social behaviors, without affecting nonsocial behaviors. RNA sequencing of manipulated PFC revealed that HSV-TRIM28 VPR drove transcriptional escape of all classes of TEs, particularly those located within intronic and enhancer regions proximal to downregulated immune genes. HSV-TRIM28 VPR -mediated social deficits were reversible by intra-PFC repletion of interferon cytokines. These data point to PFC KZFP–TRIM28 interactions as necessary to stabilize genomic TEs to enable cis -regulation of key immune gene expression, which enhances organismal capacity for complex, prosocial behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) has regained research prominence as deep learning advancements accelerate the search for analytical models from observational data. However, the vast search space often hinders existing algorithms to yield complex analytical expressions. We present SR-LLM, an SR framework integrating retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms based on large language models (LLM) to achieve incremental learning. Specifically, our framework is capable of leveraging accumulated prior knowledge and past exploration results from external knowledge bases to retrieve the most relevant information for current regression tasks. It first composes prior information into small symbolic groups with the assistance of the LLMs and then utilizes deep reinforcement learning to combine these groups to formulate complex yet explainable analytic expressions that are more easily understood by humans. The capability for efficient knowledge utilization enables our framework to integrate all previous human experiences and exploration results, effectively learning by standing on the shoulders of giants. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we not only test the framework on popular symbolic regression benchmarks but also extend its application to a domain where the explicit optimal model remains controversial: how to analytically describe human car-following behavior based on observed vehicle trajectories? Experiments confirm that our method outperforms on standard benchmarks, successfully rediscovers famous traditional car-following models and discovers new models from empirical trajectory data, achieving both fitting effectiveness and interpretability.",

          "abstract": "Cereal crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, and barley) constituted the major component of global human diet and fundamentally changed human society since the dawn of agriculture around 12,000 y ago. Originated and domesticated in different continents and environments, cereal crops vary significantly in their salt tolerance. The High-Affinity K + Transporter1;5s (HKT1;5s) predominately regulate Na + accumulation and salt tolerance in salt-sensitive cereal crops by mediating shoot-to-root Na + exclusion. However, HvHKT1;5 paradoxically promotes root-to-shoot Na + translocation in salt-tolerant barley. Therefore, unravelling the regulatory mechanisms of HvHKT1;5 is critical to understanding the molecular basis of salt tolerance in barley. Here, we demonstrated that a microRNA164d-HvNAC92-HvHKT1;5 module improves salt tolerance via reduced shoot Na + accumulation and increased K + retention in barley, whereas miR164d suppresses HvNAC92 transcription factor to directly downregulate HvHKT1;5 expression. Under salinity condition, the MIR164d -OE, Hvnac92 , and Hvhkt1;5 lines showed significantly reduced root-to-shoot Na + translocation and shoot Na + content compared with the wild-type. In conclusion, we resolve the species-specific function of HKT1;5s in cereal crops by establishing miRNA-guided Na + and K + transport regulation as a regulatory framework for engineering salt-tolerant crops.",

However, it remains unclear whether other transcriptional programs operate beyond the central androgen/AR signaling in promoting WD development. We found that mesenchyme-specific deletion of the transcription factor Gata2 resulted in defective epididymal coiling in the corpus and caudal regions. The defective coiling did not result from androgen signaling deficiency, as there were no abnormalities in testicular androgen production, AR/ Ar expression, or androgen-responsive genes, and dihydrotestosterone supplementation did not restore epididymal coiling in cultured WDs. Instead, Gata2 deletion led to the loss of epididymal identity, as evidenced by the reduced expression of epididymal mesenchymal markers. The epididymal defect persisted into adulthood, with the uncoiled corpus and caudal epididymis exhibiting abnormal epithelial morphology and lumen environments, resulting in an unfavorable environment for sperm storage. Our results demonstrate the androgen-independent role of mesenchymal GATA2 in promoting epididymal development and highlight the importance of proper fetal development in male reproduction.",

In this paper, we test whether local circuits alone can generate predictive signals by training a recurrent spiking network using local plasticity rules.

We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge 2 / 3 anyons leads to a chiral superconductor through a direct second-order transition for a smooth random potential with long-wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. Close to the transition, we show that the superconducting ground state is an “Anomalous Vortex Glass” stabilized in the absence of an external magnetic field. For short-wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge 1 / 3 anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the resulting phase is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with ρ xy = h / e 2 . At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe 2 near ν = 2 / 3 and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.",

Here we address this question from the perspective of B cells that comprise 5 to 10% of the human circulating repertoire, expressing self-reactive surface immunoglobulins employing the IGHV4-34 heavy chain variable element. Using gene targeting to construct mice expressing a representative human IGHV4-34 antibody on the surface of many B cells, we show these cells are prevented from autoantibody secretion by B cell clonal anergy marked by downregulation of surface IgM, induction of tolerance-response mRNAs, and exclusion from the marginal zone and B1 cell subsets. This functionally tolerant state is overridden when the IGHV4-34 B cells cross-react with a virus, which stimulates the self-reactive B cells to hypermutate in germinal centers. Within 16 d of infection, 99% of daughter cells have acquired one of five heavy chain mutations that diminish binding to self but preserve virus binding, and 33% had combined 2 or 3 of these mutations to make their antibodies genetically self-tolerant and virus specific. These results demonstrate, from the perspective of a pathologically important human autoantibody class and the world’s most successful virus vaccine, how human antibody specificity is sculpted in the progeny of anergic B cells to yield antibodies that bind a virus but not self.",

Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here, we report an untargeted, longitudinal plasma metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. Targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a preexisting contributor to disease trajectory—patients that show aberrant one-carbon metabolite levels and that are homozygous for the MTHFR C677T, have higher incidence of severe COVID.

          "abstract": "α-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered neuronal protein that forms an amphipathic helix when it peripherally binds to lipid membranes. This membrane interaction is integral to the protein’s function but is also associated with its dysfunction. Numerous membrane parameters have been identified to promote α-synuclein binding such as high negative charge and low lipid-packing density, which corresponds to greater lipid-packing defects—increased spacing between lipids conferred through curvature, unsaturation, or small headgroups. Despite α-synuclein’s established preference for negatively charged membranes with packing defects, the specific effects that each parameter has on this interaction remains underexplored. With increasing links between α-synuclein-associated diseases and changes in lipid composition, it has become more important to delineate how changes in membrane parameters affect α-synuclein membrane-interactions. Here, we demonstrate using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy that while net negative charge does increase the density of α-synuclein bound to a membrane, lipid-packing defects alone are sufficient for α-synuclein to insert. Not only do our results establish a lipid-packing defect requirement for α-synuclein, but they also reveal a packing defect-dependent shift in the ensemble of binding modes of the protein favoring the insertion of the end of its binding domain—a binding mode which has previously been linked to disease mutants of the protein. Overall, this work establishes the significance of lipid-packing defects in contrast to net negative charge for α-synuclein–membrane binding and proposes a lipid-compositionally dependent shift in α-synuclein’s ensemble of bound conformations, which may be relevant for the protein’s function and dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Humanoid robots with advanced sensory capabilities are increasingly demanded for empathetic, close-contact interactions with humans. Electronic skin (E-skin) is a key enabling technology for such tactile perception. However, current E-skins are limited to basic tactile sensing with simple circuit architecture. Here, we introduce a neuromorphic robotic e-skin (NRE-skin) that not only provides fundamental tactile sensing but also integrates advanced features, such as active pain and injury detection. The NRE-skin encodes dynamic tactile stimuli into neural-like pulse trains and features active pain detection that triggers protective reflexes. Additionally, its injury sensing and modular design enable precise localization of damaged areas and rapid replacement of affected skin. By emulating human sensory and protective systems, the NRE-skin facilitates more natural and safer human–robot interactions.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical recovery of heavy metals from acid mine drainage (AMD) offers a sustainable solution to global AMD contamination, yet remains challenged by thermodynamic and kinetic barriers in reducing redox-active metals with negative standard reduction potentials (E θ &lt; 0 V), especially at low concentrations. Here, using Cd as a model system, we demonstrate that the formation of a metastable intermediate, Cd 2 SO 4 (OH) 2 , plays a crucial role in facilitating the efficient electrochemical reduction of low-concentration Cd(II) to metallic Cd 0 in acidic solutions. A combination of experimental and theoretical analyses reveals that in situ generated OH − at the cathode, in conjunction with bulk-phase SO 4 2− , drives the formation of this metal-inorganic complex, which mediates electron transfer by overcoming redox limitations. By optimizing flow dynamics and incorporating hierarchical electrode configurations, we enhance intermediate formation and achieve 96.81% Cd recovery from real AMD, with effluent Cd concentrations below 0.5 mg L −1 . Economic analysis estimates a net-positive return of 2.32 CNY per ton of treated AMD. Life cycle assessment further shows that the electroextraction process substantially outperforms lime neutralization with respect to all major environmental indicators. This work establishes a mechanistically driven, economically viable, and environmentally superior strategy for recovering valuable metals from AMD, advancing the prospects of circular resource recovery and sustainable wastewater management.",

          "abstract": "The stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), crucial for predicting future sea-level rise, is threatened by ocean-forced melting in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. While some geological records and ice-sheet models suggest WAIS retreat during past warm periods, reliable data constraining the extent of retreat are lacking. Detrital Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope data of sediments recently drilled at International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1532 on the Amundsen Sea continental rise manifest repeated alternations in sediment provenance during glacial–interglacial cycles of the Pliocene (5.33 to 2.58 Mya), a time warmer than present. The variations reflect large fluctuations in WAIS extent on the Antarctic continent. A unique high Pb/low ε Nd signature of sediments found at the onset of glacial intervals (3.88, 3.6, and 3.33 Ma) is attributed to the supply of detritus sourced from plutonic rocks located in the West Antarctic interior. Its isotopic signature at Site U1532 indicates major inland retreat of the WAIS during the preceding interglacials. During peak interglacials, the ice margin had retreated inland, and icebergs rafted and deposited inland-sourced detritus over 500 km across the Amundsen Sea shelf. Subsequent readvance of grounded ice then “bulldozed” these inland-derived fine-grained sediments from the shelf down to the continental slope and rise, resulting in a high Pb/low ε Nd peak in the rise sediments. Our continuous Pliocene records provide conclusive evidence for at least five major inland retreat events of the WAIS, highlighting the significant vulnerability of the WAIS to ongoing warming.",

          "abstract": "We all likely agree that tactile experience contributes to the emergence of the feeling of ownership over one’s own body. Is the opposite true? We answered this question by testing whether and how the sense of body ownership gates our tactile experience. In two experiments, we exploited a well-known multisensory illusion (Rubber Hand Illusion) to induce participants to feel a fake hand as belonging to their body, while their own hand was left in a disembodiment state (illusory-phases). After each illusory phase, a tactile stimulus was delivered to either the fake (embodied) hand or the real (disembodied) hand (testing-phases). Experiment 1 shows that the illusory phase significantly modulates the subjective feeling of touch experienced in the testing-phase, increasing tactile sensations when participants observed the fake (embodied) hand being touched (visual-touch), and decreasing them when the real (disembodied) hand was touched (real-touch). Experiment 2 investigated, by using TMS-EEG, the neural mechanism supporting this diametrical modulation of subjective feeling of touch, focusing on alpha-band oscillatory networks as the neural correlate of somatosensory awareness. S1 alpha-band connectivity fully matches the behavioral results, significantly increasing in visual-touch and decreasing in real-touch. In both experiments, a greater embodiment experienced in the illusory-phase significantly predicted higher behavioral and neurofunctional responses to visual-touch and lower responses to real-touch in the testing-phase. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the sense of body ownership exerts a top-down modulation on tactile awareness and may do so by increasing or decreasing the strength of the somatosensory network involved in tactile awareness.",

          "abstract": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is a primary output for basal ganglia signaling. It plays an important role in the control of movement, integrating inputs from upstream structures in the basal ganglia, before sending organized projections to a range of targets in the midbrain, brainstem, and thalamus. Here, we present a detailed in silico model of the mouse SNr, including its major afferent inputs. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of SNr neurons are characterized in acute brain slices via whole cell patch-clamp recordings and morphological reconstruction. Using reconstructed morphologies, multicompartmental models of single neurons are instantiated within the NEURON simulation environment and populated with relevant modeled ion channels. Model parameters are optimized via an evolutionary algorithm, such that simulated neurons faithfully reproduce recorded electrophysiological behavior. Using the simulation infrastructure software Snudda , single neuron models are incorporated into a circuit-level model, where the sparse connectivity within the SNr is recreated. We simulate the mouse SNr at scale, featuring realistic volumes and neuronal density. The unique synaptic properties and activity patterns of different afferent sources are captured in silico. Born out of ex vivo data, our model reproduces in vivo firing patterns. Our simulations suggest that paradoxical activity increases in response to experimental inhibition can be explained by lateral connectivity. In addition, our model predicts the functional implications of characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. The model can be extended to include additional inputs and be connected with existing models of upstream basal ganglia nuclei to further explore circuit dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Intercalary meristems (IcMs), specialized developmental zones that drive rapid stem elongation in monocots, exhibit distinct spatiotemporal dynamics; however, their genetic basis remains poorly understood due to their transient activity and cellular heterogeneity. Moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis )—with its exceptional daily growth rates of up to 114.5 cm, prolonged IcM activity spanning 45 to 60 d, and large, accessible culm structure—provides an ideal system for building a comprehensive IcM cell atlas. Here, we integrated a chromosome-level genome assembly of Moso bamboo with a high-resolution anatomical atlas to delineate three critical developmental stages of IcM activity: the initial cell division phase (ID), the rapid cell division phase (RD), and the rapid cell elongation phase (RE). By combining single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we reconstructed a dynamic single-nucleus transcriptomic continuum spanning from proliferative to elongation states. Multiomics integration, along with in situ hybridization and ultrastructural imaging, identified IcM cells as short-columnar cells adjacent to elongating ground tissue parenchyma (Gp) cells, with the IcM1 subpopulation functioning as stem-like cells essential for maintaining the proliferative capacity. Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed transcriptional transitions from stem-like IcM states to differentiated Gp cells. Functional experiments revealed that clrGene008562 , a WOX2 homolog, enhances callus regeneration, indicating its potential role in promoting cell division and differentiation processes relevant to IcM development. These findings provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular framework for understanding IcM function and offer valuable multiomics resources for advancing meristem research in bamboo and other Poaceae species.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) gradually demonstrate their potential to boost productivity and become integral tools for problem-solving in daily life worldwide, understanding the linguistic inequalities they introduce is becoming increasingly important. Prior research has primarily focused on static analyses of disparities in existing knowledge and capabilities of LLMs across languages. However, LLMs are continuously evolving, acquiring new knowledge to provide current, relevant responses and deliver precise, expert-level answers in specific domains. Investigating linguistic inequalities within this dynamic learning process is, therefore, also essential. In this paper, we explore inequalities in new knowledge learning by LLMs across different languages and four key dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, prioritization, and robustness. Through extensive experiments in both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, with proprietary and open-source models, we reveal four key findings: 1) LLMs face greater challenges in efficiently and accurately learning new knowledge in lower-resource languages; 2) knowledge learned by LLMs tends to be more easily transferred to higher-resource languages than to lower-resource ones; 3) new knowledge in higher-resource languages is more likely to be retained and prioritized; and 4) LLMs are more robust against incorrect or misleading information in higher-resource languages. We further analyze the underlying causes of these inequalities from linguistic perspectives, pretraining characteristics, and tokenizer design, and propose a preliminary mitigation strategy through the lens of linguistic neurons. This work highlights the urgent need to recognize and address emerging linguistic inequalities in the development of LLMs.",

          "abstract": "The ability to represent locations across multiple dimensions of space is a core function of cognitive maps. While the influence of boundary-dependent environmental geometry on spatial representations has been extensively studied in 2D spaces, less is known about the role of boundaries for volumetric spatial memory. Research in humans and other animals has demonstrated distinct processing of the vertical and horizontal spatial dimensions, likely related to species-specific modes of locomotion. Here, we investigate whether different locomotion modes, flying and walking, affect the use of vertical boundaries, leading to possibly distinct volumetric representations. In a Virtual Reality experiment, human participants memorized objects within a symmetric 3D enclosure, and then were asked to replace them in either the familiar or geometrically deformed environments. We found that the flying group exhibited lower vertical than horizontal spatial memory precision, whereas the walking group showed the opposite pattern, an effect related to using their body axis as a vertical “ruler”. Within deformed environments, object replacements in the flying group followed the predictions from a 3D-extended boundary-vector-cell-like computational model of spatial mapping that treated all boundaries equally, whereas those in the walking condition favored a modified model that prioritized the ground boundary. Our findings suggest that gravity-related movement constraints promote different utilization of geometric and body-related cues, resulting in flexible representations of volumetric space.",

          "abstract": "Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method whereby randomly oriented chiral molecules are irradiated by circularly polarized light (CPL), photoionizing electrons, which are measured in a momentum-resolved manner. This scheme permits chiral light–matter interactions within the electric-dipole approximation (avoiding weak magnetic-dipole interactions), yielding huge chiral signals in the form of a forward–backward asymmetry in photoemission. Recently, more intricate realizations of PECD have been explored where the CPL is replaced with elaborate polarization-tailored light (e.g., bichromatic, noncollinear, etc.), some of which do not even require circularly polarized components, but still lead to massive chiral signals. However, the connection between generalized symmetries and asymmetries of the laser drive and selection rules in PECD have not yet been derived. Here, we formulate this connection analytically from group theory, also predicting two previously unknown selection rules for PECD from fields with dynamical inversion and improper-rotational symmetries. We further propose bichromatic bielliptical fields for breaking symmetries in typical spectra, yielding potentially more information for ultrafast-resolved measurements. We numerically demonstrate all of our results with state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations in the archetypal chiral molecule, Bromochlorofluoromethane, providing predictions for experiments. Our work presents a roadmap for analyzing PECD from tailored light and resolves a long-standing issue in the field. It should motivate theoretical and experimental investigations in novel PECD set-ups.",

          "abstract": "Some patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) make a full recovery, while others remain severely disabled. Accurate prognostication is important, because withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy based on perceived poor prognosis is the leading cause of death after TBI. Synchronized activity between brain regions, measurable with resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), may underlie neurological recovery. However, which functional connections are critical for recovery, and whether functional connectivity measured shortly after brain injury predicts long-term recovery, is unknown. Here, we analyzed data from three prospective cohorts of patients with moderate or severe TBI (N = 116 patients; 134 controls) who underwent rs-fMRI shortly after injury. The strongest predictor of 6-mo functional outcomes in the Training Cohort (mean cross validation AUC 0.94) and independent Testing Cohort (AUC 0.78; P = 0.001) was functional connectivity between three pairs of brain regions from functionally distinct networks, two of which were anticorrelated. Results were robust to controlling for sedation ( P = 0.02) and level of consciousness at time of MRI ( P = 0.02). Finally, preserved anticorrelations improved the leave-one-out outcome prediction accuracy of an established prognostic score (AUC 0.90 vs. 0.80; P = 0.02). Preserved functional anticorrelations in acutely traumatized brains identify patients with the neurological substrate required for recovery. This biomarker can inform prognostic decisions in patients at high risk for death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.",

          "abstract": "Electrochemical ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions via calcium-mediated nitrogen fixation holds considerable promise but is impeded by fundamental gaps such as poor gas–liquid interface stability, sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics, and instability of the critical intermediate calcium nitride. To systematically address these barriers, we i) introduced a high surface-area Ni-based anode specifically selected for enhancing HOR kinetics and minimizing solvent oxidation; ii) substituted the conventionally used tetrahydrofuran solvent with dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve chemical stability; and iii) developed a tailored flow cell configuration to enhance gas–liquid mass transport and stabilize reaction intermediates. Employing in-situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we provided direct evidence of stabilized calcium nitride formation, elucidating the crucial roles of solvent stability and electrode composition in sustaining reactive intermediates. As a result of these combined innovations, our system demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 34.35 ± 1.76% in short-term tests and sustaining ~20% FE over extended continuous operation (~56 h). At elevated current densities, the improved gas–liquid interface stability enables robust ammonia production, reaching partial current densities of approximately 219 mA cm − 2 at ~29% FE. Isotope-labeling studies with 15 N 2 confirmed the direct electroreduction of N 2 , while kinetic analyses underscored the impact of anode material selection on HOR efficiency and overall electrochemical stability.

SpARC-map uses only routine microbiology techniques, with no reliance on specialized instrumentation, dedicated reagents, or reconstituting protein complexes in vitro. SpARC-map can be tuned to detect PPIs over a broad range of affinities, multiplexed to probe multiple PPIs in parallel, and its nonspecific background can be precisely measured, enabling the sensitive detection of weak PPIs. Using SpARC-map, we recover known PPI interfaces in the p21–PCNA, p53–MDM2, and MYC–MAX complexes. We also use SpARC-map to probe the purinosome, the weakly bound complex of six purine biosynthetic enzymes, where no PPI interfaces are known. There, we identify interfaces that satisfy structural requirements for substrate channeling, as well as protein surfaces that participate in multiple distinct interactions, which we validate using site-specific photocrosslinking in live human cells.

          "authors": "Nidhi Vijayan, John Briseño, Oleg Simakov, Spencer V. Nyholm",
          "abstract": "Many animals have multiple organs or tissues that are colonized by diverse microbiota. The female Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes , has two organs with distinct symbiotic communities: the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) and the light organ (LO). The ANG hosts a bacterial consortium, whereas the LO has a binary relationship with Vibrio fischeri , housed in extracellular crypt spaces as part of the central core (CC). To understand how the host maintains distinct symbiotic communities, we used transcriptomics to identify immune-related genes that are uniquely and similarly expressed in the ANG and LO-CC compared to organs without a known microbiota. Genes such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins EsPGRP2 and EsPGRP3, cathepsin-Z, alkaline phosphatase, and acidic phospholipase exhibited significant upregulation in the symbiotic organs compared to other tissues like gills, skin, mantle, optic lobe, ovaries, and brain. Moreover, EsPGRP2 displayed distinct localization patterns within the ANG, inversely correlating with bacterial presence, whereas the protein was colocalized with V. fischeri in the LO-CC. Notably, 10 different galaxins (EsGal) were uniquely highly expressed in both the ANG and LO-CC, with EsGal1 messenger RNA predominantly localized to the LO-CC epithelium, while EsGal2 and EsGal3 were primarily found in the epithelia of ANG tubules. Furthermore, antimicrobial assays using partial peptides derived from EsGal1 and EsGal2 showed varying and distinct patterns of inhibitory activity for these peptides. In summary, our findings identify similar immune gene families expressed across functionally distinct symbiotic organs in E. scolopes , suggesting that common immunomodulatory factors may maintain distinct symbiotic niches in the host.",

The series has been validated through comparison with early instrumental data from 1884 to 1911 as well as with other reconstructions. TCs in the post-1911 period were also examined and a 653-y long (1368–2020) North Western Pacific TC chronology was studied. The peak TC frequency occurred in the 1650–1680 with a greater amplitude of variabilities in the south and east coasts of China and TC behaviors changed seasonally. The peak TC period corresponded to the Maunder Minimum which was characterized by lower land surface temperature, whereas the temperature reconstructed from marine proxies showed an anomalously warmer sea surface temperature over the western Pacific. Changing thermal contrast between land and sea likely created a more dynamic summer monsoon circulation resulting in active TC activity. This study provides important evidence and implication about the TC behavior in response to ongoing global climate change.",

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a fundamental principle of protein organization in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and biomaterials, yet the residue-level interactions that link condensation to structural ordering remain poorly defined. In spider dragline silk, LLPS is believed to initiate the transition from soluble spidroin dope into β-sheet–rich fibers that provide exceptional toughness, yet how sequence-specific motifs govern this process has been unclear. Here, we combine isotope-edited solution NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)–enhanced solid-state NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and AlphaFold3 modeling to define the molecular role of arginine and tyrosine in Latrodectus hesperus dragline silk. Phosphate triggers LLPS while preserving intrinsic disorder, with arginine exhibiting the largest chemical shift perturbations. Simulations reveal that phosphate displaces hydration water to promote Arg–Tyr cation–π interactions and weaken Arg–poly(Ala) contacts. Solid-state NMR directly detects Arg–Tyr contacts in spun fibers, demonstrating that arginine is partially incorporated into β-sheet interfaces while tyrosine frequently adopts β-turn conformations. AlphaFold3 models corroborate these interfacial geometries and reproduce experimental chemical shifts, supporting persistent Arg–Tyr interactions at structured–unstructured boundaries. Together, these results identify Arg–Tyr contacts as critical “sticker” interactions that mediate condensation, nucleate local order, and stabilize fiber architecture. More broadly, this work establishes a mechanistic link between residue-specific chemistry, LLPS, and hierarchical assembly in a structural protein. These insights highlight how weak multivalent interactions bridge disordered and ordered states, providing a general framework for condensate-driven assembly in biology and guiding biomimetic material design.",

The cytoskeleton is known to play a critical role in gravitropism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis kinesins KCH3 and KCH7 (KCH3/7) are expressed and functionally active in the root stele. The kch3 kch7 ( kch37 ) double mutant exhibits delayed gravitropic responses, while stele-specific expression of either KCH3 or KCH7 rescues this defect. Both the calponin homology (CH) and motor domains of KCH3/7 are essential for mediating gravitropism. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal that KCH3/7 promotes actin filament (F-actin) bundling and its turnover in the root stele. Mutation of KCH3/7 results in altered PIN protein abundance and polarity in the root stele, leading to impaired acropetal auxin transport within the stele and reduced auxin accumulation in the root tip’s columella cells. This ultimately causes defective auxin redistribution during gravistimulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics in the root stele for maintaining the auxin gradient in the root tip and for gravistimulation-induced auxin asymmetry.",

          "abstract": "Roads act as conduits for human incursions and hence underlie many of humanity’s impacts on nature, including deforestation, wildfires, and natural-resource overexploitation. Unfortunately, existing roadmaps often drastically underestimate the true extent of road networks and future predictions of road-related impacts rely on incomplete and outdated data, undermining development planning and conservation decision-making. Here, we develop a multivariate “road expansion risk” index to identify areas prone to road building and therefore vulnerable to road-related environmental impacts. Using a massive road dataset—137 million 1-ha raster cells drawn from three different sources arrayed across the Amazon and Congo basins and insular Asia-Pacific region—we predict road-prone locations via a statistical model that integrates a range of biophysical, socioeconomic, and administrative data. This highly integrative, large-scale approach allowed us to identify areas likely to experience future road building and regions that may contain unmapped roads. Importantly, our road expansion risk index is a strong predictor of forest loss and degradation and can hence identify future road building and deforestation hotspots, even for the many tropical forest locales with grossly deficient road data.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between the immune system and the somatosensory system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of diverse biological processes. Chronic itch is a common yet hard-to-treat symptom of many inflammatory skin conditions. One hallmark of chronic itch is the hyperinnervation of the skin by sensory fibers, yet what drives this aberrant nerve growth or how it contributes to disease progression remains unclear. Here, we identify IL-17A and immunity to skin microbiota as key triggers of sensory neuron plasticity and pruritus. In a murine model of psoriatic itch, we show that exposure to Staphylococcus aureus prior to experimental psoriasis results in heightened skin inflammation, increased itch, and marked hyperinnervation of CGRPα + sensory neurons. Accordingly, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglia reveals that microbiota-driven inflammation induces a regenerative transcriptional program in sensory neurons, including upregulation of axonal growth, injury response, and IL-17RA signaling pathways. Mechanistically, we show that IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling within TRPV1 + sensory neurons drives hyperinnervation and pruritus, establishing a causal link between IL-17A and microbiota-driven immune responses in sensory circuit remodeling. Further, we identify sensory hyperinnervation as a key driver of chronic itch and inflammation. Collectively, we reveal that aberrant IL-17A signaling in sensory neurons, triggered by dysregulated microbiota immunity, promotes neuronal remodeling that amplifies itch and inflammation. These findings provide a framework for targeting microbiota–neuroimmune interactions as a therapeutic strategy for pruritus.",

However, precise control of gap junctions remains elusive. Herein, we present CarGAP, a single-component chemo-optogenetic tool that utilizes the C-terminal adenosylcobalamin (AdoB 12 ) binding domain of a photoreceptor protein (i.e., CarH C ) to achieve reversible control over both vertebrate and invertebrate gap junctions with spatiotemporal precision. The vertebrate CarGAP (i.e., Cx-CarGAP), created by genetically fusing connexins with CarH C in mammalian cells, can efficiently block the gap junction channels through AdoB 12 -induced protein oligomerization and subsequently reinstate them via green light–induced protein disassembly. We further introduced the CarGAP system (i.e., Inx-CarGAP) to the Drosophila ovary, enabling reversible control over the heterotypic gap junctions formed by innexin2 (Inx2) and innexin4 (Inx4, also known as zero population growth, Zpg), thereby uncovering the roles of gap junctions in stem cell–niche interactions. This study illustrates CarGAP as a generalizable chemo-optogenetic tool for interrogating the functions of gap junctions in various biological contexts.",

          "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by biallelic mutations in the ATM gene, leads to multiple disease phenotypes, including cerebellar neurodegeneration, radiosensitivity, cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, insulin resistance, and pulmonary inflammation. ATM plays a central role in regulating cellular responses to DNA breakage [M. B. Kastan, J. Bartek, Nature 432 , 316–323 (2004)], but several cellular and physiologic abnormalities associated with ATM dysfunction suggest the possibility of noncanonical roles for ATM as well. Herein, we identified the HSP90 paralogue, GRP94, as an ATM interactor/substrate and found that ATM influences N- glycosylation of GRP94 and its subsequent activation/translocation to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a scaffold protein and stabilizer for several membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and IGF1-R. In selected cell types, ATM loss/inhibition resulted in increased cell surface expression of RTKs and overactivation of RTK pathways, alterations that were rescued by specific inhibition of cell surface GRP94. This ATM/GRP94 pathway also regulated the activation of microglial cells, manifest as increased cytokine production and phagocytosis activity associated with ATM loss/inhibition and reversal of that activation with GRP94 inhibition. These results identified GRP94 as an ATM interactor and apparent substrate and demonstrated specific critical regulatory roles for ATM outside of DNA damage signaling. These insights provide potential explanations for several of the phenotypes associated with ATM dysfunction and potential opportunities for novel approaches to blunt clinical symptoms in A-T, and also suggest that other neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders might benefit from selective inhibition of cell surface GRP94.",

          "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria build a multilayered cell envelope in which the peptidoglycan layer is sandwiched between an inner membrane of glycerophospholipids and an asymmetric outer membrane composed of glycerophospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Acinetobacter baumannii , however, synthesize lipooligosaccharide (LOS), an LPS variant lacking O-antigen. Although LPS/LOS is typically essential, A. baumannii can survive without LOS, offering the opportunity to examine how the Gram-negative envelope remains stable in the absence of this major glycolipid. We previously found that the peptidoglycan biogenesis protein NlpD, an activator of peptidoglycan degradation by cell division amidases, is critical for fitness during LOS deficiency. Here, we show that NlpD is required under these conditions because a second putative amidase activator, WthA (cell wall turnover hub protein A), no longer functions in LOS-deficient cells. Mutants lacking WthA exhibited severe cell-division defects and were synthetically sick with loss of NlpD. Acinetobacter lack canonical periplasmic amidases, raising the question of which enzymes partner with NlpD and WthA. Previous work showed that overexpression of an Acinetobacter β-lactamase increased denuded peptidoglycan, a product of amidase activity. Guided by this finding, we examined the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase Oxa51 and found that its coexpression with WthA or NlpD enhanced release of amidase products, suggesting that Oxa51 participates in peptidoglycan degradation and that WthA is an amidase activator. Further, WthA influenced peptidoglycan endopeptidases and lytic transglycosylases through a network of protein interactions. Altogether, these findings identify WthA as a missing regulator in Acinetobacter peptidoglycan biogenesis and a hub that coordinates peptidoglycan turnover and cell division.",

Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times. With high migration, our model recovers the results of classic neutral theory. We briefly discuss implications of our analysis for research on the microbiome, synthetic biology, and the origin of life.",

Here, we showed that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) failed to enhance adult neurogenesis and cognition in the mice with defective touch perception due to loss of a mechanotransduction channel Piezo2 in Merkel cells. Moreover, we found an EE-activated neuraxis, in which the dentate gyrus received tactile input through a circuit that originated from the somatosensory cortex (S1) and relayed via dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Defective touch perception diminished the S1 to SNc afferent, thereby reducing dopamine release.

Likewise, low p CO 2 estimates imply glacial climates should prevail. However, this prediction is inconsistent with an apparent billion-year hiatus in glaciation. We test these hypotheses with direct constraints on the Mesoproterozoic atmosphere from analyses of primary fluid inclusions in 1.4 Ga surficial halite, which reveal an atmospheric p O 2 of 7.84 ± 3.05 mbar and a p CO 2 of 2.76 ± 1.66 mbar. We couple these measurements with average inclusion homogenization temperatures of 31.2 ± 7.8 °C. Our results point to an Earth system state characterized by a moderate climate with sufficient O 2 for early animal respiration. These observations reflect a coevolution of life, climate, and the atmosphere, where a largely unrecognized episode of oxygenation and CO 2 drawdown was driven by the breakup of the supercontinent Nuna and the complexification of algal eukaryotes.",

This study investigates the phenomenon of mind blanking (MB), characterized by an “emptiness of mind,” comparing it with mind wandering (MW) and on-task (ON) states. Using a sustained attention task and electroencephalogram monitoring, behavioral, and neurophysiological signatures of MB were examined in 62 participants. MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased long-range interareal connectivity during MB, compared to both ON and MW states. Event-related potentials with source reconstruction and temporal decoding techniques indicated a significant disruption in visual processing during MB, starting from 200 ms post stimulus and echoing into the late-stage of visual processing, suggesting a disruption of conscious access to sensory information during MB. Electroencephalogram-derived markers allowed the prediction of mental states at the trial level, offering a finer view of conscious dynamics than subjective reports alone. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of the wakeful conscious mind as inherently content-oriented, suggesting that MB reflects genuine gaps in the stream of conscious thoughts, arising from disruptions in the generation or accessibility of thought content.",

However, there have been no guaranteed routes of microfluidics that can achieve widespread adoption in mainstream chemistry and biomedical research. Inspired by the cooperative multiple cilia of biological organisms and tissues to generate flow, we propose an open microfluidic platform, lab on an end (LoE), to pump spatially and temporally continuous flow for multifunctional micromanipulation with the acoustohydrodynamic pillar array as an end effector. LoE brings together the micromanipulation of individual entities, liquid operations, and cell processing onto an acoustic end effector. These operations are mainly driven by acoustic radiation and two unique frequency-dependent microstreaming profiles: out-of-plane vortex near a single pillar and in-plane transmission flow surrounding the entire pillar array. Applications in embryo engineering, local morphological phenotyping of Caenorhabditis elegans for neuron research, efficient chemical reactions, and multifunctional cell processing indicate that the LoE could potentially lead to breakthroughs in understanding and using microfluidics. Its capability of integrating multiple sequential processes, inherent high accessibility, easy use, and low cost provide an end-to-end solution to mainstream chemistry and biomedical research.",

By characterizing key protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions, we reveal the coordination of pseudouridylation activity across the two protomers which explains the predominance of two-hairpin structures in eukaryotic H/ACA snoRNAs. Moreover, we found that several mutations in H/ACA proteins associated with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) directly impair pseudouridine formation suggesting how these mutations disrupt RNA modification and ribosome biogenesis in this disease. Additionally, we uncover coordinated structural changes between Nop10, Nhp2, and the N-terminal extensions of Cbf5 in the 3′ protomer that resemble active and inactive conformations and may regulate H/ACA snoRNP activity. In summary, this study provides detailed insight into the structure and function of RNA modification-competent H/ACA snoRNPs, which play pivotal roles in cellular processes including ribosome biogenesis, rRNA folding, (m)RNA modification, and telomere maintenance.",

Here, we report the finding of autoantibody-secreting extrafollicular plasmablasts in EAE induced with specific myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that these cells produce nonaffinity-matured IgG antibodies. These include pathogenic antibodies competing for shared binding space on MOG’s extracellular domain. Interestingly, the synthetic anti-MOG antibody 8-18C5 can prevent the binding of pathogenic antibodies from either EAE mice or people with MOG antibody disease. Moreover, an 8-18C5 variant carrying the NNAS mutation, which inactivates its effector functions, can reduce EAE severity and promote functional recovery. In brief, this study provides not only a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response in EAE models but also a proof of concept for a therapy to antagonize pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between magnetism and flat-band (FB) instability is a central theme in quantum materials research. A striking example is the emergence of magnetic order in a nominally nonmagnetic compound when a flat band is tuned near the Fermi energy ( E F ). In this study, we investigate this phenomenon in the Pauli paramagnet SrCo 2 As 2 , where an FB associated with Co e g orbitals lies close to E F . Remarkably, a minute substitution of the nonmagnetic element Pd onto the Co site ( ∼ 2%) induces antiferromagnetic order with a transition temperature as high as T N = 25 K. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent magnetic and transport measurements, complemented by zero-field neutron diffraction, reveal a helical magnetic order for x ≤ 0.10 in Sr(Co 1− x Pd x ) 2 As 2 , transitioning to a complex ferromagnetic state at higher Pd concentrations. Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical band structure calculations demonstrate that electron doping shifts the flat band closer to E F , significantly enhancing the Stoner parameter. This enhancement drives a strong ferromagnetic instability, leading to helical magnetic ordering dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic interactions. The emergence of robust magnetic ordering through substitution with nonmagnetic elements is a unique phenomenon that underscores the pivotal role of flat-band instability in tuning magnetism in itinerant systems.",

For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the “dynamical climate” of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, its variant, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness have been achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. In addition, two real-world ecological benchmark datasets: the microbial time-series dataset and global population dynamics database, are tested to demonstrate the applicability of the meta-learning framework to the real world. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.",

ABCD3 facilitates the transport of a broad spectrum of substrates, including branched-chain fatty acids, very long-chain fatty acids, bile salt intermediates, and dicarboxylic acids as CoA adducts. Mutations in ABCD3 are associated with defects in congenital bile acid synthesis. Despite its importance, the basis for substrate selectivity and the mechanism of transport by ABCD3 are not well defined. We report the cryogenic sample electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of full-length human ABCD3 in its apo state and bound to one of its physiological substrates (phytanoyl-CoA) at resolutions of 3.33 Å and 3.13 Å, respectively. Our biochemical assays reveal that substrate binding induces ATPase activity in ABCD3, suggesting a substrate-dependent conformational change. Structural comparison of the apo and substrate-bound states demonstrates that the substrate interaction brings nucleotide-binding domains closer together, providing a mechanistic basis of substrate-induced ATPase activity. These findings offer critical insights into the transport mechanism of ABCD3 and lay a structural foundation for understanding its role in peroxisomal metabolite import and related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that dictate the localization of cytoskeletal filaments is crucial for elucidating cell shape regulation in prokaryotes. The actin homolog MreB plays a pivotal role in maintaining the shape of many rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli by directing cell-wall synthesis according to local curvature cues. However, the basis of MreB’s curvature-dependent localization has remained elusive. Here, we develop a biophysical model for the energetics of a filament binding to a surface that integrates the complex interplay between filament twist and bending and the two-dimensional surface geometry. Our model predicts that the spatial localization of a filament like MreB with substantial intrinsic twist is governed by both the mean and Gaussian curvatures of the cell envelope, which strongly covary in rod-shaped cells. Using molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the mechanical properties of MreB filaments, we show that their thermodynamic preference for regions with lower mean and Gaussian curvatures matches experimental observations for physiologically relevant filament lengths of ~50 nm. We find that the experimentally measured statistical curvature preference is maintained in the absence of filament motion and after a cycle of depolymerization, repolymerization, and membrane rebinding, indicating that equilibrium energetics can explain MreB localization. These findings provide critical insights into the physical principles underlying cytoskeletal filament localization and suggest design principles for synthetic shape-sensing nanomaterials.",

In this study, we identify consistent signatures of criticality during neural network training and provide theoretical evidence that such scaling behavior arises naturally from information-driven self-organization: a dynamic balance between the maximum entropy principle that promotes unbiased exploration and mutual information constraint that relates updates with task objective. We numerically demonstrate that the power-law exponent of updates remains stable throughout training, supporting the presence of self-organized criticality. Furthermore, we show that the loss landscape exhibits exponential ruggedness under small perturbations, transitioning to power-law ruggedness at larger scales, in the absence of mini-batch noise, indicating an intrinsic geometric landscape. We also observe a power-law distribution in the intervals between large updates, indicating an intermittent learning process.

Clinically, proteasome inhibitors are effective against hematologic cancers but show limited success with solid tumors, and the reasons for this difference are not well understood. Activation of yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ, the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, is a key mechanism behind drug resistance in cancers. Here, we demonstrate that proteasome stress acts as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway in solid tumor cells. When the proteasome is inhibited, RAP2 undergoes ubiquitination and becomes inactive, which in turn disrupts the RAP2–MAP4Ks–NF2–LATS1/2 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ activation promotes cell survival and resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Conversely, blocking YAP/TAZ can overcome this resistance and restore cancer cell sensitivity to these drugs. In diffuse-type gastric cancer—an aggressive solid tumor with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options—combined inhibition of the proteasome and YAP/TAZ effectively suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, this study identifies proteasome stress as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway and provides a mechanistic basis for combination cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Brain capillaries are sensors of neural activity. When a brain region is active, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) sense neuron-derived mediators and elicit a local increase in blood flow (functional hyperemia) to support the rise in metabolic needs. This hyperemic response involves a rapid electrical component and a slower chemical component that involves Gαq PCR (G q PCR) activation by agonists released from neurons. The intravascular forces associated with hyperemia engage mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated signaling that serves a mechano-feedback control function to facilitate the return of elevated blood flow to basal levels. Whether G q PCR activity influences Piezo1 mechanosensitive signaling has not been explored, despite the potential significant implications of such crosstalk. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology and freshly isolated brain capillary ECs, we demonstrate that prostanoid or muscarinic G q PCR activation facilitates Piezo1 activity. Pharmacological studies revealed the involvement of Gαq and phospholipase C stimulation, as well as downstream phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis in Piezo1 activation, but not signaling triggered by metabolites of PIP 2 hydrolysis. Exogenous application of nanomolar-to-micromolar PIP 2 suppressed Piezo1 open probability. Brain capillary ECs from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel disease, or Piezo1 gain-of-function mutation exhibited higher Piezo1 activity, that was corrected by exogenous ex vivo PIP 2 application. We finally tested in vivo the hypothesis that systemic PIP 2 administration restores functional hyperemia in EC-specific Piezo1 gain-of-function mutant mice suffering impaired blood flow. Our findings provide insights into Piezo1 channel regulation and how it affects neurovascular coupling and cerebral blood flow.",

          "abstract": "The evolutionary history of domesticated cattle in East Asia for the past 5000 years remains largely obscure. Here, we investigated the origins and evolution of cattle genetic diversity in China by analyzing shotgun genome sequences of 166 ancient bovines spanning a 10,000-year period and encompassing now-extinct East Asian aurochs and domesticated cattle from key archaeological cultures. East and North Asian aurochs were distinct from western aurochs, although East Asian aurochs harbored approximately 15% western ancestry. The first domesticated cattle in the Yellow River region derived approximately 10% of their ancestry from local aurochs with an uneven genome-wide distribution. Early cattle from Xinjiang were genetically distinct and partially contributed to the later northern Chinese cattle. Indicine admixture became widespread only in the Medieval period in northern China.",

In this study, by combining a suite of operando microscopy methods, we explored electrode strain evolution and observed intricate particle cluster rearrangement under electrochemical stimuli. We show that early-stage strain accumulation in intercalation cathodes occurs during the period of interparticle charge transfer and redox reactions stemming from asynchronous coupling and decoupling between chemical (de)intercalation and physical grain motion. This interplay drives heterogeneous redox activity, localized charge equilibration, and multiscale strain cascades that propagate through an asynchronous network of chemical-mechanical interactions. Together, these findings reveal how collective particle dynamics and hierarchical strain transmission dictate electrode deformation and degradation in intercalation cathodes.",

In this work, we focused on the high-symmetry Cmcm phase to boost two-dimensional phonon and three-dimensional charge transports and extended the high-performance ( ZT ~ 3.0) plateau. By simultaneously broadening the Cmcm -phase stability window and enhancing lattice symmetry through lead alloying, we extended the high performance from a single temperature point to a wide temperature range of ~250 kelvin in rock salt–like Cmcm SnSe crystals rendered n-type through chlorine doping.

To achieve processivity, multiple catalytic cycles must occur before substrate dissociation, making rapid turnover rates essential. Src family kinases processively phosphorylate multisite substrates. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified a transient intermediate state within the Src conformational ensemble, positioned between its active and inactive states. This intermediate state facilitates the rapid release of adenosine diphosphate following adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, ensuring efficient catalytic turnover. Depletion of the intermediate state abrogated processive phosphorylation by Src, Lck, and Hck, impairing function. These findings reveal that the conformational ensemble of Src family kinases has evolved to incorporate a transient state that underpins their capacity for processive substrate phosphorylation.",

We achieved this property by minimizing the ion-pairing interactions between mobile ions and highly diffuse counterions that assemble in a stepwise manner to preserve conformational flexibility across phase transitions.

Enhanced signaling between enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gut epithelium and mucosal sensory nerve fibers likely contributes to this sex bias. We identified an estrogen-responsive paracrine pathway in which two enteroendocrine cell types, peptide YY (PYY)–expressing L cells and serotonergic EC cells, communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females. We demonstrate that estrogen signaling up-regulates the bacterial metabolite short-chain fatty acid receptor Olfr78 on colonic L cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells by means of NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain. We propose that hormonal fluctuations, in conjunction with internal (stress) or environmental (diet) factors, amplify this local estrogen-responsive colonic circuit, resulting in maladaptive gut sensitivity.",

We show that the citrus canker pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri ( Xcc ) mobilizes cell wall sugars by hijacking a fruit-ripening program through the type III effector PthA4, which activates the ripening coordinator CsLOB1. CsLOB1 induces approximately 100 genes, many encoding enzymes involved in cell wall breakdown. In the nonfruiting species Nicotiana benthamiana , CsLOB1 likewise promotes Xanthomonas growth, showing that its activity is not strictly dependent on a ripening program. Transcriptomics and reporter assays revealed PthA4-dependent activation of the Xcc xylan CUT system, triggered by host-derived xylose and including a type II–secreted xylanase. Thus, PthA4-driven cell wall remodeling activates bacterial xylan use, establishing a TIII–TII effector feedforward loop that fuels Xcc proliferation.",

However, there is limited understanding of how Pol II transcribes through nucleosomes while supercoiling DNA. Here, we determined that Pol II generates a torque of 9 pN·nm alone and 13 pN·nm with TFIIS, making it a powerful rotary motor. When Pol II encounters a nucleosome, passage becomes more efficient on a chromatin substrate than on a single-nucleosome substrate, demonstrating that chromatin significantly buffers torsional stress during transcription. Furthermore, topoisomerase supercoiling relaxation allows Pol II to transcribe through multiple nucleosomes. Our results reveal a role of chromatin beyond the more conventional view of it being just a roadblock to transcription.",

The conserved AvrBs2 family effectors are among the most important virulence factors in xanthomonads, but how AvrBs2 promotes infection remains elusive. We found that AvrBs2 is a glycerophosphodiesterase-derived synthetase that catalyzes uridine 5′-diphosphate-α- d -galactose into a sugar phosphodiester, bis-(1,6)-cyclic dimeric α- d -galactose-phosphate, which is referred to as xanthosan. Xanthosan is synthesized by AvrBs2 in host cells and released into apoplastic spaces. Xanthomonas bacteria uptake xanthosan through the XanT transporter and hydrolyze it through the XanP phosphodiesterase for nutrition. AvrBs2, XanT, and XanP form a xanthosan “generation-uptake-utilization” system to provide a dedicated nutritional strategy to feed xanthomonads. Furthermore, elucidation of the AvrBs2-XanT-XanP virulence mechanism inspired us to develop an “anti-nutrition” strategy that should be applicable to control a wide variety of Xanthomonas diseases.",

          "abstract": "The human blood proteome provides a holistic readout of health states through the assessment of thousands of circulating proteins. In this study, we present a pan-disease resource to enable the study of diverse disease phenotypes within a harmonized proteomics dataset. By profiling protein concentrations across 59 diseases and healthy cohorts, we identified proteins associated with age, sex, and body mass index, as well as disease-specific signatures. This study highlights shared and distinct protein patterns across conditions, demonstrating the power of a unified proteomics approach to uncover biological insights. The dataset, covering 8262 individuals and up to 5416 proteins, serves as an online resource for exploring disease-specific protein profiles and advancing precision medicine research.",

          "abstract": "From populations of multicellular organisms to selfish genetic elements, conflicts between levels of biological organization are central to evolution. Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that face selective pressures from their hosts but also compete within the host cell for replication resources. Although theory indicates that within-cell selection matters for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of these dynamics has remained elusive. We measured within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterized their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time owing to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends nontrivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Heat extremes pose substantial health risks during pregnancy and early childhood. High humidity exacerbates heat strain, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly understood. We compare the effect of prenatal exposure to extreme humid heat versus heat alone on child growth in South Asia, where high rates of child stunting meet rapidly accelerating hot-humid extremes. After adjusting for sociodemographic, seasonal, and spatial confounders, we use within-community variation in children’s ages to isolate the impact of prenatal exposures. We find that hot-humid exposures are much more detrimental to health than hot temperatures alone, with the potential to increase stunting in South Asia by over 3 million children by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for humidity when estimating and localizing climate change impacts.",

          "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease with no effective curative therapies. Necroptosis, a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), has emerged as a potential driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression. Spatial profiling of human PSC biopsies revealed that necroptosis primarily affects cholangiocytes, while apoptosis was more frequent in hepatocytes and nonbiliary cells. In vitro, necroptosis inhibition protected cholangiocytes, and RIPK1 deletion conferred resistance to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. In a murine model of PSC, pharmacological RIPK1 inhibition reduced cholestatic injury, hepatic inflammation, and biliary fibrosis. Multiomic analyses comprehensively demonstrated reprogramming toward wild-type–like profiles following treatment. These findings identify necroptosis as a critical effector in PSC and highlight RIPK1 inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach, opening the door to targeted necroptosis-based therapies for this otherwise untreatable disease.",

          "abstract": "Phytohormone signaling pathways are crucial for defense against pathogens mediated by pattern recognition receptors and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptors. The induction of auxin signaling by immune receptors for antiviral immunity is poorly understood despite its notable role in plant defense against viral pathogens. Here, we report that plant NLR Sw-5b initiates and amplifies auxin signaling through auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAAs)–ARF19 and YUC8–transport inhibitor response1/auxin-signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) modules to promote callose-mediated antiviral defense. Upon recognizing viral effector, Sw-5b associates with and relieves repressors Aux/IAAs on transcription factor ARF19. ARF19 then activates callose synthase gene GSL5/8 to deposit callose at plasmodesmata, inhibiting viral cell-to-cell spread. Meanwhile, ARF19 activates auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 to boost auxin production; this further amplifies callose deposition signaling via TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAAs-ARF19–glucan synthase-like (GSL) module, thereby restricting the virus in localized cell death. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism by which plant immune receptors induce phytohormone signaling pathways to combat pathogens.",

The pathways underpinning antigen presentation on MHC I are well known, but we lack a quantitative understanding of the relationships between source proteins and presented epitopes and how these relate to immunogenicity. We used mass spectrometry to interrogate vaccinia virus infection to reveal that up to 90% of epitopes were presented as fast as their source proteins were translated, but that protein amounts failed to correlate with epitope levels. Unexpectedly, epitope levels on infected cells also failed to correlate with immunogenicity. However, by extending our analysis to produce the first measurements of viral epitope levels from infected mice, we found a significant but moderate correlation with immunogenicity. These data provide empirical evidence for and against several associations that to date have been assumed or are not well resolved.",

Traditionally, researchers view channel dimensions, surface properties, and permeation rates of these membranes as intrinsic properties that cannot be modulated in operando. We report that gate voltage applied to the conducting laminar MXene membrane can modulate the permeation rate of ions and neutral solutes, as well as its effective size rejection. In operando wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements reveal that these changes are not driven by electrically induced variations in the d spacing of the MXene layers. Instead, experimental data and continuum electrokinetic modeling reveal that ion transport through the MXene channels is primarily affected by Donnan equilibrium at the membrane-solution interface. We also report a strong increase in the permeation rates through the membrane under a low-frequency ac voltage gating regime that we attribute to diffusioosmotic flow oscillations induced in the membrane. Overall, MXene “transistor” membranes provide a previously unidentified approach to dynamic control of molecular separations.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, widely recognized for their role in machine learning, are also transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modeling with classical dynamical systems as well as enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.",

Yet, how T cells release ATP themselves and its effects remain poorly investigated. Here, we found vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), critical for vesicular ATP storage/release, is highly expressed in T H 1 cells and selectively restricts their differentiation and effector functions. Mechanistically, VNUT facilitates lysosomal ATP import and its extracellular release upon T cell receptor engagement. This eATP then activates the purinergic receptor P2X7R and downstream SRC kinase, triggering a signaling cascade involving heightened Ca 2+ influx and hyperphosphorylation of JNK and FOXO3a, which ultimately impairs Eomes-directed IFN-γ production in T H 1 cells. Genetic/pharmacological of VNUT inhibition significantly potentiates T H 1 effector functions against Listeria infection and transplanted tumors. These findings identify VNUT as a critical checkpoint in limiting T H 1 immunity, coupling vesicular ATP transport to transcriptional control via the P2X7R-JNK-FOXO3a-Eomes axis, offering a target for treating infection and cancer.",

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities. This non–cell-autonomous fragmentation ensures rapid apoptotic cell clearance, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis in physiological settings.",

The aim of this study was to develop iPSC-derived “minimal injectable unit” chondrogenic micropellets (MIUChons) for delivery via intra-articular injections for OA therapy. To create transplantable allogeneic cartilage tissue, we optimized good manufacturing practice or clinical-grade production of iPSC-derived injectable chondrogenic spheroids and tested them in OA animal models. MIUChons were delivered to damaged cartilage through a single injection. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that MIUChon treatment effectively reduced cartilage degeneration and deterioration.

          "abstract": "For more than two centuries, digoxin has been used to treat heart failure by increasing the strength of cardiac contraction and, more recently, is used for heart rate control. The proposed, yet unproven, mechanism underlying digoxin’s positive inotropic effect is as follows: By inhibiting the Na + -K + ATPase (NKA), digoxin partially dissipates the transmembrane Na + gradient, which is used by the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1) to extrude Ca 2+ from myocytes, thus causing accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and therefore increased cardiac contractility. Here, we demonstrate that digoxin critically relies on a specific allosteric regulation of NCX1, known as Na + -dependent inactivation, to exert its positive inotropic effect, establishing the precise mechanism of action of this historic drug. These findings identify a distinct molecular target for the development of positive inotropes that avoid the undesirable effects associated with the blockade of NKA. As the structural information for the region involved with NCX1 Na + -dependent inhibition is well resolved, we provide the mechanistic foundation for drug development.",

Specifically, SLFN14 binds to the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), thereby preventing HIV-1 Tat-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter and causing an arrest of viral transcription. Furthermore, this P-TEFb–targeted inhibiting activity also allows SLFN14 to regulate the transcription of a subset of cellular genes.

These modifications influence chromatin function, but how they occur cotranslationally on these exceptionally abundant and small proteins was not understood. Here, we show that the nascent polypeptide-associated complex controls the cotranslational modification of histones H2A and H4 by recruiting NatD and the upstream enzyme MetAP1 to ribosomes.

Furthermore, heat stress induces the sequestration of TOR and its core complex components, RAPTOR1B and LST8, into SGs. TOR activity is rapidly suppressed by heat stress, independently of SG formation. In contrast, TOR reactivation following heat stress relief is dependent on the rate of SG disassembly, implicating SG recovery dynamics as a key regulator of TOR reactivation.

A unique motif containing multiple basic and acidic residues (BAR motif) in H2A.Z prevents TSK binding. Moreover, disrupting TSK-H2A.X/W binding impairs TSK-mediated DNA repair. Genetic analyses reveal functional complementation between H2A.X and H2A.W in DNA repair, with the H2A.X N terminus being essential. This study reveals a previously unrecognized, H2A.X/W-dependent mechanism for recruiting the DNA repair protein TSK, highlighting the critical role of their N-terminal tails in plant DNA repair.",

Existing demonstrations rely on idealized cylindrical or spherical shapes, limiting their practical relevance. Here, we introduce a physics-based optimization framework that designs magnetic cloaks for arbitrarily shaped structures by directly solving Maxwell’s equations under spatial material constraints. Our method produces continuous, spatially varying permeability profiles that preserve field uniformity around complex geometries, including faceted and multi-lobed configurations. Using material parameters drawn from commercially available superconductors, we demonstrate low-distortion cloaking performance with permeability values within manufacturable ranges. This approach establishes a route to customizable magnetic shields for real-world components and lays the groundwork for future applications in extreme magnetic environments, such as fusion energy systems and precision instrumentation.",

Here, we present a method to suppress t 1 -noise in 13 C– 13 C double-quantum–single-quantum (DQ-SQ) spectra by converting DQ coherences into longitudinal two-spin order ( zz -terms), enabling selective removal of uncoupled 13 C magnetization. This zz -filter, compatible with both J - and dipolar-based sequences, markedly improves the spectral quality on both commercial (100 K) and custom-built helium-spinning (30 K) MAS-DNP setups. Up to a fivefold increase in signal-to-noise ratio in the indirect dimension allows detection of previously hidden long-range correlations, including intermolecular contacts. This method yields the first artifact-free 13 C– 13 C DQ-SQ spectrum at 30 K, expanding the analytical reach of MAS-DNP NMR for characterizing molecular assemblies at natural abundance.",

Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of citrus KCS6-CER2 and KCS6–CER2-like1 complexes, unveiling a kinked elongation tunnel whose hydrophobicity and volume determine VLCFA chain length.

We found that ABA-responsive phosphorylation of MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN 4 KINASE 1 (MAP4K1) was significantly down-regulated in SnRK2-disrupted mutants. Subsequent biochemical assays showed that Ser 479 of MAP4K1 is directly phosphorylated by SRK2E/OST1, a central ABA kinase. Mutational analyses of MAP4K1 and MAP4K2 revealed that both kinases positively regulate ABA-induced stomatal closure and that Ser 479 of MAP4K1 is required for this phenotype. In map4k1map4k2 double mutants, stomatal closure was induced by applying exogenous Ca 2+ but not H 2 O 2 . Electrophysiological experiments showed that MAP4K1/2 is required for ABA-dependent activation of Ca 2+ -permeable channels in GCPs.

Aging Top3b -KO mice also display splenomegaly and systemic immune alterations including neutrophilia and lymphopenia consistent with chronic inflammation. At the molecular level, Top3b deficiency causes genome-wide R-loop accumulation in splenocytes as measured by CUT&amp;Tag sequencing. Increased R-loops are associated with genomic breaks and activation of immune signaling pathways including innate and adaptive immune cell signaling, IL-4 signaling, FAK signaling, and cGAS-STING.

Here, we reveal that cancer cells collaboratively reprogram ECM to construct interconnected microchannel networks functioning as “superhighways” for barrier-free metastasis. Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence. Collectively, our findings unveil a self-organized metastatic network and its mechanobiological mechanisms, offering a previously unidentified framework and potential therapeutic insights for cancer metastasis.",

However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22 millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform’s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication.

In rice ( Oryza sativa ), the florigens Heading date 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T1 play central roles in these transitions. The plant hormones auxin and cytokinin shape the morphologies associated with each transition, but little is known about the factors that integrate florigen function with phytohormone signaling during these transitions. Here, we show that in rice, Hd3a activates the transcription of FT-LIKE1 ( OsFTL1 ), which encodes a mobile FT-like protein that promotes the transition from the IM to the FM, whereas cytokinin signaling suppresses its transcription. We performed single-cell resolution three-dimensional imaging to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution of Hd3a, cytokinin, and auxin signaling during the SAM-to-IM and IM-to-FM transitions, finding that Hd3a accumulation and cytokinin signaling occupy opposite domains in the IM. Hd3a accumulated at the center of the meristem and activated the OsFTL1 promoter, while OsFTL1 was present throughout the IM, suggesting that a “florigen relay” consisting of Hd3a from the leaves moves to the SAM and induces OsFTL1 expression within the SAM. We propose an antagonistic mechanism mediated by Hd3a and cytokinin that modulates the abundance of OsFTL1 and thus regulates reproductive development in rice.",

Here, we present a visible-light–mediated photoredox-catalyzed chemo-divergent and regioselective radical difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylsulfonylation and difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylation of structurally diverse alkenes through switchable sulfur dioxide reintegration. The method demonstrates broad applicability across styrenes, unactivated alkenes, and gaseous ethylene/propylene substrates. The photocatalyst functions as a switch, and Sodium difluoromethanesulfinate (CF 2 HSO 2 Na) acts as a bifunctional reagent, enabling controllable divergence radical conversion via radical-polar crossover pathways. Notably, chiral alcohol–derived polyfluoroarenes efficiently induce stereoselectivity control in the coupling of alkyl radicals with sulfur dioxide via dynamic kinetic resolution. Density functional theory calculations indicate noncovalent interaction between alkyl/aryl groups and polyfluorocarbons plays critical roles for the ultralong-distance (&gt;9 atoms) stereochemical induction. The key to achieving chemo-divergent and stereocontrolled transformations lies in the precise sorting of a dynamic intermediate pool containing alkyl radicals, sulfonyl radicals, and anions.",

ISD exponents increase (abundances of larger-bodied individuals increase, relative to smaller-bodied) when environments favor higher trophic levels, warmer thermal tolerances, and periodic life histories.

          "abstract": "Understanding how biotic assembly processes responded to past geoclimatic changes is key to explaining the origins of mountain biodiversity and the causes of regional disparities in species richness. Here, we jointly reconstructed geographic ranges and biome-niche evolution for 34 diverse plant clades across five major Northern Hemisphere mountain systems and quantified how late Neogene cooling increased arctic-alpine habitat connections across regions. We reveal that, while alpine floras originated asynchronously and were assembled through distinct evolutionary processes over the past 30 million years, general biological responses to orogeny and environmental change are apparent. Across regions, in situ diversification was consistently elevated during heightened phases of tectonic activity. Over the past 5 million years, enhanced arctic-alpine connectivity facilitated biotic interchange and positioned the boreal-arctic region as a major biogeographic crossroads linking Eurasia and North America.",

Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both periodic and quasi-periodic optical skyrmions, revealing a large degree of topological control. In a misaligned composite nanostructure, the rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved, which is explained by a lattice model. This topological change of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between composite nanostructures.",

Computational evolution offers a way to systematically test hypotheses, isolate individual factors, and ask the “why” questions behind vision. We recreate vision evolution by coevolving eyes and behaviors in embodied agents and use this to illuminate principles shaping vision across different levels of the Marr’s hierarchy. This leads to three key findings: First, we provide computational evidence that task-specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution. Second, we reveal how optical innovations naturally emerge to resolve fundamental trade-offs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing that provide insights into long-standing hypothesis behind eye and brain size.

The 2.0-angstrom resolution crystal structure of SFL reveals a boat-like module comprising an N-terminal helical bundle and three zinc fingers at the C terminus. A hyperphosphorylation loop (HPL) buried between the helical bundle and the zinc finger 1 harbors four phosphorylated residues (p-S249, p-T250 p-T253, and p-S256), which are important to protein folding. SFL forms monomers in solution and binds the HIV-1 −1 PRF sequence with nanomolar affinity ( K D  = 5.7 nanomolar). Disruption of HPL phosphorylation decreased the RNA binding affinity and undermined the SFL-mediated −1 PRF inhibition of various viruses. Proximity-dependent biotinylation identified three cellular Ser/Thr kinases—EEF2K, NEK9, and PBK—that phosphorylate SFL in cells. These findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying −1 PRF regulation by SFL and provide insights into the role of SFL in virus inhibition.",

LINC-PINT is the most expressed lncRNA in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under stress condition. Knocking down LINC-PINT in LECs promotes the expression of inflammation-related genes. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq revealed that LINC-PINT induces the transcription of genes involved in lymphangiogenesis and immune cell adhesion by increasing chromatin accessibility. Notably, LINC-PINT deficiency impairs LEC proliferation, migration, and sprouting. Conditional deletion of Lnc-Pint in mouse lymphatic endothelium (Lnc-Pint lecko ) leads to a reduction in dermal lymphatic network density. Lnc-Pint lecko mice exhibit decreased lymphedema, reduced dermal backflow, fibrosis, and inflammation.

Here, we present a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the T4 bacteriophage topoisomerase II with a transport-segment DNA bound directly to its central domain.

We investigate how cuticle investment, a major nutritional cost, shaped the evolution of ant societies and diversification. Using a computer vision approach on three-dimensional x-ray microtomography scans of 880 specimens from 507 species, we show that larger colonies were facilitated by reducing exoskeleton investment rather than miniaturizing workers. Reduced cuticle investment was associated with accelerated diversification rates in ants, whereas other candidates—colony size and worker size—did not correlate with diversification. Diet and climate had measurable but secondary effects on cuticle investment. Our results support a hypothesis whereby evolving cheaper but more numerous units through reduced investment in structural tissues was a strategic trend in the evolution and diversification of complex insect societies.",

Transgenic experiments in growth chamber and two latitudinal field trials confirmed their positive roles in promoting BB. Both are activated by the canonical phenological regulator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 , which, in turn, up-regulates the auxin biosynthesis gene TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE–RELATED ( PtoTAR2.1 ), accelerating BB via auxin pathway. As superior haplotypes, PtoFPA.3 HAP1 binds PtoAGL80.5 HAP1 messenger RNA to elevate protein, up-regulating PtoTAR2.1 and increasing indole-3-acetic acid accumulation. Under future climate scenarios, frequencies of PtoFPA.3 HAP1 and PtoAGL80.5 HAP1 are predicted to decline, narrowing BB variance across populations.

Here, ex vivo profiling of metabolic dependence and capacity in peri-implant tissues revealed persistent glycolytic reliance by macrophages up to 6 weeks postimplantation. Expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) increased temporally and with proximity to the implant interface in glycolytically dependent cells, paired with increased capacity for biosynthetic pathways. Glycolytic dependence was notable in multinucleated macrophages, hallmark to the phagocytic behavior of implant pathology.

Our results demonstrate that the relatively recent, brief, and marked depletion of humpback whale populations by whaling likely had subtle but discernible, negative, and lasting effects on the whales’ genomes.

A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current. Here, we lift this fundamental compromise and demonstrate organic TFTs that exhibit a complete absence of detrimental short-channel effects for channel lengths down to 300 nm, making it possible to simultaneously achieve the largest on/off current ratio (10 10 ) and the highest transit frequency (40 MHz) reported to date for flexible organic TFTs, despite the fact that these TFTs operate at very low voltages (≤3 V).

Plasmonic structures can provide strong light confinement but suffer from ohmic losses. Recent advances in dielectric nanostructures enable strong light localization without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrate a nanolaser that colocalizes photons and excited carriers within a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter yields a subdiffraction-limited mode volume and a subwavelength carrier volume without lateral quantum confinement. We observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, where enhanced mode localization produces stronger carrier confinement. By suppressing carrier surface recombination, this platform not only enables continuous-wave lasing at room temperature but also achieves a substantially reduced lasing threshold.

Here, we present a regiospecific topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition for synthesizing crystalline covalent helical polymers via a single–crystal–to–single–crystal transformation. Building on our prior glycine-proline–based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit. This minor change induced a helicity reversal (left- to right-handed) and a substantial reduction in pitch (8.9 to 4.9 Å). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction revealed that this profound reordering is driven by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (C─H⋯O and O─H⋯N), acting as supramolecular bridges between helices, enabling denser packing. Consequently, the glycine-hydroxyproline–based polymer exhibited markedly enhanced mechanics, with a Young’s modulus of 18.57 ± 2.01 GPa and hardness of 1.09 ± 0.13 GPa, surpassing natural collagen.

Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses show that the stability arises from a synergistic combination of Zintl phase formation between phosphorus and lithium atoms, noncovalent interhelical interactions, and geometric protection offered by the distinctive helical architecture. The nanoribbons show tunable optical properties dependent on temperature, thickness, and polarization state. It is demonstrated that these properties enabled nanoribbon-based hydrogels with self-healability and highly efficient photothermal conversion, showing a general approach for stabilizing active low-dimensional materials and paving the way for applying phosphorus-based nanostructures in biomedical engineering and quantum technologies.",

          "abstract": "To overcome limitations of flexible thermoacoustic devices in low-frequency emission and sensing, we present a resonance-adjustable graphene sound device (RAGSD) inspired by frog vocal sacs. Integrating laser-induced graphene (LIG) with a deformable cavity, RAGSD provides continuous tuning from 922.12 to 1762.90 hertz. A dynamic, continuously tunable electro-mechano-acoustical model explains the mechanism and predicts frequency with R 2 = 0.990 . In emission, a 25.34-decibel sound pressure level gain was observed at resonance, enabling controllable, frequency-selective voice amplification for personalized output. In sensing, the LIG piezoresistive readout delivers sensitive transduction, while resonance matching amplifies weak, high-frequency cardiac sounds. Wearable tests on healthy volunteers and patients recorded clear S1/S2 and pathological murmurs. Integrated with AuscNet-H, a deep learning algorithm designed for heart sound classification, the system achieved 99.375% accuracy across four clinical classes. Under inflation, no false negatives occurred, and misclassifications among similar diseases were fewer than with a commercial electronic stethoscope. These results demonstrate a practical path toward intelligent, wearable auscultation.",

          "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are powerful cis-regulatory drivers of gene expression, particularly during early development when many TEs become de-repressed. MERVL elements are transiently up-regulated in mouse totipotent two-cell (2C) embryos during major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and 2C-like cells in vitro. One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity, which may or may not be linked to MERVL. Using a CRISPR activation system, we unpick the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics, and cell toxicity. We find that MERVL activation drives a portion of the Dux-dependent transcriptome, sufficient for expanded fate potential, but not other totipotency features. Conversely, Dux-induced pathology is independent of MERVL activation and involves the proapoptotic factor, Noxa. Our study highlights the complexity of the Dux-MERVL transcriptional network and uncovers a previously unknown player in Dux-driven pathology.",

          "abstract": "Signal transduction by the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is modulated by its ligands as well as by the various compounds on the plasma membrane (PM), including cholesterol. Here, using single-molecule coimmunoimmobilization, we found that cholesterol in the inner leaflet of PM plays an essential role in ligand-dependent EGFR activation. This was done by direct and quantitative examination of the interaction between EGFR and cholesterol on the PM of a living cell. Structural analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further revealed that cholesterol in the inner leaflet is critically important for the transition of the dimeric transmembrane domain (TMD) of the receptor to the active conformation. We also identified the specific pattern of residues Ile 640 -Gly 641 -Leu 642 of EGFR TMD regulating inner leaflet cholesterol binding and ligand-activated EGFR by screening via site-directed mutagenesis. Our results indicate that cholesterol in the inner leaflet of PM is a key checkpoint of EGFR activation triggered by EGF.",

          "abstract": "Metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes have garnered notable interest in molecular separation. However, their high-pressure application is severely hampered by the mechanical fragility stemming from weak interactions at grain boundaries. Inspired by the cuttlebone’s wall-cavity structure, we develop a class of nanosheets-bridged MOF membranes (NB-MOFs). These graphene oxide nanosheets act as a rigid wall, bridging soft MOF grains and dispersing accumulated stresses at grain boundaries under external loadings, thereby preventing structural cracking and enhancing the mechanical robustness of crystal membranes. By fine-tuning the morphology and content of nanosheets, the optimized NB–ZIF-8 membranes are endowed with unprecedented 50-bar pressure resistance and superior C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 separation performance, with a separation factor &gt;240 maintained above 300 hours at industry-relevant pressure. We also confirm our strategy’s versatility by fabricating pressure-resistant NB–ZIF-67 membrane and commercial polymer-supported NB-MOF membranes. We envision that our strategy will establish a platform for developing durable crystalline membranes and unlock their potential in real-world scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are pervasive micropollutants in aquatic environments and along shorelines. Their release is predominantly attributed to mechanical abrasion or ultraviolet exposure, both requiring substantial external energy inputs. The role of aquatic factors (e.g., air bubbles) in the generation of MNPs is poorly understood. Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25° to 95°C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release. Nucleation, expansion, and movement of microbubbles generate shear stresses capable of dislodging polymer protrusions at surface defect sites. This sweeping action, combined with the unbalanced surface tension forces at the three-phase contact line, generates O-shaped ring structures composed of accumulated polymers, which ultimately fragment leading to the release of MNPs into the aquatic environment. Our findings demonstrate that microbubble-induced erosion represents a low-energy pathway for micropollutant release.",

While numerous studies have explored how genetic and molecular networks regulate cell activity, the impact of physical interactions and the resulting mechanical constraints on organ development remains poorly understood. In this study, we combine extensive genetic analysis, live imaging, and mechanical measurements with spatiotemporal computational modeling to show that, in the Arabidopsis root, changes in the mechanical properties of elongating cell walls influence growth and division rate of neighboring meristematic cells, thereby shaping root development. We propose that the cell wall serves as a crucial source of both autonomous and nonautonomous mechanical signals, providing a compelling example of how mechanical forces contribute to organ growth and development.",
