          "title": "Newfound immune cell in mice hints at why inflammation spikes with old age",
          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "Macrophages, which hoover up pathogens, have been implicated in the chronic inflammation that sets in with the march of time.Credit: SPL\n\nA newly discovered type of immune cell found in fat tissue seems to contribute to the chronic inflammation associated with ageing, according to preliminary data from mice — but other immune cells in fat help to keep inflammation at bay1.\n\nThe inflammation-promoting cells emerge only in older mice, researchers found. Although the cells’ precise role is unclear, they display several signatures associated with ‘inflammageing’ — the persistent inflammation that develops as people grow older. The findings were published on 2 September in Nature Aging.\n\n“We did not anticipate that there would be a completely new cell type,” says study co-author Vishwa Deep Dixit, an immunobiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nInflammation age\n\nWhen injuries or infections occur, the immune system mounts a protective response by releasing cells and proteins to affected tissues. This complex cascade is called inflammation. But as we age, inflammation gradually increases and becomes persistent instead of being a state that occurs only when things go wrong.\n\nAgeing is linked to inflammation — but only in the industrialized world\n\nAmong the cells that that help to regulate this inflammageing are a variety of macrophages — white blood cells that hoover up pathogens and cellular debris — that reside in fat tissue. But the exact roles of each type of macrophage and how these cells change throughout the ageing process remain a mystery, says study co-author Elsie Gonzalez-Hurtado, also an immunobiologist at Yale University. “There wasn’t really a good characterization of these cells.”\n\nTo build a clearer picture, Gonzalez-Hurtado and her colleagues imaged macrophages in the visceral fat, the deep fat that wraps around the organs, of young and aged mice. The researchers sorted the macrophages into categories on the basis of the cells’ RNA molecules. These molecules indicate which genes in a cell are active, and therefore offer a guide to the cell’s function.\n\nMultitude of macrophages\n\nThe results revealed 13 distinct types of visceral-fat macrophage, some of which varied in abundance with age. A previously known type of macrophage that resides near nerves, for example, became less numerous in female mice as they grew older — but its numbers remained constant in males. Another previously known type of macrophage, which congregates near fat-tissue blood vessels, was less numerous in elderly male mice than in younger ones, but its levels did not vary with age in female mice.",

          "abstract": "“Fire day! Fire day!” Roger chanted, the other kids joining in. Elo shrank in her seat. She’d already dreaded today’s assignment, and Roger had to make everything worse.\n\n“Stop that!” their teacher, Mrs Hernandez, snapped as she entered the room.\n\n“But it’s finally the end of the unit on 2036!” Roger bounced in excitement. His father was captain of the orbital, and Roger declared on a regular basis that he’d be captain some day, too. His family had held command since the orbital’s launch. “And it is ‘Fire Day’. It says so on the overlay. We know what happens. Golden Oak burns down.”\n\nThe class had spent months studying what happened on Earth almost a century ago by closely examining one California town through videos, pictures, diaries and news stories. Elo could recite the names and life stories of dozens of residents by heart. She knew and loved their pets, too. Even though she logically understood everyone in town was long-dead, she felt like she was losing dear friends.\n\n“Yes, we know the town burns down,” Mrs Hernandez said with the patience Elo admired, “but that’s not something to celebrate. You’ve studied climate change through its effects on this one place so that you can understand what individuals endured — what your own families endured, wherever they lived back then.”\n\nMrs Hernandez was trying so hard to get through to the class, but weeks ago, the others had quietly declared the study to be “stupid and boring”. That history was boring. That Earth was boring and filthy, a place for people too poor to escape to orbitals. A few days ago Roger had commented, “We might as well be studying the contents of a trash can.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nElo knew Earth had problems, big ones. Sometimes the typhoons, wildfires and war damage were even visible from their classroom window. Her parents said, way too often, that they were fortunate to live where they did. Elo loved her home orbital. She’d never known anything else.\n\nBut Earth was where humanity originated. That mattered. It had to. Just as Golden Oak mattered.\n\nA soft tone signalled the lesson’s start. Images and voices from 100 years ago filtered through Elo’s neural implant and filled her vision.\n\nThe fire was started by lightning in the canyon outside the town. Footage depicted the smoke and chaos, the speed of the wind and flames. Hunched over, 80-year-old Annadee Williams escaped her trailer with her cat clutched against her chest with both arms. Siblings Maria, Raymond and Aaron had just got home from school when they had to flee their canyon home on bicycles that soon rolled on rims, after the burning grass caused the rubber tyres to melt.\n\n“We’re OK,” Maria told her mother when they were reunited later in an evacuation centre. They’d lost everything, but they still had each other. Their smiles were wobbly but sincere.\n\n“Now, begin with the first question.” Mrs Hernandez’s voice, though soft, felt like an intrusive scream. “Why was Golden Oak abandoned after the fire?”\n\nThat answer was stated plainly in the conclusion: if people had rebuilt, they wouldn’t have been able to get home insurance, meaning that if the town burned again or some other bad thing happened, people would lose everything without any compensation. Elo transcribed her answer with concentrated thought, tears in her eyes, and went on to the next one, and the next. Other kids began to leave, finished. She kept going.\n\nAs she mentally submitted her exam, she became aware that she was the last one seated. Mrs Hernandez stood over her. “Are you OK, Elo?”\n\n“Not really. No,” she said softly.\n\n“It’s OK to not be OK.”\n\nElo shook her head, unable to articulate her feelings. “Golden Oak died. People died! I get so mad at the others, how they don’t care.”\n\n“You can’t force people to care.” Her smile was sad. “That’s why it’s even more important that you do, as lonely as it can be at times. Compassion is power, especially if you back that with action.”",

          "title": "‘LinkedIn is like air to me’: the scientists who’ve cracked professional networking",
          "authors": "Anne Marie Conlon",
          "abstract": "“I’m not looking to go viral,” says Sharon Obasi of her use of LinkedIn. “I’m looking just to be authentic, make connections and see how other people are approaching similar topics.”\n\nObasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, started using the global professional social-networking site more in the past few years as she took on extra administrative responsibilities in her department. “It was really a chance for me to find people who are in similar roles, in small institutions — a way to find community. But once I started posting and interacting, I realized it was much more than that,” she says. “I call it my 24/7, 365 scientific conference. It’s a really great way to engage in science and scholarship in a much more public way.”\n\nObasi is one of around one billion registered users of LinkedIn, which turned 22 years old in May. The platform is becoming increasingly popular, with some attributing its recent growth to the decline of the social-media platform X, which shed 11 million users in the European Union alone between October 2024 and March 2025.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to Obasi and seven other researchers about why they love LinkedIn, and how other scientists can use it to their advantage.\n\nGetting started\n\nTeaching researchers how to use LinkedIn is part of Hannah Roberts’s role as a careers coach in Macclesfield, UK. She specializes in helping women who work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, many of whom have little time to focus on career-development activities, she says. Roberts, who completed a PhD in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Manchester, UK, surveyed 3,000 women about their careers and found that 85% could benefit from using LinkedIn more. To use it to its full potential, Roberts says, people should have more than 1,000 contacts, and to get there, they need to be “intentional about evolving their network”.\n\nTo do so, Roberts recommends that researchers devote an hour per week to career-development activities, and make a special effort on LinkedIn as part of this (see ‘Six LinkedIn lessons from those in the know’). She suggests: “Set a timer for 15 minutes and connect with ten relevant people for your next job step”, whether that be making partnerships, finding collaborators or raising your profile to help secure future roles.\n\nSix LinkedIn lessons from those in the know\n\nSeasoned users offer their top tips for getting the best out of the professional-networking platform.\n\nSelect a short-term aim\n\n“Pick a strategy for the next six months,” advises science-careers coach Hannah Roberts, who is based in Macclesfield, UK. Maybe it’s to get a job or to find collaborators. You don’t have to stick with it forever, just choose what feels right for now.\n\nUpdate your profile\n\nYour personal page on LinkedIn is what potential collaborators and employers will see. “Ensure that all the sections of your LinkedIn profile are complete and up to date,” says Roberts.\n\nCurate your connections\n\nFollow people who are relevant to your line of work, but be judicious about who you connect with, says Ruth Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Those connections determine what shows up in your feed, she says, “If I’m randomly connecting with people, that’s a problem — because garbage in, garbage out.”\n\nBe consistent\n\nInvesting time on the site will pay dividends. For some, this means scheduling posts to ensure a regular output. For Elena Hoffer, who runs a professional-resources business in Stockholm, it means wading into conversations on her posts. “Don’t post and ghost,” she suggests. “When I post, I always comment in the first hour, just to get the discussion going.”\n\nBe brave\n\n“Putting yourself out there” is key on LinkedIn, says Sharon Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney — although this is something scientists aren’t always trained to do. Remember that your input is valuable, even in discussions with luminaries in your field. “You might have a perspective that is not amplified or not centred — you might have an unusual take.”\n\nConnect thoughtfully\n\nWhen connecting with someone you don’t know, try to build a relationship before asking for anything. “I get a lot of direct messages from people who I have no rapport with. Nothing has been built up, and instantly they will ping me a message about something that’s irrelevant, or ask me for a job,” says Roberts. “It’s a bit like jumping to ‘will you marry me?’ before we’ve even exchanged a word.”\n\nShe also suggests commenting on five posts each week, so that “people see your name, your picture and your LinkedIn headline”, adding: “If you’re employing that strategy every time you go on LinkedIn, you can massively extend that network in a short space of time. Consistency of action makes a big change.”\n\nOnce you’ve built up a strong network of connections, Roberts says that more behind-the-scenes networking can begin, including informal conversations and making yourself known to organizations that interest you the most.\n\nHow I put LinkedIn to work for my career as a scientist and entrepreneur\n\nSome people take a less-formal approach. Elena Hoffer co-founded the firm Alma.Me, in Stockholm, to help early-career researchers to transition out of academia. Hoffer, who has a PhD in medical sciences from the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and more than 100,000 LinkedIn followers says: “I always say, ‘do what fits you’. I never plan my content... I just need to feel it, you know?”\n\nRuth Gotian, whose 2022 book The Success Factor investigates how to achieve peak business performance based on her discussions with astronauts and Nobel laureates, doesn’t recommend setting yourself targets for LinkedIn activity. Instead, she suggests fitting it in where you can around your existing work: “I tell people to definitely do it during their non-peak performance hours,” says Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\n\nHow to network on LinkedIn\n\n“Networking is so weird, because it’s awkward,” says Vanesa Ayala-Núñez, an oncology researcher at the St Gallen branch of Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. “It’s not so easy to connect with someone who you don’t know.” To get around this, Ayala-Núñez sought common ground. As a Mexican, she says, speaking to other Europe-based Latin American women at science conferences and networking events “opened a lot of doors for me, because immediately you create a connection with this person — we have a lot of things in common. We have gone through a lot of similar experiences”.\n\nShe mirrored this approach on LinkedIn, being guided by people’s names, or where they studied. Writing messages to potential connections in Spanish and highlighting the things they had in common helped Ayala-Núñez to build a strong professional network. “You never know who can eventually help you,” she says.\n\nGotian’s approach is similar. “To me, LinkedIn is like air,” she says. “I use it all the time. If I’m going to meet with someone, I need some background information, and the first place I go to is LinkedIn, because what I want to do immediately is establish a connection with someone.” She might find common ground on the basis of someone’s education, hometown or work history, “and that just kicks the conversation off”.\n\nRuth Gotian is chief learning officer at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.Credit: LinkedIn\n\nGotian emphasizes that developing personal connections is key to professional networking. When approaching people, “you don’t want to sound like a salesperson, and you certainly don’t want to sound transactional. You want to build a relationship. People like to work with those who they know, like and trust”.\n\nGotian recommends the ‘24/7/30 networking model’: “Twenty-four hours after you meet someone, you connect with them, and you do it as a personal connection. ‘It was so great chatting with you. I hope you have a great time on that ski holiday you talked about.’ Seven days later, you connect again with a thoughtful comment.” This could be sending an article about something you discussed when you met, for example.\n\n“Then 30 days later, you’re following up”, sending your new connection an article or a podcast or mentioning a discussion you had that made you think of them. “You’re always circling back to that conversation. You have not asked for a thing. You’re just building up the ‘know, like and trust’ factor, and then obviously engaging with their content in a thoughtful way.”\n\nThis direct approach might make some researchers uncomfortable, but Gotian says it’s just like building a friendship. “Remember you’re not asking for anything. If anything, you’re helping the other person.”\n\nGotian cautions against using an overly serious tone. “Because if you make it too formal and stuffy, transactional and get right to business, it’s a real turn off.”\n\nHow to be authentic\n\nSo now that you’re using LinkedIn regularly, how should you act when you’re there? “You want to come through as authentically as possible,” says Lucy Lawrence, who works in science communication in London. She advises researchers to adopt a confident attitude and not to copy others’ approaches too closely. “Just because it’s working well for someone else on LinkedIn, it doesn’t mean it’s going to translate for you.” For Lawrence, who switched to science communication after completing a biomedical science degree at Nottingham Trent University, UK, in 2015, her authenticity comes from a genuine enthusiasm for the science that she writes about.\n\nA 60-minute guide to landing your next job in science\n\n“I’m a yapper and I just really like speaking to people,” she says. Posting on her blog and on LinkedIn gave her an opportunity to talk publicly about science that she found inspiring.\n\n“I grew my account to about 14,000 followers in three years just by being me and talking about things that I think are really interesting. Almost as if I’m talking to one of my friends: ‘Oh my God, this is really cool. Have you heard about this?’”\n\nBeing passionate about his research area also helped electrochemist Jyotisman Rath to reap benefits on LinkedIn. Rath posted daily for 100 days on topics ranging from a battery trivia challenge to sustainability, climate change, energy and the broader field of electrochemistry during his master’s degree at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, hoping that the daily target would help him stick to posting.\n\nThe task revealed to him just how many scientists are active on LinkedIn. “Perhaps they don’t post a lot or comment a lot, but they do definitely read people’s posts,” says Rath, who is now doing a PhD at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Daily posting enabled him to initiate conversations in comments and private messages, prompting discussion by asking others their opinions on the things he was posting about.\n\nElectrochemist Jyotisman Rath joined the LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022.Credit: Jyotisman Rath\n\nRath communicated with senior figures in his research field, as well as raising his profile, which resulted in an internship with a start-up company working on innovative battery materials, something he attributes to his frequent posts. “I was able to contact them during my challenge, then they saw what I’m doing and my ideas,” he says.\n\nRath was also selected to join the Indian cohort of the ten-week LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022. It offers a small stipend and training on how to build engaged communities.\n\nFor some, being authentic means being open about your personal life, even on a platform that is considered more professional than, say, X or Instagram.\n\nSiddharth Kankaria, a social-sciences researcher and science communicator in Kolkata, India, says LinkedIn is now his “primary social-media outlet”, making him inclined to share personal content there.",

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "Chemists have doubled the members of a family of buzzy 2D materials, and even jammed a record nine metals into one of them. The feat, published today in Science1, has excited researchers because it opens the door to designing a multitude of weird but useful substances.\n\nMeet ‘goldene’: this gilded cousin of graphene is also one atom thick\n\nThe materials are so complex that, at this point, it’s impossible to simulate them with computer models, says Max Hamedi, a physicist at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Scientists will need to test their properties in the laboratory, he adds — a tantalizing prospect. “Maybe we will get some properties that are very surprising and that we couldn’t predict.”\n\nThe newly expanded family of materials, called MXenes (pronounced ‘max-eens’), has previously caused a stir because their high electrical conductivity and other characteristics suggest that they might one day be used in technologies such as next-generation batteries and coatings that protect against electromagnetic interference. Not only that, but these materials can be dispersed in water, so they can be sprayed or painted onto surfaces.\n\nSnazzy sandwiches\n\nThe first MXene ever synthesized, a 2D sheet of titanium carbide, was reported in 20112 by a team co-led by Yury Gogotsi, a nanomaterials scientist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Unlike the iconic 2D material graphene, which is a single layer of carbon atoms, MXenes contain several layers of metal and carbon or nitrogen atoms. In the case of titanium carbide, for instance, there are two ‘bread’ layers of titanium atoms that sandwich a sheet of carbon.\n\nMove over graphene! Scientists forge bismuthene and host of atoms-thick metals\n\nBut scientists don’t have tight control over which metals end up in which layers when more are added. Certain metals ‘like’ to be in a particular layer owing to atomic properties, such as the size of each atom and its hunger for electrons, says Babak Anasori, a materials engineer at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and co-author of the latest study.\n\nSo although a person making a sandwich can stack up layers of cheese, lettuce, pickles and other ingredients in the order of their choosing, chemists making MXenes yield control to nature. To create these materials, scientists start by heating ingredients in a furnace to make crystals. In the resulting materials, certain metals always choose to be in the inner layers, whereas others are drawn to the outside.\n\nOwing to these constraints, some metals, including tungsten, zirconium and hafnium, have been challenging to incorporate, Anasori says. And scientists have not been able to make MXenes with certain metals on the inner or outer layers: for instance, molybdenum likes to go on the outside of the sandwich, whereas titanium likes to be enveloped. Materials prefer to adopt an atomic configuration that minimizes the energy — or enthalpy — needed to create it.",

          "title": "First CRISPR horses spark controversy: what’s next for gene-edited animals?",
          "authors": "Katie Kavanagh",
          "abstract": "Scientists have bred the world’s first horses with CRISPR-mediated genomic edits to enhance their muscle power and speed.Credit: Agustin Marcarian/Reuters\n\nThese horses might look like ordinary horses, but there is something highly unusual about their genomes. They are the first of their species to have their DNA edited using CRISPR–Cas9, a technique that cuts the genome at a specific location to change gene expression and achieve a desired trait.\n\nThe horses are clones of the prize-winning steed Polo Pureza, but they have a tweak to myostatin — a gene involved in regulating muscle development — that is designed to quicken their pace. CRISPR was used in fetal fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) to generate embryos through cloning, and then the embryos were implanted into mares.\n\nThe development of these five CRISPR-edited horses ten months ago, by the non-profit research organization Kheiron Biotech in Buenos Aires, is proving controversial among horse breeders in Argentina, where polo is extremely popular, Reuters reported on 30 August.\n\nCritics are concerned that the technology threatens people’s livelihoods and that it will compromise the tradition of using selective breeding to generate elite horses. The Argentine Polo Association has now banned the use of gene-edited horses in the sport, following the lead of similar organizations such as the International Federation for Equestrian Sports1, which banned the practice in 2019.\n\nSome scientists, however, welcome the CRISPR horses. “It’s cool to show that CRISPR works and you can create CRISPR-altered horses,” says Molly McCue, a veterinary clinician scientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “Horse[riders] often feel very strongly about breeding as an art and not a science, but really it is both together,” she adds.\n\nThe CRISPR horses join a menagerie of gene-edited animals that have wide-ranging applications — mostly with the goal of improving agriculture. Such efforts have now transformed from a research promise into a commercial reality, says Tad Sonstegard, chief scientific officer at Acceligen, a company in Eagan, Minnesota that specializes in the precision breeding of livestock. Biological engineering ethicist Jeantine Lunshof, at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, puts the rise of the technology in animals down to improvements in CRISPR techniques and “a broader acceptance of gene editing”.\n\nCRISPR in agriculture\n\nAcceligen is one of a handful of companies that are using CRISPR to alter the genomes of livestock, with the goal of making animal products such as meat and milk in a more efficient manner. Its ‘PRLR-SLICK’ cattle have an edit in the prolactin receptor gene that gives them shorter, slicker hair, providing tolerance to heat stress. Sonstegard says that the short-haired PRLR-SLICK cows should be able to adapt to hotter climates and to tolerate the rising temperatures associated with climate change, increasing the accessibility of meat and dairy products to people around the world. In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the PRLR-SLICK cattle for meat production and human consumption, deeming them a low risk to safety, but it’s unclear when the meat will hit the US market.\n\nWith a similar goal, researchers in India announced the first CRISPR-edited sheep earlier this year. As with the Argentine horses, the scientists edited the myostatin gene of the sheep to increase muscle mass — but in this case, the goal was to increase meat production rather than to speed the sheep up.\n\nScientists have used CRISPR to make pigs more resistant to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, and to make their meat hypoallergenic.Credit: Acceligen\n\nDisease resistance is another reason that scientists are producing CRISPR animals. Genus, a company based in Basingstoke, UK, has used CRISPR to generate pigs that contain a mutation in the CD163 gene. This makes them resistant to a virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which can be deadly for suckling pigs. In 2020, the FDA approved the gene-edited pigs for sale in the United States, and they are expected to go on the market there in 2026.\n\nResearchers are also using CRISPR to make animal products that are safer for human consumption. GalSafe pigs, made by Revivicor in Blacksburg, Virginia, are designed to be a source of hypoallergenic meat. Researchers use CRISPR to inactivate the GGTA1 gene, which produces alpha-gal, a sugar molecule found in most mammals that can cause allergic reactions in humans who eat red meat. Revivicor is also investigating whether organs from the pigs could be transplanted into people: the company says that the same gene edits might reduce the risk of pig organs being rejected from human bodies. The FDA approved GalSafe pigs for use in biomedical therapeutics and for human consumption in 2020.",

          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "A funding agency says its use of AI to sift through hundreds of grant applications makes the process more efficient.Credit: Tashatuvango/iStock via Getty\n\nIt can take weeks to write a grant proposal, so how would it feel to have a machine reject it in seconds? Researchers in Spain have been finding out, after a major funding foundation in the country turned to artificial intelligence (AI) for help with reviewing grant proposals.\n\n“We are using a model made up of three AI algorithms to screen proposals that have low chances of being finally selected in our specific health research call,” says Inés Bouzón-Arnáiz, who works on research and scholarships at the non-profit La Caixa Foundation in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nThe foundation, which distributes €145 million (US$170 million) in research funds annually, uses the AI tool to sift through hundreds of applications to its annual flagship biomedical-funding programme, which offers three-year grants of up to €1 million. By training the model on successful applications from previous years, La Caixa says it can find and advance proposals that have the best chance of success more efficiently.\n\nThe AI-assisted review scheme has run for three years. In this year’s funding round, the algorithms highlighted 122 applications from a total of 714 as having a low chance of success. This decision was checked by two human reviewers, who rescued 46 applications initially flagged for rejection by the AI system. The remaining 76 were rejected. Of the 638 proposals then sent to specialists for peer review, just 34 were funded.\n\nPros and cons\n\nThe foundation’s shift towards using AI algorithms is the latest attempt by funders to address an ever-increasing burden placed on peer reviewers.\n\n“It is difficult to find good reviewers, and if they have a big workload they won’t do it,” Bouzón-Arnáiz says. “We are taking away proposals that have no chance of being finally selected.” The move was partly prompted by reviewers who said they were often sent low-quality and immature proposals to assess, she adds.\n\nThe researchers using AI to analyse peer review\n\nAlthough the use of algorithms in the peer-review process has seeped into scholarly publishing, La Caixa thinks it’s the first funder to incorporate AI algorithms into its decision-making process in this way. Indeed, many grant-giving organizations explicitly prevent both applicants and reviewers from using the technology. UK Research and Innovation, the UK’s national funder of research, says reviewers who break that rule could face could face a lifetime ban.\n\nIt’s a live and evolving issue, however, with fresh possibilities emerging all of the time. Earlier this year, the Federation of American Scientists, a non-profit organization in Washington DC, urged the US Office of Science and Technology Policy to subject grant applications to AI analysis. The organization said this would help “predict the future of science, enhance peer review, and encourage better research investment decisions by both the public and the private sector”. And researcher funders at Imperial College London are using an AI system to scan study abstracts to identify UK projects that they want to support.\n\nBouzón-Arnáiz says it’s easier for private funders such as La Caixa Foundation to experiment with AI tools and other alternative peer-review systems because they are not using public money. Still, other grant-giving bodies contacted by Nature had mixed reactions to La Caixa’s use of algorithms.\n\n“We are very concerned about the possible breakdown in trust between researchers and funders if AI were to become an integral part of the evaluation process,” says Anders Smith, who leads the technical and natural sciences programme at the Villum Fonden, a philanthropic foundation in Søborg, Denmark. “The nightmare scenario is applications created by AI and subsequently evaluated by AI.” This could create a process that perpetuates the training biases of an AI system with no genuinely new ideas being created, he says.\n\nBy contrast, the Volkswagen Foundation, a private funder in Hanover, Germany, is assessing the technology and how it could be used. “We have started experimenting with it. However, we are really at the beginning and still need to set up all the regulatory guidelines and legal framework,” says Hanna Denecke, head of team exploration at the foundation.\n\nData security\n\nSebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI tools in research, says it’s surprising that more funders haven’t already adopted AI systems to help with the peer-review process. “The potential for efficiency gains is even greater for grants than in scholarly publishing,” he says.",

It’s a question that has puzzled both philosophers and neuroscientists for decades, but has proved notoriously difficult to answer.\n\nNow, a study that recorded the brain activity of 15 participants suggests that colours are represented and processed in the same way across different people. The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience on 8 September1.\n\n“Now we know that when you see red or green or whatever colour, that it activates your brain very similarly to my brain,” says study co-author Andreas Bartels, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Tübingen in Germany. “Even at a very low level, things are represented similarly across different brains, and that is a fundamentally new discovery.”\n\nBartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is between people.\n\nBrand-new colour created by tricking human eyes with laser\n\nThe pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of people while they viewed different colours.

          "abstract": "A study has found that exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of developing Lewy body dementia.Credit: Sonu Mehta/Hindustan Times/Shutterstock\n\nAn analysis of 56 million people has shown that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of developing a particular form of dementia, the third most common type after Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.\n\nThe study, published in Science on 4 September1, suggests that there is a clear link between long-term exposure to PM2.5 — airborne particles that are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter — and the development of dementia in people with Lewy body dementia or Parkinson’s disease.\n\nThe study found that PM2.5 exposure does not necessarily induce Lewy body dementia, but “accelerates the development” in people who are already genetically predisposed to it, says Hui Chen, a clinician–neuroscientist at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.\n\nPM2.5 exposure\n\nLewy body dementia is an umbrella term for two different types of dementia: Parkinson’s disease with dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. In both cases, dementia is caused by the build-up of α-synuclein (αSyn) proteins into clumps, called Lewy bodies, in the brain’s nerve cells, which cause the cells to stop working and eventually die. Studies have suggested that long-term exposure to air pollution from car exhausts, wildfires and factory fumes is linked with increased risks of developing neurodegenerative illnesses, including Parkinson’s disease with dementia2.\n\nStudy co-author Xiaobo Mao, who researches neurodegenerative conditions at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says he and his colleagues wanted to determine whether PM2.5 exposure also influenced the risk of developing Lewy body dementia. They analysed 2000–14 hospital-admissions data from 56.5 million people with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with or without dementia. The data served to identify people with severe neurological diseases.\n\nThey found that long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for all three neurodegenerative conditions, including a 12% increased risk for severe dementia with Lewy bodies that required hospitalization. They noted that living in areas of higher PM2.5 exposure was linked with a higher relative risk of Lewy body dementia — including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia — compared with Parkinson’s without dementia.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThe team then performed experiments in mice to investigate why exposure to air pollution affected dementia risk. Mice were exposed to PM2.5 pollution through their nostrils, then the researchers tested for behaviours linked with dementia-like problems. After ten months of PM2.5 exposure, mice showed behavioural challenges in maze exploration tests for spatial memory, and tasks that tested their recognition of new objects. At ten months, the team also observed a substantial increase in the build-up of αSyn in the animals’ brains.\n\nExposure to PM2.5 for ten months also caused shrinkage of the medial temporal lobe in mice — a brain region which is responsible for memory formation and retrieval. In comparison, there were no changes to the brains of genetically modified mice lacking αSyn, suggesting that the protein is required for neurodegenerative pathology.\n\nThe team also found clumps of αSyn in the gut and lungs of mice exposed to PM2.5, but not in the control or genetically modified mice. Mao says that αSyn acts like a seed, which can propagate and spread from the gut to the brain by way of the gut–brain axis, and eventually cause Alzheimer’s disease or Lewy body dementia. PM2.5 also accumulates in the lungs, causing inflammation before entering the bloodstream and crossing the blood–brain barrier.\n\nPredisposition needed\n\nThe researchers next investigated gene-expression changes caused by PM2.5 exposure in mice and compared them with gene-expression changes observed in people with Lewy body dementia. They focused on the anterior cingulate cortex — a brain region linked with cognitive deficits in people with dementia. They found a strong correlation of gene-expression changes between PM2.5-exposed mice and people with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson’s disease with dementia, but no correlation with Parkinson’s disease without dementia.",

          "title": "Can a bold ‘social contract’ make data sharing more palatable?",
          "authors": "Nchangwi Syntia Munung, Cornelius Ewuoso, Francis E. Agamah, Emile R. Chimusa",
          "abstract": "The past decade has seen swathes of biomedical data collected across Africa1,2. These include, for example, demographic, health and environmental data from the INDEPTH Network, which is revealing links between climate change and disease; and information about genetic diversity and disease risk factors in African populations from the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. But the promise that these and other data sets hold for improving health care and scientific innovation is at risk of being squandered, unless the data can be made more accessible.\n\nAs a group of African bioethics and data-science researchers with expertise in bioinformatics, genomics and decolonization of health research, we are well aware of these challenges in African data science. Consider the H3Africa initiative, which between 2010 and 2022 ran 51 projects aiming to improve health in Africa, funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the UK biomedical funder Wellcome. The projects ranged from studying the genomics of schizophrenia in the Xhosa people of South Africa to analysing how microorganisms in the nasal passages affect respiratory disease in African children. The H3Africa initiative overall has generated almost 1,000 whole-genome sequences and information about the traits they encode from at least 50 ethnolinguistic groups3. But in some cases, difficulties with logistics, costs and infrastructure led to delays in data collection, which in turn prevented groups from depositing their data before funding expired.\n\nHow to meet Africa’s grand challenges with African know-how\n\nMany Africa-based researchers seem to prefer sharing data informally with trusted peers or as part of projects or collaborations on grant applications, rather than securing them formally from a repository4–7. For example, data from 23,421 biological samples collected across 16 H3Africa studies can be accessed through requests to a data and biospecimen access committee. But, according to one study4, the committee received just 28 data-access requests between December 2018 and June 2023, of which only 6 came from Africa. Of the remainder, 20 were from the United States, United Kingdom and Europe combined, one came from Asia and one from South America.\n\nHere, we set out how such data hoarding can be combated by developing a ‘social contract’ for responsible data stewardship. This will require building up trust between researchers, commercial partners, governments, funders and the public by providing guarantees that data will be used in the best interests of African researchers, communities and research participants.\n\nHoarding habit\n\nData sharing is not an ingrained habit in most African countries. Many researchers are wary. For example, in a 2019 survey of 129 postgraduate students and researchers at South African universities, roughly three-quarters said that they would be happy to use external data sets for their research, yet only half would consider sharing their data5. Scientists in other African nations show similar attitudes6,7.\n\nAccording to surveys, reasons include fears about research ideas being scooped and about inadequate reward systems for sharers6,8 — as is the case elsewhere. But, in Africa, much of this reluctance can be traced back to historical and structural factors.\n\nAfrican nations too often lack control over what happens to the data they generate. Research into HIV/AIDS, for instance, has been led by teams in a few countries, such as Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon and South Africa, that are supported by institutions in high-income nations. These collaborations, although valuable, expose a deep power imbalance — decisions about data storage, secondary use and long-term access frequently rest with the partners outside Africa.\n\nSimilarly, digital health platforms on mobile devices that aim to improve maternal health care, vaccine tracking and infectious-disease surveillance across Africa — often introduced by international non-governmental organizations and technology companies — typically rely on cloud-based data-storage infrastructure hosted by foreign firms (see go.nature.com/4g2tz2h). There are few safeguards to ensure that governments or communities in Africa retain meaningful oversight of the data.\n\nOpen science, done wrong, will compound inequities\n\nEven flagship programmes that were designed to empower African science can fall short. Consortia such as H3Africa and the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network have built genomics capacities on the continent and have invested in the development of equitable data-sharing policies. But both store data in public repositories outside Africa — leading to the risk that Africa remains a data donor rather than a data power.\n\nTechnical limitations can also encourage data hoarding. Africa holds less than 1% of the global infrastructure capacity for digital data. Much of this infrastructure is concentrated in a few institutions in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya, with others lacking the means to manage, store and share data in ways that comply with the requirements of research funders, or with evolving national and international regulatory standards. And there is often a lack of staff trained in data management and analytics across African scientific institutions.\n\nThese weaknesses can lead researchers in Africa to conclude that there are limited benefits to sharing data. Added to this are worries about legal compliance if researchers need to deposit data outside their own country, as well as the risks of their research being scooped by other scientists who have more resources — African or international — if the data are made public.\n\nData hoarding might be exacerbated by requirements for informed consent and evolving data-protection laws. In many African countries, such laws emphasize the principles of specifying a purpose for the data, limiting its storage, adhering to data minimization (collecting, processing and storing only those data that are necessary for the defined purpose) and giving participating individuals the right to restrict processing and have autonomy over their health and genetic data9. Although some of the laws include exceptions for scientific research, these are often defined ambiguously. This ethical and legal uncertainty can lead to researchers not sharing data — even if research participants give broad consent for their data to be shared — for fear of breaching legal requirements. This is a particular problem in the absence of clear mechanisms for participants to withdraw consent or to provide consent for secondary uses.\n\nA social contract\n\nThere are signs that attitudes are shifting. A 2022 survey of 160 scientists engaged in data-intensive research in Africa showed that 88% would be willing to share data, provided there were robust governance mechanisms in place7. Respondents also said they would exchange data if there were opportunities for tangible benefits such as co-authorship (87%), shared royalties (53%) and collaboration on projects (78%).\n\nWhat is needed now is a system-wide move towards responsible data stewardship that takes these expectations into account. In our view, trust can best be gained by establishing a ‘social contract’ in which data sharing becomes the collective responsibility of researchers, study communities, funders and research institutions. A social contract frames data sharing not simply as a mandate from funders, but as a moral and social commitment to equity, transparency, shared responsibility and shared benefit. Similar thinking was behind the development of the Bermuda principles for DNA sequence data sharing10 and the Fort Lauderdale Agreement11, which laid the foundations of the importance of open data sharing in genomics.\n\nSaliva samples in a tuberculosis research laboratory in Benin.Credit: Yanick Folly/AFP/Getty\n\nThe social contract we propose involves four strands that together define an ethical and operational framework for using data.\n\nClear commitments to sharing and rewards. All funders should demand plans for data sharing as a part of grant proposals. They should follow up to ensure that researchers can and do share data. When institutional infrastructure is lacking, funders could offer technical support or conditional infrastructure grants to enable compliance. They should also introduce clear accountability measures, including funding restrictions or ineligibility for future grants, for individuals or institutions that consistently fail to share data without adequate justification. Commercial and international partners should also commit to data sharing in collaboration agreements.\n\nUniversities and other research institutions should consider data-sharing practices as part of their promotion criteria, as they do with publication and teaching metrics. This could extend to criteria for world university rankings, such as those generated by Times Higher Education and QS, which could incorporate open-science and data-sharing metrics to encourage institutional leaders to take the practice seriously.\n\nBenefit-sharing agreements. Academic, commercial and community partners in data-science projects should together agree on fair benefit-sharing mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, such agreements are rare in commercial collaborations involving African research data, and formal mechanisms for equitable returns are lacking12. For instance, if academics in Africa collaborate with international partners, they might agree to technology-transfer mechanisms, such as capacity-building programmes or investments in setting up and maintaining secure data infrastructure in Africa.\n\nCollaborations with commercial entities might involve a commitment that any diagnostics, treatments and tools developed using African data are made available to African communities at fair prices. Revenue-sharing agreements could ensure that African researchers (and, where appropriate, communities) receive a share of profits for any commercial products developed using their data. And social-investment clauses, such as contractual commitments that require reinvestment of a percentage of revenue into local scientific infrastructure or public health, could help to build long-term sustainability and public trust in science.\n\nInteroperability. Data-science funders and governments should invest in making data systems interoperable, which would enhance collaboration across borders and between institutions. Some efforts to do this are already under way.\n\nThe Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa initiative, for instance, is working to develop an interoperable open-data science platform called eLwazi. The initiative hosts training workshops and is developing a data catalogue to help ensure that clinical, climate and genomics data sets in research projects in Africa adhere to FAIR data principles (meaning that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).",

          "abstract": "Becoming Nature Positive: Transitioning to a Safe and Just Future Edited by Peter Vanham, Ross Chainey and Gemma Parkes Routledge (2025)\n\nAs biodiversity loss accelerates alongside the climate crisis, businesses are increasingly recognizing their role in both causing and potentially solving this planetary emergency. The scale of the problem is stark: humans and our livestock now make up around 96% of all land-based mammal biomass, leaving just 4% for the world’s remaining wild species. But progress in combating such losses remains too slow.\n\nBecoming Nature Positive offers an ambitious, timely and comprehensive guide for organizations seeking not only to reduce harms but also to regenerate nature in an active way. With more than two dozen contributors, this volume provides both theoretical grounding and practical strategies. It comes at a crucial time, as the world is working out how to meet the goal of the 2022 Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030.\n\nEnvironmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories\n\nIn the opening sections, Marco Lambertini, convenor of the Nature Positive Initiative and former director-general of WWF, the conservation group headquartered in Gland, Switzerland, traces the story of the ‘nature positive’ movement. This growing global community is committed to doing more than halting and reversing biodiversity loss: its aim is that, by 2030, the world has more nature than it did in 2020 and, by 2050, all ecosystems will have recovered.\n\nLambertini charts the movement’s emergence through early United Nations initiatives, such as the Decade on Biodiversity in the 2010s, through to the pivotal 2019 meetings in Davos, Switzerland, leading to biodiversity loss appearing as a top-ten issue for the first time in the 2020 World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report. The adoption of the 30% goal under the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2022 was a step as groundbreaking for nature as the 2015 Paris climate agreement was for climate.\n\nBut much remains to be done, as global assessments continue to show. The UN Environment Programme’s 2024 Protected Planet Report (see go.nature.com/3hc330h) reveals that 17.6% of land and 8.4% of ocean areas are now protected — an increase since 2020 that is equivalent to twice Colombia’s size. But to meet the target, this still leaves areas the size of Brazil and Australia combined on land, and an area larger than the Indian Ocean at sea, requiring protected designation by 2030.\n\nPragmatic solutions\n\nWhat distinguishes this compilation from many others is its refusal to promise simple solutions, instead acknowledging the complexity and scale of change required across business, finance, policy and society at large.\n\nThe book’s honest assessment of implementation barriers is particularly valuable. The authors acknowledge that, despite increasing corporate commitments, large gaps remain between rhetoric and action. By 2021, only 10% of firms in the Fortune 100 list of top US companies by revenue had specific, measurable, time-bound biodiversity targets. That’s twice as many as in 2016, but progress is much too slow (S. O. S. E. zu Ermgassen et al. J. Clean. Prod. 379, 134798 (2022); see also go.nature.com/47vfnw3).\n\nExamples of what can work are offered in Eva Zabey’s excellent chapter on business engagement. As chief executive of Business for Nature, a business coalition driving nature-positive action on the global stage, Zabey provides an insider’s perspective on the corporate awakening to biodiversity issues. She goes beyond categorizing businesses as either part of the problem or part of the solution, to explore the nuanced reality of different business types.\n\nThe peaks of Cuernos del Paine in the Torres del Paine National Park in Chile.Credit: Marco Bottigelli/Getty\n\nLarge companies, for instance, have the resources, scale and reach through their supply chains to drive significant environmental gains quickly, if they integrate nature-positive practices into their core strategies. Smaller firms can be more agile, piloting innovative approaches and influencing local economies and communities.\n\nPurpose-led businesses often set ambitious standards and lead by example, whereas profit-driven firms can shift entire markets when regulations and incentives align. Some companies will transform their value chains and set global benchmarks. Others will pioneer innovative business models or foster grassroots change. Zabey makes clear that actions from all types of company are needed to move the nature needle in the right direction.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nZabey also demonstrates how language enables, as well as shapes, action. Her discussion of how concepts such as natural capital (the value of everything that comes from the natural world) and ecosystem services (the direct benefits people receive from nature, including fresh air to breathe) have enabled business participation is insightful.\n\nSuch terms translate matters of ecological concern into economic and managerial language that resonates with corporate decision makers. Similarly, framing a wetland as ‘flood protection infrastructure’ recasts the natural world as an asset class or service provider, and thus makes it easier to integrate biodiversity into business models, investment decisions and policy frameworks.\n\nClear thinking\n\nIndeed, competing definitions of nature positive have been a challenge, creating a blind spot in which businesses and policymakers can talk past each other or measure progress differently. Some businesses focus on reducing harms, others on restoration, and yet others consider a more general sustainability agenda. Such confusion elevates the risk of ‘greenwashing’, in which companies portray themselves as acting on sustainability when they are, in fact, doing little. It paints an unclear picture for those setting policy agendas and misses opportunities for collaboration.",

Together, they traced more than 60 suspicious e-mail domains that were linked to Tanu.pro and appeared among the author e-mails of 1,517 papers published between 2017 and 2025, listing more than 4,500 researchers affiliated with around 460 universities across 46 countries. The majority of the authors were in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Russia.\n\n“I was astounded by the sheer number and the sheer scale of this paper mill,” says Kleiner. She and Abalkina presented their findings on 3 September at the 10th International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publications in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nPeculiar e-mails\n\nDuring her investigation into a number of peculiar e-mail domains that cropped up on hundreds of papers, Abalkina established that one of the domains was registered to a founder of a Kyiv-based company called Scientific Publications, which was established in 2016.\n\nOn its website, Scientific Publications says that it offers services such as manuscript editing, translation and submission to journals that are indexed in Scopus and the Web of Science. It claims to be able to ‘boost citations’, and says that its customers are ‘legally protected’. At first glance, “they do look like a legitimate business that just facilitates submission”, says Kleiner.\n\nBut some of the wording on the website — such as “Order the publication of scientific article in high-rated journal right now” — implies that papers are produced to order or that authors can buy their way onto papers.\n\nScience’s fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills\n\nThe investigation also found that some of the papers by authors with e-mail addresses linked to Scientific Publications, along with other companies it is linked to through ownership, contain hallmarks of paper-mill publications: fabricated data, plagiarism, irrelevant citations and signs of efforts to manipulate peer review. The presence of e-mail addresses that do not match up with authors’ listed affiliations suggests that the paper mill is creating e-mail aliases for its clients that allow it to directly correspond with journal editors, Abalkina says.\n\nScientific Publications told Nature that it does not own or use the domain tanu.pro or others identified by the investigation. When asked whether or not the company produces papers to order, sells authorships or creates e-mail addresses for its clients, a spokesperson for Scientific Publications said: “Technologies and working methods of our company are considered commercial secrets, as they provide us with a competitive advantage.”\n\n“Over nearly ten years of work in scientific consulting, our clients have included tens of thousands of researchers from more than 60 countries, who have received high-quality, transparent and reliable services,” they added. “Another important area of our activity is the prevention of ethical violations and the detection of academic misconduct. Our experts maintain ongoing professional contact with journalists, researchers and government agencies in different countries, advising them on issues of transparency and integrity in scientific publishing.”\n\nProlific paper mill\n\nThe Tanu.pro paper mill is “very prolific” and “what gets published is a very small part” of everything it produces, says Kleiner. Over the past few years, Springer Nature received 8,432 submissions linked to Tanu.pro, most of which were rejected, but 79 were published. Forty-eight of these have since been retracted, and the remaining 31 are being investigated, the publisher says.\n\n‘Stamp out paper mills’ — science sleuths on how to fight fake research",

          "abstract": "Senators grilled Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, on Thursday about vaccines, the firing of federal health officials and other matters.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nUS health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr defiantly defended his controversial actions to upend public health at a Senate hearing on 4 September. Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, also made unfounded allegations about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and accused the medical establishment of corruption.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a routine hearing about the health-care agenda of Republican President Donald Trump was anything but. The hearing devolved at several points into a shouting match, as senators grilled Kennedy on turmoil and a leadership shake-up at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which he oversees, and on his efforts to block research on mRNA vaccines.\n\nRFK Jr’s vaccine advisers vote down flu-shot ingredient — but back some jabs\n\nIn response, Kennedy repeatedly alleged that scientists, including researchers at federal agencies, had colluded with the pharmaceutical industry. He also emphasized the high rates of chronic disease in the United States, citing them as justification for his agenda. “That’s why we had to fire people at the CDC,” he said at the hearing.\n\nIn turn, several senators accused Kennedy of stacking advisory panels of independent scientists with members whose views on vaccines fall outside the scientific consensus. “This is not a podcast,” said Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado, referring to Kennedy’s frequent appearances on conservative media outlets. “This is the American people’s health that’s on the line here.”\n\nTurmoil besets the CDC\n\nOnly last week, Trump fired Susan Monarez as CDC director, barely one month into her tenure. In an opinion piece published today in The Wall Street Journal, Monarez wrote that she was dismissed after being told to fire top career CDC scientists and “preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric”. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a group that provides vaccine recommendations to the federal government, and appointed new members, some of whom are outspoken critics of US vaccination policies.\n\nAt the hearing, Kennedy denied he had told Monarez to pre-approve the vaccine panel’s recommendations, and said she was lying. He claimed he had fired her because he asked her if she was “trustworthy” and she said “no”. Asked for comment after the hearing, Monarez’s attorneys said that “secretary Kennedy’s claims are false, and at times, patently ridiculous”.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nAfter her firing, four top CDC officials resigned in protest. Kennedy admitted at the hearing that he had asked Monarez to fire career CDC staff members.\n\nKennedy repeatedly criticized the CDC during the hearing, saying it was the most corrupt US health agency, and perhaps the most corrupt agency in the entire federal government. To justify the recent shake-up at the CDC, he pointed to its performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC staff members “who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving”, he said in his opening remarks.\n\nAt one point, he said he did not know how many people had died from COVID-19 in the United States — or the number of lives saved by COVID-19 vaccines — during the pandemic. “I don’t think anybody knows, because there was so much data chaos coming out of the CDC,” he said, without elaborating. (The CDC says some 1.2 million people in the United States have died from COVID-19 so far.)\n\nSenator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked Kennedy whether Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for the initiative he launched in 2020, during his first term as president, to accelerate the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy said yes. Several senators were incredulous at this statement, given that Kennedy has cut more than US$500 million in funding for research projects investigating mRNA vaccines, and has slammed the initiative repeatedly in social-media posts.\n\nInformation sources\n\nThe hearing also made clear who Kennedy is soliciting scientific advice from — and who he’s shutting out.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic islets (artificially coloured) no longer secrete sufficient insulin in people with type 1 diabetes. Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nIn a medical first, researchers report that they have implanted CRISPR-edited pancreas cells into a person with type 1 diabetes. The cells pumped out sugar-regulating insulin for months — without the need for the recipient to take immune-dampening drugs, thanks to gene edits that allowed the cells, collected from a deceased donor, to evade detection by the recipient’s immune system1.\n\nThe study, orchestrated by the firm Sana Biotechnology in Seattle, Washington, raises hopes of an enduring cure for an autoimmune disease that consigns millions of people to a life of strict monitoring and dependence on injected insulin. “The preliminary data has definitely lifted the spirits of our community — and it’s a really elegant approach,” says Aaron Kowalski, chief executive of Breakthrough T1D, a non-profit organization in New York City formerly known as JDRF.\n\nStealthy stem cells to treat disease\n\nThe ultimate goal is to apply immune-cloaking gene edits to stem cells and then direct their development into insulin-secreting islet cells. Unedited islets made from stem cells have already shown promise for treating type 1 diabetes in a small trial, according to results published in June2.\n\nBut some independent research groups have failed to confirm that the Sana method confers immune-skirting abilities on edited cells. And the study involved only one person who received a low dose of cells for a short time — not enough “to achieve insulin independence, so clinical efficacy remains unproven”, says Tim Kieffer, a molecular endocrinologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nStill, Kieffer calls the demonstration of immune cloaking “convincing” and “a major milestone toward the goal of effective cell therapy without chronic immunosuppression”. Kieffer previously held the role of chief scientific officer at biotechnology company ViaCyte (that has since been acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts), which, like Sana, focused on developing cell therapies for type 1 diabetes.\n\nStem-cell solutions\n\nCurrently, the only way for someone with type 1 diabetes to avoid dependence on injected insulin is through the transplantation of cadaveric islet cells. The procedure can restore insulin production for years, but it is rarely performed — constrained by the scarcity of donor pancreases and the need for lifelong immune-suppressing drug therapy, which carries risks of infection, cancer and other serious side effects.\n\n‘Smart’ insulin prevents diabetic highs — and deadly lows\n\nTo address the donor shortage, some companies have turned to stem-cell technologies to generate limitless supplies of replacement islets in the laboratory.\n\nVertex is furthest along. As reported in June, the company transplanted embryonic stem-cell-derived islets into 12 people with type 1 diabetes. After one year, ten participants no longer required insulin injections2. The company plans to seek regulatory approval for this cell therapy next year.\n\nIn a similar vein, scientists at regenerative-medicine company Reprogenix Bioscience in Hangzhou, China, are creating islets from reprogrammed stem cells derived from a recipient’s own fat tissue, with early reports of success3. Both approaches, however, still require recipients to take anti-rejection drugs, either to fend off immune attacks on donor cells or to counter the autoimmune assault that persists even against a person’s own cells.\n\nStealth mode\n\nSana’s strategy aims to bypass the need for those drugs entirely. Company scientists began with islets from a deceased donor who did not have diabetes. Using the CRISPR gene-editing system, the researchers disabled two genes that normally help to flag foreign invaders to T cells, the immune system’s front-line defender. They then used a virus to shuttle genetic instructions for a protein called CD47 into the cells. This protein serves as a protective ‘do not eat me’ signal that prevents immune watchdogs, known as natural killer cells, from attacking the edited cells.\n\nBrain cells given an ‘invisibility cloak’ fix Parkinson’s symptoms in rats",

          "title": "Can researchers stop AI making up citations?",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "OpenAI says GPT-5 has reduced the frequency of fake citations and other kinds of hallucination.Credit: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) models are known to confidently conjure up fake citations. When the company OpenAI released GPT-5, a suite of large language models (LLMs), last month, it said it had reduced the frequency of fake citations and other kinds of ‘hallucination’, as well as ‘deceptions’, whereby an AI claims to have performed a task it hasn’t.\n\nWith GPT-5, OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, is bucking an industry-wide trend, because newer AI models designed to mimic human reasoning tend to generate more hallucinations than do their predecessors. On a benchmark that tests a model’s ability to produce citation-based responses, GPT-5 beat its predecessors. But hallucinations remain inevitable, because of how LLMs function.\n\n“For most cases of hallucination, the rate has dropped to a level” that seems to be “acceptable to users”, says Tianyang Xu, an AI researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. But in particularly technical fields, such as law and mathematics, GPT-5 is still likely to struggle, she says. And despite the improvements in hallucination rate, users quickly found that the model errs in basic tasks, such as creating an illustrated timeline of US presidents.\n\nOpenAI is making “small steps that are good, but I don’t think we’re anywhere near where we need to be”, says Mark Steyvers, a cognitive science and AI researcher at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s not frequent enough that GPT says ‘I don’t know’.”\n\nA feature, not a bug\n\nHallucinations are a result of the fundamental way in which LLMs work. As statistical machines, the models make predictions by generalizing on the basis of learnt associations, leading them to produce answers that are plausible, but sometimes wrong. Another issue is that, similar to a student scoring points for guessing on a multiple choice exam, during training, LLMs get rewarded for having a go rather than acknowledging their uncertainty, according to a preprint published by OpenAI on 4 September.\n\nImprovements have come from scaling up the size of LLMs — in terms of both the richness of their internal associations and the amount of data they are trained on, says Xu. But hallucinations are particularly prevalent in topics for which the model has scant training data or its underlying information is wrong, she says. Hallucinations can also happen when an AI tries to summarize or analyse papers that are too long for that model to process.\n\nEliminating hallucinations entirely is likely to prove impossible, says Mushtaq Bilal, a researcher at Silvi, a Copenhagen-based firm that makes an AI app to aid the creation of systematic reviews in science. “I think if it was possible, AI labs would have done it already.”\n\nBut reducing errors and getting a model to admit that it doesn’t know an answer have been “a pretty heavy focus” for OpenAI, says Saachi Jain, who manages the firm’s AI safety training team. According to technical documents released with GPT-5, OpenAI concentrated on “training our models to browse effectively for up-to-date information”, as well as cutting hallucinations. The firm focused on reducing hallucinations in lengthy, open-ended responses to queries, because this best represents real-life use of ChatGPT, says Jain.\n\nIn one literature-review benchmark known as ScholarQA-CS, GPT-5 “performs well” when it is allowed to access the web, says Akari Asai, an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, based in Seattle, Washington, who ran the tests for Nature. In producing answers to open-ended computer-science questions, for example, the model performed marginally better than human experts did, with a correctness score of 55% (based on measures such as how well its statements are supported by citations) compared with 54% for scientists, but just behind a version of institute’s own LLM-based system for literature review, OpenScholar, which achieved 57%.\n\nHowever, GPT-5 suffered when the model was unable to get online, says Asai. The ability to cross-check with academic databases is a key feature of most AI-powered systems designed to help with literature reviews. Without Internet access, GPT-5 fabricated or muddled half the number of citations that one of its predecessors, GPT-4o, did. But it still got them wrong 39% of the time, she says.\n\nOn the LongFact benchmark, which tests accuracy in long-form responses to prompts, OpenAI reported that GPT-5 hallucinated 0.8% of claims in responses about people or places when it was allowed to browse the web, compared with 5.1% for OpenAI’s reasoning model o3. Performance dropped when browsing was not permitted, with GPT-5’s error rate climbing to 1.4% compared with 7.9% for o3. Both models showed worse performance than did the non-reasoning model GPT-4o, which had an error rate of 1.1% when offline.\n\nOn other independent evaluations — such as the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model, which is run by the AI platform Vectara in Palo Alto, California, and looks at how often an LLM makes false claims when summarizing a document — rival models such as Google’s Gemini 2.0 slightly outperformed GPT-5, although both erred less than 1.5% of the time.\n\nLearning to admit defeat\n\nOpenAI also reported that the model was more honest in its responses than the company’s previous models were. When given a coding task that was impossible to complete — for example, owing to a lack of access to necessary hardware — GPT-5 claimed to have done the task 17% of the time, compared with 47% for o3. Although Jain wouldn’t give details of the firm’s methods, she hinted that, in later stages of the model’s training, OpenAI worked on rewarding it for answering honestly.",

          "abstract": "Credit: M. Scott Brauer/MIT/UPI/Alamy\n\nIn 1972, German-American physicist Rainer ‘Rai’ Weiss showed that laser interferometers — devices that measure tiny changes in distance using beams of light — could, in principle, detect gravitational waves. These ripples in the fabric of space and time were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 as part of his general theory of relativity. Although prototype detectors already existed, most scientists thought the task was hopeless: the waves were so faint that they shifted matter by amounts thousands of times smaller than the nucleus of an atom. Weiss demonstrated that, with extreme precision and technological innovation, they could be detected.\n\nMore than 40 years later, in 2015, gravitational waves were observed directly for the first time. This breakthrough earned Weiss one-half of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half being shared by his colleagues Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.\n\nEinstein hated entanglement — and five other quantum myths\n\nGravitational waves are produced by violent cosmic events, such as black-hole collisions or star explosions. Einstein had predicted them reluctantly, dismissing them as “of no consequence” because they seemed impossible to detect. Weiss and Thorne disagreed. They campaigned for the US National Science Foundation to fund large-scale detectors, leading to the construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with twin facilities in Washington and Louisiana; it was completed in 1999.\n\nWeiss was known for his blunt humour. After winning the Nobel Prize “for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves”, he joked to friends: “This is going to screw up my life for a year.” The irreverence was intentional.\n\nBorn in Berlin in 1932, Weiss came from an intellectual but unsettled family. His father, a Jewish communist doctor, and his mother, a Christian actress, fled Nazi Germany when Rai was still a child. The family escaped first to Prague and later to New York City, arriving in 1939. Weiss studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge but struggled, failing out in his junior year. He was rescued by nuclear physicist Jerrold Zacharias at MIT, who took him on as a laboratory technician and later a PhD student. Weiss never forgot the kindness and spent much of his career mentoring students in the same spirit.\n\nThe breakthrough proof bringing mathematics closer to a grand unified theor\n\nAfter earning his PhD in 1962, Weiss worked briefly at Tufts University in Medford and Princeton University in New Jersey, before returning to MIT in 1964, where he remained for the rest of his career. His early work included weather-balloon experiments to study the faint glow of the Big Bang, the cosmic-microwave background. His interest in gravitational waves began in 1966, while he was teaching a course on general relativity. To explain the effect of these waves to undergraduates, he sketched out the design for a laser interferometer — a device sensitive enough to register space itself stretching and squeezing.\n\nA chance conversation with Kip Thorne further strengthened his conviction. Thorne had assumed that interferometers could measure distances to the scale of only a single wavelength of light. Weiss corrected him: with careful design, the sensitivity could be orders of magnitude greater. That insight laid the groundwork for LIGO.",

This is the longest a pig organ has survived in a living person. Researchers say the outcome is a landmark case of successful xenotransplantation — the process of transplanting organs from animals to humans.\n\nThe recipient, Tim Andrews, had end-stage kidney disease and had been receiving dialysis for more than two years before he underwent the surgery in January. He has been dialysis-free since receiving the kidney. Andrews was one of three patients to receive genetically modified pig kidneys supplied by the biotechnology company eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on compassionate grounds.\n\nReaching six months’ survival is an amazing feat, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia. The first six months is the period of “highest risk for the patient and also the transplant”, he adds. Possible complications include anaemia and graft rejection, when the immune system attacks the new organ. “The six-month time point marks that things have gone extremely well,” Hawthorne says. Reaching 12 months would be another milestone and a “fantastic long-term outcome”, he adds.\n\nPreviously, the recipient with longest-surviving genetically modified pig organ was a 53-year-old US woman, Towana Looney, who had a functioning pig kidney for four months and nine days. However, the organ was removed earlier this year because her immune system began to reject it.\n\nGenetically modified\n\nAndrews received a kidney from a pig with three types of genetic modification. One involved the elimination of three antigens to prevent organ rejection; another the addition of seven human genes that reduce inflammation and the risk of bleeding complications. Retroviruses that are found in the pig genome were also deactivated.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembled thin films respond to external loads via surface instabilities that are critical to their functionality in both biology and technology. Lipid monolayers at the air–liquid interface are one such system. Tunability between out-of-plane buckling (e.g., folding) and in-plane relaxation (e.g., reorganization of lipid domains) in highly compressed lipid monolayers suggests underlying mechanistic generality. Yet, how in-plane relaxation occurs and how it is distinguished from folding remains elusive. Here, we use continuum mechanics, finite element (FE) simulations, and Langmuir trough fluorescence microscopy (FM) data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these elastic instability modes. Uniaxial loading of the Langmuir trough is evaluated in FE simulations, where the lipid monolayer is modeled as a thin sheet with a hyperelastic energy function developed to exhibit a relaxation mechanism. Results show that this material relaxation mechanism triggers tunable in-plane shear localization (shear banding). Furthermore, the simulation results of a heterogeneous model, built from fluorescence micrographs of lipid domains distributed in a continuous matrix, are rigorously compared with experimental data by domain organizational analyses. These analyses suggest shear bands are sufficient in inducing domain symmetry breaking that is characteristic of in-plane relaxation and, without such shear bands, domain organization remains in powder structure, characteristic of folding lipid monolayers. Our findings develop a hyperelastic model validated against experimental FM images that can connect the observed lipid monolayer instabilities of folding and in-plane relaxation, establishing a generalized framework with the potential to unify all other monolayer instability modes and characterize other thin film systems.",

We report that activated and proliferating malignant CLL B cells in circulation express PD-1, a protein normally expressed in T cells. PD-1 expression is absent in circulating B cells from healthy controls and nonmalignant B cells from patients with CLL. Circulating PD-1 + CLL cells are found in all treatment naïve patients, regardless of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation status or cytogenetic abnormalities. PD-1 + CLL cells are transcriptionally distinct compared to PD-1 − CLL cells and upregulate genes associated with cell activation, proliferation, and B cell receptor (BCR) and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Indeed, ex vivo stimulation of the BCR and TLR9 readily increased PD-1 expression in CLL cells from treatment-naïve patients within 24 h, an effect that was blocked by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). More importantly, patients initiating BTKi therapy experienced profound reductions in circulating PD-1 + CLL cell numbers within 1 mo, which is in line with reduction in Ki-67 + CLL cells. Elevated percentages of circulating PD-1 + CLL cells also preceded a clinical diagnosis of disease progression in patients receiving BTKi. Thus, our findings indicate that PD-1 expression is a potential biomarker to identify proliferating CLL cells in vivo and will be useful to predict response and resistance to BTKi. In addition, eliminating PD-1 + CLL cells with depleting anti-PD-1 monospecific or bispecific antibodies should be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Local neural activation drives regional increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF), in a phenomenon known as functional hyperemia. Astrocytes, which enwrap cerebral blood vessels and respond to neuronal activity through their G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), play a vital role in brain energy metabolism. Although astrocytic calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling has been widely studied in relation to neurovascular coupling, the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), another key second messenger of GPCRs, on CBF has not been established. In this study, we explored the effects of optogenetically induced astrocytic cAMP elevation on CBF. We engineered adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to express a bacterial photoactivated adenylyl cyclase in astrocytes, which triggers an increase in cAMP upon blue light stimulation. Opto-stimulation also elevated astrocytic Ca 2+ , albeit with a delayed onset under mild stimulation. In vivo imaging of anesthetized and awake wild-type mice through a thinned skull preparation revealed that optogenetically induced astrocytic cAMP elevation led to pronounced arteriole dilation, with a latency of 1.8 s and maximal dilation reached within 10 s in the awake state and slower response under anesthesia. Mild opto-stimulation causing sensory-level cAMP elevations was sufficient to induce arteriole dilation. This effect was preserved in IP 3 receptor type 2-knockout (IP 3 R2 −/− ) mice, indicating a mechanism independent of GPCR-induced intracellular Ca 2+ elevations. These findings highlight astrocytic cAMP as a key modulator of cerebral vasodilation, contributing to our understanding of local CBF regulation. This study opens broad avenues for understanding astrocyte-mediated control of CBF and its implications in neurological diseases characterized by dysregulated blood flow.",

We interpret these data in the context of elemental behavior in modern weathering environments and modern marine sediments. We find that from 2000 Mya to ca. 650 Mya, physical erosion was effective, where braided rivers efficiently delivered particles from land to the sea. Overall, chemical weathering was less efficient than now, although many easily weatherable minerals were as weathered as today. We suggest a dramatic change in weathering dynamics after 650 Mya when modern-like deep subduction originated. With this development, mantle dynamics, by promoting periodic vigorous subduction and intense mountain building, began to control the intensity of chemical weathering and particle transport to the oceans. Through spectral analysis of several geochemical records, we find that during times of enhanced subduction and mountain building, continents underwent periods of net erosion and less intense chemical weathering, while during periods of less intense subduction, continents accumulated particles, and chemical weathering was more intense. The evolution and proliferation of land plants changed chemical weathering intensity but had little apparent impact on the cyclic nature of particle transport and storage on the continents. These results could offer a framework to better understand the evolution of elemental cycling from the continents to the oceans over the last 2000 My.",

          "abstract": "We model the effect of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) adoption on U.S. power system generator capacity investment, operations, and emissions through 2050 by estimating power systems outcomes under a range of EV adoption trajectory scenarios. Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.",

          "abstract": "Chimaeras ( Holocephali ) are an understudied group of mostly deep-ocean cartilaginous fishes ( Chondrichthyes ) with unique characteristics that distinguish them from their distant relatives, sharks, skates, and rays. Unlike sharks, chimaeras lack scales and do not have serially replacing rows of serrated teeth crowned with enameloid. Instead, they possess a fused dentition of dentine tooth plates. Additionally, male chimaeras develop an articulated cartilaginous facial appendage, the tenaculum, which is covered in an arcade of tooth-like structures. These extraoral teeth remain poorly understood, and their evolutionary origin is unclear. We investigate the development of the tenaculum and its teeth throughout the ontogeny of the Spotted Ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei , to assess homology and convergence between this novel craniofacial feature and oral jaws. Our study aims to 1) describe the development of the tenaculum, 2) assess tenaculum tooth development in comparison to oral teeth and denticles, and 3) characterize the genes and tissues responsible for tenaculum tooth emergence. We found that juvenile male chimaeras develop a full tenaculum before tooth development is complete and that only mature males possess a fully toothed tenaculum. These extraoral teeth emerge from within the tenaculum rather than from the surrounding epithelium. We integrate our developmental data with fossil evidence of the tenacular dentition from the Carboniferous holocephalan Helodus simplex . Our findings show that the tenaculum is closely associated with the upper jaw and that tenacular dentition resembles separate shark-like oral tooth whorls more than modified dermal denticles.",

          "abstract": "In mammals, sperm formation is completed in the seminiferous tubules within the testis, and sperm maturation occurs during the epididymal transit of the spermatozoa. Sperm morphology drastically changes when abnormal spermatozoa migrate from the testis to the epididymis. Detailed molecular mechanisms for sperm survival in the epididymis have not been determined yet. Globozoospermia is a cause of male infertility and is characterized by round-headed spermatozoa without acrosomes, an abnormal sperm nuclear membrane, and sperm midpiece defects. Testis expressed 50 ( Tex50 ) is a testis-enriched gene that is expressed in mice and humans. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated Tex50 knockout (KO) mice and found that the KO males were sterile due to epididymal sperm malformations and impaired sperm motility. Surprisingly, electron microscopy, sperm morphology, and globozoospermia-related protein expression and localization in the KO testis were all normal. To understand this phenotype in more detail, we created TEX50-mCherry knockin mice to determine the localization of the TEX50 protein during spermatogenesis. The mCherry signals detected a ring-shaped structure surrounding the sperm acrosome and migrated to the posterior region of the sperm head. After the acrosome reaction, most of the spermatozoa retained mCherry signals. These results indicate that the Tex50 KO globozoospermia phenotype occurs after the migration of spermatozoa from the testis to the epididymis. We found that sperm membrane protein TEX50 is a putative key molecule to survive against globozoospermia-like malformations in the epididymis. It is essential for complete sperm formation and male fertility in mice.",

          "abstract": "Mechanisms underlying heterotypic subunit assembly of ion channels and other oligomeric complexes are poorly understood. In the human heart, heteromeric assembly of two isoforms encoded by the human ether-à-go-go related gene ( hERG ) is essential for the normal function of cardiac I Kr in ventricular repolarization, with loss of hERG1b contributing to arrhythmias associated with long QT-syndrome (LQTS). While hERG1a homomers traffic efficiently to the plasma membrane, hERG1b homomers are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When expressed together, the two subunits avidly associate during biogenesis. Seeking rules specifying heteromeric association, we characterized the fate of hERG1b proteins using confocal and superresolution imaging in fixed and live HeLa cells. We found hERG1b sequestered in punctate intracellular structures when expressed alone in HeLa cells. These puncta, which depend on the presence of an N-terminal “RXR” ER retention signal, represent a privileged ER subcompartment distinct from that containing ER-retained, type 2 (hERG-based) LQTS mutant proteins, which were rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Introducing hERG1a to cells with preformed hERG1b puncta dissolved these puncta by rescuing extant hERG1b. Rescue occurred by association of fully translated hERG1b with 1a, a surprising finding given previous studies demonstrating cotranslational heteromeric association. We propose that sequestration limits potentially deleterious surface expression of hERG1b homomeric channels while preserving hERG1b for an alternative mode of heteromeric hERG1a/1b channel assembly posttranslationally. These findings reveal a surprising versatility of biosynthetic pathways promoting heteromeric assembly.",

The superconducting T c in many of these materials is maximized in the regime of strong nematic fluctuations, making the role of nematicity in influencing the superconductivity a topic of intense research. Here, we use the AC elastocaloric effect (ECE) to map out the phase diagram of Ba(Fe 1− x Co x ) 2 As 2 near optimal doping. The ECE signature at T c on the overdoped side, where superconductivity condenses without any nematic order, is quantitatively consistent with other thermodynamic probes that indicate a single-component superconducting state. In contrast, on the slightly underdoped side, where superconductivity condenses within the nematic phase, ECE reveals a second thermodynamic transition proximate to and below T c . We rule out magnetism and reentrant tetragonality as the origin of this transition and find that our observations strongly suggest a phase transition into a multicomponent superconducting state. This implies the existence of a subdominant pairing instability that competes strongly with the dominant s ± instability. Our results highlight the significant role of nematic order in determining the pairing symmetry close to optimal doping in this extensively studied iron-based SC, while also demonstrating the power of ECE in uncovering strain-tuned phase diagrams of quantum materials.",

          "abstract": "Vegetation phenology, i.e., seasonal biological events such as leaf-out and leaf-fall, regulates local climate through biophysical processes like evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo. However, the net surface temperature impact of these processes—whether ET cooling or albedo-induced warming predominates—and how the dominance changes across phenological transitions and regions remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of vegetation foliage on daytime land surface temperature (LST) following six phenological transitions, spanning from the start of season to end of season, in deciduous and mixed forests across the mid- to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere during 2013–2021 using multiple satellite products and ground observations. We quantified vegetation effect as the difference between observed LST and LST estimates from the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model, representing a no-foliage scenario. We found that vegetation-induced cooling consistently outweighs warming following all phenological transitions except for the end of the season. Cooling intensity increased with vegetation greenness, ranging from 1.0 ± 0.5 °C (mean ± 0.15 SD) in 59% of forests after the start of the season (SOS) to 6.1 ± 0.8 °C in 89% of forests following the onset of maturity, before declining toward the end of the season. Over half of the regions experiencing cooling showed intensification of surface cooling with climate warming, suggesting an amplified vegetation-mediated cooling under future climate change. The findings provide a more precise understanding of the role of vegetation in modulating climate at the intraseasonal scale, highlighting the importance of integrating phenological impacts into climate adaptation strategies and Earth system modeling.",

For optimizing biomaterials capable of similar dynamical features, it is essential to understand the first step of these interactions, namely the multivalent molecular recognition between ligands and cell receptors. Here, we present the reciprocal cooperation between dynamic ligands in supramolecular polymers and dynamic receptors in model cell membranes, determining molecular recognition and multivalent binding via receptor clustering. The nonlinear dependences of the ligand concentration, receptors, and their binding affinity are observed experimentally by fluorescence and superresolution fluorescence microscopies, revealing a valency-dependent clustering mode of anchoring. The mechanism is supported by stochastic modeling demonstrating that such nonlinear dependence is unlikely in the absence of any dynamics and superselectivity. Using a coarse-grained molecular model, the subtle competition between local and global entropies that controls this anchoring mechanism explains the clustering. Further investigation using single particle tracking reveals the presence of two populations of bound and unbound receptors after the clustering process. The result of this study highlights the importance of reciprocity of dynamics in supramolecular polymer and lipid membrane for recruitment, multivalent binding, and clustering, all of which are crucial elements in the design of materials capable of actively interacting with biological targets.",

The prelimbic cortex (PL) plays a central role in this process, with a stable PL neuronal population (ensemble) recruited during operant reward learning to encode response execution. However, it is unknown how this established reward-learning ensemble adapts to changing reward contingencies, such as reward omission during extinction. Specifically, does the same ensemble adjust its activity to support behavior suppression, or is a distinct ensemble recruited for this new learning? Our data reveal that operant extinction learning recruits a distinct PL Extinction ensemble to support response inhibition, and concerted engagement of both ensembles encodes both ongoing and subsequent context-specific behavior. Using single-cell calcium imaging, we longitudinally tracked PL neurons in rats as they pressed a lever for food rewards (Training), learned to suppress responding upon reward omission (Extinction), and reinstated responding following a noncontingent “priming” pellet (Reinstatement). We trained decoders on individual rats’ PL activity patterns to predict trial-wise responses and used an in silico deletion approach to identify separate PL Training and Extinction ensembles associated with response execution and inhibition, respectively. Critically, both ensembles were reengaged and maintained their distinct roles during Reinstatement. These findings highlight ensemble-based encoding of multiple, even opposing, learned associations within the same region, demonstrating how selective ensemble recruitment enables behavioral flexibility under changing contingencies.",

However, there is a notable lack of experimental studies that examine how these active flows shape resource fields to optimize feeding. In particular, the suspected cooperative hydrodynamics provided by groups of cells remains largely unexplored due to the difficulties in visualizing these dynamic three-dimensional flows. Here, we experimentally investigate how Stylonychia lemnae ciliates form feeding clusters of independent cells around food patches. Individual feeding flows interact hydrodynamically to create a chaotic collective flow at the population scale. Using a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, we measure and predict the entire collective flow, enabling us to assess its remarkable mixing and dispersion properties. We show that the active spreading of the food patch accelerates its detection by starving cells. As many fitness advantages provided by collective flows can be envisioned, we propose that this feeding cluster represents a form of intraspecific by-product cooperative behavior.",

Applied to mesoporous silica at parts-per-million levels, the atomic armor provides thermal resistance exceeding that of existing stabilization techniques. Thermal treatment at 1,000 °C for 168 h results in a fivefold increase in specific surface area, 66% lower thermal conductivity, and a sixfold increase in pore volume compared to untreated samples. Surface viscosity is linked to sintering resistance, and glass transition temperature and fragility are introduced as design parameters. Machine-learned interatomic potentials and metabasin escape algorithm-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to reveal that materials traditionally classified as nonglass formers can exhibit glass transition temperatures and display intrinsic fragility. Alumina is identified as having a record-high glass transition temperature. By modulating the surface viscosity of nanoparticles, this approach stabilizes nanoporous structures effectively.

Herein, we find elevated levels of muricholic acid (MCA) species in the serum of girls with central precocious puberty, which strongly correlate with indices of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis activation and can reach peak levels during puberty among healthy children. Intriguingly, reduction of MCA species can lead to decreased expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and delay the early onset of puberty, while elevated MCA levels induced premature sexual development in female mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that MCA had strong activation effects on Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and MCA enhanced GnRH expression in GnRH neurons through activation of the TGR5-PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

          "abstract": "Bromodomain-and-extraterminal-domain (BET) proteins are promising therapeutic targets for refractory solid tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, acquired resistance to BET inhibitors (BETi) remains a significant clinical challenge. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of BETi resistance is therefore of critical importance. In this study, we identified the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP2 as a key driver of acquired BETi resistance in TNBC, primarily through its role in enhancing the translation of c-MYC mRNA. Given that IGF2BP2 is not an ideal target for small-molecular drugs, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-Seq) and found circRNA-BISC as a potent IGF2BP2 repressor. BISC effectively inhibited both c-MYC translation and BETi resistance. Notably, BISC contains a “CAC-linker-XGGX” motif that specifically binds IGF2BP2 rather than to IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3. The efficacy and selectivity of BISC in targeting IGF2BP2 prompted further exploration of BISC-based RNA therapeutics for TNBC. In vitro transcribed and circularized BISC, when combined with the BETi OTX-015, demonstrated impressive tumor regression in BETi-resistant TNBC models without detectable toxicity. These findings establish BISC as a potent IGF2BP2 repressor and highlight the feasibility of circRNA-based therapeutic strategies to overcome BETi resistance in TNBC.",

          "abstract": "Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae), sexual conflict maintains female-limited color polymorphisms, with one female morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of novel female morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female color polymorphisms are more likely to evolve in temperate regions and open landscapes, whereas region and habitat shifts are independent of female-color states. We also show that these macroecological patterns are mediated by population densities at breeding sites. Temperate and open habitats are associated with female-polymorphic lineages because they harbor higher densities of adults, promoting more frequent encounters between females and males. Finally, we found that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. We conclude that female color polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of premating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict.",

          "abstract": "Coopetition is a term from game theory that describes a mix of cooperative and competitive behavior. The maternal–fetal interface (MFI) among eutherian mammals presents close interaction of two distinct individuals. These interactions have resulted in a remarkable diversity in MFI structure, often interpreted as the outcome of maternal–fetal conflict. Nevertheless, the fetus and the mother share evolutionary interests since 50% of fetal genes are maternal. In hemochorial species, characterized by invasive placentation, endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs) undergo decidualization to regulate embryo implantation. In great apes, hemochorial placentation is driven by highly invasive extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT). Here, using EVTs differentiated from trophoblast stem cells, term placenta, as well as HTR8/SVneo, we demonstrate that EVTs orchestrate a transformation of the maternal stroma, reducing its resistance to invasion acquired during decidualization. Through paracrine signals, in particular IL-11, trophoblasts transform decidual ESFs from a matrix-producing to a matrix-degrading state. Notably, noninvasive cytotrophoblast cells, do not transform decidual ESFs. We further provide evidence that maternal coadaptation is critical to EVT-induced decidual transformation. Decidual ESFs upregulate expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 in response to EVTs, rewiring downstream IL-11 signaling from JAK/STAT to AP-1 specific transcription. We conclude that the evolution of highly invasive placentation is the outcome of both the evolution of invasive EVTs, as well as the evolution of maternal traits, i.e., the switch from JAK/STAT to AP-1 signaling. We interpret this as evidence for co-opetition (cooperation among competitors).",

Furthermore, the mechanical tuning curve of the male mosquito flagellum was shown not to be aligned with that of its sensory neural elements. Using a generic theoretical model for acoustic sensing, we evaluate the signal-detection advantages and disadvantages that are implied by these two schemes: distortion product detection and cascading a signal through multiple layers of oscillator elements of different characteristic frequency. Last, we show that the combination of these two schemes yields a signal detector with enhanced frequency selectivity and speed of response, thus enabling the detection of transient, narrowband flight tones.",

Here, we observe the cell behaviors of the murine neural crest in three dimensions over time and apply a free energy framework to more wholly understand why cells ingress. Guided by work on granular matter that provides a path by which to define the roles of stochastic mechanisms in nonequilibrium systems, we measured and manipulated biophysical parameters in vivo. The data suggest that an energy barrier to cell ingression is overcome by a combination of relatively favorable cell adhesion energies, high cell shape fluctuations, and entropic cell packing configurations. Under those conditions, cell ingression may proceed spontaneously. Recognized biophysical cues likely tilt these parameters to make the process more robust.

Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g., growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.",

          "abstract": "Cyanobacteria achieve highly efficient photosynthesis using a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism relying on specialized Type I (NDH-1) complexes. Among these, NDH-1 3 and NDH-1 4 catalyze redox-coupled hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate, supporting carbon fixation in carboxysomes. The mechanism of coupling electron transfer to CO 2 -hydration by these variant NDH-1 complexes remains unknown. We engineered a Synechococcus PCC7942 strain that expresses exclusively the high flux/low affinity NDH-1 4 complex, enabling the observation of the coupling of CO 2 hydration to cyclic electron flow in isolation from the other NDH-1 isoforms normally present in cells. We found that inhibition of the CupB protein by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxzolamide (EZ) suppressed CO 2 uptake, slowed photosystem I rereduction, and abolished proton pumping as probed by acridine orange fluorescence. These effects were absent in strains lacking Cup proteins, confirming specificity. The results demonstrate that CO 2 hydration and electron transfer through NDH-1 4 are tightly coupled via proton translocation across the thylakoid membrane. These findings provide direct evidence for the bidirectional interaction in bioenergetic coupling between the plastoquinone reduction and the CO 2 uptake at the distal Zn-site over a span of ~150 Å and support a proton-removal hypothesis involving the proton transfer pathways from the Zn-site of CO 2 hydration to an energetically coupled proton loading site evolutionarily repurposed from the ancestral proton pumping mechanism to enable energetic CO 2 uptake.",

By periodically modulating and tracking cell positions along the z-axis, Electro-LEV identified distinct levitation behaviors between single cells and cell clusters, with clusters responding more rapidly to magnetic field changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Electro-LEV significantly enhances the purity and efficiency of levitational sorting, achieving 10-fold enrichment of live cells from 50% starting viability samples and 18.8-fold enrichment from 10% starting viability samples. These results establish Electro-LEV as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity, differentiating cell sizes and types, and improving cell sorting efficiency.

Through crystal engineering strategies, the adsorption capacity of HMIC for anions and water molecules can be regulated, thereby facilitating cation hopping transport and enhancing electrochemical stability. As a result, optimized HMIC shows exceptional properties, including an extraordinarily high Zn 2+ transference number (t Zn2+ = 0.81), an expanded electrochemical stability window (~2.6 V), and an exceptionally high Zn 2+ ion conductivity (8.6 mS cm –1 , 25 °C).

          "abstract": "Across taxonomical domains, synonymous codons of an amino acid are found to be used at unequal frequencies within genomes. This codon usage bias (CUB) is highly variable across species. Genome-wide CUB reflects a balance between adaptive and nonadaptive microevolutionary processes within a species. Variation in microevolutionary processes results in across-species variation in CUB. As CUB is tightly linked to important molecular and biophysical processes, it is critical to understand how changes to these processes are linked to changes in microevolutionary processes. We employed a population genetics model to quantify natural selection and mutation biases on a per-codon basis across the Saccharomycotina budding yeast subphylum. We find that the strength of natural selection and mutation biases varied significantly between closely related yeasts. Across-species variation in natural selection reflected the evolution of tRNA gene copy number (tGCN). Additionally, we find that changes to tRNA modification expression can contribute to changes in natural selection across species independent of changes to tGCN. Both lines of evidence support the link between the evolution of the tRNA pool and natural selection in codon usage through changes in the translation efficiency of a codon. Furthermore, we show that changes to tGCN often reflected changes in genome-wide GC%, suggesting changes in the tRNA pool reflect changes in mutation biases.

By prestressing the Kresling cell by means of special springs with individual control, we induce either global or localized (i.e., crease level) frustration, which allows changing the energy barrier (cell or assembly). We investigate the mechanical behavior of frustrated Kresling assemblies, both theoretically and experimentally, under various loading and boundary conditions. Our findings reveal that changing the frustration state leads to precise control of folding sequences, enabling previously inaccessible folding paths.

U- 13 C-glucose/glutamine isotope tracing revealed a metabolic shift from the pentose phosphate pathway to oxidative phosphorylation, accelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle and switching substrate preference from glutamine to glucose. These effects were abolished by electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors or in ρ 0 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, emphasizing the necessity of mitochondrial function for differentiation. Dietary RA and uncoupler treatment promoted tumor differentiation in an orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft model, evidenced by neuropil production and Schwann cell recruitment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of xenografts revealed that this strategy effectively eliminated the stem cell population, promoted differentiation, and increased mitochondrial gene signatures along the differentiation trajectory, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a common form of ocular fibrosis, is a major cause of blindness, characterized by the formation of extensive fibrous proliferative membranes. Understanding the cellular origins of PVR-associated fibroblasts (PAFs) is essential to decipher the mechanisms of ocular wound healing. In this study, we combined single-cell transcriptomics with genetic lineage tracing to map the contributions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, immune cells, and Müller cells to disease progression. RPE cells were found to constitute the largest fraction of cells within PVR lesions, transitioning through metabolic, proliferative, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition stages during their conversion to PAFs. These cells exhibited remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity. Notably, Pdgfrb + RPE cells demonstrated significant morphological plasticity, transitioning toward a fibroblast-like phenotype, while macrophage-like RPE cells acquired inflammation-related functions post-PVR. Cell communication network analysis identified Thbs1 (encoding TSP-1) as a key hub gene driving RPE cell fate transitions during PVR. Importantly, therapeutic antibodies targeting TSP-1 significantly mitigated PVR progression. This study provides a detailed roadmap of fibrosis formation during ocular wound healing and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSP-1 in the management of PVR.",

The same technology was applied to cultured macrophages exposed to cholesterol crystals, and the observations made on the macrophages were compared to those made on the pathological tissue. We observed that cholesterol crystal digestion and, eventually, cholesterol crystal clearance occurs in the advanced human plaques through cellular processing. Our findings suggest that cholesterol crystal disassembly occurs through the esterification of crystalline cholesterol to cholesteryl-ester in isolated volumes, whereby the ester aggregates into intra- and extracellular pools. The hypothesis is supported by the close similarity of the processes imaged in the human tissue and in the macrophages and is in agreement with earlier biochemical studies performed on cultured macrophages.",

          "abstract": "Humans and other organisms make decisions choosing between different options, with the aim of maximizing the reward and minimizing the cost. The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, recent observations challenge this model. It was found that inhibitory tone increases during situations of difficult discrimination tasks, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for directional decision-making of animals moving in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model that includes global inhibition and use it to describe two-choice decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain’s decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered phases. Within the model, this observation can be explained by noting that this critical region has unique dynamics that give rise to advantageous properties for the decision-making process.",

Here, we use a combination of stable isotope imaging and tracing to reveal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) exchanges among three symbiotic primary producers that fuel a salmon-bearing river food web. Bulk isotope analysis, nanoSIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) isotope imaging, and density centrifugation for quantitative stable isotope probing enabled quantification of organism-specific C- and N-fixation rates from the subcellular scale to the ecosystem. After winters with riverbed-scouring floods, the macroalga Cladophora glomerata uses nutrients in spring runoff to grow streamers up to 10 m long. During summer flow recession, riverine N concentrations wane and Cladophora becomes densely epiphytized by three species of Epithemia , diatoms with N-fixing endosymbionts (proto-organelles) descended from a free-living Crocosphaera cyanobacterium. Over summertime epiphyte succession on Cladophora , N-fixation rates increased as Epithemia spp. became dominant, Cladophora C-fixation declined to near zero, and Epithemia C-fixation increased. Carbon transfer to caddisflies grazing on Cladophora with high densities of Epithemia was 10-fold higher than C transfer to caddisflies grazing Cladophora with low Epithemia loads. In response to demand for N, Epithemia allocates high levels of newly fixed C to its endosymbiont. Consequently, these endosymbionts have the highest rates of C and N accumulation of any taxon in this tripartite symbiosis during the biologically productive season and can produce one of the highest areal rates of N-fixation reported in any river ecosystem.",

Such topology-changing processes are of fundamental interest. They are also essential for intercellular transport, transcellular communication, and drug delivery. However, studies of vesicle formation are challenging because of the rapid dynamics and small length scale involved. We develop fluid colloidosomes, micrometer-sized analogues of lipid vesicles. The mechanics of colloidosomes and lipid vesicles are described by the same theoretical model. We study colloidosomes close to their disk-to-sphere topological transition. Intrinsic colloidal length and time scales slow down the dynamics to reveal colloidosome conformations in real time during their assembly and disassembly. Remarkably, the lowest-energy pathway by which a closed vesicle transforms into a flat disk involves a topologically distinct cylinder-like intermediate. These results reveal aspects of topological changes that are relevant to all liquid capsules.

Here, we combine two nucleic acid delivery approaches to create CRISPR lipid nanoparticle–spherical nucleic acids (LNP–SNAs) that are both efficient and biocompatible. Compared to lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) lacking a surface-bound DNA shell, CRISPR LNP–SNAs exhibit two- to three-fold higher cellular uptake, reduced cytotoxicity, and improved gene transfection efficiency. Across multiple cell lines and genomic loci, CRISPR LNP–SNAs induce insertion–deletion mutations at average frequencies two- to three-fold higher than those observed with LNPs.

          "abstract": "Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4 , the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.",

T cell exclusion is mediated by the interaction between CXCR4 on T cells and its ligand, CXCL12, which is complexed to keratin-19 (KRT19) on the surface of PDA cells. KRT19 secretion by PDA cells is essential to this process but is unusual because KRT19 lacks an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-directing signal peptide (SP). By using biotinylation by an ER-restricted TurboID system and a split-GFP assay in PDA cells, we demonstrate that KRT19 enters the ER via its “head” domain. Additionally, KRT19 is shown to interact with the signal recognition particle and its secretion is sensitive to canonical protein secretion inhibitors. In vivo, mouse tumors formed with ER-TurboID-expressing PDA cells contain biotinylated KRT19. In contrast, keratin-8 (KRT8), which colocalizes with KRT19 on the surface of PDA cells, does not enter the ER. Rather, KRT8 is externalized via secretory autophagy possibly in a complex with KRT19. Thus, despite lacking a classical SP, PDA cells secrete KRT19 to capture CXCL12 and protect against immune attack.",

We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets.

However, understanding how wild predators may use multimodal sensing when hunting prey in split-second interactions remains largely unexplored. As nocturnal hunters, bats rely on echolocation to navigate and to locate evasive prey, yet they have retained functional vision, despite the associated costs. We therefore hypothesized that bats use vision to enhance sensory redundancy when commuting and tracking small insects. To test this, we equipped 21 wild common noctule bats ( Nyctalus noctula ) with high-resolution light, sound, and motion sensor loggers and measured their echolocation and movements while commuting and foraging in both dark and lit environments. When commuting, the bats maintained consistent echolocation sampling across light levels. However, when tracking prey in illuminated environments, the bats emitted calls with half the rate and with 7 dB higher call levels compared to in dark conditions, but at much faster approach speeds (from 5.2 in darkness to 7.9 m/s in lit conditions). This suggests that, in illuminated environments, hunting bats integrate acoustic and visual information, resulting in more efficient approaches to prey. Our findings demonstrate how a wild sensory specialist predator uses multimodal sensing to hunt efficiently in highly dynamic resource landscapes.",

This increase is initiated by the male seminal fluid protein ovulin and is executed by female pathways, including octopamine (OA) neuronal signaling. Despite OA signaling’s central role in ovulation regulation, the broader molecular landscape underlying female control of ovulation remains poorly understood. Here, using ovulin as a probe, we performed evolutionary rate covariation and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction screens to identify candidate female ovulation-regulating proteins. Ovulation assays performed on knockdowns or mutants of identified membrane-protein candidates revealed seven important female ovulation regulators: Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, mthl9, Smog, Cirl, and CG6067. Lgr3 and GabaβR1 function in an ovulin-dependent manner, while SIFaR and mthl9 regulate ovulation independently of ovulin. For proteins with known nervous system expression, we examined their requirement in OA neurons and their expression in female reproductive tract neurons. Tissue-specific knockdown revealed that Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, and CG6067 act in OA neurons to influence ovulation, highlighting OA neurons as a key signaling hub. Additionally, Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, Smog, and Cirl are expressed in OA neurons innervating the reproductive tract, suggesting a potential local function. Finally, we identified evidence of recurrent positive selection having acted on residues within Smog’s ligand binding region, which is interesting in light of ovulin’s rapid evolution. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the molecular networks regulating ovulation following mating in Drosophila .",

Highlighting the importance of FcγR-mediated signaling in the regulation of the fate, activation, and differentiation status of leukocytes, FcγRs are ubiquitously expressed by nearly all leukocyte populations. Here, we report that while at steady state, T cells are negative for all classes of FcγRs, CD8 T cells specifically induce the expression of the activating FcγR, FcγRIIIa, in response to viral infection in cohorts of COVID-19 and dengue patients, as well as in virus infection models using FcγR humanized mouse strains. In in vivo mechanistic studies, we demonstrate that induction of FcγRIIIa expression on effector CD8 T cells follows a well-defined trajectory that closely tracks the course and magnitude of the immune response, while immune resolution is characterized by receptor downregulation. Uniquely to these CD8 T cells, FcγRIIIa crosslinking alone is paradoxically insufficient to elicit T cell activation and cytotoxicity. However, when coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, it results in synergistic cellular activation and, compensates for the downregulation of canonical costimulatory molecules on terminal effector CD8 T cells. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for FcγRIIIa as a unique costimulatory molecule that synergizes with TCR signaling to lower the effective threshold required for CD8 T cell activation, highlighting the role of virally induced antibodies in modulating CD8 effector cell responses.",

Climate change is threatening krill populations and their predators, while current catch limits do not take into account climate variability or krill population dynamics. In 2024, CCAMLR was unable to renew its spatial catch limits, highlighting the urgent need for improved management of the krill fishery to prevent any harm to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To address this, we propose a management framework that integrates variability in krill recruitment and key pathways between spawning and nursery areas—a krill stock hypothesis—to inform decisions on catch limits and conservation measures. Implementing this approach will require targeted data collection, which we propose can be achieved through a multisector collaborative network that combines traditional and new technologies, including the use of fishing vessels as data collection platforms. We use case studies to demonstrate how fisheries can contribute to data collection while promoting sustainable management. A major challenge in this effort is securing long-term funding for data collection, which is critical for managing climate-sensitive populations of high commercial interest. We therefore recommend using the industry as a source of funding, research platform and data provider, alongside national research funding opportunities. Given the fundamental role of krill in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, its decline would have cascading effects on predators and essential ecosystem services.",

Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest.",

Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of sporadic and familial BDII patients, we found that Serinc2 expression showed deficits in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, resulting in decreased synaptic pruning. Further, combining the microglia-specific Serinc2-deficient mouse and iPSC-microglia models, we found that microglial Serinc2 deficits functioned through attenuating the synthesis of serine-related phospholipids in the plasma membrane, thus resulting in depression-like behavioral abnormalities in the animals. Finally, we showed that the Serinc2-dependent lipid deficits diminished microglial membrane CR3 formation to interrupted synaptic pruning signals from neurons.

In this study, we propose a model for a three-dimensional deformable cellular composite particle consisting of self-propelled rod-shaped colloids confined within a flexible vesicle—representing a superstructure we call a “flexicle” that couples particle deformation to the internal dynamics of the internal active components. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the collective behavior of dense systems composed of many flexicles. We show that individual flexicles exhibit shape changes upon collisions with other flexicles that lead to rearrangements of the internal active rods, which slows flexicle motion. This shape deformability gives rise to a diverse set of motility-induced phase separation phenomena and the spontaneous flow of flexicles reminiscent of the migration of cells in dense tissues.

          "abstract": "12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX, Alox15 ) generates bioactive oxygenated lipids during inflammation, however its homeostatic role(s) in normal healing are unclear. Here, the role of 12/15-LOX in resolving skin wounds was elucidated, focusing on how its lipids act together in physiologically relevant amounts. In mice, wounding caused acute appearance of 12/15-LOX-expressing macrophages and stem cells, coupled to early generation of ~12 monohydroxy-oxylipins and enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPL). Alox15 deletion increased collagen deposition, stem cell/fibroblast proliferation, IL6/pSTAT3, pSMAD3, and interferon (IFN)-γ levels. Conversely, CD206 expression, F480+ cells, and MMP9 and MMP2 activities were reduced. Alox15 −/− skin was deficient in PPARγ/adiponectin activity. Furthermore, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated as normal during wounding, many including Il6, Il1b, ccl4, Cd14, Cd274, Clec4d, Clec4e, Csf3, Cxcl2, and miR-21 failed to revert to baseline during healing, indicating disruption of PPARγ’s anti-inflammatory brake on NLRP3/inflammasome and TGF-β signaling. Reconstituting Alox15 −/− wounds with a physiological mixture of Alox15 -derived primary oxylipins generated by healing wounds restored MMP and dampened collagen deposition. The oxylipin mixture activated the PPARγ response element in vitro, while in vivo, its coactivator, Helz2 , was significantly upregulated as well as several fatty acid and prostaglandin PPARγ ligands. Additional inflammatory and proliferative gene networks impacted by Alox15 −/− included Elf4, Cebpb , and Tcf3. In summary, 12/15-LOX generates abundant monohydroxy oxylipins that act together via PPARγ. The identification of multiple gene alterations reveals several targets for treating nonhealing wounds. Our studies demonstrate that 12/15-LOX oxylipins act in concert, dampening inflammation in vivo, revealing the need to consider lipid signaling holistically.",

          "abstract": "Reducing charge carrier transport losses, improving selectivity, and minimizing non-radiative recombination are essential for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts, and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM 2.5 exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)–deficient mice. PM 2.5 exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM 2.5 –induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM 2.5 samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM 2.5 -exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM 2.5 ’s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.",

The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H 2 ) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H 2 dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H 2 dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO 2 to ethane in &gt;99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in &gt;99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.",

Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ ( Retnlg or RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specific Retnlg deletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.",

Across Rodentia, we find that most extant genera and ancestral lineages bear D1 nails. Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates.

Most neural diversity is embodied in various types of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) interneurons, grouped into four major families. We collected datasets of opto-tagged neurons from all four families, along with excitatory neurons, from both the neocortex and hippocampus. The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members. We further showed that these motifs differentially control the place field features of pyramidal neurons.

Repletion of adenosine, but not other nucleotides, restored ATP generation, which required a nuclear-encoded purine biosynthetic enzyme, adenylate kinase 4 (AK4). Analysis of 369,912 UK Biobank participants revealed a graded association between mutation burden and chronic kidney disease severity as well as an independent increase in the risk of future acute kidney injury events (p &lt; 10 −7 ). Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations may therefore reflect the cumulative effect of acute injuries to metabolically active cells, impairing major functions in a fashion amenable to nuclear-controlled purine biosynthesis.",

Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, “SCORE,” that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues.

          "abstract": "Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems.",

Although similar geometry-induced phenomena in chiral organic molecule-based systems were observed, synthesizing uniform inorganic nanostructures with desired chirality using a scalable method remains challenging. We electrochemically synthesized chiral ferromagnetic cobalt-iron nanohelices from nanoparticles in anodized aluminum oxide templates. The spiral directions and the number of strands were regulated by incorporating chiral molecules and applying an appropriate potential. We demonstrate the observation of Faraday’s law of induction at the nanoscale and show how chiral nanohelices regulate the electron flow direction. The implications of our findings extend to the technological realm, with chirality- and ferromagnetism-based spin-tunable devices.",

          "abstract": "Cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.",

          "abstract": "We used a retrained machine learning workflow to enhance the performance of the seismic monitoring network at Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc) for improved tracking of the evolution of volcanic unrest. We analyzed the recent (1/21/22 – 03/20/25) continuous seismic data, which showed a sharp increase in seismicity at the highly populated CFc. Our analysis expanded the seismicity catalog from around 12,000 to over 54,000 earthquakes. The more complete picture of seismicity revealed a sharply defined caldera ring fault system (RFS) featuring a very narrow depth range of seismicity, clearly illuminated shallow faults in the northern part of the caldera and uncovered a source of very shallow hybrid earthquakes likely related to the hydrothermal system. To date, we have not observed any direct signature of upward migration of magma, nor have we observed seismic activity at depths below 3.7 km on or inside the RFS.",

          "abstract": "The global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.",

We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multiomic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction with p53 inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through coactivation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. By contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intraluminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.",

Apoptosis-unrelated roles of MCL-1 in metabolism may contribute to this requirement, although their relevance for embryogenesis and postnatal life remains unclear. We hypothesized that BCL-XL and BCL-2 may substitute MCL-1’s anti-apoptotic but not its apoptosis-unrelated functions. Replacing MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 supported embryo development by rescuing the Mcl-1 −/− preimplantation lethality. Mcl-1 Bcl-xL/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 Bcl-2/Bcl-2 mice were born on a mixed background, although they showed metabolic defects. Thus MCL-1’s apoptosis-unrelated functions appear critical in later development, with BCL-XL, but not BCL-2, partially compensating. These findings clarify MCL-1’s distinct physiological roles, critically informing MCL-1 inhibitor development as cancer therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Artists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted creators to matched nonadopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”",

Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4 + T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4 + T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96 Hi CD4 + T cells exhibited a proinflammatory T H 1/T H 17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of T H 1/T H 17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4 + T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.",

Variations in translation rhythm can cause misfolding linked to disease; however, predicting cotranslational folding pathways remains challenging. Here, we computationally predict and experimentally validate a vectorial hierarchy of folding resolved at the atomistic level, where early intermediates are stabilized through non-native hydrophobic interactions before rearranging into the native-like fold. Disrupting these interactions destabilizes intermediates and impairs folding. The chaperone trigger factor alters the cotranslational folding pathway by keeping the nascent peptide dynamic until the full domain emerges. Our results highlight an unexpected role of surface-exposed residues in protein folding on the ribosome and provide tools to improve folding prediction and protein design.",

          "abstract": "Ketonyl C -glycosides, a vital subclass of alkyl C -glycosides, play essential roles in drug discovery, biochemistry, and materials sciences. However, a practical strategy that merges bench-stable glycosyl donors with styrenes—a ubiquitous class of synthetic building blocks—remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonyl C -glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units. Demonstrating synthetic versatility, this method enables efficient access to diverse drug-sugar conjugates and complex C -glycopeptidomimetics. Mechanistic studies reveal key intermediates, suggesting a radical-polar crossover pathway. This study offers a broadly applicable approach to valuable sugar-containing structures.",

This work highlights that the strength of electronic correlations in nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical charge-transfer insulator, can be coherently reduced by tuning the intensity of an optical pulse excitation. This weakening of correlations persists for hundreds of picoseconds and exhibits a recovery time independent of photodoping density across two orders of magnitude. A broadening of the charge-transfer gap is also observed, consistent with dynamical screening. The high degree of control achieved over both the energy and temporal dynamics of electronic correlations offers a promising avenue to a full optical control of correlated systems and the Mott transition.",

PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser 449 as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr 192 phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr 192 not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser 449 phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity.",

Using satellite data, we characterized how PSMA has affected high seas vessel behavior and identify opportunities to strengthen its impact. PSMA adoption has increased travel distances to the nearest ports in States not Party to PSMA and channeled more fishing effort to domestic and PSMA Party ports. However, domestic fishing fleets need greater attention because they constituted 66% of port visits in 2021. Among reflagged vessels, we also found a 30% increase in visits to PSMA ports by vessels shifting to domestic flags after PSMA entered into force, allowing them to avoid PSMA requirements for foreign vessels.

          "abstract": "Advances in brain stimulation have made it possible to target smaller and smaller regions for electromagnetic stimulation, in the hopes of producing increasingly focal neural effects. However, the brain is extensively interconnected, and the neurons comprising those connections may themselves be particularly susceptible to neurostimulation. Here, we test this hypothesis by identifying long-range projections in single-unit recordings from nonhuman primates receiving transcranial alternating current stimulation. We find that putative long-range projections are more strongly affected by stimulation than other cells. Specifically, they are both more entrained on average and account for occurrences of extremely strong entrainment. Given that stimulation appears to target the edges, rather than nodes, of neural networks, it may be necessary to rethink how neurostimulation strategies are designed.",

Here, we propose a circularly polarized optical mapper capable of generating high-entropy, noise-resistant keys, serving as a physical interface for unique interaction process between parties. To materialize this mapper, we developed an automated, in situ synthesis platform that facilitates the self-acting fabrication of robust, solid-state, chiral optical spin constrained assemblies. Our mappers, formed by randomized arrays of discrete assemblies, demonstrate near-theoretical performance in uniformity (0.4917), uniqueness (0.4968), and reliability (0.9355). By emitting high-dimensional spin-polarized light, our mappers enable both far-field readout and near-field authentication, with resistance to stray light interference, offering promising applications in the internet of things, augmented reality, and beyond.",

Using fluorescent-labeled AGs and flow cytometry, we quantified differential uptake. To enhance AG efficacy, we screened 198 carbon sources for their ability to induce transporter expression using a cmtA - gfp fusion. Uridine emerged as a strong inducer of cmtA and 12 additional AG-importing transporters. Coadministration of uridine considerably improved AG efficacy against clinical and resistant E. coli strains by enhancing drug uptake. This combination also improved outcomes in human blood ex vivo and in a murine urinary tract infection model. Given uridine’s clinical safety, it holds promise as an adjuvant to potentiate AG treatment against multidrug-resistant infections.",

          "abstract": "Wheat production is limited by the rapid expansion of salinized arable land worldwide. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the salt stress response is of great importance. Here, we uncovered the NAC-type transcription factor, TaVOZ1, as a positive regulator of wheat salt tolerance. Its overexpression could enhance yield and biomass production under salt stress, while TaVOZ1 knockdown attenuates salt tolerance. TaVOZ1 transcriptionally activates stress-responsive genes, especially HKT1 -family transporters, decreasing shoot Na + accumulation. However, the RING-type E3 ligase, TaGW2, directly interacts with and ubiquitinates TaVOZ1, promoting its ubiquitin/26 S proteasomal degradation. TaGW2 overexpression reduces salt tolerance, while its knockdown or knockout enhances wheat response to salt stress. Moreover, we found a moonlight function of TaGW2 wherein it binds the same DNA motifs as TaVOZ1 to block its up-regulation of HKT1 -family genes while coordinately governing both the salt tolerance and grain yield. This study highlights the functional versatility of TaGW2 and defines an antagonistic TaGW2-TaVOZ1 regulatory module in wheat salt tolerance.",

Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA.",

Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures.

          "abstract": "Subretinal injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) is generally more efficacious and less inflammatory than intravitreal injection for retinal gene therapy. However, adverse events (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy) have been reported in many patients receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) and experimental gene therapies. Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2- GFP ). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2- GFP ( n  = 11) was compared to subretinal ( n  = 5) and intravitreal AAV2- GFP injection ( n  = 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation. This technology could advance gene therapy for retinal degenerations and other ocular or systemic disorders.",

          "abstract": "Age-related deterioration in bone strength among Western humans has been linked with sedentary lifestyles, but the effect remains debatable. We evaluated aging of diaphyseal strength and cortical bone loss in a European Holocene sample of 1881 adult humeri, femora, and tibiae. Diaphyseal aging did not differ between Early and Late Holocene adults, despite their differences in physical activity. Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area. This indicates that subperiosteal apposition did not fully biomechanically compensate for the medullary expansion. Diaphyseal strength remained unchanged through age in female femora and male diaphyses but declined in female humeri and tibiae. We highlight the importance of postnatal growth to compensate for adult medullary expansion. Diaphyseal aging is critical for the upper limbs, as humeri are more sensitive to aging than femora and tibiae.",

Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment, leading to phenotypic remodeling. A critical component of the ECM mechanosensing machinery, including the protein talin, is organized at the cardiomyocyte costamere. Our previous work indicated a different talin tension, depending on the ECM stiffness, but the effects on downstream signaling remained elusive. Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.",

Here, we introduce a micromanipulation platform that effectively constrains cell distribution to enable patterned and complex organoid biofabrication. This system integrates multidimensional cell sense technology to provide real-time feedback, enabling adaptive fluid dynamics control that robustly compensates for seeding-induced nonlinear fluidic perturbations. Through this closed-loop control, the micromanipulation platform effectively restrains the spatial distribution of multiple cell types, promoting consistent self-assembly. Using this platform, we have successfully achieved programmable organoid manufacturing as well as the construction of assembloids composed of multiple cell types that better mimic mature organ microenvironments. This supports advancements in organoid-based biomechanism discovery, drug screening, and other organoid-related investigations.",

We epitaxially grow arrays of crystal phase–engineered InP nanosheets with atomically smooth sidewalls as both the laser active medium and a symmetry-broken quasi-BIC cavity, strategically optimizing coupling between spontaneous emission and the lasing mode. Furthermore, we leverage the dipole selection rule associated with the wurtzite crystal structure of the nanosheets for side mode suppression, achieving single-mode lasing at room temperature with lasing threshold as low as 14 μJ cm −2 pulse −1 . Optimal light-cavity coupling is evidenced by spontaneous emission factors as high as 0.8, showcasing the potential of bottom-up BIC lasers in realizing near-thresholdless lasing at room temperature.",

More than 800 short-duration seismic events were detected within 28 days along a 150-kilometer profile, indicating widespread ongoing explosive gas release. We suggest that billions of tons of hydrogen gas were produced through serpentinization associated with fluid infiltration via fractures formed by bending of the oceanic plate. Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes. Oxygen released from circulating seawater can be concentrated at crustal depths and then mixed with mantle-derived hydrogen. Explosion of the gas mixture releases large amounts of heat that triggers further explosions of compressed hydrogen gas and results in the formation of hydrothermal pipes.",

Current apheresis systems require large blood volumes and are primarily designed for adults, making them unsuitable for children and small animals. These systems often indiscriminately remove both harmful and protective antibodies, increasing the risk of complications such as life-threatening infections. To address this critical need, we developed acoustofluidic-based system for targeted antibody removal in transplantation (A-START). A-START is engineered to handle small blood volumes and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical small animal trials. In a sensitized rodent skin transplantation model, A-START only demands 240 microliters of blood, selectively removing donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) while preserving protective antibodies, such as tetanus antibodies. A-START retains ~95% of beneficial antibodies and achieves a 60% improvement in DSA removal compared to conventional methods. These findings highlight the transformative potential of A-START as a promising, reliable, scalable solution for improving outcomes in pediatric transplantation and treating antibody-mediated diseases.",

We show that MI transporters are highly conserved across birds and that dietary MI reduces fat accumulation in Anna’s hummingbirds. MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection. Our findings underscore the importance of MI in avian metabolism, offering insights into their evolutionary adaptations in the context of insulin insensitivity.",

Here, we explore this question using a coupled climate model. We show that the existence of the North American continent is critical for the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet. The individual role of other continents outside Afro-Eurasia is found to be less important.",

Here, we confirm a fission event in one zokor species through multiple-omics and functional analyses. We traced this event to a mutation in a splicing enhancer of the DNA repair gene Aplf in the fission-bearing species, which caused exon skipping and produced a truncated protein that disrupted DNA repair. An intronic deletion in Dna2 , known to facilitate neo-telomere formation when knocked out, reduced gene activity. These variants collectively drove chromosomal fission in this zokor species. The newly formed chromosome became fixed due to carrying essential genes and strong selective pressure. While geographic isolation likely initiated the divergence of this species and the sister one, the fission event and associated decline at the chromosome level in gene flow probably exacerbated the speciation process.

Ca 2+ ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensify S. aureus virulence.

Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions.

In chordoma cells, T-DARPins reduced cell cycle progression, spheroid formation, and tumor growth in mice and induced signs of senescence and differentiation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate the potential of DARPins for probing nuclear proteins to understand the regulatory networks of transcription factor–driven cancers, including entry points for therapies that warrant testing in patients.",

A B. bronchiseptica mutant lacking b-Cool (Δ b-Cool ) showed significantly delayed and decreased colonization in mouse nasopharynx and nasal epithelia, resulting in decreased transmission.

Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification.

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy.",

Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii. Furthermore, through integrating image sensor with a readout matrix and wireless data collection component, the real-time imaging system is demonstrated with real-time focus-tunable imaging capabilities.",

Under opposing forces, kinetochores move bidirectionally along these walls while remaining near the ends, yet how continuous wall sliding occurs without end detachment remains unclear. Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior.",

          "abstract": "Sulfur and other volatiles could be transported from the martian interior to surface through magmatic processes, including mantle melting, magma differentiation, and degassing. However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H 2 S and S 2 , are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H 2 S and S 2 may form a hazy atmosphere with SF 6 , a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars.",

Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species ( Ammonia confertitesta ) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA). A. confertitesta was rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s. We hypothesize that increasing propagule pressure from the rapid increase in global ship traffic and ballast water was the main factor for its success.",

In the Drosophila circadian clock network, the small ventral lateral neurons (sLN v s) serve as critical pacemakers. Peptidergic communication mediated by the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), released by sLN v s, has been well characterized. In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLN v s form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLN v s form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep. Our results reveal that the main postsynaptic partners of key Drosophila pacemaker neurons are a nonclock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity.",

We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover.

Here, we present real-space observation of doping-tunable granular charge ordering using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in semiconducting single-layer Cr 2 Se 3 , a group VIB transition metal chalcogenide (TMC). Observations of lattice distortion, bandgap modulation at E F , and STM contrast inversion at low temperatures indicate a charge ordering origin. Cr 2 Se 3 ’s semiconducting nature enables charge ordering modulation through doping: Hole doping suppresses it, whereas electron doping alters the pattern, yielding a periodic 3√3 × 3√3 CDW phase.

We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth’s axis are intrinsically contained in the observations.

Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase.

Knockout of TaCEP15 or TaCEPRL increases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressing TaSnRK1 α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to the TaCEP15 promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in the TaCEP15 promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants with TabZIP9 knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance.

          "abstract": "The aberrant vasculature within the inflamed joint cavity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not only exacerbates joint pathology but also restricts the effective delivery of therapeutic drugs. Herein, we propose a strategy that involves the rapid and sustained vasculature repair alongside microenvironment-driven drug delivery to achieve multifaceted RA management. The transformable, self-assembling nanoplatform specifically accumulates in the inflamed joint cavity guided by a vascular targeting peptide (STP). Subsequently, STP detaches and undergoes shape transformation, forming nanofibers on the vascular endothelium, which serve as a rapid-acting physical barrier in the short term and facilitate sustained vascular normalization in the long term. Concurrently, the remaining nanoparticles undergo charge reversal and RGD exposure, enabling precise delivery of anti-RA agent triptolide and the immunomodulatory agent metformin. Collectively, this study provides a potent strategy for rapid, sustained, and precise spatiotemporal remodeling of RA using a simple yet intelligent self-assembling nanoplatform.",

          "abstract": "The transition from unicellular to multicellular life required the acquisition of coordinated and regulated cellular behaviors, including adhesion and migration. In metazoans, this involves adhesion proteins, signaling systems, and an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM) that contributes to adhesion and signaling interactions. Innovations that enabled complex multicellularity occurred through new genes in these pathways, novel functions for existing genes, and regulatory changes. Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) expanded with multicellularity. A single miRNA, miR-100, arose in the last common eumetazoan ancestor and is widely conserved across animals. We reveal the molecular function of its C. elegans homolog, the miR-51 family. This family acts in a dose-dependent manner to control morphogenesis by regulating several genes involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and migration, including ECM modifiers—specifically heparan sulfate sulfotransferases (HSTs). Some of these targets are also predicted to be conserved targets across vertebrates. Our work suggests that this miRNA provided an innovation in the regulation of cellular interactions early in metazoan evolution.",

          "abstract": "Stereotactic neurointervention is a common procedure for biopsy, injection, ablation, and implantation of electrodes for deep brain stimulation. Guided by preoperative imaging, conventional approaches are mostly performed manually, lacking operation stability and interactive feedback. The intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables both structural and functional assessment during operation, permitting interactive adaptation to tissue deformation and avoidance of critical anatomical regions. Here, we report an MRI-guided robotic system for stereotactic neurointervention. A macro-micro hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic actuated stereotactic robot with a large range of motion and high precision is developed. This is coupled with a compact bioinspired soft actuator for target intervention. A global-focal MRI sequence is proposed for interactive navigation, closed-loop control, and precise targeting. Validation is performed with phantom, cadaveric, and in vivo animal studies, showing positional accuracies of 0.39, 0.68, and 0.14 millimeters, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state of the art in robotic-assisted stereotactic neurointervention.",

          "abstract": "Year-to-year variance of agricultural productivity is an important determinant of food security. Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by 7   to   19 % ° C across crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming.",

          "abstract": "Turbulence-induced vibrations pose substantial risks to aircraft structural integrity and flight stability, particularly in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where real-time impact monitoring and lightweight protection are critical. Here, we present a bioinspired twist-hyperbolic metamaterial (THM) integrated with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for simultaneously impact buffering and self-powered sensing. The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources. This work establishes a transformative framework for lightweight, multifunctional protective systems with applications in aerospace, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is hallmarked by phenotypic transitions enabling abnormal cell proliferation and invasion. The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2. Together, we propose that HSF2 acts as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), people with HIV (PWH) experience persistent inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, increasing their risk for non-AIDS comorbidities. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizing Oscillibacter and reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels. THC-treated RMs maintained viral suppression despite reduced plasma ART levels, suggesting diminished ART-related toxicity. Our findings demonstrate phytocannabinoids to be a safe adjunct therapy alongside ART to mitigate chronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in PWH.",

          "abstract": "The Early Paleozoic radiation of diverse animal life is commonly connected to a well-ventilated global ocean. Yet the oxygenation history of Paleozoic deep oceans remains debated. Using thallium (Tl) isotope ratios in deep-marine mudrocks, we reconstruct the history of deep marine oxygenation from ~485 to 380 million years ago. Thallium isotopes can track bottom water oxygenation indirectly through their sensitivity to seafloor Mn oxide burial. We apply Tl isotopes to a global set of mudrocks, placing a particular focus on the Road River Group of Yukon, Canada. Our data reveal an oscillatory pattern in seawater Tl isotope ratios and, in turn, a dynamic ocean ventilation history. A long-lived deep ocean oxygenation episode is identified between ~405 and 386 million years ago. These short-term dynamics are superimposed on a muted positive ocean oxygenation trend over the entire Early and Middle Paleozoic. Sustained O 2 accumulation in global marine bottom waters occurred sometime after ~380 million years ago according to our dataset.",
