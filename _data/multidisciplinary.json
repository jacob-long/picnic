          "authors": "Gemma Dipoppa, Saad Gulzar",
          "abstract": "Air pollution in South Asia is a health emergency, responsible for 2 million deaths every year1. Crop residue burning accounts for 40–60% of peak pollution during the winter harvest months2,3. Despite being illegal, this practice remains widespread4,5. Any solution to curb the problem necessitates government action at scale. Here we study whether leveraging the incentives of bureaucrats tasked with controlling burning can mitigate this phenomenon. Using a decade of wind, fire and health data from satellites and surveys from the Demographic and Health Surveys Program, we show that crop burning responds to bureaucrat incentives: fires increase by 15% when wind is most likely to direct pollution to neighbouring jurisdictions, and decrease by 14.5% when it pollutes their own. These effects intensify with stronger bureaucratic incentives and capacity. We also find that bureaucrat action against burning deters future polluters, further reducing fires by 13%. Finally, using an atmospheric model, we estimate that one log increase in in utero exposure to pollution from burning raises child mortality by 30–36 deaths per 1,000 births, underscoring the importance of bureaucrat action. Contrary to the growing beliefs that the problem of crop burning is intractable6,7, these findings highlight specific ways in which existing bureaucrats, when properly incentivized, can improve environmental management and public health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Low soil moisture and high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) cause plant water stress and lead to a variety of drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration and photosynthesis 1,2 . When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress 3,4 . However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation–atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil.",

          "abstract": "Biobanks aim to improve our understanding of health and disease by collecting and analysing diverse biological and phenotypic information in large samples. So far, biobanks have largely pursued a population-based sampling strategy, where the individual is the unit of sampling, and familial relatedness occurs sporadically and by chance. This strategy has been remarkably efficient and successful, leading to thousands of scientific discoveries across multiple research domains, and plans for the next wave of biobanks are underway. In this Perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of a complementary sampling strategy for future biobanks based on oversampling of close genetic relatives. Such family-based samples facilitate research that clarifies causal relationships between putative risk factors and outcomes, particularly in estimates of genetic effects, because they enable analyses that reduce or eliminate confounding due to familial and demographic factors. Family-based biobank samples would also shed new light on fundamental questions across multiple fields that are often difficult to explore in population-based samples. Despite the potential for higher costs and greater analytical complexity, the many advantages of family-based samples should often outweigh their potential challenges.",

However, the effects of underlying genetic diseases, replication stress, and aging on hematopoietic reconstitution and lineage specification remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed hematopoietic reconstitution in 53 patients treated with lentiviral-HSC-GT for diverse conditions such as metachromatic leukodystrophy2,3 (MLD), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome4,5 (WAS), and β-thalassemia6 (β-Thal) over a follow-up period of up to 8 years, using vector integration sites as markers of clonal identity. We found that long-term hematopoietic reconstitution was supported by 770 to 35,000 active HSCs. While 50% of transplanted clones demonstrated multilineage potential across all conditions, the remaining clones exhibited a disease-specific preferential lineage output and long-term commitment: myeloid for MLD, lymphoid for WAS, and erythroid for β-Thal, particularly in adult patients. Our results indicate that HSC clonogenic activity, lineage output, long-term lineage commitment, and rates of somatic mutations are influenced by the underlying disease, patient age at the time of therapy, the extent of genetic defect correction, and the hematopoietic stress imposed by the inherited disease. This suggests that HSCs adapt to the pathological condition during hematopoietic reconstitution.",

However, writing large-scale data directly into DNA sequences by de novo synthesis remains uneconomical in time and cost4. We present an alternative, parallel strategy that enables the writing of arbitrary data on DNA using premade nucleic acids. Through self-assembly guided enzymatic methylation, epigenetic modifications, as information bits, can be introduced precisely onto universal DNA templates to enact molecular movable-type printing. By programming with a finite set of 700 DNA movable types and five templates, we achieved the synthesis-free writing of approximately 275,000 bits on an automated platform with 350 bits written per reaction. The data encoded in complex epigenetic patterns were retrieved high-throughput by nanopore sequencing, and algorithms were developed to finely resolve 240 modification patterns per sequencing reaction. With the epigenetic information bits framework, distributed and bespoke DNA storage was implemented by 60 volunteers lacking professional biolab experience. Our framework presents a new modality of DNA data storage that is parallel, programmable, stable and scalable. Such an unconventional modality opens up avenues towards practical data storage and dual-mode data functions in biomolecular systems.",

          "abstract": "The ability of stony corals to thrive in the oligotrophic (low-nutrient, low-productivity) surface waters of the tropical ocean is commonly attributed to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates 1,2 . The evolutionary history of this symbiosis might clarify its organismal and environmental roles 3 , but its prevalence through time, and across taxa, morphologies and oceanic settings, is currently unclear 4–6 . Here we report measurements of the nitrogen isotope ( 15 N/ 14 N) ratio of coral-bound organic matter (CB-δ 15 N) in samples from Mid-Devonian reefs (Givetian, around 385 million years ago), which represent a constraint on the evolution of coral photosymbiosis. Colonial tabulate and fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals have low CB-δ 15 N values (2.51 ± 0.97‰) in comparison with co-occurring solitary and (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals (5.52 ± 1.63‰). The average of the isotopic difference per deposit (3.01 ± 0.58‰) is statistically indistinguishable from that observed between modern symbiont-barren and symbiont-bearing corals (3.38 ± 1.05‰). On the basis of this evidence, we infer that Mid-Devonian tabulate and some fasciculate (dendroid) rugose corals hosted active photosymbionts, while solitary and some (pseudo)colonial (cerioid or phaceloid) rugose corals did not. The low CB-δ 15 N values of the Devonian tabulate and fasciculate rugose corals relative to the modern range suggest that Mid-Devonian reefs formed in biogeochemical regimes analogous to the modern oligotrophic subtropical gyres. Widespread oligotrophy during the Devonian may have promoted coral photosymbiosis, the occurrence of which may explain why Devonian reefs were the most productive reef ecosystems of the Phanerozoic.",

          "abstract": "Mounting effective immunity against pathogens and tumours relies on the successful metabolic programming of T cells by extracellular fatty acids1,2,3. Fatty-acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) has a key role in this process by coordinating the efficient import and trafficking of lipids that fuel mitochondrial respiration to sustain the bioenergetic requirements of protective CD8+ T cells4,5. However, the mechanisms that govern this immunometabolic axis remain unexplored. Here we report that the cytoskeletal organizer transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) is necessary for optimal fatty acid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and anticancer function in CD8+ T cells. TAGLN2 interacts with FABP5 to facilitate its cell surface localization and function in activated CD8+ T cells. Analyses of ovarian cancer specimens revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses induced by the tumour microenvironment repress TAGLN2 in infiltrating CD8+ T cells, thereby enforcing their dysfunctional state. Restoring TAGLN2 expression in ER-stressed CD8+ T cells increased their lipid uptake, mitochondrial respiration and cytotoxic capacity. Accordingly, chimeric antigen receptor T cells overexpressing TAGLN2 bypassed the detrimental effects of tumour-induced ER stress and demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in mice with metastatic ovarian cancer. Our study establishes the role of cytoskeletal TAGLN2 in T cell lipid metabolism and highlights the potential to enhance cellular immunotherapy in solid malignancies by preserving the TAGLN2–FABP5 axis.",

Selection for immunity to pathogens has driven the evolution of sophisticated immunity mechanisms throughout biology, including in bacterial defence against bacteriophages 3 . Here we characterize the widely distributed anti-phage defence system CmdTAC, which provides robust defence against infection by the T-even family of phages 4 . Our results support a model in which CmdC detects infection by sensing viral capsid proteins, ultimately leading to the activation of a toxic ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein, CmdT. We show that newly synthesized capsid protein triggers dissociation of the chaperone CmdC from the CmdTAC complex, leading to destabilization and degradation of the antitoxin CmdA, with consequent liberation of the CmdT ADP-ribosyltransferase. Notably, CmdT does not target a protein, DNA or structured RNA, the known targets of other ADP-ribosyltransferases. Instead, CmdT modifies the N6 position of adenine in GA dinucleotides within single-stranded RNAs, leading to arrest of mRNA translation and inhibition of viral replication. Our work reveals a novel mechanism of anti-viral defence and a previously unknown but broadly distributed class of ADP-ribosyltransferases that target mRNA.",

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterized by their high energy and short duration (from microseconds to milliseconds)1. The physical origin of these FRBs remains unknown and is a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates2,3. Previous studies have used various methodologies to address the problem of FRB origin, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments4,5,6, assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift7,8,9 and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts10. However, these studies are susceptible to substantial biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias probably leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated6. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is probably responsible for the observed bias11,12. However, a larger sample of localized FRBs is required to robustly quantify the contribution of scattering to the inclination-related selection bias.",

          "abstract": "The brain processes an array of stimuli, enabling the selection of appropriate behavioural responses, but the neural pathways linking interoceptive inputs to outputs for feeding are poorly understood 1–3 . Here we delineate a subcortical circuit in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) directly connect interoceptive inputs to motor centres, controlling food consumption and jaw movements. VMH BDNF neuron inhibition increases food intake by gating motor sequences of feeding through projections to premotor areas of the jaw. When food is unavailable, VMH BDNF inhibition elicits consummatory behaviours directed at inanimate objects such as wooden blocks, and inhibition of perimesencephalic trigeminal area (pMe5) projections evokes rhythmic jaw movements. The activity of these neurons is decreased during food consumption and increases when food is in proximity but not consumed. Activity is also increased in obese animals and after leptin treatment. VMH BDNF neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from both agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc), and constitutive VMH BDNF activation blocks the orexigenic effect of AgRP activation. These data indicate an Arc → VMH BDNF → pMe5 circuit that senses the energy state of an animal and regulates consummatory behaviours in a state-dependent manner.",

          "abstract": "Allergic diseases, affecting over a quarter of individuals in industrialized countries, have become significant public health concerns1,2. The high-affinity Fc receptor for IgE (FcεRI), mainly present on mast cells and basophils, plays a crucial role in allergic diseases3-5. Monomeric IgE binding to FcεRI regulates mast cell survival, differentiation, and maturation6-8. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that, prior to IgE binding, FcεRI mostly exists as a homo-dimer on human mast cell membrane. The structure of human FcεRI confirms the dimeric organization, with each promoter comprising one α subunit, one β subunit, and two γ subunits. The transmembrane helices of the α subunits form a layered arrangement with those of the γ and β subunits. The dimeric interface is mediated by a four-helix bundle of the α and γ subunits at the intracellular juxtamembrane region. Cholesterol-like molecules embedded within the transmembrane domain may stabilize the dimeric assembly. Upon IgE binding, the dimeric FcεRI dissociates into two protomers, each binding to an IgE molecule. Importantly, this process elicits transcriptional activation of Egr1/3 and Ccl2 in rat basophils, which can be attenuated by inhibiting the FcεRI dimer-to-monomer transition. Collectively, our study unveils the mechanism of antigen-independent, IgE-mediated FcεRI activation.",

SynthID-Text does not affect LLM training and modifies only the sampling procedure; watermark detection is computationally efficient, without using the underlying LLM. To enable watermarking at scale, we develop an algorithm integrating watermarking with speculative sampling, an efficiency technique frequently used in production systems 5 . Evaluations across multiple LLMs empirically show that SynthID-Text provides improved detectability over comparable methods, and standard benchmarks and human side-by-side ratings indicate no change in LLM capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of watermarking in large-scale-production systems, we conducted a live experiment that assessed feedback from nearly 20 million Gemini 6 responses, again confirming the preservation of text quality.

          "abstract": "Complex multicellularity has emerged independently across a few eukaryotic lineages and is often associated with the rise of elaborate, tightly coordinated developmental processes 1,2 . How multicellularity and development are interconnected in evolution is a major question in biology. The hourglass model of embryonic evolution depicts how developmental processes are conserved during evolution, and predicts morphological and molecular divergence in early and late embryogenesis, bridged by a conserved mid-embryonic (phylotypic) period linked to the formation of the basic body plan 3,4 . Initially found in animal embryos 5–8 , molecular hourglass patterns have recently been proposed for land plants and fungi 9,10 . However, whether the hourglass pattern is an intrinsic feature of all complex multicellular eukaryotes remains unknown. Here we tested the presence of a molecular hourglass in the brown algae, a eukaryotic lineage that has evolved multicellularity independently from animals, fungi and plants 1,11,12 . By exploring transcriptome evolution patterns of brown algae with distinct morphological complexities, we uncovered an hourglass pattern during embryogenesis in morphologically complex species. Filamentous algae without canonical embryogenesis display transcriptome conservation in multicellular stages of the life cycle, whereas unicellular stages are more rapidly evolving. Our findings suggest that transcriptome conservation in brown algae is associated with cell differentiation stages, but is not necessarily linked to embryogenesis. Together with previous work in animals, plants and fungi, we provide further evidence for the generality of a developmental hourglass pattern across complex multicellular eukaryotes.",

More than 300 structures were designed and 13 were characterized, showcasing the ability to complex polyhalides in homogeneous aqueous solution, to deter cation-exchange membrane crossover and to alter the electrochemical electrode mechanism. In flow battery cycling at a standard catholyte SoC of 66.6 per cent (stoichiometrically X3–), an average coulombic efficiency of more than 99.9 per cent at 40 milliamperes per square centimetre with no apparent decay was observed after more than 1,000 cycles over 2 months, with stability at elevated temperatures also demonstrated. Interestingly, SH-ZITs enable homogeneous cycling of the halide catholyte up to 90 per cent SoC at 2 moles per litre (47.7 ampere-hours per litre) for bromide, revealing previously unknown polyhalide regimes to be studied. Ultimately, SH-ZIT enables ultrahigh catholyte capacity utilization up to over 120 ampere-hours per litre at 80 per cent SoC with homogeneous cycling as well as the ability to pair with a zinc anode in a hybrid flow battery.",

          "abstract": "The T cell response to cancer controls disease progression and response to immunotherapy1,2,3. Despite extensive knowledge regarding CD8 T cells, how CD4 T cells contribute to this process is less well understood. Here we identified a population of PD1+TCF1+ CD4 T cells with stem-like properties that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into canonical CD4 effector cells. Primarily residing in tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), these tumour-specific CD4 T cells are restricted by T regulatory (Treg) cells to a stem-like fate that predominantly generated induced Treg (iTreg) cells, limiting effector CD8 T cell responses to the tumour. By contrast, upon Treg depletion, stem-like CD4 T cells differentiated into T helper 1 (TH1) cells, and via IFNγ production induced robust effector differentiation from TCF1+ CD8 T cells in TDLNs, a state we defined as ‘active’. Notably, enforcing TBET expression in transferred stem-like CD4 T cells was sufficient to overcome the established restricted T cell state. Despite the presence of Treg cells, endogenous stem-like CD4 T cells actively generated TH1 cells, which were required to restore TDLN effector CD8 T cell differentiation, enhance tumour control and rescue response to immunotherapy. In agreement, TH1 differentiation in patients with kidney cancer predicted successful immunotherapy responses and improved progression-free survival. Together, these findings identify a stem-like CD4 T cell population that through alternative differentiation fates controls the switch between restricted and active T cell states with implications for cancer immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Evidence suggests that, when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ‘natal kick’, during which the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial1,2, yet is limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks3,4,5. Here we report that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3,500 astronomical units (au) away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole probably received a sub-5 km s−1 kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery lends support to the idea that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of LMXBs involving a hierarchical triple structure6. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3–5 billion years ago and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is required that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.",

Here we use the tunicate, Ciona, to explore the evolutionary origins of neural crest since this invertebrate chordate is among the closest living relatives of vertebrates2,3,4. Previous studies identified two potential neural crest cell types in Ciona, sensory pigment cells and bipolar tail neurons5,6. Recent findings suggest that bipolar tail neurons are homologous to cranial sensory ganglia rather than derivatives of neural crest7,8. Here we show that the pigment cell lineage also produces neural progenitor cells that form regions of the juvenile nervous system following metamorphosis. Neural progenitors are also a major derivative of neural crest in vertebrates, suggesting that the last common ancestor of tunicates and vertebrates contained a multipotent progenitor population at the neural plate border. It would therefore appear that a key property of neural crest, multipotentiality, preceded the emergence of vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Regulated start-codon selection has the potential to reshape the proteome through the differential production of upstream open reading frames, canonical proteins, and alternative translational isoforms1,2,3. However, conditions under which start codon selection is altered remain poorly defined. Here, using transcriptome-wide translation-initiation-site profiling4, we reveal a global increase in the stringency of start-codon selection during mammalian mitosis. Low-efficiency initiation sites are preferentially repressed in mitosis, resulting in pervasive changes in the translation of thousands of start sites and their corresponding protein products. This enhanced stringency of start-codon selection during mitosis results from increased association between the 40S ribosome and the key regulator of start-codon selection, eIF1. We find that increased eIF1–40S ribosome interaction during mitosis is mediated by the release of a nuclear pool of eIF1 upon nuclear envelope breakdown. Selectively depleting the nuclear pool of eIF1 eliminates the change to translational stringency during mitosis, resulting in altered synthesis of thousands of protein isoforms. In addition, preventing mitotic translational rewiring results in substantially increased cell death and decreased mitotic slippage in cells that experience a mitotic delay induced by anti-mitotic chemotherapies. Thus, cells globally control stringency of translation initiation, which has critical roles during the mammalian cell cycle in preserving mitotic cell physiology.",

          "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and tissue fibrosis are common responses that worsen organ function, yet the molecular mechanisms governing their cross-talk are poorly understood. In diseased organs, stress-induced gene expression changes fuel maladaptive cell state transitions1 and pathological interaction between cellular compartments. Although chronic fibroblast activation worsens dysfunction in the lungs, liver, kidneys and heart, and exacerbates many cancers2, the stress-sensing mechanisms initiating transcriptional activation of fibroblasts are poorly understood. Here we show that conditional deletion of the transcriptional co-activator Brd4 in infiltrating Cx3cr1+ macrophages ameliorates heart failure in mice and significantly reduces fibroblast activation. Analysis of single-cell chromatin accessibility and BRD4 occupancy in vivo in Cx3cr1+ cells identified a large enhancer proximal to interleukin-1β (IL-1β, encoded by Il1b), and a series of CRISPR-based deletions revealed the precise stress-dependent regulatory element that controls Il1b expression. Secreted IL-1β activated a fibroblast RELA-dependent (also known as p65) enhancer near the transcription factor MEOX1, resulting in a profibrotic response in human cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, antibody-mediated IL-1β neutralization improved cardiac function and tissue fibrosis in heart failure. Systemic IL-1β inhibition or targeted Il1b deletion in Cx3cr1+ cells prevented stress-induced Meox1 expression and fibroblast activation. The elucidation of BRD4-dependent cross-talk between a specific immune cell subset and fibroblasts through IL-1β reveals how inflammation drives profibrotic cell states and supports strategies that modulate this process in heart disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders featuring tissue remodelling.",

Here we present a platform to engineer and validate synthetic CREs capable of driving gene expression with programmed cell-type specificity. We take advantage of innovations in deep neural network modelling of CRE activity across three cell types, efficient in silico optimization and massively parallel reporter assays to design and empirically test thousands of CREs 4–8 . Through large-scale in vitro validation, we show that synthetic sequences are more effective at driving cell-type-specific expression in three cell lines compared with natural sequences from the human genome and achieve specificity in analogous tissues when tested in vivo. Synthetic sequences exhibit distinct motif vocabulary associated with activity in the on-target cell type and a simultaneous reduction in the activity of off-target cells.

Here we performed multiomic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 healthy donor, acutely infarcted and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory that diverged into distinct populations reminiscent of myofibroblasts and matrifibrocytes, the latter expressing fibroblast activator protein (FAP) and periostin (POSTN). Genetic lineage tracing of FAP+ fibroblasts in vivo showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model cardiac fibroblasts and demonstrated that three different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared with cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand–receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signalling drove the emergence of FAP/POSTN fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts and the IL-1β ligand in CCR2+ monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signalling using a monoclonal antibody, and showed reduced FAP/POSTN fibroblasts, diminished myocardial fibrosis and improved cardiac function.

Daptomycin is a last-resort antibiotic for VREfm infections with a novel mode of action2, but for which resistance has been widely reported but is unexplained. Here we show that rifaximin, an unrelated antibiotic used prophylactically to prevent hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver disease3, causes cross-resistance to daptomycin in VREfm. Amino acid changes arising within the bacterial RNA polymerase in response to rifaximin exposure cause upregulation of a previously uncharacterized operon (prdRAB) that leads to cell membrane remodelling and cross-resistance to daptomycin through reduced binding of the antibiotic. VREfm with these mutations are spread globally, making this a major mechanism of resistance. Rifaximin has been considered ‘low risk’ for the development of antibiotic resistance. Our study shows that this assumption is flawed and that widespread rifaximin use, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, may be compromising the clinical use of daptomycin, a major last-resort intervention for multidrug-resistant pathogens. These findings demonstrate how unanticipated antibiotic cross-resistance can undermine global strategies designed to preserve the clinical use of critical antibiotics.",

More recently, uncrewed aerial vehicle/drone lidar scanning has markedly improved the resolution of three-dimensional point clouds, allowing for the detection of slight traces of structural features at centimetres of detail across large archaeological sites, a method particularly useful in areas such as mountains, where rapid deposition and erosion irregularly bury and expose archaeological remains3. Here we present the results of uncrewed aerial vehicle–lidar surveys in Central Asia, conducted at two recently discovered archaeological sites in southeastern Uzbekistan: Tashbulak and Tugunbulak. Situated at around 2,000–2,200 m above sea level, these sites illustrate a newly documented geography of large, high-altitude urban centres positioned along the mountainous crossroads of Asia’s medieval Silk Routes (6th–11th century CE (Common Era)4,5. Although hidden by centuries of surface processes, our pairing of very-high-resolution surface modelling with semiautomated feature detection produces a detailed plan of monumental fortifications and architecture spanning 120 ha at Tugunbulak, thereby demonstrating one of the largest highland urban constellations in premodern Central Asia. Documentation of extensive urban infrastructure and technological production among medieval communities in Central Asia’s mountains—a crucial nexus for Silk Road trade networks6—provides a new perspective on the participation of highland populations in the economic, political and social formation of medieval Eurasia.",

This is especially severe in the winter months, when the air quality index (AQI) reaches hazardous levels (above 300 on a scale of 0–500; anything above 150 is considered unhealthy) and occasionally levels that far surpass the top of the scale (see airquality.cpcb.gov.in/AQI_India and iqair.com/pakistan). At a time when the effects of human activities on the environment and their global implications for well-being present challenges, a study in Nature by Dipoppa and Gulzar1 sheds light on the potential for bureaucratic incentives to address sources of air pollution from crop-residue burning at the local level.",

This form of multicellularity arose independently from that found in plants and in animals. These three manifestations of multicellular life are not necessarily expected to have much in common, but if they do, the commonalities are likely to point to key underlying principles. Lotharukpong et al. report that brown algae — which include species such as Fucus serratus, Fucus distichus and those belonging to the genus Ectocarpus — show a pattern of gene expression described as an hourglass (for its egg-timer shape) during their development, resembling the one previously found in animals and in plants.",

High-altitude urban sites are extraordinarily rare in the archaeological record because of a unique set of landscape challenges and technological demands that must be overcome for people to form large communities in mountainous areas. For much of human history, areas of dense population have mainly formed in low-lying areas that are usually along rivers or coasts. Writing in Nature, Frachetti et al.1 help to re-evaluate our understanding of upland urbanization by using drones for an aerial technique called lidar to assess signs of human-generated structures in a mountainous region. This work was conducted at a site in Uzbekistan, right at the heart of the medieval network of trade and exchange known as the Silk Roads and it is the first archaeological lidar survey conducted in Central Asia.",

The instructions for activating or repressing a gene are encoded in the genome, and each type of cell has its own genomic ‘language’ that is based on highly complex patterns of nucleotides that describe whether a gene will be expressed. Writing in Nature, Gosai et al.1 apply artificial intelligence (AI) methods to learn the ‘regulatory grammar’ of that language — that is, the patterns of nucleotides in the genome that relate to gene-regulatory activity — for different cell types. The authors then apply those models, along with experimental genomics techniques, to create synthetic DNA sequences that can drive gene expression in specific cell types, which has implications for targeted cell and gene therapy.",

Here the authors examine the integration of GenAI as a tool for human learning, addressing its promises and challenges from a holistic viewpoint that integrates insights from learning sciences, educational technology and human–computer interaction. GenAI promises to enhance learning experiences by scaling personalized support, diversifying learning materials, enabling timely feedback and innovating assessment methods. However, it also presents critical issues such as model imperfections, ethical dilemmas and the disruption of traditional assessments. Thus, cultivating AI literacy and adaptive skills is imperative for facilitating informed engagement with GenAI technologies. Rigorous research across learning contexts is essential to evaluate GenAI’s effect on human cognition, metacognition and creativity. Humanity must learn with and about GenAI, ensuring that it becomes a powerful ally in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, rather than a crutch that undermines our intellectual abilities.",

Thanks to improved virtual communication systems, people can now work with fewer limitations imposed by location, time and language.

We tested 21 honesty oaths (including a baseline oath)—proposed, evaluated and selected by 44 expert researchers—and a no-oath condition in a megastudy involving 21,506 UK and US participants from Prolific.com who played an incentivized tax evasion game online. Of the 21 interventions, 10 significantly improved tax compliance by 4.5 to 8.5 percentage points, with the most successful nearly halving tax evasion. Limited evidence for moderators was found. Experts and laypeople failed to predict the most effective interventions, though experts’ predictions were more accurate.

Under this paradigm, we review recent research and identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion and collective decision-making, with context-rich examples from high-frequency trading markets, a social media platform, an open collaboration community and a discussion forum. To ensure more robust and resilient human–machine communities, we require a new sociology of humans and machines.

          "abstract": "Public concerns about the societal effects of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are shaped by narratives that have the potential to influence research priorities and policy agendas. Understanding the origins and dynamics of these narratives is crucial to effectively address the actual impacts of AI and ensure a constructive discourse about its risks and potential.\n\nThis shift in media coverage points to the need for a closer examination of the underlying discourse. We currently see four main types of narratives around generative AI:\n\n(1)\n\nThe ‘existential risk’ narrative contends that existential risks from artificial superintelligence or artificial general intelligence could stem from the next generations of generative AI-type systems. As generative AI systems become more sophisticated, their capabilities could surpass human control and lead to potentially existentially catastrophic consequences. Strong versions of this narrative raise the concern that artificial superintelligence or artificial general intelligence technologies could lead to human extinction3.\n\n(2)\n\nThe ‘effective accelerationist’ narrative champions the rapid development of AI. Proponents argue that its potential benefits for solving complex global problems far outweigh the risks, and the existential risks from advanced AI are zero or near zero and so can be dismissed4. This narrative is driven by a strong belief in the power of AI progress to bring about substantial positive change.\n\n(3)\n\nThe ‘real, immediate societal risks’ narrative focuses only on the tangible, immediate societal risks of generative AI. It emphasizes issues such as the creation of deepfake pornography, unjust capability distribution or the growing environmental effects of generative AI, and argues that these present-day concerns are much more pressing and relevant than speculative existential risks. Proponents of this view argue that focusing on distant existential threats distracts us from addressing the real and present dangers of AI5.\n\n(4)\n\nThe ‘balanced risks’ narrative advocates for an approach to AI risk governance that acknowledges both the existential and immediate societal risks posed by AI. It encourages finding meaningful connections between these two classes of risks, and suggests that addressing them in tandem can lead to more comprehensive and effective risk mitigation strategies and policies6.",

We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and artificial intelligence thought partners can engage, and we propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.",

          "abstract": "Nuanced portrayals of stigmatized groups in media have been shown to reduce prejudice. In an online experiment (N = 749), we tested whether a feature film depicting incarcerated peoples’ experiences in the criminal justice system can increase a) empathic accuracy and compassion toward people who have been incarcerated and b) support for criminal justice reform. We measured baseline empathic accuracy via a well-validated task, where participants infer the emotions of people sharing stories about difficult life events. All storytellers were formerly incarcerated and students. However, in half the videos we labeled them as “formerly incarcerated” and in the remaining half as “college student.” We then surveyed people’s baseline attitudes toward criminal justice reform. Next, we assigned participants to watch one of three films. The intervention film chronicled the true stories of Black men on death row. Two docudramas of similar length served as control films. Finally, participants completed the empathic accuracy task and survey again and were given the opportunity to sign a petition. Compared to those who watched a control film, participants who watched the intervention film more accurately inferred the emotions of storytellers labeled “formerly incarcerated,” and increased their support for criminal justice reform. These effects held for conservative and liberal participants alike. However, the film had no effect on feelings of compassion. Together, these results demonstrate the power of narrative interventions to not only increase empathic accuracy for members of a severely stigmatized group, but to increase support for reforms designed to improve their lives.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between sociopolitical organization and violence remains an enduring question in anthropological research. Less studied is the articulation of gender with violence in societies of different sociopolitical organization. We investigate the frequency and type of violence experienced by adult males and females in pre-Hispanic Andean archaeological contexts, comparing exposure to antemortem (nonlethal) and perimortem (potentially lethal) violence across three categories of sociopolitical organization: autonomous communities, regional cultural formations, and states. Using a database of 8,607 adults from 169 publications and over 155 sites, we construct a multinomial logistic regression using Bayesian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to fit our model. The odds of antemortem and perimortem trauma were low for both sexes. However, the odds of antemortem trauma were consistently higher for males than females in all categories of sociopolitical organization, suggesting that men were more frequently exposed to violence. Males display similar odds of cranial trauma across all forms of sociopolitical organization, while females display slightly reduced odds of cranial trauma in states compared to autonomous communities. Perimortem trauma is especially strongly patterned by sex. In autonomous communities, the odds of potentially lethal cranial trauma are equivalent between the sexes; in states, they are consistent for males, but depressed for females. In the pre-Hispanic Andes, living in states dramatically reduced the chances of encountering lethal violence for females, but not males. Our study complicates the notion that increasing sociopolitical complexity leads to decreasing interpersonal violence and highlights the importance of gender in understanding the human history of violence.",

          "abstract": "Reducing hostility in social media interactions is a key public concern. Most extant research emphasizes how online contextual factors breed hostility. Here, we take a different perspective and focus on the offline roots of hostility, that is, offline experiences and stable individual-level dispositions. Using a unique dataset of Danish Twitter users (N = 4,931), we merge data from administrative government registries with a behavioral measure of online hostility. We demonstrate that individuals with more aggressive dispositions (as proxied by having many more criminal verdicts) are more hostile in social media conversations. We also find evidence that features of childhood environments predict online hostility. Time spent in foster care is a strong correlate, while other indicators of childhood instability (e.g., the number of moves and divorced parents) are not. Furthermore, people from more resourceful childhood environments—those with better grades in primary school and higher parental socioeconomic status—are more hostile on average, as such people are more politically engaged. These results offer an important reminder that much online hostility is rooted in offline experiences and stable dispositions. They also provide anuanced view of the core group of online aggressors. While these individuals display general antisocial personality tendencies by having many more criminal verdicts, they also come from resourceful backgrounds more often than not.",

Two trimeric transmembrane proteins, Alanine, Serine, Cysteine Transporters 1 and 2 (ASCT1 and ASCT2), were suggested and widely accepted as Syncytin-1 cellular receptors. To quantitatively assess the individual contributions of human ASCT1 and ASCT2 to the fusogenic activity of Syncytin-1, we developed a model system where the ASCT1 and ASCT2 double knockout was rescued by ectopic expression of either ASCT1 or ASCT2. We demonstrated that ASCT2 was required for Syncytin-1 binding, cellular entry, and cell-to-cell fusion, while ASCT1 was not involved in this receptor interaction. We experimentally validated the ASCT1–ASCT2 heterotrimers as a possible explanation for the previous misidentification of ASCT1 as a receptor for Syncytin-1. This redefinition of receptor specificity is important for proper understanding of Syncytin-1 function in normal and pathological pregnancy.",

However, there is no comprehensive pan-Arctic overview of industrial and urban development, which is crucial for the planning of sustainable development of the region. In this study, we utilize satellite-derived artificial light at night (ALAN) data to quantify the hotspots and the development of light-emitting human activity across the Arctic from 1992 to 2013. We find that out of 16.4 million km 2 analyzed a total area of 839,710 km 2 (5.14%) is lit by human activity with an annual increase of 4.8%. The European Arctic and the oil and gas extraction regions in Russia and Alaska are hotspots of ALAN with up to a third of the land area lit, while the Canadian Arctic remains dark to a large extent. On average, only 15% of lit area in the Arctic contains human settlement, indicating that artificial light is largely attributable to industrial human activity. With this study, we provide a standardized approach to spatially assess human industrial activity across the Arctic, independent from economic data. Our results provide a crucial baseline for sustainable development and conservation planning across the highly vulnerable Arctic region.",

While targeting the UPS for HCC therapy has been proposed, identifying effective targets has been challenging. In this study, we conducted a focused screen of siRNA libraries targeting UPS-related WD40 repeat (WDR) proteins and found that silencing WDR20, a deubiquitinating enzyme activating factor, selectively inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells without affecting normal hepatocytes. Moreover, the downregulation of WDR20 expression induced HCC cellular senescence and suppressed tumor progression in xenograft, sleeping beauty transposon/transposase, and hydrodynamic tail vein injection-induced HCC models, and Alb-Cre + / MYC + HCC transgenic mouse models. Mechanistically, we found that WDR20 silencing disturbed the protein stability of c-Myc, orchestrating the simultaneous USP12/46-mediated deubiquitination of c-Myc, thereby promoting the transcriptional activation of CDKN1A . Further investigation revealed a positive coexpression of WDR20 and c-Myc in a tissue microarray with 88 HCC clinical samples. By employing three patient-derived organoids from individuals with HCC, we have validated the decrease in c-Myc expression and the significant induction of senescence and growth inhibition following silencing of WDR20. This study not only uncovers the biological function of WDR20 and elucidates the molecular mechanism underlying its negative regulation of HCC cellular senescence but also highlight the potential of WDR20 as a promising target for HCC therapy.",

In this study, we uncover a function of eIF4F in the negative regulation of the rat sarcoma (RAS)/rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. We demonstrate that eIF4F is essential for controlling ERK signaling intensity in treatment-naïve melanoma cells harboring BRAF or NRAS mutations. Specifically, the dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP6/MKP3, which acts as a negative feedback regulator of ERK activity, requires continuous production in an eIF4F-dependent manner to limit excessive ERK signaling driven by oncogenic RAF/RAS mutations. Treatment with small-molecule eIF4F inhibitors disrupts the negative feedback control of MAPK signaling, leading to ERK hyperactivation and EGR1 overexpression in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our quantitative analyses reveal a high spare signaling capacity in the ERK pathway, suggesting that eIF4F-dependent feedback keeps the majority of ERK molecules inactive under normal conditions. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of eIF4F in regulating ERK signaling flux and suggest that pharmacological eIF4F inhibitors can disrupt the negative feedback control of MAPK activity in melanomas with BRAF and NRAS activating mutations.",

As hubs where diverse immune cells converge and interact, the alterations in the immune microenvironment within lymph nodes (LNs) are intricately linked to immune responses. Herein, we designed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) loaded with circular RNA (circRNA) and targeted to LNs, in which CXCL13 was directly integrated into antigen-encoding circRNA strands. We demonstrated that CXCL13 alters the transcriptomic profiles of LNs, especially the upregulation of IL-21 and IL-4. Meanwhile, CXCL13 promotes the formation of germinal center and elicits robust antigen-specific T cell responses. With the codelivery of CXCL13 and the antigen, CXCL13 enhances cross-reactive antibodies against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, achieving protection against both homologous and heterologous influenza virus challenges in a mouse model. Notably, the targeted modification of LNP surfaces with antibodies helps address some of the challenges associated with lyophilized LNP vaccines, which is crucial for the long-term storage of LNP-circRNA vaccines. Overall, the circRNA-based antigen-CXCL13 coexpression system developed herein provides a simple and robust platform that enhances the magnitude and breadth of antibody responses against multiple viral glycoproteins, highlighting the potential utility of CXCL13 in inducing broad immune responses.",

Typically, the analysis assumes that the relaxation rate of a pure bending deformation is determined by the competition between membrane bending rigidity and viscous dissipation in the surrounding medium. Here, we reexamine this assumption and demonstrate that viscous flows within the membrane dominate the dynamics of bending fluctuations of nonplanar membranes with a radius of curvature smaller than the Saffman–Delbrück length. Using flickering spectroscopy of giant vesicles made of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC:cholesterol mixtures and pure diblock-copolymer membranes, we experimentally detect the signature of membrane dissipation in curvature fluctuations. We show that membrane viscosity can be reliably obtained from the short time behavior of the shape time correlations. The results indicate that the DPPC:cholesterol membranes behave as a Newtonian fluid, while the polymer membranes exhibit more complex rheology.

Due to its gating by extracellular Zn 2+ , ZAC has been considered a Zn 2+ sensor, but it has undergone minimal structural and functional characterization since its molecular cloning. Among the families in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily, only the structure of ZAC has yet to be determined. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of ZAC in the apo state and performed structure-based mutation analyses. We identified a few residues in the extracellular domain whose mutations had a mild impact on Zn 2+ sensitivity. The constriction site in the ion-conducting pore differs from the one in other Cys-loop receptor structures, and further mutational analysis identified a key residue that is important for ion selectivity.

          "abstract": "Aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion are two key hallmarks of cancer. However, how these two features are mechanistically linked to promote tumor growth is not well understood. Here, we show that the glycolytic enzyme enolase-1 (ENO1) is dynamically modified with an O -linked β- N -acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation), and simultaneously regulates aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion via differential glycosylation. Glycosylation of threonine 19 (T19) on ENO1 promotes its glycolytic activity via the formation of active dimers. On the other hand, glycosylation of serine 249 (S249) on ENO1 inhibits its interaction with PD-L1, decreases association of PD-L1 with the E3 ligase STUB1, resulting in stabilization of PD-L1. Consequently, blockade of T19 glycosylation on ENO1 inhibits glycolysis, and decreases cell proliferation and tumor growth. Blockade of S249 glycosylation on ENO1 reduces PD-L1 expression and enhances T cell–mediated immunity against tumor cells. Notably, elimination of glycosylation at both sites synergizes with PD-L1 monoclonal antibody therapy to promote antitumor immune response. Clinically, ENO1 glycosylation levels are up-regulated and show a positive correlation with PD-L1 levels in human colorectal cancers. Thus, our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how O-GlcNAcylation bridges aerobic glycolysis and immune evasion to promote tumor growth, suggesting effective therapeutic opportunities.",

          "abstract": "Subduction zones play a pivotal role in the mechanics of plate tectonics by providing the driving force through slab pull and weak megathrusts that facilitate the relative motion between tectonic plates. The initiation of subduction zones is intricately linked to the accumulation of slab pull and development of weakness at plate boundaries and, by consequence, the largest changes in the energetics of mantle convection. However, the transient nature of subduction initiation accompanied by intense subsequent tectonic activity, leaves critical evidence poorly preserved and making subduction initiation difficult to constrain. We overcome these limitations through a comprehensive analysis focused on Puysegur, a well-constrained extant example of subduction initiation offshore South Island, New Zealand. Through time-dependent, three-dimensional thermo-mechanical computations and quantitative comparison to new geophysical and geological observations, including topography, stratigraphy, and seismicity, we demonstrate that subduction initiation develops with a fast strain weakening described with a small characteristic displacement ( Δ s ≈ 4 to 8 km). Potential physical mechanisms contributing to the strain weakening are explored and we find that the observed fast weakening may arise through a combination of grain-size reduction within the lower lithosphere and fluid pressurization at shallower depths. With the shared commonality in the underlying physics of tectonic processes, the rapid strain weakening constrained at Puysegur offers insights into the formation of the first subduction during early Earth and the onset of plate tectonics.",

          "abstract": "Ecological change in the Brazilian Amazon is closely linked to human mobility and health. Mining, agriculture, logging, and other activities alter highly diverse ecological and demographic contexts and subsequent exposure to diseases such as malaria. Studies that have attempted to quantify the impact of deforestation on malaria in the Brazilian Amazon have produced conflicting results. However, they varied in methodology and data sources. Most importantly, all studies used annual data, neglecting the subannual seasonal dynamics of malaria. Here, we fill the knowledge gap on the subannual relationship between ecological change in the Brazilian Amazon and malaria transmission. Using the highest spatiotemporal resolution available, we estimated the effect of deforestation on malaria cases between 2003 and 2022 using a stratified Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchical zero-inflated Poisson model fitted with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation. The model was also stratified by state. We found that a 1% increase in 1-mo lagged deforestation increased malaria cases in a given month and municipality by 6.3% [95% credible interval (Crl): 6.2, 6.5%]. Based on an interaction term included in the model, the effect of deforestation on malaria was even larger in areas with higher forest cover. We found that the coefficients for deforestation and mobility were highly variable when stratified by state. Our results provide detailed evidence that, on average, deforestation increases malaria transmission, but that the relationship is not spatiotemporally uniform. These results have implications for stratifying malaria control interventions based on ecological dynamics to help Brazil achieve its goal of malaria elimination by 2035.",

Despite global declines in both terrestrial insects and plants, the relationship between these trends remains elusive. Here, we address this gap by analyzing the relationship between population trends of insects and their host plants in Germany, encompassing over 150,000 interactions among 3,429 plant and 2,239 insect species, including both pollinators (bees and hoverflies) and herbivores (butterflies, moths, and sawflies). Our findings reveal parallel population declines of insects and host plants across taxa, except for more generalist hoverflies. However, simulated extinctions of threatened host plants led to limited coextinctions in insects. Notably, 96% of insect species retained over 25% of their host plant diversity, and among those, 98% still retained at least one common species in their interaction portfolio. Even highly specialized insects may persist because they tend to specialize in nonthreatened plant species. While uncertainties remain regarding the interchangeability of host plants, our findings suggest that insect coextinctions are far from a 1:1 match with plant extinctions. Our findings suggest the declining abundance of many plant species can contribute to insect decline yet challenge the common assumption that the extinction of threatened plant species will necessarily trigger an imminent extinction wave of associated insects.

However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions that inevitably limit their scope. Here, we propose a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We introduce the concept of landscape-mediated fitness, quantifying how fit a species is in a given environment in terms of colonization and extinction. We show that, when all environments are equivalent, one species excludes all the others—except the marginal case where species fitnesses are in exact trade-off. However, we prove that stable coexistence becomes possible in sufficiently heterogeneous environments by introducing spatial disorder in the model and solving it exactly in the mean-field limit. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. We show that our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence by buffering competition. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated heterogeneity promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.",

          "abstract": "Complement activation through antibody–antigen complexes is crucial in various pathophysiological processes and utilized in immunotherapies to eliminate infectious agents, regulatory immune cells, or cancer cells. The tertiary structures of the four IgG antibody subclasses are largely comparable, with the most prominent difference being the hinge regions connecting the Fab and Fc domains, providing them with unique structural flexibility. Complement recruitment and activation depend strongly on IgG subclass, which is commonly rationalized by differences in hinge flexibility and the respective affinities for C1, the first component of the classical complement pathway. However, a unifying mechanism of how these different IgG subclass properties combine to modulate C1 activation has not yet been proposed. We here demonstrate that complement activation is determined by their varying ability to form IgG oligomers on antigenic surfaces large enough to multivalently bind and activate C1. We directly visualize the resulting IgG oligomer structures and characterize their distribution by means of high-speed atomic force microscopy, quantify their complement recruitment efficiency from quartz crystal microbalance experiments, and characterize their ability to activate complement on tumor cell lines as well as in vesicle-based complement lysis assays. We present a mechanistic model of the multivalent interactions that govern C1 binding to IgG oligomers and use it to extract kinetic rate constants from real-time interaction data from which we further calculate equilibrium dissociation constants. Together, we provide a comprehensive view on the parameters that govern complement activation by the different IgG subclasses, which may inform the design of future antibody therapies.",

          "abstract": "Abscission is the programmed separation of plant organs. It is widespread in the plant kingdom with important functions in development and environmental response. In Arabidopsis, abscission of floral organs (sepals, petals, and stamens) is controlled by two receptor-like protein kinases HAESA (HAE) and HAESA LIKE-2 (HSL2), which orchestrate the programmed dissolution of the abscission zone connecting floral organs to the developing fruit. In this work, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the core HAE/HSL2 abscission gene expression program. We identify the MAP KINASE PHOSPHATASE-1/MKP1 gene as a negative regulator of this pathway. MKP1 acts prior to activation of HAE/HSL2 signaling to establish a signaling threshold required for the initiation of abscission. Furthermore, we use single-cell data to identify genes expressed in two subpopulations of abscission zone cells: those proximal and those distal to the plane of separation. We identify INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION/IDA family genes, encoding activating ligands of HAE/HSL2, as enriched in distal abscission zone cells at the base of the abscising organs. We show how this expression pattern forms a biophysical circuit breaker whereby, when the organ is shed, the source of the IDA peptides is removed, leading to cessation of HAE/HSL2 signaling. Overall, this work provides insight into the multiple control mechanisms acting on the abscission-signaling pathway.",

Under rapid environmental changes, it is important to understand the current and future trajectories of the CO 2 budget in high-latitude ecosystems. In this study, we present the importance of anomalous wet conditions and rising [CO 2 ] on the long-term CO 2 budget based on two decades (2003–2022) of quasicontinuous measurements of CO 2 flux at a poorly drained black spruce forest on permafrost peat in interior Alaska. The long-term CO 2 budget for the black spruce forest was a small sink of −53 ± 63 g C m −2 y −1 . The CO 2 sink increased from 49 g C m −2 y −1 for the first decade to 58 g C m −2 y −1 for the second decade. The increased CO 2 sink was attributed to an 11.3% increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) among which 9% increase in GPP was explained by a recent increase in precipitation. Furthermore, a 3% increase in GPP in response to a 37-ppm increase in [CO 2 ] was estimated from the data-model fusion. Our study shows that understanding the coupling between hydrological and carbon cycles and the CO 2 fertilization effect is important for understanding the current and future carbon budgets of high-latitude ecosystems in permafrost regions.",

Here, we present a macroecological study investigating how plant invaders and their root traits affect soil microbial communities, spanning data from 377 unique plots across the United States sampled multiple times, totaling 632 sampling events and 94 invasive plant species. We found that native and invasive plants harbor different root traits on average, with invasive plants possessing higher specific root lengths and native plants having higher root tissue density. We also show that soil microbial communities experiencing heavy plant invasions were more similar to each other in composition across ecosystem types and geographical regions than plots with higher proportions of native plants, which displayed highly variable microbial communities across the continent. Root traits of invasive plants in highly invaded plots explained two times more variation in microbial composition than native plants. This work represents an important step toward understanding macroscale and cross-scale patterns of the relationship between plant invasions, root traits, and soil microbial composition. Our findings provide insights into how invasive plants may impact ecosystem functioning at the macroscale via their homogenizing influence on microbial communities.",

          "abstract": "Sexual reproduction requires the choreographed interaction of female cells and molecules with sperm and seminal fluid. In internally fertilizing animals, these interactions are managed by specialized tissues within the female reproductive tract (FRT), such as a uterus, glands, and sperm storage organs. However, female somatic reproductive tissues remain understudied, hindering insight into the molecular interactions that support fertility. Here, we report the identification, molecular characterization, and analysis of cell types throughout the somatic FRT in the premier Drosophila melanogaster model system. We find that the uterine epithelia is composed of 11 distinct cell types with well-delineated spatial domains, likely corresponding to functionally specialized surfaces that interact with gametes and reproductive fluids. Polyploidy is pervasive: More than half of lower reproductive tract cells are ≥4C. While seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) are typically thought of as male products that are transferred to females, we find that specialized cell types in the sperm storage organs heavily invest in expressing SFP genes. Rates of amino acid divergence between closely related species indicate heterogeneous evolutionary processes acting on male-limited versus female-expressed seminal fluid genes. Together, our results emphasize that more than 40% of annotated seminal fluid genes are better described as shared components of reproductive transcriptomes, which may function cooperatively to support spermatozoa. More broadly, our work provides the molecular foundation for improved technologies to catalyze the functional characterization of the FRT.",

          "abstract": "The ability to remotely control the activity of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) with small molecules can improve the safety and efficacy of gene-modified T cells. Split ON- or OFF-switch CARs involve the dissociation of tumor–antigen binding from T cell activation (i.e., CD3ζ) on the receptor (R-) and signaling (S-) chains, respectively, that either associate or are disrupted in the presence of a small molecule. Here, we have developed an inducible (i)ON-CAR comprising the anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma protein 2 protein in the ectodomain of both chains which associate in the presence of venetoclax. We showed that inducible ON (iON)-CAR T cells respond to target tumors cells in the presence of venetoclax or the BH3 mimetic navitoclax in a dose-dependent manner, while there is no impact of the drugs on equivalent second generation-CAR T cells. Within 48 h of venetoclax withdrawal, iON-CAR T cells lose the ability to respond to target tumor cells in vitro as evaluated by Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) production, and they are reliant upon the presence of venetoclax for in vivo activity. Finally, by fusing a degron sequence to the endodomain of the iON-CAR S-chain we generated an all-in-one ON/OFF-switch CAR, the iONØ-CAR, down-regulated by lenalidomide within 4 to 6 for functionally inactive T cells (no IFNγ production) within 24 h. We propose that our remote-control CAR designs can reduce toxicity in the clinic. Moreover, the periodic rest of iON and iONØ-CAR T cells may alleviate exhaustion and hence augment persistence and long-term tumor control in patients.",

This field effect can be described by several theoretical models, each of which is intuitive to varying degrees. In this contribution, we show that a fundamental effect of electric fields is to generate electrostatic potentials that facilitate the energetic alignment of reactant frontier orbitals. We apply this model to demystify the impact of electric fields on high-valent iron–oxo heme proteins: catalases, peroxidases, and peroxygenases/monooxygenases. Specifically, we show that this model easily accounts for the observed field-induced changes to the spin distribution within peroxidase active sites and explains the transition between epoxidation and hydroxylation pathways seen in Cytochrome P450 active site models. Thus, for the intuitive interpretation of the chemical effect of the field, the strategy involves analyzing the response of the orbitals of active site fragments, and their energetic alignment. We note that the energy difference between fragment orbitals involved in charge redistribution acts as a measure for the chemical hardness/softness of the reactive complex. This measure, and its sensitivity to electric fields, offers a single parameter model from which to quantitatively assess the effects of electric fields on reactivity and selectivity. Thus, the model provides an additional perspective to describe electrostatic preorganization and offers ways for its manipulation.",

Infection with the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is the strongest environmental risk factor, and HLA-DR15 is the strongest genetic risk factor for MS. We employed computational methods and in vitro assays for CD4 T cell activation to investigate the DR15-restricted response to EBV. Using a machine learning-based HLA ligand predictor, the EBV glycoprotein B (gB) was predicted to be enriched in epitopes restricted to presentation by DRB1*15:01. In DR15-positive individuals, two epitopes comprised the major CD4 T cell response to gB. Surprisingly, the expression of recombinant gB in a DR15-homozygous B cell line or primary autologous B cells elicited a CD4 T cell response, indicating that intracellular gB was loaded onto HLA class II molecules. By deleting the signal sequence of gB, we determined that this pathway for direct activation of CD4 T cells was dependent on trafficking to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within the B cell. We screened seven recombinant EBV antigens from the ER compartment for immune responses in DR15-negative vs. DR15-homozygous individuals. In addition to gB, gH was a key CD4 T cell target in individuals homozygous for DR15. Compared to non-DR15 controls, DR15-homozygotes had significantly higher T cell responses to both gB and gH but not to EBV latent or lytic antigens overall. Responses to gB and gH were slightly elevated in DR15 homozygotes with MS. Our results link MS environmental and genetic risk factors by demonstrating that HLA-DR15 dictates CD4 T cell immunity to EBV antigens.",

          "abstract": "Dormant cancer stem cells (DCSCs) exhibit characteristics of chemotherapy resistance and immune escape, and they are a crucial source of tumor recurrence and metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unrevealed. We demonstrate that enriched Gzmk + CD8 + T cells within the niche of esophageal DCSCs restrict the outgrowth of tumor mass. Nonetheless, DCSCs can escape immune elimination by enhancing PD-L1 signaling, thereby maintaining immune equilibrium. Quiescent fibroblast-derived quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) promotes the expression of PD-L1 and its own expression in DCSCs by elevating the level of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, high QSOX1 in the dormant tumor niche contributes to the exclusion of CD8 + T cells. Conversely, blocking QSOX1 with Ebselen in combination with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy can effectively eradicate residual DCSCs by reducing PD-L1 expression and promoting CD8 + T cell infiltration. Clinically, high expression of QSOX1 predicts a poor response to anti-PD-1 treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism whereby QSOX1 promotes PD-L1 upregulation and T cell exclusion, facilitating the immune escape of DCSCs, and QSOX1 inhibition, combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach for eliminating DCSCs and preventing recurrence.",

          "abstract": "The maintenance of lipid asymmetry on the plasma membrane is regulated by flippases, such as ATP8A2, ATP11A, and ATP11C, which translocate phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet. We previously identified a patient-derived point mutation (Q84E) in ATP11A at the phospholipid entry site, which acquired the ability to flip phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). This mutation led to elevated levels of sphingomyelin (SM) in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We herein present two de novo ATP11A dominant mutations (E114G and S399L) in heterozygous patients exhibiting neurological and developmental disorders. These mutations, situated near the predicted phospholipid exit site, similarly confer the ability for ATP11A to recognize PtdCho as a substrate, resulting in its internalization into cells. Cells expressing these mutants had increased SM levels on their surface, attributed to the up-regulated expression of the sphingomyelin synthase-1 gene, rendering them more susceptible to SM phosphodiesterase-mediated cell lysis. Corresponding mutations in ATP11C and ATP8A2, paralogs of ATP11A, exerted similar effects on PtdCho-flipping activity and increased SM levels on the cell surface. Molecular dynamics simulations, based on the ATP11C structure, suggest that the E114G and S399L mutations enhance ATP11C’s affinity toward PtdCho. These findings underscore the importance of the well-conserved exit and entry sites in determining phospholipid substrate specificity and indicate that aberrant flipping of PtdCho contributes to neurological disorders.",

In contrast, little is known about how arthropods sense viruses, although several innate immune pathways including Toll have antiviral functions. Large DNA viruses in the family Baculoviridae are used to control a number of pest insects. Here, we studied Spodoptera litura and Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) to test the hypothesis that one or more myeloid differentiation–like (ML) proteins and Toll family members sense baculoviruses. We identified 11 ML and 12 Toll genes in the S. litura genome. A series of experiments indicated that S. litura ML protein 11 (SlML-11) binds the budded form of AcMNPV and partners with S. litura Toll5 (SlToll5). SlML-11 also bound sphingomyelin (SPM), which is a component of the virion envelope. Disabling SlML-11 and SlToll5 increased susceptibility to infection, while priming larvae with SPM reduced susceptibility as measured by increased survival to the adult stage and clearance of AcMNPV from individuals that emerged as adults. We conclude that SPM is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule while SlML-11 and SlToll5 interact to function as a pattern recognition receptor that senses AcMNPV.",

          "abstract": "As their statistical power grows, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an increasing number of loci underlying quantitative traits of interest. These loci are scattered throughout the genome and are individually responsible only for small fractions of the total heritable trait variance. The recently proposed omnigenic model provides a conceptual framework to explain these observations by postulating that numerous distant loci contribute to each complex trait via effect propagation through intracellular regulatory networks. We formalize this conceptual framework by proposing the “quantitative omnigenic model” (QOM), a statistical model that combines prior knowledge of the regulatory network topology with genomic data. By applying our model to gene expression traits in yeast, we demonstrate that QOM achieves similar gene expression prediction performance to traditional GWAS with hundreds of times less parameters, while simultaneously extracting candidate causal and quantitative chains of effect propagation through the regulatory network for every individual gene. We estimate the fraction of heritable trait variance in cis- and in trans- , break the latter down by effect propagation order, assess the trans- variance not attributable to transcriptional regulation, and show that QOM correctly accounts for the low-dimensional structure of gene expression covariance. We furthermore demonstrate the relevance of QOM for systems biology, by employing it as a statistical test for the quality of regulatory network reconstructions, and linking it to the propagation of nontranscriptional (including environmental) effects.",

In Arabidopsis , endosomal membrane constriction and scission are uncoupled, resulting in the formation of extensive concatenated ILV networks and enhancing cargo sequestration efficiency. Here, we used a combination of electron tomography, computer simulations, and mathematical modeling to address the questions of when concatenated ILV networks evolved in plants and what drives their formation. Through morphometric analyses of tomographic reconstructions of endosomes across yeast, algae, and various land plants, we have found that ILV concatenation is widespread within plant species, but only prevalent in seed plants, especially in flowering plants. Multiple budding sites that require the formation of pores in the limiting membrane were only identified in hornworts and seed plants, suggesting that this mechanism has evolved independently in both plant lineages. To identify the conditions under which these multiple budding sites can arise, we used particle-based molecular dynamics simulations and found that changes in ESCRT filament properties, such as filament curvature and membrane binding energy, can generate the membrane shapes observed in multiple budding sites. To understand the relationship between membrane budding activity and ILV network topology, we performed computational simulations and identified a set of membrane remodeling parameters that can recapitulate our tomographic datasets.",

In this study, we investigated the role of T6SSs in Snodgrassella alvi wkB2, a core bacterial symbiont of the honey bee gut microbiota. We generated single- and double-knockout mutants targeting essential genes ( tssD and tssE ) in both T6SS-1 and T6SS-2 and assessed their colonization and competition capabilities in vivo. Our results indicate that T6SSs are nonessential for colonization of the bee gut, although T6SS-2 mutant strains exhibited significantly lower colonization levels compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Further, a defined community experiment showed that S. alvi wkB2 T6SSs do not significantly impact interspecific competition among core gut bacteria. However, cocolonization experiments with closely related S. alvi strains demonstrated that T6SS-1 plays a role in mediating intraspecific competition. Transcriptomic analysis of bee guts monocolonized by WT or T6SS mutants revealed differential expression of host immunity-related genes relative to microbiota-deprived bees, such as upregulation of the antimicrobial peptide apidaecin in the presence of WT S. alvi and the antimicrobial peptide defensin in the presence of T6SS-2 mutant S. alvi , suggesting that T6SSs contribute to shaping host immune responses.

          "abstract": "Bacteria power rotation of an extracellular flagellar filament for swimming motility. Thousands of flagellin subunits compose the flagellar filament, which extends several microns from the bacterial surface. It is unclear whether bacteria actively control filament length. Many polarly flagellated bacteria produce shorter flagellar filaments than peritrichous bacteria, and FlaG has been reported to limit flagellar filament length in polar flagellates. However, a mechanism for how FlaG may function is unknown. We observed that deletion of flaG in the polarly flagellated pathogens Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and Campylobacter jejuni caused extension of flagellar filaments to lengths comparable to peritrichous bacteria. Using C. jejuni as a model to understand how FlaG controls flagellar filament length, we found that FlaG and FliS chaperone–flagellin complexes antagonize each other for interactions with FlhA in the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) export gate. FlaG interacted with an understudied region of FlhA, and this interaction appeared to be enhanced in Δ fliS and FlhA FliS-binding mutants. Our data support that FlaG evolved in polarly flagellated bacteria as an antagonist to interfere with the ability of FliS to interact with and deliver flagellins to FlhA in the fT3SS export gate to control flagellar filament length so that these bacteria produce relatively shorter flagella than peritrichous counterparts. This mechanism is similar to how some gatekeepers in injectisome T3SSs prevent chaperones from delivering effector proteins until completion of the T3SS and host contact occurs. Thus, flagellar and injectisome T3SSs have convergently evolved protein antagonists to negatively impact respective T3SSs to secrete their major terminal substrates.",

Inspired by nature, we capture atmospheric water through a hydrogel membrane “skin” at an extraordinarily high rate of 5.50 kgm − 2 d − 1 at a low humidity of 35%. and up to 16.9 kgm − 2 d − 1 at higher humidities. For a drinking-water application, calculated performance of a hypothetical one-square-meter device shows that water could be supplied to two to three people in arid environments. This work is a significant step toward providing new resources and possibilities to water-scarce regions.",

Type III interferons (IFNλs) are ordinarily considered inducible antiviral cytokines involved in intestinal immunity. Unlike other IFNλs, we found that newly identified IFNλ4 is an intestinal antibacterial protein. Large amounts of natural IFNλ4 are present in the secretory layer of the intestinal tracts of healthy piglets, which suggests that IFNλ4 is in direct physiological contact with microbial pathogens. We also identified two biochemical functions of mammalian IFNλ4, the induction of bacterial agglutination and direct microbial killing, which are not functions of the other IFNλs. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that after binding to the carbohydrate fraction of lipopolysaccharide, mammalian IFNλ4 self-assembles into bacteria-surrounding nanoparticles that agglutinate bacteria, and that its unique cationic amphiphilic molecular structure facilitates the destruction of bacterial membranes. Our data reveal features of IFNλ4 distinct from those of previously reported IFNλs and suggest that noncanonical IFNλ4 is deeply involved in intestinal immunity, beyond simply cytokine signaling.",

While prior work has elucidated the mechanisms underlying the first two processes, biomechanical processes driving the postfiltration phagocytosis of RBCs retained at interendothelial slits (IES) are still poorly understood. We present here a unique computational model of macrophages to study the role of cell biomechanics in modulating the kinetics of phagocytosis of aged and diseased RBCs retained in the spleen. After validating the macrophage model using in vitro phagocytosis experiments, we employ it to probe the mechanisms underlying the kinetics of phagocytosis of mechanically altered RBCs, such as heated RBCs and abnormal RBCs in hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and sickle cell disease (SCD). Our simulations show pronounced deformation of the flexible and healthy RBCs in contrast to minimal shape changes in altered RBCs. Simulations also show that less deformable RBCs are engulfed faster and at lower adhesive strength than flexible RBCs, consistent with our experimental measurements. This efficient sensing and engulfment by macrophages of stiff RBCs retained at IES are expected to temper splenic congestion, a common pathogenic process in malaria, HS, and SCD. Altogether, our combined computational and in vitro experimental studies suggest that mechanical alterations of retained RBCs may suffice to enhance their phagocytosis, thereby adapting the kinetics of their elimination to the kinetics of their mechanical retention, an equilibrium essential for adequately cleaning the splenic filter to preserve its function.",

This involved exploring the behavioral implications of a two-toed Cretaceous-aged theropod trackway produced by a small, bird-like microraptorine moving at high speed. Applying first principle running biomechanics, we were able to conclude that the trackway is atypical, indirectly evidencing pre-avian aerial behavior. This trackway documents the evidence of wing-assisted aerodynamic force production during locomotion, supporting a broader distribution of this behavior than currently known.

Rocks of the Archean Eon record at least 16 major impact events, involving bolides larger than 10 km in diameter. These impacts probably had severe, albeit temporary, consequences for surface environments. However, their effect on early life is not well understood. Here, we analyze the sedimentology, petrography, and carbon isotope geochemistry of sedimentary rocks across the S2 impact event (37 to 58 km carbonaceous chondrite) forming part of the 3.26 Ga Fig Tree Group, South Africa, to evaluate its environmental effects and biological consequences. The impact initiated 1) a giant tsunami that mixed Fe 2+ -rich deep waters into the Fe 2+ -poor shallow waters and washed debris into coastal areas, 2) heating that caused partial evaporation of surface ocean waters and likely a short-term increase in weathering and erosion on land, and 3) injection of P from vaporization of the S2 bolide. Strata immediately above the S2 impact event contain abundant siderites, which are associated with organic matter and exhibit light and variable δ 13 C carb values. This is consistent with microbial iron cycling in the wake of the impact event. Thus, the S2 impact likely had regional, if not global, positive and negative effects on life. The tsunami, atmospheric heating, and darkness would likely have decimated phototrophic microbes in the shallow water column. However, the biosphere likely recovered rapidly, and, in the medium term, the increase in nutrients and iron likely facilitated microbial blooms, especially of iron-cycling microbes.",

Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cDC1s and a monolayer human gut organoid coculture system, we show that cDC1s extend their dendrites toward pyruvate on the luminal side, forming transepithelial dendrites (TED).

Although many animals routinely consume ethanol in low concentrations as part of their natural diets, its inherent toxicity can cause severe damage. Even species particularly well adapted to ethanol consumption face detrimental effects when exposed to concentrations above 4%. Here, we investigated the metabolism of ethanol and its impact on survival and behavior in the Oriental hornet ( Vespa orientalis ), a social wasp that naturally consumes ethanol. We show that chronic ethanol consumption, even at concentrations as high as 80%, had no impact on hornet mortality, construction behavior, or agonistic behavior. Using 13 C1 labeled ethanol, we show that hornets efficiently metabolized ingested ethanol and at a much higher rate than honey bees. The presence of multiple copies of the alcohol dehydrogenase (NADP+) gene in the Vespa genera suggests a potential mechanism for ethanol tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that the mutualistic relationship between ethanol-producing organisms and vespid hosts may be at the origin of their remarkable capacity to utilize and metabolize ethanol.",

Neither the D- nor the L-RNA components alone can achieve autocatalytic self-replication. Cross-chiral exponential amplification can be continued indefinitely through a serial-transfer process that provides an ongoing supply of the component D- and L-substrates. Unlike the familiar paradigm of semiconservative nucleic acid replication that relies on Watson–Crick pairing between complementary strands, cross-chiral replication relies on tertiary interactions between structured nucleic acids “across the mirror.” There are few examples, outside of biology, of autocatalytic self-replication systems that undergo exponential amplification and there are no prior examples, in either biological or chemical systems, of cross-chiral replication enabling exponential amplification.",

          "abstract": "The dominance of beneficial mutations is a key evolutionary parameter affecting the rate and genetic basis of adaptation, yet it is notoriously difficult to estimate. A leading method to infer it is to compare the relative rates of adaptive substitution for X-linked and autosomal genes, which—according to a classic model by Charlesworth et al. (1987)—is a simple function of the dominance of new beneficial mutations. Recent evidence that rates of adaptive substitution are faster for X-linked genes implies, accordingly, that beneficial mutations are usually recessive. However, this conclusion is incompatible with leading theories of dominance, which predict that beneficial mutations tend to be dominant or overdominant with respect to fitness. To address this incompatibility, we use Fisher’s geometric model to predict the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations and the relative rates of positively selected substitution on the X and autosomes. Previous predictions of faster-X theory emerge as a special case of our model in which the phenotypic effects of mutations are small relative to the distance to the phenotypic optimum. But as mutational effects become large relative to the optimum, we observe an elevated tempo of positively selected substitutions on the X relative to the autosomes across a broader range of dominance conditions, including those predicted by theories of dominance. Our results imply that, contrary to previous models, dominant and overdominant beneficial mutations can plausibly generate patterns of faster-X adaptation. We discuss resulting implications for genomic studies of adaptation and inferences of dominance.",

          "abstract": "Meta-learning enables us to learn how to learn the same or similar tasks more efficiently. Decision-making literature theorizes that a prefrontal network, including the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, underlies meta-learning of decision making by reinforcement learning. Recently, computationally similar meta-learning has been theorized and empirically demonstrated in motor adaptation. However, it remains unclear whether meta-learning of motor adaptation also relies on a prefrontal network. Considering hierarchical information flow from the prefrontal to motor cortices, this study explores whether meta-learning is processed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), which is situated upstream of the primary motor cortex, but downstream of the DLPFC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to either PMd or DLPFC during a motor meta-learning task, in which human participants were trained to regulate the rate and retention of motor adaptation to maximize rewards. While motor adaptation itself was intact, TMS to PMd, but not DLPFC, attenuated meta-learning, impairing the ability to regulate motor adaptation to maximize rewards. Further analyses revealed that TMS to PMd attenuated meta-learning of memory retention. These results suggest that meta-learning of motor adaptation relies more on the premotor area than on a prefrontal network. Thus, while PMd is traditionally viewed as crucial for planning motor actions, this study suggests that PMd is also crucial for meta-learning of motor adaptation, processing goal-directed planning of how long motor memory should be retained to fit the long-term goal of motor adaptation.",

Herein, we propose the utilization of a suspension electrolyte with dispersed magnetically responsive nanosheets whose orientation can be manipulated by an external magnetic field during cell operation for realizing in situ regeneration in LMBs. The regeneration mechanism arises from the redistribution of the ion flux and the formation of an inorganic-rich SEI for uniform and compact Li deposition. With the magnetic-field-induced regeneration process, we show that a Li||Li symmetric cell stably operates for 350 h at 2 mA cm −2 and 2 mA h cm −2 , ~5 times that of the cell with the pristine electrolyte. Furthermore, the cycling stability can be significantly extended in the Li||NMC full cell of 3 mA h cm −2 , showing a capacity retention of 67% after 500 cycles at 1C. The dynamic Li metal regeneration demonstrated here could bring useful design considerations for reviving the operating cells for achieving high-energy, long-duration battery systems.",

Nucleotide excision repair removes bulky DNA damage, and in Escherichia coli , basal excision repair, carried out by UvrA, B, C, and D, with DNA PolI and DNA ligase, occurs genome-wide. In transcription-coupled repair (TCR), the Mfd protein targets template strand (TS) lesions that block RNA polymerase for accelerated repair by the basal repair enzymes. Accelerated repair is also seen with particular adducts. Notably, of the two major UV photoproducts, basal repair of (6-4) photoproducts [(6-4)PPs] is about 10× faster than repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). To better understand repair prioritization in E. coli , we used XR-seq to measure TCR of UV photoproducts genome-wide. With CPDs, we found that TCR occurred at early time points, increased with transcription level, and was Mfd dependent; later, with completion of TS repair, nontranscribed strand (NTS) repair predominated. With (6-4)PP, when analyzing all genes, TCR was not observed; in fact, among the most highly transcribed genes, slightly more repair of (6-4)PPs in the NTS was evident. Thus, the very rapid basal repair of (6-4)PP in the NTS was faster than TCR of (6-4)PPs in the TS. Overall, TCR is of limited importance in (6-4)PP repair, and TCR of CPDs is limited to the TS of more highly transcribed genes. These results are consistent with the significant role of Mfd in mutagenesis and the modest effect of mfd deletion on UV survival and bear upon the response of E. coli to bulky DNA damage.",

This PhosTAP can be used as a PP1 recruitment tool for Phosphorylation Targeting Chimera (PhosTAC)-type recruitment in in vitro and cellular experiments, as well as in phosphoproteomics experiments to identify PP1-specific substrates and phosphosites. The latter is especially important to further our understanding of cellular signaling, as the identification of substrates and especially phosphosites that are targeted by specific phosphatases lags behind that of their kinase counterparts. Using PhosTAP-based proteomics, we show that, counter to our current understanding, many PP1 regulators are also substrates, that the number of residues between regulator PP1-binding and phosphosites vary significantly, and that PP1 counteracts the activities of mitotic kinases. Finally, we also found that Haspin kinase is a direct substrate of PP1 and that its PP1-dependent dephosphorylation modulates its activity during anaphase. Together, we show that PP1-specific PhosTAPs are a powerful tool for +studying PP1 activity in vitro and in cells.",

          "abstract": "Interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) pose formidable challenges in structural characterization. IDRs are highly versatile, capable of adopting diverse structures and engagement modes. Motivated by recent strides in protein structure prediction, we embarked on exploring the extent to which AlphaFold-Multimer can faithfully reproduce the intricacies of interactions involving IDRs. To this end, we gathered multiple datasets covering the versatile spectrum of IDR binding modes and used them to probe AlphaFold-Multimer’s prediction of IDR interactions and their dynamics. Our analyses revealed that AlphaFold-Multimer is not only capable of predicting various types of bound IDR structures with high success rate, but that distinguishing true interactions from decoys, and unreliable predictions from accurate ones is achievable by appropriate use of AlphaFold-Multimer’s intrinsic scores. We found that the quality of predictions drops for more heterogeneous, fuzzy interaction types, most likely due to lower interface hydrophobicity and higher coil content. Notably though, certain AlphaFold-Multimer scores, such as the Predicted Aligned Error and residue-ipTM, are highly correlated with structural heterogeneity of the bound IDR, enabling clear distinctions between predictions of fuzzy and more homogeneous binding modes. Finally, our benchmarking revealed that predictions of IDR interactions can also be successful when using full-length proteins, but not as accurate as with cognate IDRs. To facilitate identification of the cognate IDR of a given partner, we established “minD,” which pinpoints potential interaction sites in a full-length protein. Our study demonstrates that AlphaFold-Multimer can correctly identify interacting IDRs and predict their mode of engagement with a given partner.",

Here, we improve immune cell infiltration into solid tumors by manipulating septin-7 functions in cells. Using protein allosteric design, we reprogram the three-dimensional structure of septin-7 and insert a blue light-responsive light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domain 2 (LOV2), creating a light-controllable septin-7-LOV2 hybrid protein. Blue light inhibits septin-7 function in live cells, inducing extended cell protrusions and cell polarization, enhancing cell transmigration efficiency through confining spaces. We genetically edited human natural killer cell line (NK92) and mouse primary CD8 + T-cells expressing the engineered protein, and we demonstrated improved penetration and cytotoxicity against various tumor spheroid models. Our proposed strategy to enhance immune cell infiltration is compatible with other methodologies and therefore, could be used in combination to further improve cell-based immunotherapies against solid tumors.",

The reconfigurability of this system stems from the ability to modify heat loss by adjusting thermal conductivity, size, placement, and quantity of the slabs. Moreover, this structure allows for precise control of zero-energy thermal nonreciprocity across a broad temperature spectrum, utilizing solely environmental temperature gradients without additional energy consumption. This research presents a different approach to achieving nonreciprocity, broadening the potential for nonreciprocal devices such as thermal diodes and topological edge states, and inspiring further exploration of nonreciprocity in other loss-based systems.",

          "abstract": "Epidemiological studies show a strong correlation between air pollution and fetal growth restriction (FGR), but existing results are controversial due to inherent limitations, such as causality of specific pollutants, developmental origin, and maternal–fetal transmission. To address this controversy, we first conducted a retrospective analysis of 28,796 newborns and revealed that maternal nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) exposure during the second trimester was positively associated with FGR, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.075 (95% confidence interval: 1.020-1.133) per 10 μg/m 3 NO 2 increase for small for gestational age. Then, by establishing an animal model of prenatal NO 2 exposure, we confirmed its adverse effects on embryonic growth and hematopoiesis in the yolk sac and fetal liver, primarily affecting the differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and erythroid maturation. By applying internal exposure analyses coupled with 15 N isotope tracing, we found that maternal NO 2 inhalation induced acquired methemoglobinemia through its byproducts and placental hypoxia in pregnant mice. Importantly, by combining transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics analysis, and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP)/chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP), we clarified that placental-fetal hypoxia transmission activated hypoxia-inducible factors, disturbed hematopoiesis through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1β-long noncoding RNAs-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha-proinflammatory signaling pathway, ultimately contributing to FGR progression. These findings provide insights for risk prevention and clinical intervention to promote child well-being in NO 2 -polluted areas.",

We measured and compared isoprene emissions from sedges grown in different climatic zones, all showing an exponential temperature response with a Q10 range of 7.2 to 12, significantly higher than the Q10 of about 3 for other common isoprene emitters. The distinct temperature sensitivity of sedges makes them a hidden isoprene source, significant during heat waves but not easily detected in mild weather. For instance, isoprene emissions from Carex praegracilis can increase by 320% with a peak emission of over 100 nmol m −2 s −1 compared to preheat wave emissions. During heat waves, the peak isoprene emissions from C. praegracilis can match those from Lophostemon confertus , a commonly used street tree species which is considered the dominant urban isoprene source due to higher biomass and emission capacities. This surge in isoprene from globally distributed sedges, including those in urban landscapes, could contribute to peak ozone and aerosol pollutants during heat waves.",

Here, we present a long-term record of CH 4 -fueled pelagic food webs across the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (~120 Mya) that serves as a geological analog to future warming. We show an exceptionally strong expansion of both methanogens and CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria (up to 87% of hopanoid-producing bacteria) during this Event. Grazing on CH 4 -oxidizing bacteria by zooplankton (up to 47% of ciliate diets) within the chemocline transferred substantial CH 4 -derived carbon to the higher trophic levels, representing an important CH 4 sink in the water column.

Many studies either neglect genetic confounding altogether or rely on adjusting for polygenic scores (PGS) in regression analysis. In this study, we unveil that the commonly employed PGS approach is inadequate for removing genetic confounding due to measurement error and model misspecification. To tackle this challenge, we introduce PENGUIN, a principled framework for polygenic genetic confounding control based on variance component estimation. In addition, we present extensions of this approach that can estimate genetically unconfounded associations using GWAS summary statistics alone as input and between multiple generations of study samples. Through simulations, we demonstrate superior statistical properties of PENGUIN compared to the existing approaches. Applying our method to multiple population cohorts, we reveal and remove substantial genetic confounding in the associations of educational attainment with various complex traits and between parental and offspring education. Our results show that PENGUIN is an effective solution for genetic confounding control in observational data analysis with broad applications in future epidemiologic association studies.",

Four hundred seventeen (417) women aged 46 to 86 y residing at ≥3,500 m in Upper Mustang, Nepal, provided information on reproductive histories, sociocultural factors, physiological measurements, and DNA samples for this observational cohort study. Simultaneously assessing multiple traits identified combinations associated with lifetime reproductive success measured as the number of livebirths. Women with the most livebirths had distinctive hematological and cardiovascular traits. A hemoglobin concentration near the sample mode and a high percent of oxygen saturation of hemoglobin raised arterial oxygen concentration without risking elevated blood viscosity. We propose ongoing stabilizing selection on hemoglobin concentration because extreme values predicted fewer livebirths and directional selection favoring higher oxygen saturation because higher values had more predicted livebirths. EPAS1, an oxygen homeostasis locus with strong signals of positive natural selection and a high frequency of variants occurring only among populations indigenous to the Tibetan Plateau, associated with hemoglobin concentration. High blood flow into the lungs, wide left ventricles, and low hypoxic heart rate responses aided effective convective oxygen transport to tissues. Women with physiologies closer to unstressed, low altitude values had the highest lifetime reproductive success. This example of ethnic Tibetan women residing at high altitudes in Nepal links reproductive fitness with trait combinations increasing oxygen delivery under severe hypoxic stress and demonstrates ongoing natural selection.",

However, an understanding of how the ENSO might have evolved over geological timescales is still lacking, despite a well-accepted recognition that such an understanding has direct implications for constraining human-induced future ENSO changes. Here, using climate simulations, we show that ENSO has been a leading mode of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the past 250 My but with substantial variations in amplitude across geological periods. We show this result by performing and analyzing a series of coupled time-slice climate simulations forced by paleogeography, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and solar radiation for the past 250 My, in 10-My intervals. The variations in ENSO amplitude across geological periods are little related to mean equatorial zonal SST gradient or global mean surface temperature of the respective periods but are primarily determined by interperiod difference in the background thermocline depth, according to a linear stability analysis. In addition, variations in atmospheric noise serve as an independent contributing factor to ENSO variations across intergeological periods. The two factors together explain about 76% of the interperiod variations in ENSO amplitude over the past 250 My. Our findings support the importance of changing ocean vertical thermal structure and atmospheric noise in influencing projected future ENSO change and its uncertainty.",

T cells lacking AMBRA1 resisted FAS-mediated cell death by down-regulating FAS expression at the translational level. We show that AMBRA1 is a vital regulator of ribosome protein biosynthesis and ribosome loading on select mRNAs, whereby it plays a key role in balancing TCR signaling with cell cycle regulation pathways. We also found that AMBRA1 itself is translationally controlled by TCR stimulation via the CD28–PI3K–mTORC1–EIF4F pathway. Together, these findings shed light on the molecular control of translation after T cell activation and implicate AMBRA1 as a translational regulator governing TCR signaling, cell cycle progression, and T cell death.",

          "abstract": "Atherosclerosis results from lipid-driven inflammation of the arterial wall that fails to resolve. Imbalances in macrophage accumulation and function, including diminished migratory capacity and defective efferocytosis, fuel maladaptive inflammation and plaque progression. The neuroimmune guidance cue netrin-1 has dichotomous roles in inflammation partly due to its multiple receptors; in atherosclerosis, netrin-1 promotes macrophage survival and retention via its receptor Unc5b. To minimize the pleiotropic effects of targeting netrin-1, we tested the therapeutic potential of deleting Unc5b in mice with advanced atherosclerosis. We generated Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 creERT2/WT mice, which allowed conditional deletion of Un5b (∆ Unc5b MØ ) in monocytes and macrophages by tamoxifen injection. After inducing advanced atherosclerosis by hepatic PCSK9 overexpression and western diet feeding for 20 wk, Unc5b was deleted and hypercholesterolemia was normalized to simulate clinical lipid management. Deletion of myeloid Unc5b led to a 40% decrease in atherosclerotic plaque burden and reduced plaque complexity compared to Unc5b fl/fl Cx3cr1 WT/WT littermate controls (Ctrl MØ ). Consistently, plaque macrophage content was reduced by 50% in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice due to reduced plaque Ly6C hi monocyte recruitment and macrophage retention. Compared to Ctrl MØ mice, plaques in ∆ Unc5b MØ mice had reduced necrotic area and fewer apoptotic cells, which correlated with improved efferocytotic capacity by Unc5b -deficient macrophages in vivo and in vitro. Beneficial changes in macrophage dynamics in the plaque upon Unc5b deletion were accompanied by an increase in atheroprotective T cell populations, including T-regulatory and Th2 cells. Our data identify Unc5b in advanced atherosclerosis as a therapeutic target to induce pro-resolving restructuring of the plaque immune cells and to promote atherosclerosis regression.",

We revealed hippocampal functional hierarchy within the large-scale cortical brain systems, with the anterior hippocampus preferentially connected to an anterior temporal (AT) pathway and the posterior hippocampus embedded in a posterior medial (PM) pathway. We examined the developmental effects of the primary gradient and its whole-brain functional interaction. We observed increased functional specialization along the hippocampal long axis and found a general whole-brain connectivity shift from the posterior to the anterior hippocampus during development. Using phenotypic predictive modeling, we further delineated how the hippocampus is differentially integrated into the whole-brain cortical hierarchy underlying episodic memory and identified several key nodes within PM/AT systems.

          "abstract": "Sleep is an essential behavior that supports lifelong brain health and cognition. Neuronal synapses are a major target for restorative sleep function and a locus of dysfunction in response to sleep deprivation (SD). Synapse density is highly dynamic during development, becoming stabilized with maturation to adulthood, suggesting sleep exerts distinct synaptic functions between development and adulthood. Importantly, problems with sleep are common in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Moreover, early life sleep disruption in animal models causes long-lasting changes in adult behavior. Divergent plasticity engaged during sleep necessarily implies that developing and adult synapses will show differential vulnerability to SD. To investigate distinct sleep functions and mechanisms of vulnerability to SD across development, we systematically examined the behavioral and molecular responses to acute SD between juvenile (P21 to P28), adolescent (P42 to P49), and adult (P70 to P100) mice of both sexes. Compared to adults, juveniles lack robust adaptations to SD, precipitating cognitive deficits in the novel object recognition task. Subcellular fractionation, combined with proteome and phosphoproteome analysis revealed the developing synapse is profoundly vulnerable to SD, whereas adults exhibit comparative resilience. SD in juveniles, and not older mice, aberrantly drives induction of synapse potentiation, synaptogenesis, and expression of perineuronal nets. Our analysis further reveals the developing synapse as a putative node of convergence between vulnerability to SD and ASD genetic risk. Together, our systematic analysis supports a distinct developmental function of sleep and reveals how sleep disruption impacts key aspects of brain development, providing insights for ASD susceptibility.",

          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics imposes limits on the statistics of certain observables. Perhaps the most famous example is the uncertainty principle. Similar trade-offs also exist for the simultaneous violation of multiple Bell inequalities. In the simplest case of three observers, it has been shown that if two observers violate a Bell inequality, then none of them can violate any Bell inequality with the third observer, a property called monogamy of Bell violations. Forms of Bell monogamy have been linked to the no-signaling principle, and the inability of simultaneous violations of all inequalities is regarded as their fundamental property. Here, we show that the Bell monogamy does not hold universally and that in fact the only monogamous situation exists for only three observers. Consequently, the nature of quantum nonlocality is truly polygamous. We present a systematic methodology for identifying quantum states, measurements, and tight Bell inequalities that do not obey the monogamy principle for any number of more than three observers. The identified polygamous inequalities enable any subset of ( N − 1 ) observers to reveal nonlocality, which is also shown experimentally by measuring Bell-type correlations of six-photon Dicke states. Our findings may be exploited for multiparty quantum key distribution as well as simultaneous self-testing of multiple nodes in quantum networks.",

Here, we present ice-core δ 15 N-N 2 records from south (Dye 3) and coastal east Greenland (Renland) to calibrate the local water isotope thermometer and provide a Greenland-wide spatial characterization of DO event magnitude. We combine these data with existing records of δ 18 O, deuterium excess, and accumulation rates to create a multiproxy “fingerprint” of the DO impact on Greenland. Isotope-enabled climate models have skill in simulating the observational multiproxy DO event impact, and we use a series of idealized simulations with such models to identify regions of the North Atlantic that are critical in explaining DO variability. Our experiments imply that wintertime sea ice variation in the subpolar gyre, rather than the commonly invoked Nordic Seas, is both a sufficient and a necessary condition to explain the observed DO impacts in Greenland, whatever the distal cause. Moisture-tagging experiments support the idea that Greenland DO isotope signals may be explained almost entirely via changes in the vapor source distribution and that site temperature is not a main control on δ 18 O during DO transitions, contrary to the traditional interpretation. Our results provide a comprehensive, multiproxy, data-model synthesis of abrupt DO climate variability in Greenland.",

We show that new collective phases emerge where the school of fish “follows the tank wall” or “double mills.” Importantly, confinement induces repeated switching between two collective states, schooling and milling. We describe the group dynamics probabilistically, uncovering bistable collective states along with unintuitive bifurcations driving phase transitions.

          "abstract": "Guanine-rich DNA forms G-quadruplexes (G4s) that play a critical role in essential cellular processes. Previous studies have mostly focused on intramolecular G4s composed of four consecutive guanine tracts (G-tracts) from a single strand. However, this structural form has not been strictly confirmed in the genome of living eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the formation of hybrid G4s (hG4s), consisting of G-tracts from both DNA and RNA, in the genome of living yeast cells. Analysis of Okazaki fragment syntheses and two other independent G4-specific detections reveal that hG4s can efficiently form with as few as a single DNA guanine–guanine (GG) tract due to the participation of G-tracts from RNA. This finding increases the number of potential G4-forming sites in the yeast genome from 38 to 587,694, a more than 15,000-fold increase. Interestingly, hG4s readily form and even dominate at G4 sites that are theoretically capable of forming the intramolecular DNA G4s (dG4s) by themselves. Compared to dG4s, hG4s exhibit broader kinetics, higher prevalence, and greater structural diversity and stability. Most importantly, hG4 formation is tightly coupled to transcription through the involvement of RNA, allowing it to function in a transcription-dependent manner. Overall, our study establishes hG4s as the overwhelmingly dominant G4 species in the yeast genome and emphasizes a renewal of the current perception of the structural form, formation mechanism, prevalence, and functional role of G4s in eukaryotic genomes. It also establishes a sensitive and currently the only method for detecting the structural form of G4s in living cells.",

Intriguingly, the mutation V319F, known to confer resistance to BRD-8000.3, alters the expression level and oligomeric state of EfpA. Based on our results and the observation of other antiparallel dimers in the MFS family, we propose an antiparallel-function model of EfpA. Collectively, our work provides structural and functional insights into EfpA’s role in lipid transport and drug resistance, which would accelerate the development of antibiotics against this promising drug target.",

          "abstract": "Defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and β-cell senescence are hallmarks in diabetes. The mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) has been shown to promote GSIS and β-cell proliferation in the clonal β-cell lines, yet its physiological relevance remains unknown. Here, we provide animal and human data showing a role of PC in protecting β-cells against senescence and maintaining GSIS under different physiological and pathological conditions. β-cell-specific deletion of PC impaired GSIS and induced β-cell senescence in the mouse models under either a standard chow diet or prolonged high-fat diet feeding. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that p53-related senescence and cell cycle arrest are activated in PC-deficient islets. Overexpression of PC inhibited hyperglycemia- and aging-induced p53-related senescence in human and mouse islets as well as INS-1E β-cells, whereas knockdown of PC provoked senescence. Mechanistically, PC interacted with MDM2 to prevent its degradation via the MDM2 binding motif, which in turn restricts the p53-dependent senescent program in β-cells. On the contrary, the regulatory effects of PC on GSIS and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) anaplerotic flux are p53-independent. We illuminate a function of PC in controlling β-cell senescence through the MDM2–p53 axis.",

          "abstract": "Fast, nondestructive three-dimensional (3D) imaging of live suspension cells remains challenging without substrate treatment or fixation, precluding scalable single-cell morphometry with minimal alterations. While optical sectioning techniques achieve 3D live cell imaging, lateral versus depth resolution differences further complicate analysis. We present a scalable microfluidic method capable of 3D fluorescent isotropic imaging of live, nonadherent cells suspended inside picoliter droplets with high-speed single-cell volumetric readout (800 to 1,200 slices in 5 to 8 s) and near-diffraction limit resolution (~216 nm). The platform features a droplet trap array that leverages flow-induced droplet interfacial shear to generate intradroplet microvortices, which rotate single cells on their axis to enable optical projection tomography (OPT)-based imaging. This allows gentle (~1 mPa shear stress) observation of cells encapsulated inside nontoxic isotonic buffer droplets, facilitating scalable OPT acquisition by simultaneous spinning of hundreds of cells. We demonstrate 3D imaging of live myeloid and lymphoid cells in suspension, including K562 cells, as well as naive and activated T cells—small cells prone to movement in their suspended phenotype. Our fully suspended, orientation-independent cell morphometry, driven by isotropic imaging and spherical harmonic analysis, enabled the study of primary T cells across various immunological activation states. This approach unveiled six distinct nuclear content distributions, contrasting with conventional 2D images that typically portray spheroid and bean-like nuclear shapes associated with lymphocytes. Our arrayed-droplet OPT technology is capable of isotropic, single live-cell 3D imaging, with the potential to perform large-scale morphometry of immune cell effector function states while providing compatibility with microfluidic droplet operations.",

Generally, active objects rely on the symmetry-broken structures, compositions, or interfacial activities through a physical or chemical approach. Here, we report an active bubble spontaneously hovering with a horizontal oscillation at the solid/liquid interface by impacting a stationary laser beam into a liquid through a transparent solid cover. This spontaneous oscillation mode of the bubble synchronizes with that of the interfacial temperature and hydrodynamical flow. A physical mechanism is proposed, and the scaling analysis of the oscillation frequency agrees well with experiments in various liquids under different laser powers. Additionally, the bubble trajectory rotates azimuthally, arising from the symmetry breaking of the vortex pair accompanying the oscillation. Moreover, the double pendulum of oscillation bubbles has been demonstrated, achieving a preferable oscillation direction in a controllable way. These findings would not only advance our understanding of active matters but also shed light on the bubble-mediated technological applications, such as microrobots and drug deliveries.",

          "abstract": "Current research on memory indicates that learning is most effective when it involves spaced retrieval practice of study materials. Here, we investigated whether the benefits of both retrieval practice and spacing can be further boosted when variability is introduced across practice sessions. Across six experiments, participants learned translations of foreign vocabulary, with foreign words embedded in contextual sentences hinting at the meaning of these words. These sentences were then either kept constant or varied from one learning cycle to another. Whenever repeated practice took the form of retrieval from long-term memory with contextual sentences serving as cues (with or without feedback after retrieval attempts), variable sentences led to better learning of the meanings of the embedded foreign words than constant sentences. The benefits of variable retrieval were observed both immediately after study and after a 24-h delay, and they were larger when retrieval practice was spaced rather than massed. However, these benefits were not appreciated by the learners who judged learning to be more effective with constant rather than variable cues. This metacognitive illusion, misaligning the effectiveness of learning and its appraisal by learners, was confirmed in the seventh experiment which focused on learning lecture content. Thus, while spaced retrieval practice employing variable cues clearly produces robust benefits for memory performance, such benefits may be severely underappreciated by the learners.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved many defenses against invading viruses (phage). Despite the many bacterial defenses and phage counterdefenses, in most environments, bacteria and phage coexist, with neither driving the other to extinction. How is coexistence realized in the context of the bacteria/phage arms race, and how are immune repertoire sizes determined in conditions of coexistence? Here we develop a simple mathematical model to consider the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of competing bacteria and phage with different immune/counterimmune repertoires. We find an ecologically stable fixed point exhibiting coexistence, in agreement with the experimental observation that each individual bacterium typically carries multiple defense systems, though fewer than the maximum number possible. However, in simulations, the populations typically remain dynamic, exhibiting chaotic fluctuations around this fixed point. These dynamics enable coexistence even when phage (predator) strains outnumber bacteria (prey) strains. We obtain quantitative predictions for the mean, amplitude, and timescale of these dynamics. Our results provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of the bacteria/phage arms race and demonstrate how bacteria/phage coexistence can stably arise from the coevolution of bacterial defense systems and phage counterdefense systems.",

They transduce signals across membranes, scaffold signaling complexes, and mediate vesicular traffic. Their functions are regulated by constraining conformational ensembles through specific intra- and intermolecular interactions, physical tethering, and posttranslational modifications. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-phagy receptor FAM134B/RETREG1, known for its reticulon homology domain (RHD), includes a substantial C-terminal IDR housing the LC3 interacting motif. Beyond engaging the autophagic machinery, the function of the FAM134B-IDR is unclear. Here, we investigate the characteristics of the FAM134B-IDR by extensive modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We present detailed structural models for the IDR, mapping its conformational landscape in solution and membrane-anchored configurations. Our analysis reveals that depending on the membrane anchor, the IDRs collapse onto the membrane and induce positive membrane curvature to varying degrees. The charge patterns underlying this Janus-like behavior are conserved across other ER-phagy receptors. We found that IDRs alone are sufficient to sense curvature. When combined with RHDs, they intensify membrane remodeling and drive efficient protein clustering, leading to faster budding, thereby amplifying RHD remodeling functions. Our simulations provide a perspective on IDRs of FAM134B, their Janus-like membrane interactions, and the resulting modulatory functions during large-scale ER remodeling.",

Here, we characterize a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) from a growth-associated intestinal strain of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii cultured from these children. This enzyme, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, hydrolyzes a variety of N -acylamides, including oleoylethanolamide (OEA), neurotransmitters, and quorum sensing N -acyl homoserine lactones; it also synthesizes a range of N -acylamides, notably N -acyl amino acids. Treating germ-free mice with N -oleoylarginine and N -oleolyhistidine, major products of FAAH OEA metabolism, markedly affected expression of intestinal immune function pathways. Administering MDCF to Bangladeshi children considerably reduced fecal OEA, a satiety factor whose levels were negatively correlated with abundance and expression of their F. prausnitzii FAAH. This enzyme, structurally and catalytically distinct from mammalian FAAH, is positioned to regulate levels of a variety of bioactive molecules.",

Predation experiments suggest that the relative fitness of color phenotypes varies between forested and deforested habitats. Genomic and coloration analyses of 1200 specimens show repeated selection at the ebony locus controlling color polymorphism across lineages.

Owing to their five-fold symmetry, the iron cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterized by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units.

Exposure to sublethal doses also induced widespread changes in the phosphoproteome and changes in development and reproduction. The negative effects of agrochemicals were amplified when the temperature was increased. We observed similar behavioral changes across multiple insect species, including mosquitoes and butterflies. These findings suggest that widespread sublethal pesticide exposure can alter insect behavior and physiology, threatening long-term population survival.",

          "abstract": "DNA transfer is ubiquitous in the human gut microbiota, especially among species of the order Bacteroidales. In silico analyses have revealed hundreds of mobile genetic elements shared between these species, yet little is known about the phenotypes they encode, their effects on fitness, or pleiotropic consequences for the recipient’s genome. In this work, we show that acquisition of a ubiquitous integrative conjugative element (ICE) encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS) shuts down the native T6SS of Bacteroides fragilis . Despite inactivating this T6SS, ICE acquisition increases the fitness of the B. fragilis transconjugant over its progenitor by arming it with the new T6SS. DNA transfer causes the strain to change allegiances so that it no longer targets ecosystem members with the same element yet is armed for communal defense.",

          "abstract": "Insertion storage in battery electrodes and supercapacitive storage are typically considered to be independent phenomena and thus are dealt with in separate scientific communities. Using tailored experiments on titanium oxide thin films of various thicknesses, we demonstrate the simultaneous occurrence of both processes. For the interpretation of the entire storage profile encompassing both contributions, the (free) energies of the charge carriers in the mixed conductor and the neighboring phase are the only materials parameters required. The experimental results enable no less than a unification of insertion and supercapacitive storage, the first being dominant for thick films, the latter for thin films or negligible electronic conductivity. Therefore, the size of the storage medium and the nature of the current collecting phases can be used to tune power density versus energy density.",

          "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and erythropoiesis are activated during pregnancy and after bleeding by the derepression of retrotransposons, including endogenous retroviruses and LINE elements. Retrotransposon transcription activates the innate immune sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING), which induce IFN and IFN-regulated genes in HSCs, increasing HSC division and erythropoiesis. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase or deficiency for cGAS or STING had little or no effect on hematopoiesis in non-pregnant mice but depleted HSCs and erythroid progenitors in pregnant mice, reducing red blood cell counts. Retrotransposons and IFN regulated genes were also induced in mouse HSCs after serial bleeding and in human HSCs during pregnancy. Reverse transcriptase inhibitor use was associated with anemia in pregnant, but not non-pregnant, people suggesting conservation of these mechanisms from mice to humans.",

Infrared emission bands show that PAHs are abundant in space, but only a few specific PAHs have been detected in the interstellar medium. We detect 1-cyanopyrene, a cyano-substituted derivative of the related four-ring PAH pyrene, in radio observations of the dense cloud TMC-1 using the Green Bank Telescope. The measured column density of 1-cyanopyrene is ∼ 1 .52×10 12 cm − 2 , from which we estimate that pyrene contains up to 0.1% of the carbon in TMC-1. This abundance indicates that interstellar PAH chemistry favors the production of pyrene. We suggest that some of the carbon supplied to young planetary systems is carried by PAHs that originate in cold molecular clouds.",

Nearly half of the ecoregions experienced destructive fast fires that grew more than 1620 hectares in 1 day. These fires accounted for 78% of structures destroyed and 61% of suppression costs ($18.9 billion). From 2001 to 2020, the average peak daily growth rate for these fires more than doubled (+249% relative to 2001) in the Western US. Nearly 3 million structures were within 4 kilometers of a fast fire during this period across the US.

Using genome, transcriptome, and proteome analysis of Hypsibius henanensis sp. nov. , we explored the molecular basis contributing to radiotolerance in this organism. A putatively horizontally transferred gene, DOPA dioxygenase 1 ( DODA1 ), responds to radiation and confers radiotolerance by synthesizing betalains—a type of plant pigment with free radical–scavenging properties. A tardigrade-specific radiation-induced disordered protein, TRID1, facilitates DNA damage repair through a mechanism involving phase separation. Two mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly proteins, BCS1 and NDUFB8, accumulate to accelerate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) regeneration for poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and subsequent poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)–mediated DNA damage repair. These three observations expand our understanding of mechanisms of tardigrade radiotolerance.",

In this study, we establish that aging of the immune system, regardless of the age of the stroma and tumor, drives lung cancer progression. Hematopoietic aging enhances emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in the local accumulation of myeloid progenitor–like cells in lung tumors. These cells are a major source of interleukin (IL)–1⍺, which drives the enhanced myeloid response. The age-associated decline of DNA methyltransferase 3A enhances IL-1⍺ production, and disrupting IL-1 receptor 1 signaling early during tumor development normalized myelopoiesis and slowed the growth of lung, colonic, and pancreatic tumors. In human tumors, we identified an enrichment for IL-1⍺–expressing monocyte-derived macrophages linked to age, poorer survival, and recurrence, unraveling how aging promotes cancer and offering actionable therapeutic strategies.",

Microplastics arise from multiple sources, including tires, textiles, cosmetics, paint, and the fragmentation of larger items. They are widely distributed throughout the natural environment, with evidence of harm at multiple levels of biological organization. They are pervasive in food and drink and have been detected throughout the human body, with emerging evidence of negative effects. Environmental contamination could double by 2040, and wide-scale harm has been predicted. Public concern is increasing, and diverse measures to address microplastic pollution are being considered in international negotiations.

We adapted RNA interactome capture to mouse male germ cells, building an RBP atlas characterized by multiple layers of dynamics along spermatogenesis. Trapping of RNA–cross-linked peptides showed that the glutamic acid–arginine (ER) patch, a residue-coevolved polyampholytic element present in coiled coils, enhances RNA binding of its host RBPs. Deletion of this element in NONO (non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein) led to a defective mitosis-to-meiosis transition due to compromised NONO-RNA interactions. Whole-exome sequencing of over 1000 infertile men revealed a prominent role of RBPs in the human genetic architecture of male infertility and identified risk ER patch variants.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the evolution and dissemination of human knowledge over time faces challenges due to the abundance of historical materials and limited specialist resources. However, the digitization of historical archives presents an opportunity for AI-supported analysis. This study advances historical analysis by using an atomization-recomposition method that relies on unsupervised machine learning and explainable AI techniques. Focusing on the “Sacrobosco Collection,” consisting of 359 early modern printed editions of astronomy textbooks from European universities (1472–1650), totaling 76,000 pages, our analysis uncovers temporal and geographic patterns in knowledge transformation. We highlight the relevant role of astronomy textbooks in shaping a unified mathematical culture, driven by competition among educational institutions and market dynamics. This approach deepens our understanding by grounding insights in historical context, integrating with traditional methodologies. Case studies illustrate how communities embraced scientific advancements, reshaping astronomic and geographical views and exploring scientific roots amidst a changing world.",

However, empirical evidence from managed and mature forests on the impact of this enrichment on ecological (multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality) and economic dimensions remains scarce, particularly when nonnative species are used. Here, we propose and test a framework that integrates economic multifunctionality, encompassing timber production–oriented goals and resistance against disturbances, with multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in European beech forest stands enriched with conifers. Our results show that enriched beech forest stands (~80 years old) can provide high levels of economic multifunctionality without compromising multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. In comparison to pure beech stands, enriched stands with Douglas-fir supported win-win-win situations for these three dimensions. Our findings contribute to the discussion of integrating biodiversity, ecosystem, and economic functions, providing empirical evidence for future forest management.",

Across three studies, we reveal the developmental differences and computational mechanisms that underlie the social media engagement and feedback processing of adolescents and adults. First, using a reinforcement learning model on a large Instagram trace dataset ( N = 16,613, 1.6+ million posts), we show that adolescents are more sensitive to social feedback than adults. Second, in an experimental study ( N = 194), we show that adolescents’ mood is affected more strongly by a reduction in likes than adults. Last, in a neuroimaging study ( N = 96), we show that social media feedback sensitivity is related to individual differences in subcortical-limbic brain volumes of emerging adults. Together, these findings highlight the need for digital competence programs to help youth manage the constant feedback they encounter on social media platforms.",

Improved SWB in later adulthood has been considered a paradox given age-related declines in health and social losses. While SWB has mostly been studied in high-income countries, it remains largely unexplored in rural subsistence populations lacking formal institutions that reliably promote social welfare. Here, we evaluate the age profile of SWB among three small-scale subsistence societies ( n = 468; study 1), forest users from 23 low-income countries ( n = 6987; study 2), and Tsimane’ horticulturalists ( n = 1872; study 3). Across multiple specifications, we find variability in SWB age profiles. In some cases, we find no age-related differences in SWB or even inverted U-shapes. Adjusting for confounders reduces observed age effects. Our findings highlight variability in average well-being trajectories over the life course. Ensuring successful aging will require a greater focus on cultural and socioecological determinants of individual trajectories.",

By measuring the structure of knowledge networks constructed by readers weaving a thread through articles in Wikipedia, we replicate two styles of curiosity previously identified in laboratory studies: the nomadic “busybody” and the targeted “hunter.” Further, we find evidence for another style—the “dancer”—which was previously predicted by a historico-philosophical examination of texts over two millennia and is characterized by creative modes of knowledge production. We identify associations, globally, between the structure of knowledge networks and population-level indicators of spatial navigation, education, mood, well-being, and inequality.

This phenomenon is relatively well understood for inorganic materials but much less so for organic semiconductors (OSs). These materials present a challenge because the strong thermal fluctuations of electronic coupling between the molecules result in partially delocalized charge carriers that cannot be treated with traditional theories for thermoelectricity. Here, we develop a quantum dynamical simulation approach revealing in atomistic detail how the charge carrier wave function moves along a temperature gradient in an organic molecular crystal. We find that the wave function propagates from hot to cold in agreement with the experiment, and we obtain a Seebeck coefficient in good agreement with experimental measurements that are also reported in this work. Detailed analysis reveals that gradients in thermal electronic disorder play an important role in determining the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, opening unexplored avenues for the design of OSs with improved Seebeck coefficients.",

While there are numerous methods to detect and quantify mRNA and protein abundance in biological samples, there are no general approaches to detect and quantify endogenous protein activity with single-cell resolution. Here, we report the development of a chemoproteomic platform, single-cell activity-dependent proximity ligation, which uses automated, microfluidics-based single-cell capture and nanoliter volume manipulations to convert the interactions of family-wide chemical activity probes with native protein targets into multiplexed, amplifiable oligonucleotide barcodes. We demonstrate accurate, reproducible, and multiplexed quantitation of a six-enzyme (Ag-6) panel with known ties to cancer cell aggressiveness directly in single cells. We further identified increased Ag-6 enzyme activity across breast cancer cell lines of increasing metastatic potential, as well as in primary patient-derived tumor cells and organoids from patients with breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "In fuel cells and electrolyzers, suboptimal proton conductivity and its dramatic drop at low humidity remain major drawbacks in proton exchange membranes (PEMs), including current benchmark Nafion. Sustained through-plane (TP) alignment of nanochannels was proposed as a remedy but proved challenging. We report an anisotropic composite PEM, mimicking the water-conductive composite structure of bamboo that meets this challenge. Micro- and nanoscale alignment of conductive pathways is achieved by in-plane thermal compression of a mat composed of co-electrospun Nafion and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanofibers stabilizing the alignment. This translates to pronounced TP-enhanced proton conductivity, twice that of pure Nafion at high humidity, 13 times larger at low humidity, and 10 times larger water diffusivity. This remarkable improvement is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that stronger nanochannels alignment upon dehydration compensates for reduced water content. The presented approach paves the way to overcoming the major drawbacks of ionomers and advancing the development of next-generation membranes for energy applications.",

The DEAs use a thickness-varying multilayer structure to achieve large out-of-plane displacement and force, maintaining comfort and wearability. Experimental results demonstrate that HAMS can produce complex tactile feedback with high perception accuracy.

          "abstract": "Coherent interaction between light fields and matter has led to many exotic physical phenomena, one of which is the Autler-Townes splitting originating from the optical Stark effect of a three-level system. It has been well documented for atoms, molecules, and low-dimensional, epitaxial-grown semiconductors but rarely for solution-processed samples. Here, we report on Autler-Townes splitting observed in CdSe nanoplatelets. The strong intersubband transition of these nanoplatelets situated in the near-infrared allows us to coherently drive it with femtosecond near-infrared pulses, and meanwhile, their strong interband transition in the visible records the resultant spectral changes. The splitting is most prominent with cross-polarized, linear pump-probe pulses, consistent with the orthogonal polarizations of interband and intersubband transition dipoles. When the nanoplatelets are driven from tilted incident angles, we observe anomalous spectral lineshapes arising from a competition between interband and intersubband drivings, which are nevertheless quantitatively captured by our dressed-state model simulation.",

          "abstract": "The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains of up to 2.25 decibel, comparable to fundamental bounds for up to about 80 atoms in the presence of decoherence. This result is unexpected because GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.",

Early-replicated vDNA segregated from the viral replication compartment (VRC). Single object tracking, superresolution microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, and correlative light-electron microscopy revealed a stepwise assembly program involving vDNA and capsid intermediates. Depending on replication and the scaffolding protein 52K, late-replicated vDNA with rapidly exchanging green fluorescent protein–tagged capsid linchpin protein V and incomplete virions emerged from the VRC periphery. These nanogel-like puncta exhibited restricted movements and were located with the capsid proteins hexon, VI, and virions in the nuclear periphery, suggestive of sites for virion formation.

          "abstract": "Single molecule x-ray scattering experiments using free-electron lasers hold the potential to resolve biomolecular structures and structural ensembles. However, molecular electron density determination has so far not been achieved because of low photon counts, high noise levels, and low hit rates. Most approaches therefore focus on large specimen like entire viruses, which scatter sufficiently many photons to allow orientation determination of each image. Small specimens like proteins, however, scatter too few photons for the molecular orientations to be determined. Here, we present a rigorous Bayesian approach to overcome these limitations, additionally taking into account intensity fluctuations, beam polarization, irregular detector shapes, incoherent scattering, and background scattering. We demonstrate using synthetic scattering images that electron density determination of small proteins is possible in this extreme high noise Poisson regime. Tests on published virus data achieved the detector-limited resolution of 9 nm, using only 0.01% of the available photons per image.",

The resulting stiff scar tissue, in turn, enhances fibroblast contraction—bearing the question of how this positive feedback loop begins. We show that direct contact with profibrotic but not proinflammatory macrophages triggers acute fibroblast contractions. The contractile response depends on αvβ3 integrin expression on macrophages and Piezo1 expression on fibroblasts. The touch of macrophages elevates fibroblast cytosolic calcium within seconds, followed by translocation of the transcription cofactors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 and Yes-associated protein, which drive fibroblast activation within hours. Intriguingly, macrophages induce mechanical stress in fibroblasts on soft matrix that alone suppresses their spontaneous activation. We propose that acute contact with suitable macrophages mechanically kick-starts fibroblast activation in an otherwise nonpermissive soft environment. The molecular components mediating macrophage-fibroblast mechanotransduction are potential targets for antifibrosis strategies.",

While the proneural factor achaete-scute complex-like 1 ( Ascl1 ) is widely used for neuronal reprogramming, in the early postnatal mouse cortex, Ascl1 fails to induce the glia-to-neuron conversion, instead promoting the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC). Since Ascl1 activity is posttranslationally regulated, here, we investigated the consequences of mutating six serine phospho-acceptor sites to alanine (Ascl1SA6) on lineage reprogramming in vivo. Ascl1SA6 exhibited increased neurogenic activity in the glia of the early postnatal mouse cortex, an effect enhanced by coexpression of B cell lymphoma 2 ( Bcl2 ). Genetic fate-mapping revealed that most induced neurons originated from astrocytes, while only a few derived from OPCs. Many Ascl1SA6/Bcl2-induced neurons expressed parvalbumin and were capable of high-frequency action potential firing.

We observed that TgMIF that interacts with CD74, antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) modulates endocytosis, restoration of mitochondrial function, and macrophage polarization, respectively. These interactions promote therapeutic efficacy in mice infected with MTB, thereby presenting a potential route to host-directed therapy development. Furthermore, TgMIF, in combination with first-line TB drugs, significantly inhibited drug-resistant MTB strains, including multidrug-resistant TB.

          "abstract": "Social dominance is essential for maintaining a stable society and has both positive and negative impacts on social animals, including humans. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing social dominance, as well as the crucial regulators and biomarkers involved, remain poorly understood. We discover that mice lacking acid-sensing ion channel 2 (ASIC2) exhibit persistently higher social dominance than their wild-type cagemates. Conversely, overexpression of ASIC2 in the medial prefrontal cortex reverses the dominance hierarchy observed in ASIC2 knockout ( Asic2 −/− ) mice. Asic2 −/− neurons exhibit increased synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially mediated by protein kinase A signaling pathway. Furthermore, ASIC2 plays distinct functional roles in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, thereby modulating the balance of neuronal activities underlying social dominance behaviors—a phenomenon suggestive of a cell subtype–specific mechanism. This research lays the groundwork for understanding the mechanisms of social dominance, offering potential insights for managing social disorders, such as depression and anxiety.",

Spacetime SPP interference patterns recorded in terahertz (THz) frequency range provided unobstructed readouts of the group velocity and lifetime of polariton that can be directly mapped onto the electronic spectral weight and the relaxation rate. Our data uncovered prominent departures of the electron dynamics from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes are approximately equal.

However, few studies have assessed the reliability of the operations of the memory technology. Here, we decode the errors associated with writing and shifting domain walls using nanosecond current pulses in a ~5-micrometer-wide wire composed of a Pt/GdFeCo bilayer. We find that writing a domain wall at the edge of the wire causes a bit positioning error of ~0.3 micrometers, whereas the shifting process induces an error of ~0.1 micrometers per a 2-nanosecond-long current pulse. The error correlation among successive shifting is negligible when the current drive is sufficiently large.

Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising hybrid classical-quantum algorithm for finding the lowest-energy configuration of a molecular system. However, it typically requires many qubits and quantum gates with substantial quantum circuit depth to accurately represent the electronic wave function of complex structures. Here, we propose an alternative approach to solve the electronic structure problem using VQE with a single qudit. Our approach exploits a high-dimensional orbital angular momentum state of a heralded single photon and notably reduces the required quantum resources compared to conventional multi-qubit–based VQE. We experimentally demonstrate that our single-qudit–based VQE can efficiently estimate the ground state energy of hydrogen (H 2 ) and lithium hydride (LiH) molecular systems corresponding to two- and four-qubit systems, respectively. We believe that our scheme opens a pathway to perform a large-scale quantum simulation for solving more complex problems in quantum chemistry and material science.",

We flashed short sentences during magnetoencephalography measurement, revealing sentence-sensitive neural activity in left temporal cortex within 130 milliseconds. These signals emerged for subject-verb-object sentences regardless of grammatical or semantic well-formedness, suggesting that at-a-glance language comprehension begins by detecting basic phrase structure, independent of meaning or other grammatical details.

Currently, overdose survival relies on bystander intervention, requiring a nearby person to find the overdosed individual and have immediate access to naloxone to administer. To circumvent the bystander requirement, we developed the Naloximeter: a class of life-saving implantable devices that autonomously detect and treat overdose while simultaneously contacting first responders. We present three Naloximeter platforms, for fundamental research and clinical translation, all equipped with optical sensors, drug delivery mechanisms, and a supporting ecosystem of technology to counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression.

Because of eigenstate broadening on solid substrates, resolving low-frequency vibronic states demands strong decoupling. This work designs a type II band alignment in STM junction to achieve effective charge-transfer state decoupling. This strategy enables the successful identification of the lowest-frequency H g (ω 1 ) (Raman-active H g mode) vibronic excitation within single C 60 molecules, which, despite being notably pronounced in electron transport of C 60 single-molecule transistors, has remained hidden at submolecular level. Our results show that the observed H g (ω 1 ) excitation is “anchored” to all molecules, irrespective of local geometry, challenging common understanding of structural definition of vibronic excitation governed by Franck-Condon principle. Density functional theory calculations reveal existence of molecule-substrate interfacial charge-transfer dipole, which, although overlooked previously, drives the dominant H g (ω 1 ) excitation. This charge-transfer dipole is not specific but must be general at interfaces, influencing vibronic coupling in charge transport.",

Here, we set out to determine whether FGF21 has a major impact on Kupffer cells’ (KCs) ability during MASH-HCC transition. We found aberrant hepatic FGF21 and KC pool in human MASH-HCC. Lack of FGF21 up-regulated ALOX15, which converted the oxidized fatty acids to induce excessive KC death and mobilization of monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) for KC replacement. Lack of FGF21 oversupplied free fatty acids for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) cascade synthesis to mediate MASH-HCC transition via S1P-YAP signaling and cross-talk between tumor cells and macrophages. In conclusion, lack of FGF21 accelerated MASH-HCC transition via the S1P-AP signaling.

The qubit basis states correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the two vortex states. By engineering the potential, we tune the coupling and coherent oscillations between the two circulating current states, control the energies of the qubit basis states, and initialize the qubit in the desired state.

Here, we use murine and organoid-based models to study the role of Trp53 during epithelial reprogramming. We find that p53 signaling is silent and dispensable during homeostasis but strongly up-regulated in the epithelium upon DSS-induced colitis. While in WT cells this causes termination of the regenerative state, crypts that lack Trp53 remain locked in the highly proliferative, regenerative state long-term. The regenerative state in WT cells requires high Wnt signaling to maintain elevated levels of glycolysis. Instead, Trp53 deficiency enables Wnt-independent glycolysis due to overexpression of rate-limiting enzyme PKM2.

Among them, the quantum Hall current is a representative example. Realized in two-dimensional electronic systems under a strong magnetic field, the topological protection quantizes the Hall conductance in the unit of e 2 / h ( e , elementary charge; and h , Planck constant), of which the edge transport picture gives a good account.

Many stresses, such as telomere shortening and oncogene activation, induce senescence by damaging nuclear DNA. However, the mechanisms linking DNA damage to senescence remain unclear. Here, we show that DNA damage response (DDR) signaling to mitochondria triggers senescence. A genome-wide small interfering RNA screen implicated the outer mitochondrial transmembrane protein BNIP3 in senescence induction. We found that BNIP3 is phosphorylated by the DDR kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and contributes to an increase in the number of mitochondrial cristae. Stable isotope labeling metabolomics indicated that the increase in cristae enhances fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to acetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). This promotes histone acetylation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a . Notably, pharmacological activation of FAO alone induced senescence both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, mitochondrial energy metabolism plays a critical role in senescence induction and is a potential intervention target to control senescence.",

          "abstract": "Protein fibril surfaces tend to generate toxic oligomers catalytically. To date, efforts to study the accelerated aggregation steps involved with Alzheimer’s disease–linked amyloid-β (Aβ)–42 proteins on fibril surfaces have mainly relied on fluorophore-based analytics. Here, we visualize rare secondary nucleation events on the surface of Aβ-42 fibrils from embryonic to endpoint stages using liquid-based atomic force microscopy. Nanoscale imaging supported by atomic-scale molecular simulations tracked the adsorption and proliferation of oligomeric assemblies at nonperiodically spaced catalytic sites on the fibril surface. Upon confirming that fibril edges are preferential binding sites for oligomers during embryonic stages, the secondary fibrillar size changes were quantified during the growth stages. Notably, a small population of fibrils that displayed higher surface catalytic activity was identified as superspreaders. Profiling secondary fibrils during endpoint stages revealed a nearly threefold increase in their surface corrugation, a parameter we exploit to classify fibril subpopulations.",

          "abstract": "Insects have evolved diverse ecological flight behaviors and adaptations that played a key role in their large-scale evolutionary patterns. However, the evolution of their flight performance is poorly understood because reconstructing flight abilities of extinct insects is highly challenging. Here, we propose an integrated approach to reveal the evolution of flight performance of Palaeontinidae (giant cicadas), a Mesozoic arboreal insect clade with large bodies and wings. Our analyses unveil a faunal turnover from early to late Palaeontinidae during the latest Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous, accompanied by a morphological adaptive shift and remarkable improvement in flight abilities including increased flight speed and enhanced maneuverability. The adaptive aerodynamic evolution of Palaeontinidae may have been stimulated by the rise of early birds, supporting the hypothesis of an aerial evolutionary arms race (Air Race) between Palaeontinidae and birds. Our results provide a potential example of predator-induced morphological and behavioral macroevolution and contribute to our understanding of how powered flight has shaped animal evolution.",

          "abstract": "How CRISPR-Cas and cyclic oligonucleotide–based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) are coordinately deployed against invaders remains unclear. We show that a locus containing two CBASS and one type III-B CRISPR-Cas system, regulated by the transmembrane anti-σ DdvA and its cognate extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ DdvS, can defend Myxococcus xanthus against a phage. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals DdvA-DdvS pairs assemble as arrow-shaped transmembrane dimers. Each DdvA periplasmic domain adopts a separase/craspase-type tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)–caspase HetF–associated with TPR (TPR-CHAT) architecture with an incomplete His-Cys active site, lacking three α-helices conserved among CHAT domains. Each active site faces the dimer interface, raising the possibility that signal-induced caspase-like DdvA autoproteolysis in trans precedes RseP-mediated intramembrane proteolysis and DdvS release. Nuclear magnetic resonance reveals a DdvA cytoplasmic CHCC-type zinc-bound three-helix bundle that binds to DdvS σ 2 and σ 4 domains, undergoing σ 4 -induced helix extension to trap DdvS. Altogether, we provide structural-mechanistic insights into membrane anti–σ-ECF σ regulation of an antiviral CBASS-CRISPR-Cas defense island.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells make the decision to divide at the G 1 -S transition in response to diverse signals impinging on the retinoblastoma protein Rb, a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor. Passage through the G 1 -S transition is initially driven by Rb inactivation via phosphorylation and by Rb’s decreasing concentration in G 1 . While many studies have identified the mechanisms of Rb phosphorylation, the mechanism underlying Rb’s decreasing concentration in G 1 was unknown. Here, we found that Rb’s concentration decrease in G 1 requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. UBR5 knockout cells have increased Rb concentration in early G 1 , exhibited a lower G 1 -S transition rate, and are more sensitive to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (Cdk4/6). This last observation suggests that UBR5 inhibition can strengthen the efficacy of Cdk4/6 inhibitor–based cancer therapies.",

          "abstract": "Ex vivo or in vivo cell-hitchhiking has emerged as a potential means for efficient drug delivery and various disease therapies. However, many challenges remain, such as the complicated engineering process and dependence on ligand-receptor interaction. Here, we present a simple in vivo platelet-hitchhiking strategy based on self-assembling peptides without ligand modification. The engineered peptide nanofibers can hitchhike ultrafast (&lt;5 s) and efficiently on both resting and activated platelets in a receptor-independent and species-independent manner. Mechanistic studies showed that unique secondary structure of nanofibers, which lead to surface exposure of hydrophobic and hydrogen bond–forming groups, might primarily contribute to the selective and efficient platelet-hitchhiking behavior. After intravenous injection, these peptide nanofibers hitchhiked in situ on circulating platelets and achieved almost 20-fold lung accumulation. Our study provides not only a different paradigm of in vivo platelet-hitchhiking beyond ligand-receptor recognition but also a potential strategy for lung-targeted drug delivery and pulmonary disease therapy.",

          "abstract": "The master regulator of the DNA damage response, the transcription factor p53, orchestrates multiple downstream responses and coordinates repair processes. In response to double-strand DNA breaks, p53 exhibits pulses of expression, but how it achieves temporal coordination of downstream responses remains unclear. Here, we show that p53’s posttranslational modification state is altered between its first and second pulses of expression. We show that acetylations at two sites, K373 and K382, were reduced in the second pulse, and these acetylations differentially affected p53 target genes, resulting in changes in gene expression programs over time. This interplay between dynamics and modification may offer a strategy for cellular hubs like p53 to temporally organize multiple processes in individual cells.",

While pulsed electric field electroporation effectively permeabilizes cell membranes to deliver payloads without the need for toxic chemical or viral transduction agents, conventional bulk electroporation devices face major challenges with cell viability and heterogeneity due to variations in fields generated across cells and electrochemistry at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Here, we introduce the use of microfabricated electrodes based on the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which substantially increases cell viability and transfection efficiency. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the enhanced delivery of Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and plasmid DNA into cell lines and primary cells. This use of PEDOT:PSS enables rapid modification of difficult-to-transfect cell types to accelerate their study and use as therapeutic platforms.",

          "authors": "Peter J. Bishop, Stephanie E. Pierce",
          "abstract": "The evolutionary transition from early synapsids to therian mammals involved profound reorganization in locomotor anatomy and function, centered around a shift from “sprawled” to “erect” limb postures. When and how this functional shift was accomplished has remained difficult to decipher from the fossil record alone. Through biomechanical modeling of hindlimb force-generating performance in eight exemplar fossil synapsids, we demonstrate that the erect locomotor regime typifying modern therians did not evolve until just before crown Theria. Modeling also identifies a transient phase of increased performance in therapsids and early cynodonts, before crown mammals. Further, quantifying the global actions of major hip muscle groups indicates a protracted juxtaposition of functional redeployment and conservatism, highlighting the intricate interplay between anatomical reorganization and function across postural transitions. We infer a complex history of synapsid locomotor evolution and suggest that major evolutionary transitions between contrasting locomotor behaviors may follow highly nonlinear trajectories.",
