          "authors": "Jacob N. Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Large-scale, centrally funded measurement systems on the economy, education, the environment, and public health enable rapid scientific research and support robust policy feedback. They provide frameworks for assessing policy effectiveness, flagging emerging problems, and informing planning processes. The online information environment—a critical domain of human interaction—has not yet been similarly instrumented. This article first reviews key measurements in other domains and outlines why existing tools for studying online environments are insufficient. It then lays out the consequences of the measurement gap, identifies key data-collection tasks, discusses the scale of resources required to meet them, and addresses the implications of generative AI for the instrumentation task. I argue that modest but strategic investments in scaled measurement infrastructure could unlock transformative research capabilities and facilitate an evidence-driven approach to policymaking that could improve how we govern online spaces.",

          "authors": "Baron L. Pineda",
          "abstract": "Technological advancements in internet communications have led to changes in how young people’s behavior is monitored and shaped in their families and schools. The debate about the impacts of the rise of internet use and the creation of a new generation of digital natives is polarized: Some believe that internet restrictions on youth are undemocratic and counterproductive, and others connect internet use to social problems among youth—such as shortened attention spans, apathy, and increased vulnerability to predatory behavior. This article analyzes life history interviews of young people that focus on their use of technology and how it is regulated by their parents. I show how the social norms associated with the digital lives of youth can vary and evolve, often in unpredictable ways. This suggests that governance efforts likely need to be dynamic and capable of changing in ways that keep pace with new forms of sociality.",

          "title": "The Myths of Platform Governance: How Tech Works to Create Online Trust and Safety",
          "authors": "Sudhir Venkatesh",
          "abstract": "Platform governance is often conceptualized in terms of external rules or algorithmic systems. This article shifts the analytic focus inward, examining how governance teams within technology firms create social order through their everyday practices. Drawing on organizational sociology and cultural analysis, I argue that internal governance is shaped less by formal policy than by the underlying “myths” that structure how practitioners understand harm, responsibility, and effectiveness. These organizational myths—rooted in engineering culture and reinforced by institutional routines—shape not only how governance work is carried out, but also what counts as legitimate intervention. By analyzing the symbolic and practical dimensions of governance labor, I show how cultural logics embedded within platform teams produce specific orientations to risk, fairness, and authority. Understanding these logics is essential for researchers and practitioners seeking to explain—and ultimately influence—the ways in which social order is maintained online.",

          "authors": "Toby Shulruff",
          "abstract": "Policymakers struggle to craft effective strategies for governing online platforms. Their efforts are often referred to as attempts to regulate “black-boxed” tech in a sector that has long been described as the “Wild West.” But historical perspectives from practitioners in the trust and safety field offer a more nuanced understanding. Data from the History of Trust and Safety Project reveal that governance precedents and cross-sectoral initiatives date back at least two decades and address issues including fraud, spam, child sexual abuse material, and extremist content. This collaborative work occurred in and among government agencies, media, civil society organizations, academia, and the platforms themselves. The Wild West and black-box metaphors are not helpful points of departure for regulatory debates with decades-old precedents. Governance should be informed by what has been tried before and by a clearer understanding of the technical and social forces that have shaped the present state of play.",

          "abstract": "Platform governance that is driven by external policymakers and researchers is often disconnected from how and when technology companies actually make decisions about their products. This misalignment creates challenges for meaningful oversight and regulation, as external actors cannot see the internal processes that shape platform design and governance. This article explores the internal dynamics of product development, from prototyping through iteration, and how governance considerations are incorporated or excluded at various stages. Arguing for a reintegration of social science and academic expertise into product decision-making, I propose an updated framework that bridges external governance objectives with the realities of platform power and product design.",

          "abstract": "Social media data have become a mainstay of social science research since the first application programming interfaces (APIs) debuted in the mid-2000s. Over time, platforms have radically altered their data offerings, substantially determining the kinds of research that can be conducted. This article presents historical and normative analyses of the current state of platform data precarity, defined by Freelon (2018) as the post-API age . We recount a periodized history of social media data access spanning nearly 20 years, characterize the data access options currently offered by six prominent platforms, and make recommendations for improving platform data access. Our primary aim is to help social media researchers understand how access to social media data has evolved over the years and consider how platforms might help them conduct more rigorous research moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Prominent online platforms have recently engaged in highly visible pullbacks in their commitments to promoting purpose-driven organizational cultures and to developing diverse workforces. These changes have been framed as a move back to a profit-centered business model, but they have also been perceived as government regulation in decline. We argue that there is strong evidence that associates purpose-driven organizational cultures and diverse workforces with organizational vitality, profitability, and growth. The association holds for organizations generally but is particularly true for online platforms, whose success is linked to innovation and change. Thus, there is a strong bottom-line business argument for creating and sustaining purpose-driven organizational cultures and for developing diverse workforces, irrespective of whether they are mandated by external authorities.",

          "abstract": "Middleware is software that can give users increased control over their social media experience, allowing them to protect their privacy, customize their recommendations, and understand the spread and impact of content they create. We believe middleware could complement policy efforts and reforms made by social media platforms to improve user experiences on social media, while avoiding freedom of expression questions that plague the regulation of online platforms. We describe and examine middleware as it exists in the world, demonstrating that even while middleware is a viable solution to some contemporary problems attendant to social media, there are still open questions about who middleware helps and who it harms. We suggest Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulation of middleware and show that U.S. Code 47 section 230(b) anticipated categories of middleware that would be protective of users’ control over their online experiences.",

          "abstract": "Concerned about the power that social media now wield, a chorus of tech-minded reformers have called for a return to the internet’s foundational design principles of interoperability and end-user control. This group argues for “middleware”—online tools like browser extensions and consumer-facing protocols that would enable people to take control of their online experiences across the web. This article argues that the campaign for middleware is laudable but mostly speculative and inapposite. It proceeds on the disproven theory that consumers can control their online experiences in today’s networked information economy. As such, it distracts reformers from solutions that would redress the structural asymmetries that define today’s market for consumer-facing services, including social media. This article argues that it is time to give up the illusory promise of user control and attend above all to enacting enforceable restrictions on service designs and commercial surveillance practices.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of user engagement has dominated debate over the governance of online platforms, and critics use the term to assign crass commercial interests to social media companies. We argue that social media engagement is a multifaceted ideal that serves both economic and ideological functions for platforms. We show how Facebook’s early leadership used the concept to reconcile the competing demands of expansion, revenue generation, and community-building. In doing so, they synthesized three distinct ideas: the Silicon Valley belief that network expansion correlated with network strength , the ad industry’s contention that media should promote emotional investment from viewers, and the academic claim that civic participation is the most important democratic virtue. Even as the contradictions that these claims yield have come to the foreground, the multiple logics of engagement have proven difficult to evade, and it continues to shape discussions of platform governance.",

          "abstract": "I examine the relationship between social media platforms and news organizations as it has evolved over the past two decades, showing that platform governance has affected individual users and news publishers in ways that often result in damage to democratic societies. I argue that the contraction of traditional journalism and rise of democratic backsliding around the globe call for a reconsideration of platform governance models that might help to reinvigorate news production. A better synthesis of traditional journalism’s public interest values and social media’s engagement model requires a restructuring of platform algorithms that focuses on long-term user value, enhanced press freedom protections, and renewed economic support for news production. Supporting news represents a global imperative as democratic stability becomes increasingly threatened, social media companies come under increasing strain and scrutiny as public actors, and generative AI further imperils news production.",

          "abstract": "Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems1, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave’s cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs2. Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks3, our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning4 and lattice protein folding5—benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP—traditionally used in optical communications—within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.",

Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project 1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.",

          "abstract": "Spared regions of the damaged central nervous system undergo dynamic remodelling and exhibit a remarkable potential for therapeutic exploitation1. Lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), which interact with viable neurons and glia, undergo reactive transformations whose molecular and functional properties are poorly understood2. Here, using multiple transcriptional profiling methods, we investigated LRAs from spared regions of mouse spinal cord following traumatic spinal cord injury. We show that LRAs acquire a spectrum of molecularly distinct, neuroanatomically restricted reactivity states that evolve after spinal cord injury. We identify transcriptionally unique reactive LRAs in degenerating white matter that direct the specification and function of local microglia that clear lipid-rich myelin debris to promote tissue repair. Fuelling this LRA functional adaptation is the secreted matricellular protein CCN1. Loss of astrocyte-derived CCN1 results in excessive, aberrant activation of local microglia, characterized by abnormal molecular specification, impaired debris processing reflected by the intracellular accumulation of myelin and axon debris, and dysregulated lipid metabolism with distinctive attenuation in lipid droplet accumulation. Mechanistically, we find that CCN1 binds microglial SDC4 to augment lipid storage, linking this signalling axis to a vital repair-associated lipid buffering response in debris-clearing microglia. Accordingly, microglial deficits resulting from astrocyte CCN1 depletion culminate in blunted clearance of white matter debris and impaired neurological recovery from spinal cord injury. Ccn1-expressing white matter astrocytes are induced by local myelin damage and are generated in diverse demyelinating disorders in mice and humans, pointing to their fundamental, evolutionarily conserved role in white matter repair. Our findings show that context-specific cues shape regionally distinct LRA reactivity states with functional adaptations that orchestrate multicellular processes underlying neural repair and influence disease outcome.",

This study assessed the efficacy and safety of mazdutide versus dulaglutide in participants with T2D on background oral anti-diabetic drugs. In this randomised phase 3 study, 731 participants with T2D were randomised 1:1:1 to receive mazdutide 4 mg, mazdutide 6 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg for 28 weeks. Both mazdutide doses demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to dulaglutide 1.5 mg in mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28, with the least squares (LS) mean treatment difference of −0.24% (p=0.0032) for mazdutide 4 mg and −0.30% (p=0.0003) for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Significantly greater weight reductions were achieved with mazdutide versus dulaglutide, with LS mean treatment difference of −3.78% for mazdutide 4 mg and −5.76% for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide (both p<0.0001). Moreover, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7.0% with ≥5% weight reduction vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg at week 28 (both p<0.0001). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Our findings showed that 28-week treatment with mazdutide (4 mg and 6 mg) provided superior reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in Chinese participants with T2D. Mazdutide was generally safe, with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than dulaglutide.",

          "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and facilitate the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by exchanging GDP for GTP1. This exchange function is not unidirectional2. Here we demonstrate that an agonist can show selective affinity for an active state that prefers the release of GTP. Specifically, for the mu opioid receptor, we show that several agonists have state-selective affinities for promoting GTP release versus GTP binding. We identify two agonists that show a marked preference for promoting release. In mice, marginally efficacious doses of the release-preferring agonist enhance and prolong the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl without enhancing the respiratory and cardiac effects of fentanyl. Although these observations are limited to simple measures of thermal nociception, they may point to a way to bifurcate physiological responses to such agonists. We propose that the active-state selectivity of an agonist may determine the preferred direction of the receptor GEF function, which may affect the kinetics and selectivity of the engagement of the receptor with downstream effectors; this may ultimately present a means to disentangle multifaceted drug-induced physiological responses.",

In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration 2,3 , in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids 4–6 , we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.",

Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons and nuclei3. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches4, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, 227AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for 227AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by 3 orders of magnitude.

Here we assess palaeometabolomes from fossilized mammalian hard tissues as a molecular ecological strategy to provide evidence of an ancient organism’s relationship with its environment. From eastern, central and southern African Plio-Pleistocene localities of palaeoanthropological significance, we study six fossils from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, one from the Chiwondo Beds, Malawi, and one from Makapansgat, South Africa. We perform endogeneity assessments by analysing palaeometabolomes of palaeosols and the effects of owl digestion on rodent bones to enable prudent ecological inferences. Diagenesis is indicated by metabolites of collagenase-producing bacteria2, whereas the preservation of peptides including those of collagen are identified by proteomics. Endogenous metabolites document biological functions and exogenous metabolites render environmental details including soil characteristics and woody cover, and enable annual minimum and maximum rainfall and temperature reconstructions at Olduvai Gorge, supporting the freshwater woodland and grasslands of Olduvai Gorge Bed I3,4,5, and the dry woodlands and marsh of Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II6. All sites denote wetter and/or warmer conditions than today. We infer that metabolites preserved in hard tissues derive from an extravasated vasculature serum filtrate that becomes entombed within developing mineralized matrices, and most probably survive palaeontological timeframes in the nanoscopic ‘pool’ of structural-bound water that occurs in hard tissue niches7.",

Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility 1,3–5 . Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8 + infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments 6,7 . These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations.",

          "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts 1,2 . The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen (H2) will play a part in decarbonizing the global energy system1. However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 ± 4 (refs. 2,3,4,5). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H2 use under future hydrogen economies3,5. A comprehensive accounting of H2 sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H2 sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020. H2 sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H2 production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H2. Estimated global H2 sources and sinks averaged 69.9 ± 9.4 Tg yr−1 and 68.4 ± 18.1 Tg yr−1, respectively, for 2010–2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H2, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H2 between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 ± 0.006 °C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H2 in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01–0.05 °C, depending on H2 usage, leakage rates and CH4 emissions that influence photochemical H2 production.",

          "abstract": "The growing demand for advanced materials, miniaturized devices and integrated microsystems calls for the reliable fabrication of complex, multiscale, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, a need increasingly addressed through light-based and laser-based processes. However, owing to the field-of-view (FOV) limitations of conventional imaging optics, existing 3D laser nanofabrication techniques face fundamental challenges in throughput, proximity error and stitching defects on the path to scaling. Here we present a scalable 3D nanofabrication platform that uses a metalens-generated focal spot array to parallelize two-photon lithography (TPL)1 beyond centimetre-scale write field areas. Metalenses are ideally suited for producing submicron-scale focal spots for high-throughput nanolithography, as they uniquely feature large numerical apertures (NAs), immersion media compatibility and large-scale manufacturability. We experimentally demonstrate a printing system that uses a 12-cm2 metalens array to produce more than 120,000 cooperative focal spots, corresponding to a throughput exceeding 108 voxels s−1. By programmatically patterning the focal spot array using a spatial light modulator (SLM), an adaptive parallel printing strategy is developed for precise greyscale linewidth modulation and choreographed printing of semiperiodic and fully aperiodic 3D geometries. We demonstrate parallel printing of replicated microstructures (>50 M microparticles per day), centimetre-scale 3D architectures with feature sizes down to 113 nm, and photonic and mechanical metamaterials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D nanolithography towards wafer-scale production, showing how TPL could be used at scale for applications in microelectronics2, biomedicine3, quantum technology4 and high-energy laser targets5,6.",

Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases1,2, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for co-propagating modes and induce unexpected edge valley polarization, which differs from the bulk. Although some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes scanning tunnelling microscopy as a promising tool for exploring the edge physics of the rapidly expanding group of two-dimensional topological phases, including recently realized fractional Chern insulators.",

At week 24, mazdutide significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (primary endpoint): -1.57% with mazdutide 4 mg and -2.15% with mazdutide 6 mg, versus -0.14% with placebo, with treatment differences of -1.43% and -2.02% (both p <0.0001). Significant weight loss at week 24 occurred with -5.61% (4 mg) and -7.81% (6 mg) versus -1.26% (placebo) (both p<0.0001).

The most common adverse events—diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and nausea—were consistent with GLP-1R agonists.

          "abstract": "Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds 1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control 3 . By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control 4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms 5 . An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.",

          "abstract": "The Cassini mission provided unprecedented insights into Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from its atmosphere to the deep interior1. The moon’s large measured response to the tides exerted by Saturn was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a subsurface ocean2,3. This response, twice the value predicted in pre-Cassini studies, has escaped complete explanation. Here we show that the signature of tidal dissipation in Titan’s gravity field is not consistent with the presence of an ocean. Our results arise from the detection of this signature through a reanalysis of the radiometric data acquired by Cassini with improved techniques. We found that substantial energy is being dissipated in the interior (approximately 3–4 TW, corresponding to a tidal quality factor Q ≈ 5), consistent with recent studies of Titan’s rotational state4. Because the presence of a liquid layer reduces the tidal dissipation generated below it5, these new measurements preclude the existence of a subsurface ocean on Titan and are explained by a model in which dissipation is concentrated in a high-pressure ice layer close to its melting point. This model also reproduces Titan’s observed rotational state and static gravity field self-consistently, reconciling all available geophysical measurements. Efficient ice shell convection can prevent widespread melting and ocean formation, but a slushy high-pressure ice layer is consistent with expectations6, indicating that it probably hosts liquid water pockets.

Furthermore, among those 70 years of age or older, ADNCs were present in 60% of people with dementia, in 32.6% of those with mild cognitive impairment and in 23.5% of the cognitively unimpaired group.

          "abstract": "Neural circuits in many brain regions are refined by experience. Sensory circuits support higher plasticity at younger ages during critical periods—times of circuit refinement and maturation—and limit plasticity in adulthood for circuit stability1,2. How astrocytes, a glial subtype, maintain these differing plasticity levels, and whether they stabilize the properties of sensory circuits in adulthood, remain largely unclear. Here we take a comprehensive approach to address these questions and establish astrocytes as key orchestrators of circuit stability. Combining a transcriptomic approach with ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo imaging, we identify that astrocytes release CCN1 (refs. 3,4) to maintain synapse and circuit stability in the adult visual cortex. Overexpressing CCN1 in astrocytes during the critical period promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons, limits ocular dominance plasticity and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Conversely, knocking out astrocyte CCN1 in adults destabilizes binocular circuits and reduces myelination. This establishes CCN1 as an astrocyte-secreted factor that stabilizes neuronal circuits by coordinating the maturation state of multiple cell types, and demonstrates that the composition and properties of sensory circuits require ongoing maintenance in adulthood, and that these maintenance cues are provided by astrocytes.",

          "abstract": "The human reproductive tract is essential for species perpetuation and overall health. Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility 1–5 . Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.",

          "authors": "Dalmeet Singh Chawla",
          "abstract": "The difficulty of detecting AI-tool use in peer review is proving problematic.Credit: BrianAJackson/iStock via Getty\n\nIt’s almost impossible to know whether a peer-review report has been generated by artificial intelligence, according to a study that put AI-detecting tools to the test.\n\nA research team based in China used the Claude 2.0 large language model (LLM), created by Anthropic, an AI company in San Francisco, California, to generate peer-review reports and other types of documentation for 20 published cancer-biology papers from the journal eLife1. The journal’s publisher makes papers freely available online as ‘reviewed preprints’, and publishes them alongside their referee reports and the original unedited manuscripts.\n\nThe authors fed the original versions into Claude and prompted it to generate referee reports. The team then compared the AI-generated reports with the genuine ones published by eLife.\n\nThe AI-written reviews “looked professional, but had no specific, deep feedback”, says Lingxuan Zhu, an oncologist at the Southern Medical University in Lianyungang, China, and a co-author of the study. “This made us realize that there was a serious problem.”\n\nThe study found that Claude could write plausible citation requests (suggesting papers that authors could add to their reference lists) and convincing rejection recommendations (made when reviewers think a journal should reject a submitted paper). The latter capability raises the risk of journals rejecting good papers, says Zhu. “An editor cannot be an expert in everything. If they receive a very persuasive AI-written negative review, it could easily influence their decision.”\n\nThe study also found that the majority of the AI reports fooled the detection tools: ZeroGPT erroneously classified 60% as written by a human, and GPTzero concluded this for more than 80%.\n\nDiffering opinions\n\nA growing challenge for journals is the fact that LLMs could be used in many ways to produce a referee report. What is deemed an ‘acceptable’ use of AI also differs depending on whom you ask. In a survey of some 5,000 researchers conducted by Nature earlier this year, 66% of respondents said it wasn’t appropriate to use generative AI to create reviewer reports from scratch. But 57% said it was acceptable to use it to help with peer review by getting it to answer questions about papers.\n\nAnd although AI-detection tools are improving, they struggle to determine how much of a document has been generated using AI. An analysis published last year of referee reports that were submitted to four computer-science conferences estimated that 17% had been substantially modified by chatbots2. It’s not clear, however, whether the referees used AI to improve the reports or to write them entirely.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nJeroen Verharen, a neuroscientist at the firm iota Biosciences in Alameda, California, says he is surprised that the AI detectors used by Zhu and his team weren’t better at spotting the AI-written referee reports.\n\nBut he adds that AI-written reports and associated materials are unlikely to become a widespread problem. If reviewers don’t want to review, he says, “they would just say no”.\n\nConversely, Mikołaj Piniewski, a hydrologist at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, argues that it is a growing issue. He says he has already received referee reports that he suspects were written by AI.\n\n“LLMs are increasingly being used by peer reviewers, although this is rarely disclosed,” he says. “When I spoke to my colleagues in the field of hydrology, it became clear that each of us had encountered at least one such case as an author in the past two years. At least one of the review reports we received looked very suspicious, and the AI-detection tools we used flagged it as potentially generated by LLMs.”\n\nPiniewski adds that he is sure some journal editors are accepting AI-generated referee reports, unwittingly or otherwise. He suggests that a global shortage of peer reviewers could be causing some editors to be more lenient than they should be. “I’m afraid it is largely driven by convenience,” he says.",

          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "In just the first weeks of Donald Trump’s second presidency, his administration embarked on making radical changes to US science.\n\nOfficials appointed by the new president started firing thousands of researchers and other government employees. At the same time, it cut billions of dollars of US support for global-health programmes, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It arrested some scholars from outside the United States as it stepped up efforts to restrict entry into the country and limit political speech. Over the next few months, the US government took steps to exert unprecedented control over universities by withholding federal research funding. The administration cancelled tens of billions of dollars in research grants to universities to force the adoption of policies on hiring and admissions, policing of campuses, curricula and other factors.\n\nDespite all the negatives, 2025 showcased the power, resilience and universality of science\n\nThe administration has justified its actions by saying that they were necessary to improve science and innovation. “The Trump administration is committed to cutting taxpayer funding of left-wing pet projects that are masquerading as ‘scientific research’ and restoring the American people’s confidence in our scientific and public-health bodies that was lost during the COVID era,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to Nature.\n\nBut critics of the administration see these actions as part of a broader plan to bend science for political purposes. “The attack on science must be seen as one component of a larger attack on information, on facts, on independent analysis,” says John Holdren, a physicist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who worked as the science adviser to former US president Barack Obama. “I think Trump sees science as the fortress of the opposition.”\n\nDuring Trump’s previous term in office, he encountered resistance from people in his own administration as well as from members of his own party in Congress, which rejected his calls to slash funding for science agencies. This time, that kind of opposition has been more limited, even as his administration ignored spending laws enacted by Congress, which holds the power to decide government funding.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nBut some people and institutions have fought the government over such changes. Harvard University sued the Trump administration after it cancelled billions of dollars in grants amid claims that Harvard had failed to combat campus antisemitism. Several lawsuits have been filed challenging both the administration’s firing of employees and its cancellation of grants. Climate scientists pushed back against the administration’s efforts to deny the threat of global warming. And six former surgeons general who served during both Republican and Democrat administrations published an article in The Washington Post criticizing Trump’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. They wrote that he was “endangering the health of the nation” by amplifying misinformation and undermining public confidence in medicine and the very public-health agency that he oversees — the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which includes the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest biomedical funder.\n\n“The consequences aren’t abstract,” the surgeons general wrote. “They are measured in lives lost, disease outbreaks and an erosion of public trust that will take years to rebuild.”\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science",

Next year, it will observe the Sun during its peak activity phase.Credit: Indian Space Research Organisation via AP/Alamy\nAI for science\n\nResearch powered by artificial intelligence made leaps this year, and it is here to stay. AI ‘agents’ that integrate several large language models (LLMs) to carry out complex, multi-step processes are likely to be used more widely, some with little human oversight. The coming year might even bring the first consequential scientific advances made by AI. But heavier use could also expose serious failures in some systems. Researchers have already reported errors that AI agents are prone to, such as the deletion of data.\n\nNext year will also bring techniques that move beyond LLMs, which are expensive to train. Newer approaches focus on designing small-scale AI models that learn from a limited pool of data and can specialize in solving specific reasoning puzzles. These systems do not generate text, but process mathematical representations of information. This year, one such tiny AI model beat massive LLMs at a logic test.\n\nGene-editing momentum\n\nNext year could see the launch of two clinical trials to develop personalized gene therapies for children with rare genetic disorders. The efforts expand on the treatment of KJ Muldoon, a baby boy with a rare metabolic disorder who received a CRIPSR therapy tailored to correct his specific disease-causing mutation.\n\nThe team that treated Muldoon plans to seek approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to run a clinical trial in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that will test gene-editing therapies in more children with rare metabolic disorders. These conditions are caused by variants in seven genes that can be addressed with the same type of gene editing as was used in Muldoon’s therapy. Another team hopes to begin a similar trial for genetic disorders of the immune system next year.\n\nArtemis II crew members Victor Glover, Reid Wiseman, Christina Koch and Jeremy Hansen with the Orion crew module.Credit: NASA\nMassive trial\n\nA UK clinical trial of a single blood test that detects around 50 types of cancer before symptoms begin is expected to report results next year. The test screens for bits of DNA that cancer cells release into the blood, and can home in on the tissue type or organ that the signal comes from. The trial involved more than 140,000 participants, and if the results are promising, UK health authorities plan to roll out the tool across hospitals.\n\nIn April, the biggest regulatory update to clinical trials in the United Kingdom in two decades will come into force. Under the new rules, researchers can seek ethics and regulatory approval in one application. But the law also mandates that all trials involving medicines be publicly registered before recruiting their first participant and that a summary of results be published within 12 months of the end of the trial. The goal is to speed up research, boost the diversity of trial participants and reduce the time it takes for promising treatments to reach the people who need them.\n\nMeanwhile, changes proposed by the FDA this month that would require a single clinical trial, rather than two, for new drugs to be approved will continue to unfold in 2026.\n\nHeavy lunar traffic\n\nNext year is set to be another busy one for Moon missions. NASA’s Artemis II will send four astronauts to fly around the Moon aboard the Orion spacecraft. The ten-day flight is the first crewed lunar mission since the 1970s and will help to prepare for subsequent missions to land on the Moon.\n\nChina is also preparing to launch the next in its series of lunar probes, Chang’e-7, in August. The mission will use a hopper spacecraft with shock-absorbing capabilities. It aims to arrive near the south pole — a rock- and crater-strewn region known for being challenging to land on. In 2023, India’s Chandrayaan-3 was the first spacecraft to successfully touch down near the lunar south pole. If it achieves a successful landing, Chang’e-7 will hunt for water ice and study moonquakes.\n\nThe payload module of ESA’s PLATO spacecraft — due to launch in 2026 — undergoes tests in a thermal vacuum chamber.Credit: ESA-Remedia\nMartian moons and beyond\n\nResearchers are also turning their eyes to Mars, with Japan planning to launch its Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission to visit the red planet’s two moons, Phobos and Deimos. The spaceship will collect samples of Phobos’s surface and return them to Earth in 2031, which has never been done before.\n\nThe European Space Agency is planning to launch its planet-hunting satellite PLATO towards the end of next year. Equipped with 26 cameras, PLATO will monitor more than 200,000 bright stars and identify ‘Earth twin’ planets with temperatures that allow liquid water to form.\n\nIndia’s first solar mission, Aditya-L1, will observe the Sun during solar maximum, the peak of a roughly 11-year activity cycle, marked by the highest rates of sunspots, flares and solar storms. The satellite has been sitting in a halo orbit, which allows continuous observation of the Sun, about 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, since last year. Its data will help researchers to build a better picture of the Sun’s surface during the solar maximum.\n\nDrill, baby, drill\n\nNext year, China’s ocean-drilling ship Meng Xiang is expected to embark on its first scientific expedition. The vessel is designed to drill up to 11 kilometres through oceanic crust into Earth’s mantle and collect samples. The work will help researchers to learn about how the ocean floor forms and what drives its tectonic activity.\n\nThe Meng Xiang, China’s deep-ocean drilling vessel, is designed to drill through Earth’s crust into the mantle.Credit: Liu Dawei/Xinhua via Alamy",

Neves Valente, who was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, on 18 December, is also thought to have killed two students and injured nine others at Brown University on 13 December. Foley said Neves Valente attended Brown University in the early 2000s and attended the same academic programme in Portugal as Loureiro between 1995 and 2000.\n\nScientists have expressed their shock and sadness following the death of plasma physicist Nuno Loureiro, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who was shot at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday.\n\nThe scientist died from his injuries on Tuesday morning after being shot multiple times. Police say they are investigating his death and treating it as a homicide. Loureiro’s death is the second US university-related tragedy in a week, after two people were killed and nine others were injured in a shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on Saturday.\n\nAt the time of his death, Loureiro had been the head of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, a position he held since May last year. The laboratory hosts more than 250 scientists. This year, Loureiro was given the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which is bestowed on researchers who show exceptional potential for leadership.\n\nLoureiro was a “brilliant scientist”, who was sharp, kind and had a smart sense of humour, says Stanislav Boldyrev, a plasma physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who began working with Loureiro in 2017. “It’s a privilege to have a friend like him,” Boldyrev adds. “He was so interested in science, it was almost contagious.”\n\n“He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner,” said Dennis Whyte, former director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, in a statement.\n\nLoureiro was passionate about the potential for fusion as a clean power source and about teaching a new generation of scientists, say colleagues. He thought “that we are really progressing towards finally having electricity from fusion”, says Bruno Soares Gonçalves, a plasma physicist and president of the Institute of Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion in Lisbon, where Loureiro worked until he moved to MIT in 2016.\n\n“People in the community are so shocked and extremely saddened,” he says.\n\nNuno Loureiro was a theoretical physicist who was helping to develop clean-energy fusion devices. Credit: Jake Belcher/MIT\n'Doing what he loved'\n\nLoureiro grew up in Portugal and obtained his PhD in physics at Imperial College London in 2005. He worked in the United Kingdom and Portugal before starting at MIT in 2016. The move was a huge opportunity for Loureiro, which he was eager to take, says Gonçalves. He was “doing what he loved in the place where he was really keen to be”.\n\nLoureiro’s work focused on modelling and understanding turbulence in plasma, the super-hot, exotic state of matter composed of charged particles that makes up stars and could one day power fusion reactors on Earth. He studied how plasma behaves inside fusion chambers, particularly its tendency to become unstable, to optimize the operation of future devices.",

          "abstract": "A quantum computer. The administration of US President Donald Trump has announced sizable spending prorammes for quantum information science and artificial intelligence.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nFor much of US science, 2025 was a year of cancelled grants and budget anxiety — but a few fortunate fields came out ahead. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, artificial intelligence and quantum information science have sat at the top of his administration’s scientific priorities. And they don’t seem to be leaving any time soon.\n\nTrump has ordered his advisers to ensure that the nation is “the unrivaled world leader” in AI and quantum information. The subjects are listed first and second on the administration’s list of research and development priorities. And on 11 December, Trump signed an executive order preventing US states from regulating AI, with the goal of speeding the technology’s development.\n\nBut some researchers question the effectiveness of the administration’s programmes to promote quantum science and AI. And some argue that the administration’s strategies might be hampered by some of its other policy changes.\n\nHere Nature examines three ways in which the administration aims to move quantum science and AI forwards.\n\nFunding opportunities\n\nTrump’s budget proposal for the NSF in 2026 largely spared quantum science and AI, with a 3% increase in AI funding and a 0.4% increase in spending on quantum science — in contrast to cancelled research grants and proposals for steep cuts in many other areas. And throughout 2025, both the NSF and the Department of Energy (DoE) have announced new investments in AI and quantum science, such as $100 million for AI projects at five US universities.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nSteven Rolston, a quantum physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park and chair of the university’s physics department, says that the disparity between fields is visible there: faculty members in fields such as particle astrophysics face deep uncertainty about how much funding they’ll receive and how often they’ll have to reapply for awards. For quantum research, however, the biggest change is that the grant cycle has slowed down because of a US government shutdown and agency staffing changes. “I sort of have survivor’s guilt here,” Rolston says.\n\nBut quantum science and AI have not been immune to grant cuts. According to data from the non-profit website Grant Witness, NSF has cancelled 101 grants that mention ’artificial intelligence’ in their abstracts, and 68 grants that mention ‘quantum’ in their abstracts.\n\nAnd although AI and quantum science escaped massive cuts, the administration’s funding increases for these areas “are negligible in scope”, says David Schatsky, an AI policy researcher at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The 2026 budget doesn’t reflect — in dollar terms — an increase in focus or commitment to AI and quantum.” The NSF declined Nature’s request for comment, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) did not respond.\n\nJoining forces\n\nTo pursue its priorities, the administration is also promoting both new and existing public–private partnerships, most prominently through an initiative called the Genesis Mission that was announced in November. The project, headed by the DoE, will make scientific data sets from the 17 US national laboratories available to private companies and academic researchers, who will use that data to build AI models to accelerate scientific research. Among the companies that have signed up to collaborate with federal researchers are Microsoft, IBM and OpenAI.\n\nIf the AI bubble bursts, what will it mean for research?\n\nThe administration has promoted public–private partnerships in quantum science as well. Under the National Quantum Initiative, which began during the first Trump administration, quantum-information research centres at five national labs partner with private quantum companies to create prototypes and test new technology. The DoE made an extra $625-million investment in the programme this year, and an executive order outlining the administration’s overarching approach to quantum science is expected soon, says Constanza Vidal Bustamante, a quantum-technology policy researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC.",

Credit: Chen Kun/VCG via Getty\n\nThe biggest science story this year was the political upheaval in the United States. Funding cuts, academic lay-offs and vaccine-sceptic policies have widely been seen as an attack on science, according to critics of President Donald Trump’s administration. The resulting damage to science could last way into the future.\n\nBut, there were also plenty of positive developments in 2025 that offer hope for the coming years. “From a non-US scientist, it’s somewhat business as usual. You just keep doing your job,” says Glen Peters, a climate-policy researcher at the Cicero Center for International Climate Research in Oslo.\n\nOur recent Nature’s 10 package includes many good news stories — and there were many more. From gene-editing firsts to rapid disease containment and policy victories, Nature takes a look at some positive science stories of 2025.\n\nNature’s 10: Ten people who shaped science in 2025\n\nSpecies recovery\n\nThis year saw populations of some endangered and near-extinct species bounce back owing to strong conservation efforts.\n\nThe green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), which has been endangered since the 1980s, has now moved to ‘least concern’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Efforts to protect the turtle’s eggs and measures to prevent their accidental capture in fishing nets have allowed populations to recover.\n\nThe ampurta (Dasycercus hillieri), a rat-sized Australian marsupial, moved from near-extinction to ‘least concern’ this year. Between 2015 and 2021, ampurta territory expanded by more than 48,000 square kilometres, despite dry conditions and food shortages.\n\nLastly, nations reached a historic milestone for marine conservation in September with the United Nations High Seas Treaty receiving approval from more than 60 countries. The treaty, which will come into effect in January, aims to legally protect biodiversity in international waters and conserve at least 30% of land and sea areas.\n\nOzone hole shrinks\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since 2019, indicating the continued recovery of Earth’s protective upper atmosphere.\n\nThe ozone hole was first discovered in 1985 and is a result of human-emitted ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as coolants in refrigerators and aerosol sprays. The Montreal Protocol in 1987 phased out the production and use of CFCs, which has successfully curbed emissions1. Since 1987, the average size of the ozone hole throughout the year has been gradually decreasing in size, with the smallest so far in 2019.\n\nThe ozone hole is on track to recover completely in the late 2060s, provided efforts to find climate-friendly alternatives to CFCs continues.\n\nThe hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has continued to shrink.Credit: CAMS\nGene-editing successes\n\nThis year “was a breakthrough year for gene editing”, says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “In 2025, these technologies have achieved a number of medical milestones.”\n\n“I view this year as an outstanding one, marked by the launch of many clinical trials,” adds Annarita Miccio, who studies gene therapy at the Imagine Institute at the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.\n\nHuntington’s disease treated for the first time using gene therapy\n\nThe first gene therapy for Huntington’s disease proved striking, slowing the rate of cognitive decline in participants by 75%. Another gene-therapy trial — for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia — showed promise with the majority of 11 participating children and adults entering remission2. The new type of CAR-T-cell therapy uses base-editing technology to modify several genes in T cells, helping them to target the cancer cells.\n\nResearchers also trialled the first use of a CRISPR technology tailored to an individual this year. Other successes include the first clinical trial for a gene therapy to treat a rare immune disorder called chronic granulomatous disease3, and another that corrected a pathogenic mutation that can cause lung damage and liver disease4.\n\nThese clinical trials paved the way for developing mutation-specific strategies for rare diseases and demonstrated that collaboration between academia and industry can lead to cures for people with such diseases, says Miccio.\n\nRenewable-energy boost\n\nRenewable energy surpassed coal as the largest energy source for the first time globally this year. The achievement was helped by China becoming the first country in the world to install 1 terawatt of solar power capacity in May. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity of 256 gigawatts — twice as much as the rest of the world combined. The country plans to add a further 200–300 gigawatts of capacity for solar and wind energy in its five year plan beginning in 2026.\n\nWhat happened at COP30? 4 science take-homes from the climate summit\n\n“China and many developing countries are deploying solar and wind [and] electric vehicles at pretty breakneck pace,” says Peters.\n\nAround half of the European Union’s demand for electricity came from from renewables in the second and third quarters of this year. Renewable-energy capacity is projected to increase by almost 4,600 gigawatts between 2025 and 2030 — double the capacity deployed between 2019 and 2024.\n\nHowever, greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels reached a new high this year. It remains to be seen whether renewable energy can replace fossil fuels as the dominant global energy sources.\n\nEbola contained",

Credit: Simon Maina/AFP via Getty\n\nThe United States is rolling out bilateral health agreements across Africa under its America First Global Health Strategy. Its announcement on 4 December of a US$1.6-billion health agreement with Kenya was the first, and signals a shift in how the United States intends to engage with African health systems. Rather than strengthening relevant continental bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the strategy leans towards one-to-one agreements between governments.\n\nThe timing could not be more delicate. It follows the United States’ withdrawal of funding from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the WHO, two international health institutions that African governments rely on for vaccines, coordination and technical support, and the importance of which in the region has grown since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfrica finally has its own drug-regulation agency — and it could transform the continent’s health\n\nDuring the pandemic, countries across Africa faced devastating delays in accessing vaccines, medical supplies and diagnostic tools. Front-line responders and laboratories struggled. Surveillance systems had uneven coverage. Outbreak information moved too slowly. Countries negotiated alone for tools they needed but could not secure.\n\nIn 2022, led by the Africa CDC, African leaders endorsed a New Public Health Order to build continent-wide systems to protect everyone, not just the states with the most leverage. One example is the Continental Cholera Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan for Africa. Developed by the Africa CDC and the WHO, and endorsed by heads of state in August, it outlines how countries should respond to cholera as a single coordinated unit.\n\nThe plan establishes one team, one plan, one budget and one monitoring framework. It describes how responders can deploy from one country to another rapidly; how national laboratories with sequencing capacity can support testing for neighbours with fewer resources; and how information should flow seamlessly across borders so that no outbreak is hidden by a lack of capacity.\n\nCould Africa be the future for genomics research?\n\nAnother example is Africa’s Health Security and Sovereignty Agenda, which was outlined by the Africa CDC in November. It includes stronger mandates for the CDC, harmonized regulatory pathways, expansion of regional manufacturing and cross-border surveillance systems built on shared data.\n\nBy contrast, the America First Global Health Strategy prioritizes bilateral health agreements with individual governments, with limited reference to the role of continental bodies. It creates space for parallel systems that might not connect to Africa’s surveillance networks or regulatory structures. This shift raises three concerns.",

But there were also unexpected differences, including higher disease rates than anticipated in individuals older than 85.\n\n“This is very important work from a beautiful Norwegian study,” says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris who was not involved in the research. The study, published today in Nature, shows that blood-based tools can improve epidemiological estimates of neurodegenerative disease.\n\nBlood tests are now approved for Alzheimer’s: how accurate are they?\n\nBut exactly how to use these tests remains controversial, warns Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Blood-based markers can be helpful for physicians treating people with dementia and for answering research questions, but they aren’t ready to be rolled out widely as health screening tools.\n\n“It is the kind of test that, in the wrong hands, could cause a lot of harm,” says Karlawish, who was not involved in the study.\n\nFrom blood to brain\n\nTo assess the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an international team of researchers turned to the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study, a prospective research study that started in 1984 and that has collected health data and biological samples from 250,000 Norwegians.\n\nUsing blood samples from 11,486 individuals in the study aged 58 and above, the team looked at levels of a protein, called tau, that has been phosphorylated at a specific site. Known as pTau217, this blood marker serves as a proxy for the build-up of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of AD. HUNT-study participants over the age of 70 have undergone cognitive testing, enabling the researchers to compare pTau217 levels with the presence of dementia.\n\nAround 10% of participants over the age of 70 had dementia and AD pathology, showing both cognitive impairment and high pTau217, they report. Another 10% had mild cognitive impairments and high pTau217. And 10% had high pTau217 but no signs of cognitive impairment, which the authors refer to as preclinical AD.\n\nThese findings are broadly in line with expectations, but there were surprises, too.\n\nSome 25% of people aged 85–89 had dementia and AD pathology, up from previous estimates of around 7% for men and 13% for women in this age group in Western Europeans3. And the incidence of preclinical AD in younger individuals was 8% in those aged 70–74, down from a previous estimate of around 22%.\n\nAnders Gustavsson, a member of the team that compiled the earlier estimates, welcomes the latest data. “I’m not surprised that this study gets somewhat different numbers,” says Gustavsson, who is an adviser to the health-economics consultancy Quantify Research in Stockholm.\n\nAlzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day\n\nThe discrepancies probably reflect selection bias, says study co-author Anita Lenora Sunde, a physician and dementia researcher at Stavanger University Hospital in Norway. Previous estimates were made by recruiting participants for brain scans, and people with dementia might not have wanted to or been able to participate.\n\nBut other factors could also be at play, says Villain. The latest study uses a high pTau217 threshold to define its preclinical AD population, and so excludes people with intermediate levels of the protein and emerging pathology.\n\n“If you lower the threshold, the prevalence suddenly increases,” says Villain.\n\nThe value of education\n\nThe study also found that people with lower education levels have higher pTau217 levels.",

          "abstract": "The National Science Foundation, one of the world’s largest funders of basic science, has reduced the minimum number of external reviews that grant proposals must undergo.Credit: Briscoe Savoy for Nature\n\nThe US National Science Foundation (NSF) is relaxing some of its requirements for the review of grant proposals in an effort to cope with a backlog of applications and reduced staff numbers. Staff members at the agency, one of the world’s leading funders of basic science, say that the new strategy could have benefits, but raises the risk of grant applications being inadequately reviewed.\n\nPreviously, proposals for research grants were generally required to undergo at least three external reviews by scientists from outside the agency. Now, two reviews are enough and, under some circumstances, one can be an internal review by a scientist at the NSF.\n\nIs academic research becoming too competitive? Nature examines the data\n\nThe change in policy was described in an update of the agency’s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide that was published on 8 December. Nature also obtained the more detailed internal guidance supplied to NSF programme officers, who are in charge of the review process. To get a better understanding of the changes, Nature spoke to five NSF staff members. All requested anonymity because of concerns about retaliation.\n\nSubstituting an internal review for an external review could save time, programme officers say. “I’m glad to have a little more flexibility,” one says, especially when they are handling proposals that do not meet basic criteria for funding. “But I would hate to see two reviews becoming the norm for the proposals that are legitimate candidates for funding.” Programme officers say that they value a range of external expert perspectives.\n\nVariety of views\n\nLike other science agencies, the NSF relies heavily on external expertise to assess grant proposals. Proposals are sent to peer-review panels of between three and ten independent specialists, each of whom produces reviews of a handful of proposals. To supplement panellists’ evaluations, programme officers also solicit other external experts for ad hoc reviews.\n\nNSF slashes prestigious PhD fellowship awards by half\n\nDuring day-long discussion sessions, panels consider panellists’ reviews and any ad hoc reviews, then produce assessments of proposals. Programme officers use these assessments to make recommendations to division directors, who decide which proposals are funded.\n\nProgramme officers also write summaries of these assessments, which can provide feedback for researchers. Until now, those summaries were highly detailed and multiple paragraphs long. But new internal guidance limits summaries to three to five sentences. It is a shame to limit the summaries, which are “a more helpful synthesis” than other documents from the review process, says Laurel Yohe, a bioinformatics researcher at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.",

We compete for positions, promotions, publications and presentations. And we also compete for money, a necessary requirement if we are to continue taking part in the academic endeavour.\n\nI spent the early years of my PhD at an Austrian non-academic research institute, where competing for grants was the only way that my colleagues and I could secure funding for our research. Everything else we did, from publishing papers to presenting at conferences, felt designed, ultimately, to help secure the next grant. The system seemed back to front: surely it should be about the science first?\n\nFive important financial moves for PhD students\n\nIn science, there are many more people with ideas than there are public resources to support those ideas, which raises an unavoidable question about how to allocate scarce resources. Determining the best way to do so is extremely difficult. In an egalitarian approach, everyone would receive an equal share, even if that was only a fraction of what their projects would need. An alternative would be to use strict merit criteria, or to allow institutions to decide how they want to distribute resources. Yet the approach that has become most widespread is competition, which is presented as efficient, fair and reliable.\n\nMillion-dollar questions\n\nMy main research focuses on using computational tools to analyse intelligent systems, but I have found myself increasingly questioning how the ways in which we fund science shape its outcomes1. Which funding schemes encourage researchers to pursue high-risk research? How do different funding schemes affect scientists themselves, and what ethical issues arise from them?\n\nI suspect that because competition had been a constant companion on my path to becoming a professor at the Vienna University of Technology (perhaps even paving the way), I developed a particular interest in analysing its implications. These questions are core topics in metascience, which takes a bird’s-eye view of how research is done and aims to improve its quality, integrity and efficiency. Like many of my colleagues, I work on these topics alongside my main research.\n\nLink Introducing the j-metric: a true measure of what matters in academia\n\nA concept known as the Szilard point helps to contextualize the issues arising from excessive competition for grants. Named after the Hungarian-born physicist Leo Szilard, who wrote a short story satirizing the bureaucratic nature of scientific funding, this metric describes the threshold at which the total cost of competing for a grant equals (or surpasses) the value of the available funding. These costs are incurred by scientists in writing proposals, by their peers in reviewing them and by the administrative systems that run the process. The question is, which costs more: the research being funded, or the application process itself?\n\nGenAI for Africa, a funding call from the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme, probably crosses that threshold. The initiative aims to use generative artificial intelligence to address the societal challenges that many African countries are facing. With a total budget of €5 million (US$5.8 million), the call, which closed in October, invited proposals across four vast domains — agriculture, health care, urban planning and education. Out of 215 submissions, only two projects are expected to be funded, giving a success rate of under 1%.\n\nTo approximate the overall costs associated with the application process, I used two scenarios. See ‘GenAI for Africa: estimated grant-application costs’.\n\nScenario A\n\nIn 2023, group of researchers at the University of Lübeck in Germany developed a simulation tool for estimating the costs of grant funding. To arrive at cost estimates for GenAI for Africa applications, I fed this simulation with data from the Interim Evaluation of the Horizon Europe Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021–2024). The key inputs are:\n\nTime investment. According to the report, “the median consortium coordinator spends … 36 to 45 person-days per proposal. The effort for contributing consortium partners is typically lower, spending 16 to 25 person-days.”\n\nConsortium size. The average consortium size for Horizon projects is likely to be between 12 and 16 partners, according to statistics published by the European Commission.\n\nHourly payment rate of applicants. Hourly rates vary considerably depending on country, sector (industry versus academia), seniority and applicable overheads. To reflect this diversity, I drew on several reference sources from across Europe. To account for differences, I assumed the average cost of an hour’s work to be between €20 and €60.\n\nThe variation in input values enabled me to produce two cost estimates for GenAI for Africa grant applications: a lower estimate (Scenario A1) and a higher estimate (Scenario A2).\n\nThe tool automatically accounts for decision-making and administrative costs.\n\nScenario B",

Credit: National Institutes of Health, NIAID/SPL\n\nA twice-weekly cocktail of three messenger RNAs can rejuvenate the weary immune systems of aged mice and boost responses to vaccination and cancer treatments, a study has found1.\n\nThe treatment provides a needed boost to immune cells called T cells, which coordinate immune responses and kill infected cells. As people age, their ability to produce T cells wanes, and the ones they have become less effective.\n\nT-cell ageing helps to explain why vaccines are sometimes less effective in older people than in young adults, and why cancer treatments that unleash the immune system against tumours don’t work as well in older adults, says María Mittelbrunn, an immunologist at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. Flagging T-cell immunity is also linked to the chronic inflammation associated with many age-related diseases, including some forms of cardiovascular disease.\n\nHow to make an old immune system young again\n\n“T cells, in particular, are one of the cell types that change the most during ageing,” says Mittelbrunn, who was not involved in the study. “To rejuvenate them could have immense consequences.”\n\nThe work was reported in Nature on 17 December and earlier this month at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.\n\nTargeting T cells\n\nT cells are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to a tiny gland called the thymus to mature. In the thymus, they learn to recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. They also learn not to attack the body’s own healthy cells.\n\nBut the thymus degrades with age: it begins to shrink and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Attempts to reverse this using hormone treatments and other drugs have not worked, says Mirco Friedrich, a haematologist and oncologist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, and first author of the study.\n\nSo, Friedrich and his colleagues decided to take a different approach: rather than treating the thymus directly, they targeted T cells by delivering an experimental therapy to the liver. “Most T cells are in the blood,” Friedrich says. “And the liver receives the body’s whole blood volume.”\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nThe team began by characterizing the effects of ageing on T cells in mice, cataloguing differences in gene activity and molecular signalling pathways from shortly after birth until the animals were old and frail, at about 20 months of age.",

          "abstract": "The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, has been targeted for breakup by the Trump administration.Credit: John Greim/LightRocket/Getty\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump intends to dismantle the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), a world-leading Earth-science centre in Boulder, Colorado. The centre’s modelling and Earth observations underpin a wide range of US and global research, especially on climate.\n\n“This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,” wrote Russell Vought, Trump’s budget director, announcing the planned closure in a post yesterday on the social-media platform X. In a statement, the White House called NCAR “the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy”. The plan was first reported by USA Today.\n\nThe White House said that the National Science Foundation (NSF), which provides funding for the centre, “will be breaking up NCAR to eliminate Green New Scam research activities. Any vital functions, such as weather modeling and supercomputing, will be moved under the purview of another entity or location.”\n\nOn Wednesday, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) — the non-profit consortium of more than 130 colleges and universities that runs NCAR — received a letter of intent from the NSF regarding the planned break-up of NCAR, consortium president Antonio Busalacchi told Nature. The letter requested information regarding divesting, transferring or restructuring the various components of NCAR. It mentioned NCAR’s research aircraft fleet and its supercomputing center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as components that might be relocated. “Morale is terrible,” Busalacchi says.\n\nUS environmental agency halts funding for its main science division\n\nAny such action will be challenged by members of Congress. “I for one am not going to let this take place on my watch,” Joe Neguse, a Democrat who represents Boulder in the US House of Representatives, said Wednesday in a virtual address to the American Geophysical Union meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Congress sets the federal budget and can direct the US government to fund NCAR.\n\nThe most recent agreement between the NSF and UCAR, which was signed in 2023, provides US$938 million to run NCAR for five years. Cancelling that award would eliminate the majority of NCAR’s annual budget. The rest of the budget comes from an array of federal and non-federal sources.\n\nCentral resource\n\nNews of the intended closure rippled quickly through the Earth-science community, with many starting a #SaveNCAR discussion across social-media platforms. “Dismantling NCAR is like taking a sledgehammer to the keystone holding up our scientific understanding of the planet,” wrote Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, on social media, adding that the laboratory is the “global mothership” of atmospheric science.\n\n“To me personally, it’s just another unbelievably reckless blow to American science”, says Dawn Wright, an oceanographer and geographer at Esri, a geographic-information-system company in Redlands, California. “If the NSF does follow through with these plans to break up NCAR, that’s just going to decimate a huge chunk of the US climate research that we all depend on.”\n\nThe NSF established NCAR in 1960 to support US atmospheric-science research that requires computing or other resources beyond the means of any single institution. “If you cancel this, you will devastate atmospheric science,” says a researcher who formerly worked at the NSF and requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. “That’s different from other sciences that are more distributed.”\n\nTrump gutted two landmark environmental reports — can researchers save them?\n\nWork at NCAR played a key part in the rise of modern weather and climate forecasting. For instance, the lab pioneered the modern dropwindsonde, a weather instrument that can be released from an aircraft to measure conditions as it plummets through a storm. The technology reshaped the scientific understanding of hurricanes, says James Franklin, an atmospheric scientist and former branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.",

          "authors": "Anil Shanker",
          "abstract": "In September, the US government announced a one-off US$495-million funding boost for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and tribal colleges and universities (TCUs). This is welcome news — but doesn’t redress their chronic underfunding.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\n\nIn the United States, HBCUs educate 1.5% of all university students — yet receive only 0.9% of federal research and development (R&D) funding. Data reported in 2024 show combined HBCU endowment assets around $100,000 per student. By contrast, the ten wealthiest US universities received $2 million to $7 million per student in 2023.\n\nAs a scientist and administrator at Meharry Medical College — a 150-year-old private historically Black health-sciences institution in Nashville, Tennessee, with some 1,500 students — I’ve seen how hard it can be to manage on scant budgets. I urge the government to redress funding levels. In the meantime, HBCUs and TCUs can target their investments, as Meharry has done with some success.\n\nOver the past decade, Meharry has increased its funds for research, and its scholarly output, by using metrics to guide budgeting and investments. We tracked publications and citations, grants, awards, student engagement, graduation and career placement rates, facility use, data generation and sharing (how many samples were processed, what data sets were produced and how were shared), research collaborations and investigator diversity. We also expanded our number of sponsors and monitored how funds were used.\n\nBetween the periods of 2010–15 and 2020–25, the number of cross-disciplinary collaborations increased, both between groups at Meharry and with external investigators. The number of papers with Meharry authors indexed in the PubMed database of biomedical literature rose from 444 to 1,067.\n\nEnd racism in science\n\nThree measures underpin this growth. First, we established transdisciplinary pilot grants of $50,000–$75,000 per faculty member lasting for 12–18 months — funded by federal research endowments or private foundations — to seed ideas and support core staff and infrastructure. While maintaining budgets for ongoing cancer, HIV and oral-health studies, we prioritized new projects in genomics, inflammation, immunity and cardiometabolic health. We also launched two new schools: one in applied computational sciences, in 2021; and one in global health, in 2023.\n\nSecond, we invested in infrastructure to handle, store and analyse data securely. We established procedures — including some around human consent and data sovereignty — that meet both federal and Tribal Nations’ standards. Studies that involve human participants must be co-designed with community members to ensure that any concerns — for example, about privacy, potential stigma or data misuse — are addressed early on. Steps such as pre-consented sharing of electronic health records or clinical notes can help to accelerate the analysis of disease risk, treatment response and gaps in care, to inform services and policies that benefit local people. This transparent and respectful approach deepens public confidence in science, especially among populations long marginalized in research.",

          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nIn December 2024, I finished my PhD in biomedical chemistry in Italy, and I now find myself in that all-too-familiar early-career crisis, struggling to work out what to do next.\n\nResearch is important to me as a way to contribute meaningfully to a better, healthier world. But I have other life goals, such as becoming financially stable and starting a family, that seem incompatible with the reality of academic life. The cost of living is rising everywhere, and early-career research jobs come with low pay and short contracts.\n\nTrying to transition out of academia brings its own frustrations. After years of dedication, I’m treated by those hiring in industry as if I have no real work experience. It feels like starting from zero again.\n\nIs this early-career crisis an inevitable part of life after a PhD? How do I navigate a career when my goals and values conflict? Does my passion for research have to be all-consuming? Do I have to choose between research and a reasonable work–life balance? — A melancholy chemist\n\nThe advice\n\nYou’re not alone. These are big questions, echoed by newly minted PhD graduates around the world. This is a notoriously challenging time in the career of any young scientist, and it doesn’t mean you’re failing if you’re struggling. Nature’s careers team sought advice from three researchers on how to resolve your problem.\n\nPeter Hanenberg, vice-rector for research and innovation at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon, says: “The first step is to recognize that this crisis is something which comes with what it is to be a researcher. An academic career is, to a certain point, a matter of passion, which means it might not be just a job. But the balance should be healthy.”\n\nWhen she completed her neuroscience PhD at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain, last year, Maria del Mar Cajiao Manrique knew that she didn’t want to continue in academia, but she didn’t have a clear idea of the alternatives.\n\n“From the time we start university,” she says, “we are shown there’s only one path: bachelor, master, PhD, postdoc, and then more postdocs until you become a principal investigator. It becomes internalized. If someone doesn’t feel like they fit that one path, that’s when they start having this existential crisis: What is it that I’m good at? Have I wasted the past four years on this PhD?”\n\nCajiao Manrique took a three-month contract as a visiting researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City, then found a position as a medical writer in August this year. She says that going to talks at other research institutions and connecting with PhD holders who have been in similar situations has helped her to broaden her perspective and discover fresh possibilities.\n\nAn ‘agony aunt’ for working scientists\n\nLynn McAlpine, whose higher-education research at the University of Oxford, UK, focuses on PhD and post-PhD career trajectories, points out that research career paths are not as straightforward as they once were. “Now we see a shift to what we’re calling self-authored careers,” she says, “where people have to take more responsibility for figuring out what they want, what kinds of jobs there are, and find ways to integrate their life–career goals.”\n\nMcAlpine has investigated how researchers navigate their careers and personal lives after finishing their doctorates. She observed that personal life aims, such as the desire to live close to a partner, have children and achieve financial security, tend to have greater influence in shaping career paths in the long term than do professional aims — such as reaching for a prestigious job title or a dream research project.\n\n“There are myriad factors coming into play in the life journey of early-career researchers,” says McAlpine. Your priorities and your opportunities will be affected by variables such as location, age, international mobility and personal values.\n\nSometimes, she says, people seek academic careers, but realize that what they really love is the academic environment. “So maybe they find a job in academia — not as a professor, but working in a museum or university archives, or as a communications officer in a research centre.”\n\nOne PhD holder, interviewed as part of McAlpine’s research, wanted to relocate with her partner, who was also an academic, but she knew that it would be difficult for both of them to get posts in the same place. “When she got a postdoc in another country, they both moved there, and he took a professional position working in the university museums as a curator. There, he could apply his academic knowledge — until they moved again.”\n\nPerseverance\n\nMcAlpine points to perseverance as a crucial skill from a PhD programme that can be applied at the job-seeking stage. Getting a job is itself a job, she says. In her observations, whether they were looking for an industry job or an academic grant, “the people who were most successful just kept applying. They weren’t put off by not getting an answer or getting a no.” In other words, “it’s a race against your own frustration”, says Cajiao Manrique. After her PhD, she spent months applying for jobs. “I was sitting at my desk nine to five. I sent over 1,000 job applications.” She estimates that she received a response for only about one in every 50 that she sent.\n\nThen, Cajiao Manrique went on LinkedIn and started finding communities of PhD graduates who were dealing with the same issues. Through these connections, she learned that her CV was probably being discarded by AI tools. After more research and more conversations, she rewrote her CV to make it ‘industry-ready’, focusing on results rather than technicalities. For example, she changed “performed in vivo experiments to assess A using technique B” to “planned, managed and performed more than X studies, leading a team of Y people, which resulted in the publication of article Z”.",

It would have been far more practical to focus on the tentacles he used to communicate rather than struggling to pick which eye to look at.\n\n“Alright, alright, no need for the whole colour show — you really don’t look good in black. A fifth shot it is!” The bartender backpedalled quickly as Spooky’s displeasure became obvious. Quadrinocularis were usually a quiet, docile species, more accustomed to basking in the sun for hours than arguing. Spooky, however, had cultivated a reputation for being irascible. When he got annoyed enough to change colour, most knew to keep their distance.\n\nSoon, a small glass of clear liquid was placed before him.

Days spent weaving colour-shows with his brethren, not for profit or spectacle but simply for the joy of creating something beautiful. Occasionally, a predator would stir things up, but the Quadrinocularis’ eyes were excellent at spotting danger. More importantly, life had been static. It was so hard to remember what the reef had been like, now that he had been gone for so long. Only after a few Smokey Blasts could he recall the feeling of the warm currents flowing around him, the hum of his brethren blending into a harmony that resonated deep in his bones. His reef had been small — 20, maybe 30, Quadrinocularis — but their synchronization had been unmatched. Even in the dead of night, there was always a soft pulse of colour, a quiet song of belonging. Then the humans came — driven by greed, curiosity, and their ceaseless need for movement and expansion — and everything fell apart. His homeworld, once serene, was now forever tainted by activity. His reef had lasted longer than most. It wasn’t one of the great northern reefs, where thousands of Quadrinocularis moved as one, their collective shimmer making the sea itself vibrate with colour. There, the ocean was alive with a never-ending symphony. But humans needed space for their buildings, their entertainment, their noise. Like many of his friends, Spooky had left to chase the Universe’s vaunted beauty — only to learn that beauty was a relative concept in the endless expanse of space.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Sa’amm pretty, right?

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Organizers of the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting (pictured, a past meeting), which started 15 December, expect it to draw fewer visitors than it did in 2024.Credit: Marek Uliasz/imageBROKER/Alamy\n\nAttendance at several of the biggest science conferences held in the United States either fell this year compared with last year or is expected to fall in 2026. There are many reasons for the changes, but at least some researchers are curbing their travel to the United States because of policies put in place by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe obstacles have galvanized some meeting organizers to hatch alternative plans to bring the international research community together.\n\nMeet the early-career scientists planning to leave the United States\n\nEarlier this month, for instance, the artificial-intelligence conference NeurIPS hosted not only its main meeting in San Diego, California, but also its first-ever alternative location, in Mexico City, with the goal of alleviating travel challenges. Meanwhile, a group of AI researchers in Europe organized an independent spin-off conference, dubbed EurIPS, in Copenhagen.\n\n“Our main focus was on giving a home to people who felt intellectually homeless this year,” says Søren Hauberg, a machine-learning and computer-vision researcher at the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby who helped to organize EurIPS.\n\nSmaller crowds\n\nNature asked the organizers of large conferences that were scheduled to take place in US cities in the second half of 2025 or the first quarter of 2026 for details of their attendance trends. Of the six that responded, three had seen or were expecting a drop in attendance compared with the previous year.\n\nIn some cases, the observed decrease was slight, and the reasons were complex. For instance, attendance at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting last month was down 6%, from 22,359 people in 2024 to 21,093 this year. The number of countries those attendees represented also fell, from 88 in 2024 to 73 in 2025. Organizers of the conference, one of the biggest in the United States, say that attendance has fluctuated since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, making it difficult to pinpoint the effect Trump’s policies have had.\n\nOrganizers of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference, another of the nation’s largest meetings, say that they also are seeing a drop in numbers at the 2025 meeting, which began on Monday, compared with 2024. More than 30,000 people attended last year’s AGU conference; more than 20,000 were registered for this year’s as of Monday, conference organizers say. The lighter attendance was notable in the poster and exhibit halls, which were slightly less jam-packed than usual.\n\nBarriers to entry\n\nScientists hoping to travel to the United States in 2025 faced a raft of new restrictions. As part of Trump’s focus on immigration and visa enforcement, border officials have tightened up scrutiny of incoming travellers, turning some away at airports and other entry points. In June, Trump’s administration banned or limited entry for citizens of 19 countries, including Iran and Venezuela, citing national-security concerns. And on 9 December, the administration proposed requiring visitors from dozens of countries to provide their social media posts for the past five years before entering the United States.\n\nOther policies have also had an impact on scientists’ willingness or ability to attend US meetings. This week’s Pacifichem meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, which around 11,000 people have registered to attend, has seen significantly fewer attendees than usual from Canada, says meeting chair Laurel Schafer, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. That aligns, she says, with overall drops in tourism from Canada to the United States after Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian goods and said he would make it “the 51st state”.\n\nWhere is the best place to hold a scientific conference right now?\n\nFor Tanja Junkers, a chemist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, the deciding factor on attending Pacifichem was Trump’s attacks on trans and non-binary people; on his first day in office he issued an executive order declaring that there are “two sexes, male and female” and that the government will “enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality”. “Being of a gender-diverse background, I do not feel I am able to safely travel to the US, even to a more liberal state such as Hawaii,” Junkers says. She helped to arrange a symposium at the meeting from a distance, but did not participate in it, even remotely.",

Like most other publishers, Frontiers forbids reviewers from uploading unpublished manuscripts to chatbot websites because of concerns about confidentiality, sensitive data and compromising authors’ intellectual property.\n\nThe survey report calls on publishers to respond to the growing use of AI across scientific publishing and implement policies that are better suited to the ‘new reality’. Frontiers itself has launched an in-house AI platform for peer reviewers across all of its journals. “AI should be used in peer review responsibly, with very clear guides, with human accountability and with the right training,” says Vicario.\n\n“We agree that publishers can and should proactively and robustly communicate best practices, particularly disclosure requirements that reinforce transparency to support responsible AI use,” says a spokesperson for the publisher Wiley, which is based in Hoboken, New Jersey. In a similar survey published earlier this year, Wiley found that “researchers have relatively low interest and confidence in AI use cases for peer review,” they add. “We are not seeing anything in our portfolio that contradicts this.”\n\nChecking, searching and summarizing\n\nThe Frontiers’ survey found that, among the respondents who use AI in peer review, 59% use it to help write their peer-review reports. Twenty-nine per cent said they use it to summarize the manuscript, identify gaps or check references. And 28% use AI to flag potential signs of misconduct, such as plagiarism and image duplication (see ‘AI assistance’).\n\nMohammad Hosseini, who studies research ethics and integrity at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, says the survey is “a good attempt to gauge the acceptability of the use of AI in peer review and the prevalence of its use in different contexts”.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nSome researchers are running their own tests to determine how well AI models support peer review. Last month, engineering scientist Mim Rahimi at the University of Houston in Texas designed an experiment to test whether the large language model (LLM) GPT-5 could review a Nature Communications paper1 he co-authored.\n\nHe used four different set-ups, from entering basic prompts asking the LLM to review the paper without additional context to providing it with research articles from the literature to help it to evaluate his paper’s novelty and rigour. Rahimi then compared the AI-generated output with the actual peer-review reports that he had received from the journal, and discussed his findings in a YouTube video.\n\nHis experiment showed that GPT-5 could mimic the structure of a peer-review report and use polished language, but that it failed to produce constructive feedback and made factual errors. Even advanced prompts did not improve the AI’s performance — in fact, the most complex set-up generated the weakest peer review. Another study found that AI-generated reviews of 20 manuscripts tended to match human ones but fell short on providing detailed critique.",

          "title": "AI is transforming the economy — understanding its impact requires both data and imagination",
          "authors": "Daniel Björkegren",
          "abstract": "How will artificial intelligence reshape the global economy? Some economists predict only a small boost — around a 0.9% increase in gross domestic product over the next ten years1. Others foresee a revolution that might add between US$17 trillion and $26 trillion to annual global economic output and automate up to half of today’s jobs by 20452. But even before the full impacts materialize, beliefs about our AI future affect the economy today — steering young people’s career choices, guiding government policy and driving vast investment flows into semiconductors and other components of data centres.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nGiven the high stakes, many researchers and policymakers are increasingly attempting to precisely quantify the causal impact of AI through natural experiments and randomized controlled trials. In such studies, one group gains access to an AI tool while another continues under normal conditions; other factors are held fixed. Researchers can then analyse outcomes such as productivity, satisfaction and learning.\n\nYet, when applied to AI, this type of evidence faces two challenges. First, by the time they are published, causal estimates of AI’s effects can be outdated. For instance, one study found that call-centre workers handled queries 15% faster when using 2020 AI tools3. Another showed that software developers with access to coding assistants in 2022–23 completed 26% more tasks than did those without such tools4. But AI capabilities are advancing at an astounding pace. For example, since ChatGPT’s release in 2022, AI tools can now correctly handle three times as many simulated customer-support chats on their own as they could before5. The better, cheaper AI of tomorrow will produce different economic effects.\n\nSecond, carefully controlled studies do not capture the wider ripple effects that accompany AI adoption. For example, the studies involving call-centre workers3 and software developers4 found that when organizational structure remained fixed, the less-experienced workers benefited most from AI assistance. But in the real world, managers might respond by reorganizing work or even replacing some of the less-experienced workers with AI systems. If they do, the effect on those individuals could be the opposite of that estimated in controlled studies. Indeed, payroll data suggest that employment of younger workers has declined since 2022, particularly in occupations that include tasks that AI excels at, such as customer service and software development6. However, researchers are still trying to understand how much of the pattern is attributable to AI technology.\n\nCarefully controlled studies are like flashing a bright, narrow spotlight: they are only part of the illumination needed to understand how society is adapting to AI. With so much still unknown about its broader economic and social effects, popular debate often slips into speculative, science-fiction narratives of a world dominated by machine intelligence.\n\nSocial science could help to navigate these uncertainties, but it would require both imagination and grounding. Here, I describe three complementary approaches that can guide researchers working in this rapidly evolving field.\n\nSocial science fiction\n\nOne approach is to create what economist Jean Tirole calls social science fiction7 — speculation about the future that remains rooted in fundamental economic principles and behavioural theories. Rather than relying on imagination alone, this kind of analysis uses models to explore how technologies might interact with market forces.\n\nFor example, in 2019, researchers modelled how self-driving cars might reshape cities and found that the vehicles could make traffic worse8. Because passengers in self-driving cars can relax, read or watch videos, the personal cost of time spent in traffic falls. But as more people choose to travel by car, they impose greater congestion on others. Whether that leads to inefficiency will depend on whether governments implement policies such as congestion pricing to correct the ‘externality’.\n\nCan AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people\n\nAnother illustration of imaginative, yet grounded, social science comes from research on how market forces might limit AI’s disruptive potential. Studies9,10 suggest that, as automation boosts productivity in some tasks, other activities that cannot easily be automated — such as creative direction or vetting final outputs — will grow in relative value. That might raise demand for labour, and therefore wages, in such jobs. These opportunities could cushion some of the disruptive effects of automation. But it might also deepen inequalities between people who thrive in these roles and those who do not.\n\nMore thought experiments like these can help policymakers to imagine how the economy might shift in a more disciplined manner. Such experiments can identify which indicators to monitor and provide a head start on planning the policies that might be needed. Other open problems include understanding the incentives to create knowledge for AI systems, and how innovation and economic growth might be affected if AI labs remain competitive with each other, or if one pulls ahead as a clear market leader.\n\nForward-looking data\n\nAs well as theory, policymakers will also need evidence to understand how the economy will change. Different types of information need to combine to form a more complete picture.\n\nOne common approach to assessing AI capabilities is benchmarking — testing the systems on standardized tasks, much as exams do. Benchmarks can assess an AI system’s ability to solve mathematics problems, respond to customer-support requests or diagnose medical conditions. However, benchmark scores often diverge from performance in real-world settings, where tasks are noisier, more complex and context-dependent. For example, a medical AI system might perform well on textbook-style clinical questions, but could misinterpret communications from patients if they omit key details. More research is needed to design benchmarks that better capture real-world performance.\n\nIf AI is anywhere near as transformative as many expect, its effects will show up in numerous indicators that can be monitored in real time, such as tracking which tasks people use AI for. These usage data show, for instance, that AI chatbots are often used for software development, suggesting that this sector might feel the earliest effects of AI adoption11,12. Other indicators include employment, job openings and whether firms that integrate AI earn higher profits and expand. However, there will be questions that such descriptive indicators alone cannot answer. For that reason, researchers might still attempt to measure the causal impact of AI: that is, whether AI causes improvements, rather than merely being adopted by high performers who also happen to be more willing to try new technologies.\n\nAI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it\n\nEstimating AI’s causal effects is difficult because the technology is evolving and organizations are adapting. But this challenge is not unique to AI. Similar issues arise when evaluating how any pilot programme — whether in business, education or public health — will perform once it is expanded. When scaled up, programmes often encounter fresh constraints or trigger wider economic fallouts. Economists have developed methods to anticipate these scaling effects when designing experiments, such as replicating the conditions of the eventual implementer — for example, a government agency — rather than those of the more agile, well-resourced organizations that typically run pilots13–15. Researchers studying AI can similarly attempt to anticipate future changes when designing experiments.\n\nOne important parameter is the cost of running AI models, which has been falling. Researchers can model how cost declines might affect the viability of different applications. For example, one study16 examined AI usage by teachers in Sierra Leone who pay for Internet access by the megabyte. In early 2022, querying an AI chatbot was 12 times more expensive than loading a standard web page; by 2025, thanks to falling compute costs and the bandwidth efficiency of AI, using the technology had become 98% cheaper than accessing a web page. This cost advantage suggests that AI might expand access to information in low-resource settings where the Internet is expensive.\n\nThe capabilities of AI are another crucial determinant of its impact. It is hard to predict how these will evolve, but researchers can try to anticipate how humans might respond to more-powerful systems. Even as technology advances, human behaviour tends to follow stable patterns — in terms of how people develop trust, how they respond to incentives and how they adapt to automation.",

          "abstract": "In Stranger Things, the supernatural villain Vecna rules a nightmarish parallel world called the Upside Down. Credit: Netflix/Everett/Shutterstock\n\nThroughout its five seasons, the Netflix show Stranger Things follows a ragtag group of teenagers and their parents as monsters from another universe — unleashed by the secret work of a government laboratory — wreak havoc on a quaint, fictional town in Indiana.\n\nDon’t worry, Demogorgons, Shadow Monsters and psychokinetically gifted 12-year-olds are strictly fictional creations. But the ‘parallel universe’ concept at the core of the show — which is set to conclude its nearly decade-long run at the end of this year — comes from a real scientific theory. And it’s been hotly debated by physicists over the past 75 or so years.\n\n‘Many worlds’ interpretation\n\nAlthough the series is as much in the realm of fantasy as science fiction, Stranger Things nods to many concepts of basic physics. Principles of electromagnetism explain haywire compasses, as well as magnets that spontaneously fall off a refrigerator. And in the third season, the characters save the world by using Planck’s constant during their quest to close a gate to the other universe, called the Upside Down (although the show uses the 2014 value for Planck’s constant, which wouldn’t have been standard in the 1980s setting).\n\nPhysicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows\n\nPerhaps the most prominent physics phenomenon mentioned in the programme, however, is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. After deducing that their friend might be stuck in the Upside Down, three pre-teen-boy protagonists ask their science teacher how they could travel there. He responds, “You guys have been thinking about Hugh Everett’s many-worlds interpretation, haven’t you?”\n\nIn the 1950s, the US physicist Hugh Everett really did propose such an explanation for modern physics, and his theory has been collecting devotees ever since. Everett’s work makes sense of a concept that has long baffled quantum physicists: the measurement problem. The question is how a quantum system can seem to be in two states at once — an electron that is simultaneously in two different locations, for example — until the moment the system is observed or measured, when all at once it’s in only one of those states.\n\nThe most popular explanation for this conundrum, called the Copenhagen interpretation, says that the unobserved electron exists in a hazy quantum state of both options, described only by probabilities, until suddenly, on measurement, it ends up in one. Everett poses an almost fantastical alternative: the electron really exists in both states at once, and after the measurement, an observer sees only one state because the universe branches in two, with each outcome existing in a different world. The countless quantum states of all the world’s particles create an infinite number of universes: hence, many worlds.\n\nControversial theory\n\nFor many physicists, this idea is a bit far-fetched, particularly because if these many worlds can’t interact, then there’s no way to prove or falsify the theory, says Jorge Pullin, a theoretical physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.\n\nBut for others — including Sean Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has worked as a science adviser for science-fiction films — the many-worlds interpretation is the most elegant explanation out there. “There are a lot of people who think this is the simplest version of quantum mechanics, and it fits all the data,” he says. Of the many explanations of quantum theory, many worlds is currently the third most popular among quantum physicists, a Nature survey found earlier this year.\n\nThe sci-fi films that physicists love to watch — from Interstellar to Spider-Man",

          "abstract": "Yasmin Proctor-Kent displayed waistcoats made by her dad behind her while competing on The Great British Sewing Bee.Credit: Love Productions Ltd 2025\nScientist sewing bees\n\nIn September, Yasmin Proctor-Kent, a research and development scientist at the cancer diagnostics company Leica Biosystems who is currently based in Melbourne, Australia, reached the finals of the 2025 BBC series of The Great British Sewing Bee. The television competition, which has now completed 11 seasons and boasts more than a dozen international versions, tests amateur sewers’ skills in pattern making, altering garments and creating made-to-measure pieces under time pressure. Previous scientist ‘bees’ include cell biologist Charlotte Newland, who won series four in 2016. Afterwards, Newland left a career in scientific publishing to become a sewing teacher, and she now works as a birth and postnatal doula. “The sewing bee made me a lot more flexible and less terrified of not having a predictable work progression,” she says.\n\nI love how the skills you develop as a scientist can be applied to sewing and other crafts. Like science, sewing requires creativity, as well as an initial idea or concept to get going. Both are about research and experimenting, and are iterative processes, in which you apply knowledge gained from work that you and others have done previously.\n\nDespite these parallels, craftwork such as sewing and knitting is often undervalued or dismissed because it’s seen as ‘women’s work’. But our brains work in the same way during crafting and research. For me, training in science and having a passion for sewing have been mutually beneficial — with each discipline supporting the other and driving my success.\n\nGrowing up, sewing was always part of my background. The Great British Sewing Bee was also always a regular fixture on our family television and was a source of connection to my family after I moved out to attend university (first at the University of Sheffield, UK, where I did a master’s degree in biochemistry and genetics, then at Newcastle University, UK, where I undertook doctoral research in mitochondrial biology).\n\nMy dad was my favourite person in the world, and a keen sewer. He had an innate creativity and curiosity that shaped my own — it almost feels genetic. He trained as an armourer in the UK Royal Air Force before moving into information technology, and if something needed doing while we were growing up — electrics, plumbing, repairing a hole in an item of clothing — he just did it.\n\nAlthough I get my love of sewing from him, his way of sewing was very different from mine. Before starting, he ensured that he had all the right equipment and did tonnes of research. He wouldn’t use a sewing machine to make a garment if, for example, it wasn’t historically accurate to do so, choosing instead to stitch by hand.\n\nIt was his sudden and unexpected death from cancer two years ago, aged 62, that made me decide to apply to be a contestant on the sewing bee. Sewing — and by extension the sewing bee — was our shared connection, and applying felt like a way to carry that forward.\n\nBecoming a ‘bee’\n\nThe programme’s application process began with sending in pictures of things you’d made. This was hard for me, because I hadn’t really documented anything I’d sewn, and just had the occasional selfie I’d sent to friends or family. The next step was a series of interviews, followed by an in-person sewing audition. Initially, I wasn’t cast — and I felt a strange sense of relief, because I wasn’t sure I was really a ‘TV person’. I’m loud in volume, but not necessarily in presence. I didn’t think I fitted the mould. But two weeks later, someone dropped out, and I was invited to take their place. I couldn’t believe I’d made it through.\n\nThe filming commitment was huge. Each episode is filmed over two long days, often starting at 6.30 a.m. and not ending until 8 p.m., with two episodes filmed back-to-back and just a day off in between.\n\nYasmin (centre) says she got her love of sewing from her dad (left, Yasmin’s mum appears on the right). Credit: Yasmin Proctor-Kent\n\nSiôn Phillips, a technical team leader and my manager at Leica Biosystems in Newcastle, UK, where I was then working as a lead research and development scientist in cancer diagnostics, generously gave me the time off and encouraged me to ask the company leadership if I could be filmed at work. He felt that there were not enough scientists on the programme, and that there’s a difference between saying you’re a scientist and viewers seeing you in a laboratory. It has more power.\n\nMy scientific skills and background helped to shape my approach to the programme’s challenges, and meant I was comfortable doing the research required. In the Korea-themed episode, for example, I found myself looking for papers on historical Korean clothing, translating them and applying that knowledge to make a cheollik — a traditional garment that includes a pleated skirt and is often worn by rulers and military personnel. It was no surprise to me that Kit, another contestant, also did well on the show. Kit is a mathematician, and was accustomed to engineering and transforming a 2D object to fit perfectly around a 3D form.\n\nCareer and craft\n\nI have wanted to be a scientist for as long as I can remember. When I entered the lab at university I fell in love with research, but I knew early on in my PhD that academia wasn’t for me. I didn’t feel it was a place where I could balance work with my hobbies, which include sewing, cooking and rugby (although a torn ligament means I can no longer play).\n\nFrom bench to bread: how science can enhance your hobbies\nI find industry much more compatible with a strong work–life balance. Leica Biosystems’ Newcastle office, where I am normally based, even has a crafting social group. Most of the members knit or crochet, and we meet regularly in a local cafe to practice our hobbies together. It’s a reminder that science and craft often sit side by side.\n\nMuch of my earlier career experience helped me to handle the pressure of being on the sewing bee. I have a specific interest in coaching that I have been developing throughout my career. During my doctorate, I tutored for a charity called the Brilliant Club, which places PhD students in local schools for extracurricular teaching. After I concluded my PhD lab work, but before I graduated in 2021, I worked as a personal development coach with 16–18-year-olds at a local sixth-form college. At the start of the pandemic, I worked in a COVID-19 testing lab, where I joined the UK National Health Service’s professional coaching programme, and I now support an international coaching programme for women at Leica Biosystems, training future coaches.",

Among adolescents, heavier or more problematic use (that is, excessive or uncontrollable engagement with social media) has been consistently linked with higher levels of depression, anxiety and psychological distress, although most evidence remains cross-sectional2. Furthermore, adolescence is a period of heightened sensitivity to peer approval and social comparison. Social media intensify these dynamics by increasing the visibility and quantification of social interactions, which amplifies the pressures of belonging and popularity3. By prohibiting accounts for individuals under 16 years old, the Australian government aims to limit these risks and compel companies to prioritize safety over engagement.\n\nAlthough advocates regard the ban as a precautionary response to mounting concerns over youth wellbeing, its success might be limited because it focuses on accounts rather than content. Streaming platforms typically allow users to scroll endlessly without logging in, and recommendation systems remain active for anonymous viewers. These feeds can shift rapidly following minimal interaction, and move from generic clips to streams that feature conspiracy theories, far-right material and violent imagery. Thus, restricting accounts does not necessarily protect adolescents from harmful content. In fact, this ‘logged-out’ state might be less safe than a registered account, which at least offers restricted modes and parental controls. Moreover, algorithms do not merely reflect user interests but actively shape them. A recent study shows that the content recommended by certain platform algorithms gradually narrows over time, and particular viewpoints become increasingly amplified. This ‘narrative drift’ can entrench bias and reduce diversity in what viewers encounter4. This paradox, in which efforts to protect adolescents from harmful content might instead increase exposure, underscores the difficulty of protecting adolescents in ecosystems that are shaped by recommendation systems.",

          "abstract": "Comparing information structures in between deep neural networks (DNNs) and the human brain has become a key method for exploring their similarities and differences. Recent research has shown better alignment of vision–language DNN models, such as contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP), with the activity of the human ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) than earlier vision models, supporting the idea that language modulates human visual perception. However, interpreting the results from such comparisons is inherently limited owing to the ‘black box’ nature of DNNs. Here we combine model–brain fitness analyses with human brain lesion data to examine how disrupting the communication pathway between the visual and language systems causally affects the ability of vision–language DNNs to explain the activity of the VOTC to address this. Across four diverse datasets, CLIP consistently captured unique variance in VOTC neural representations, relative to both label-supervised (ResNet) and unsupervised (MoCo) models. This advantage tended to be left-lateralized at the group level, aligning with the human language network. Analyses of 33 patients who experienced a stroke revealed that reduced white matter integrity between the VOTC and the language region in the left angular gyrus was correlated with decreased CLIP–brain correspondence and increased MoCo–brain correspondence, indicating a dynamic influence of language processing on the activity of the VOTC. These findings support the integration of language modulation in neurocognitive models of human vision, reinforcing concepts from vision–language DNN models. The sensitivity of model–brain similarity to specific brain lesions demonstrates that leveraging the manipulation of the human brain is a promising framework for evaluating and developing brain-like computer models.",

          "abstract": "A collaborative group can often outperform a single individual in complex problem solving, even when information is limited. This phenomenon, called collective intelligence, can be achieved by engineering a central planner who assigns subtasks distributed across the group. But such algorithms cannot explain how natural populations, which often lack sophisticated central control, can nonetheless evolve collective intelligence. In fact, the process of social learning by imitating successful peers will typically reduce diversity and inhibit collective intelligence. Here, we consider a prediction task where the true outcome each round is a continuous quantity that depends linearly on a large number of random causal factors. Each individual can observe only one factor, and the collective prediction is generated by aggregating personal predictions across individuals. We propose two classes of reward structures that guarantee the emergence of collective intelligence through social learning. One scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called experts) whose personal predictions are more accurate. The other scheme provides greater rewards to those individuals (called reformers) whose predictions have greater potential to reduce the collective error, even though their personal predictions may be far from the truth. Although both of these payoff structures can provably maintain diversity and establish collective intelligence, we show that rewards based on collective error are more robust to diverse problem settings than rewards based on personal accuracy. Our results show that identifying reformers is more effective than identifying experts in promoting the emergence of collective intelligence.",

However, it remains unclear whether this effect generalizes across varied assessments and the extent of this effect across sociodemographic groups has been debated. Though seasonal variation in cognitive performance is often attributed to “forgetting” of learned material, no large-scale studies have systematically investigated seasonal variation in general cognitive skills (e.g., executive functioning) on standardized laboratory-based assessments in school-age youth compared to adults. Across four datasets with geographic, demographic, mental health, and measurement variation (total n = 23,251), we quantify cyclical, seasonal variation in children’s cognitive performance using generalized additive models with cyclic cubic splines. In school-age children but not young adults, we found consistent cognitive performance minima following school vacation (July–September in the United States; November–January in Singapore) across nearly all cognitive domains investigated. These results demonstrate a generalizable small-magnitude effect of lower cognitive performance aligning with school vacation even after adjusting for socioeconomic status or ADHD diagnosis. We contextualize summer cognitive minima relative to environmental and developmental effects, noting that the largest effect size is still seven times smaller than effects of the socioeconomic environment on cognition, and provide recommendations for future data collection and analysis of behavior across the calendar year.",

          "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) gradually demonstrate their potential to boost productivity and become integral tools for problem-solving in daily life worldwide, understanding the linguistic inequalities they introduce is becoming increasingly important. Prior research has primarily focused on static analyses of disparities in existing knowledge and capabilities of LLMs across languages. However, LLMs are continuously evolving, acquiring new knowledge to provide current, relevant responses and deliver precise, expert-level answers in specific domains. Investigating linguistic inequalities within this dynamic learning process is, therefore, also essential. In this paper, we explore inequalities in new knowledge learning by LLMs across different languages and four key dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, prioritization, and robustness. Through extensive experiments in both in-context learning and fine-tuning settings, with proprietary and open-source models, we reveal four key findings: 1) LLMs face greater challenges in efficiently and accurately learning new knowledge in lower-resource languages; 2) knowledge learned by LLMs tends to be more easily transferred to higher-resource languages than to lower-resource ones; 3) new knowledge in higher-resource languages is more likely to be retained and prioritized; and 4) LLMs are more robust against incorrect or misleading information in higher-resource languages. We further analyze the underlying causes of these inequalities from linguistic perspectives, pretraining characteristics, and tokenizer design, and propose a preliminary mitigation strategy through the lens of linguistic neurons. This work highlights the urgent need to recognize and address emerging linguistic inequalities in the development of LLMs.",

It develops a formal framework that accounts for how climate change has affected each county’s economy by altering current and past weather, both locally and elsewhere around the country. The results show that climate change is already reducing annual U.S. income by 0.32% [95% CI: −0.17 to 0.82%] by altering counties’ current, local temperatures, with losses concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest. Accounting for effects on past temperatures and on temperatures in other counties increases income losses to 12% [2.0 to 22%] and makes them more widely distributed, with suggestive evidence that trade networks propagate effects around the United States. Central estimates can change with different indices of nonlocal weather or models of cross-county heterogeneity. Calculations like those developed here could be updated annually as a way of measuring and communicating the progress of climate change.",

          "abstract": "Complex adaptive networks exhibit remarkable resilience, driven by the dynamic interplay of structure (interactions) and function (state). While static-network analyses offer valuable insights, understanding how structure and function coevolve under external interventions is critical for explaining system-level adaptation. Using a unique dataset of clandestine criminal networks, we combine empirical observations with computational modeling to test the impact of various interventions on network adaptation. Our analysis examines how networks with specialized roles adapt and form emergent structures to optimize cost–benefit trade-offs. We find that emergent sparsely connected networks exhibit greater resilience, revealing a security–efficiency trade-off. Notably, interventions can trigger a “criminal opacity amplification” effect, where criminal activity increases despite reduced network visibility. While node isolation fragments networks, it strengthens remaining active ties. In contrast, increasing a node’s connectivity (analogous to social reintegration) can unintentionally boost criminal coordination, increasing activity or connectivity. Failed interventions often lead to temporary functional surges before reverting to baseline. Surprisingly, stimulating connectivity destabilizes networks. Effective interventions require precise calibration to node roles, connection types, and external conditions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about connectivity and intervention efficacy in complex adaptive systems across diverse domains.",

          "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is a key epigenetic modification that regulates transcription factor (TF) binding and gene expression. While most current understanding of methylation-sensitive TF binding derives from studies focused exclusively on fully methylated CpG sites, alternative forms—such as non-CpG and hemimethylation—are increasingly recognized as widespread and functionally important, particularly in embryonic stem cells and neurons. However, the direct impact of these alternative methylation contexts on TF–DNA interactions remains poorly defined, largely because current binding assays introduce methylation enzymatically, which precludes strand-specific and position-resolved measurements. Here, we systematically profile the methylation sensitivity of 18 human TFs spanning 11 structural families using chemically synthesized DNA libraries containing position-specific 5-methylcytosines (5mC) in CpG, non-CpG, and hemimethylated contexts, measured via high-throughput protein-binding microarrays. Our results reveal extensive TF sensitivity to methylation state, position, and strand orientation, including strong binding of several TFs to non-CpG and hemimethylated sites. The presence of 5mC can dramatically alter TF–DNA interactions: transforming low-affinity sites into high-affinity ones by enabling new contacts or silencing otherwise favorable motifs through steric hindrance. Genomic analyses further show that the methylation-sensitive sequences identified in vitro are represented within enhancers and regulatory elements, exhibiting distinct methylation patterns across cell types. Together, our findings uncover a previously hidden layer of methylation-dependent TF–DNA recognition, broadening the understanding of epigenetics in transcriptional regulation.",

Recent work suggests that the function of enhancers is influenced by their genomic sequence context more than previously thought, further complicating our understanding of their contribution to diversity. To address these issues, we investigated the regulation of the RCO homeobox gene, which contributed to the evolution of complex leaves following its tandem duplication from LMI1 . By characterizing seventeen regulatory alleles at the LMI1 / RCO locus that we generated by genome editing, we found that the evolved RCO enhancer is subject to pronounced negative regulation that helps delimit the RCO expression domain. While the LMI1 enhancer was strictly required for LMI1 gene expression, the same was not true for the RCO enhancer, which caused only partial loss of function when deleted. We mapped both positively and negatively acting sequences within the RCO enhancer, validated them in reporter gene assays and showed that a repressive sequence arose in association with a nested duplication within the evolved RCO enhancer. This repressive sequence played a key role in shaping the specific RCO expression domain that underlies its role in leaf complexity, and we provide evidence that it helped to prevent potential pleiotropic effects arising from evolutionary diversification or RCO expression. Our findings highlight the regulatory features of a diversity-linked enhancer and show that the evolution of repressive sequences is a powerful force in regulatory evolution.",

The earlier revision included volumetric nonlinear elasticity through the use of embedded coordinates and included the disregistry as well as removing the divergence. However, the revised model had a larger self-energy than the traditional model, which we now find to arise from similar divergent terms for the line force. The present model modifies the line force field to remove the divergent terms. The resultant total energy in the modified model has a lower energy than the traditional model.",

NCAM2 belongs to the Immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules with roles in intercellular adhesion and signaling.

          "authors": "Andrew Goetz, Purushottam Dixit",
          "abstract": "Directional sensing enables eukaryotic cells to detect spatial gradients of extracellular ligands, allowing them to orient and migrate within complex environments. Prevalent models explain this computation through a circuit where signaling species with distinct diffusion constants act incoherently on a downstream readout. Here, we propose a fundamentally different mechanism of directional sensing based on simple receptor-level processes. Our model integrates three ubiquitous receptor processes-lateral diffusion, basal ligand-independent activation, and active receptor degradation, THAT together synergize to generate robust directional sensing. In the absence of diffusion, active receptor degradation and basal activity implement an integral feedback that adapts active receptor levels to a ligand-independent set point while depleting receptors in relatively ligand-rich regions. Diffusion then redistributes receptors from regions of relatively low ligand exposure to regions with higher ligand exposure. This creates a spatial mismatch between activity and feedback that drives asymmetric receptor activity relative to the set point. The model predicts an optimal diffusion constant that maximizes polarization, reveals that receptors can encode relative rather than absolute ligand concentrations, and identifies the optimal basal activity that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in stochastic regimes. A survey of kinetic parameters across receptor families suggests that this diffusion-degradation synergy constitutes a broadly applicable, receptor-level mechanism for directional sensing.",

          "abstract": "Entry of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) into host cells is mediated by the viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Structural details and assembly mechanism of Gn and Gc on the surface of RVFV remain unclear. Here, we stabilized the GnGc with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody RVFV-140 and determined a near-atomic resolution structure of the GnGc hexamer in complex with the fragment antigen binding (Fab) domain of RVFV-140 (Fab140). Our structure showed that RVFV-140 recognizes a ternary epitope and crosslinks two adjacent Gn heads within the hexamer, thus preventing the prefusion to postfusion transition of the glycoproteins. The intraglycoprotein and interglycoprotein interactions within the GnGc hexamer involve van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds, which are mainly located between Gn heads, and Gn domain C and Gc domain III. Assembly of the GnGc hexamer requires dramatic conformational changes in the loops L231-L244, D280-Q286, Q380-D386, and A427-Y429 of Gn and the hinge region between domains I and II of Gc. The construction of viral capsomeres with the hexameric structure of recombinant GnGc shows that the capsomeres interact primarily through residues 693 to 713 in domain I of Gc. These interactions vary depending on the local environment of each capsomere.",

          "abstract": "Surgery remains the mainstay treatment for many kinds of solid tumors, while tumor recurrence frequently occurs. Adjuvant therapy can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve the prognosis of surgery. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy can be leveraged as an alternative adjuvant therapy to clear residual cancer cells and prevent tumor recurrence. However, systemic administration of CAR-T often results in insufficient tumor infiltration and side effects to normal organs. Given that platelets can preferentially accumulate at postsurgical wounds, we proposed that conjugating platelets to CAR-T cells may enhance the accumulation of the CAR-T cells within the surgical bed after the resection of solid tumors. In this study, we conjugated platelets to B7-H3.CAR-T cells via click chemistry. In postsurgical human pancreatic cancer mouse models, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced tumor infiltration and elevated antitumor cytokine levels, resulting in superior suppression effects on tumor recurrence, compared with CAR-T cells. Additionally, platelet-CAR-T cells showed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting metastasis and prolonging the survival time of the mice in postsurgical triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. Mechanistic studies revealed that platelet activation could improve the CAR-T cell activity and persistence, as evidenced by an upregulation of genes associated with T cell infiltration and a downregulation of genes related to T cell exhaustion. Finally, we further validated the biosafety profile and efficacy of platelet-CAR-T in a postsurgical patient-derived xenograft TNBC-bearing humanized mouse model. The results suggested that the CAR-T cell strengthened by platelet engineering is a promising adjuvant therapy against postsurgical tumor recurrence.",

          "abstract": "Interannually highly variable and synchronized production of large seed crops by perennial plants, called masting, drives resource pulses and famines with cascading effects on food webs. While the spatial scale of masting synchrony is well documented, it remains unclear how synchrony differs between years of seed abundance and failure, and how such dynamics extend across species and space. These gaps are important to resolve, as they determine the magnitude and spatial extent of masting effects on food webs. Using a 36-y dataset from 431 sites spanning seven dominant tree species in temperate Europe, we provide evidence that seed failures are more spatially synchronized than mast peaks, indicating that regional coherence in seed production is structured primarily by reproductive failure. Among-species synchrony was localized. This suggests that in temperate forests, mobile seed consumers are unlikely to experience coordinated starvation–satiation cycles, in contrast to highly synchronous tropical dipterocarp systems. From an applied perspective, failure years affect seed availability over broad regions, limiting sourcing options for afforestation and restoration, and underscoring the value of spatially explicit masting forecasting. Because mast peaks and failures differ fundamentally in their food web consequences, our findings highlight the need to better understand and anticipate the ecological impacts of synchronized seed scarcity.",

In this study, we present high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of human SSTR5 in complex with two selective small-molecule antagonists, antagonist 1 and S5A1, revealing the receptor’s inactive conformation. Both antagonists induce a unique remodeling of extracellular loop 2, which adopts a capping architecture that sterically occludes the orthosteric site, thus preventing agonist access and stabilizing receptor inactivation. Structural analyses and functional experiments elucidate how distinct molecular moieties of the antagonists differentially contribute to inhibitory efficacy, and subtype selectivity. Furthermore, we delineate rational avenues for molecular optimization to enhance therapeutic index and mitigate off-target liabilities. These findings, complementing our previous agonist-bound structures, establish a comprehensive structural foundation for developing improved nonpeptidic SSTR5 antagonists with potential therapeutic applications for type 2 diabetes and related endocrine disorders.",

After the emergence of AI-based methods, convection nowcasting has experienced rapid advancements, with its performance surpassing that of physics-based numerical weather prediction and other conventional approaches. However, the lead time and coverage of it still leave much to be desired and hardly meet the needs of disaster emergency response. Here, we propose a deep diffusion model for satellite data (DDMS) to establish an AI-based convection nowcasting system. Specifically, DDMS employs diffusion processes to effectively simulate complicated spatiotemporal evolution patterns of convective clouds, achieving more accurate forecasts of convective growth and dissipation over longer lead times. Additionally, it combines geostationary satellite brightness temperature data and domain knowledge from meteorological experts, thereby achieving planetary-scale forecast coverage. During long-term tests and objective validation based on the FengYun-4A satellite, our system achieves effective convection nowcasting up to 4 h, with broad coverage (about 20,000,000 km 2 ), remarkable accuracy, and high resolution (15 min; 4 km). Its performance reaches a new height in convection nowcasting compared to the existing models. In terms of application, our system is highly transferable with the potential to collaborate with multiple satellites for global convection nowcasting. Furthermore, our results highlight the remarkable capabilities of diffusion models in convective clouds forecasting, as well as the significant value of geostationary satellite data when empowered by AI technologies.",

Prisoners’ dilemma, and in particular, the important special case of donation games, represents social dilemmas where cooperation is mutually beneficial, yet defection is preferred by selfish agents. In evolutionary games on networks, the agents interact over a population structure. The existence of population structures that promote cooperative behavior is a fascinating and active research topic. Previous research establishes structures promoting cooperation in the limit of weak selection where the benefit-to-cost ratio β exceeds 1.5. The existence of such structures for medium and strong selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 2 and for weak selection for 1 &lt; β &lt; 1.5 has been a long-standing open question. First, we answer the open questions in the affirmative: For every selection strength and every β &gt; 1 , we construct networks promoting cooperation. Second, we present a robustness result with respect to β and selection strength: Our structures promote cooperation for a range of these parameter values rather than specific parameter values. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with simulation results on small population structures that show the effectiveness of our construction over well-studied population structures.",

This study employed targeted and untargeted metabolomics, coupled with isotope labeling, to shed light on the metabolism of salicinoids—potent antiherbivore phenolic defenses present in the Salicaceae family—in the poplar-specialized leaf beetle, Chrysomela tremulae . C. tremulae was found to produce a range of metabolites from salicortin and utilize the essential amino acid tryptophan and its breakdown products, namely kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and 4-hydroxyquinoline, to form novel conjugates with the salicinoid metabolite saligenin, which are then excreted in the feces of the beetles. Saligenin and its conjugates are not toxic to C. tremulae and similar metabolic pathways were found in other poplar herbivores. Experimental analyses of the gut microbiota revealed that there is no microbial contribution to the formation of tryptophan metabolite–saligenin conjugates. The production of such substances by insect herbivores may be a critical adaptation that enables specialists to survive on a diet high in salicinoid defense compounds. Therefore, identifying the underlying detoxification mechanisms creates opportunities to develop targeted anti-insect agents for protecting salicaceous trees.",

Twenty-nine CI candidates and 23 normal-hearing individuals participated. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy measured brain activity during audio-only and visual-only speech tasks at 1 mo and 1 y postimplantation, with speech understanding assessed after 1 y. Brain community dynamics were analyzed using multilayer modularity and network switching rates to capture temporal reorganization. Lower network switching rates shortly after implantation were associated with better long-term speech performance. Evidence of cross-modal plasticity—reflecting preimplant neural reorganization—was observed in early recordings, indicated by increased module allegiance between the posterior temporal (PT) region and visual cortices, which diminished after 1 y. Additionally, interhemispheric connectivity in the PT showed significant improvement between sessions, reducing disparities between CI users and normal-hearing individuals. These findings highlight dynamic functional connectivity as a meaningful neural correlate of outcome variability, with potential relevance for guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies and optimizing auditory and speech outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Many regions of the world have seen an increase in highly destructive wildfires, driven by well-documented increases in burned area and growth of housing in the wildland–urban interface (WUI), which exposes more homes to fire. However, it is unclear whether wildfires are also becoming more destructive due to changes in wildfire behavior or in the development patterns of exposed communities. Here, we assessed trends in wildfire building exposure and destruction rates in the conterminous United States from 2002 to 2022. We mapped destroyed and surviving buildings within 100 m of all wildfires that destroyed 10 or more buildings (n = 362) and assessed trends relative to major ecoregions and vegetation types. We used logistic regression to assess relationships between destruction rates and landscape factors. We found that 10% of exposed buildings were destroyed in 2002–2012, but this percentage increased to 32% in 2013–2022. This increase was largely due to greater building exposure in evergreen forests in the northwestern United States, where exposed buildings were more than 3.4 times as likely to be destroyed as those in grass and shrublands. However, annual destruction rates also significantly increased in all other vegetation types and were correlated with development type, weather, and burn severity. These results indicate that increasing wildfire destruction in the United States has resulted not only from increased exposure but from rising rates of building destruction, potentially indicating more extreme wildfire behavior. This finding underscores the need to better understand how fuel management, community planning, and hardening buildings can reduce vulnerability.",

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) in turn is commonly viewed functionally as a set of nerves and ganglia transmitting input and output signals between the central nervous system (CNS) and other bodily systems to regulate physiology and behavior. Here, we collate and analyze neuroanatomical data on putative directed and weighted axonal connections between peripheral ganglia in a mammal (rat). The resulting network reveals a sparse but broad intra-PNS neuronal architecture with over 100 connections among 52 of the 84 sensory and autonomic ganglia identified. Local network differentiation of the associated 52×52 connection matrix (connectome) was examined with cluster analysis. It identified 22 modules (subsystems or subnetworks) within a six-level nested hierarchy, including seven first-order modules and 14 end modules, spatially distributed from rostral to caudal along the CNS–body axis. Global features of the intra-PNS neuronal network based on node (ganglion) centrality measures identified two hubs (the bilateral myenteric plexus ganglia that control digestive tract functionality), no rich club, and small-world properties comparable to those reported for the rat brain. These findings suggest that the PNS is not merely a series of parallel nerves and associated ganglia but instead forms a structured and recurrently connected neuronal network. Its full extent and functional relevance remain to be elucidated using contemporary structure–function neuroscience approaches.",

While end resection has been extensively studied in the repair of endonuclease-induced DSBs, little is known about how resection proceeds at DSBs generated during DNA replication. We previously established a system to generate replication-dependent double-ended DSBs at the sites of nicks induced by the Cas9 D10A nickase in the budding yeast genome. Here, we suggest that these DSB ends form in an asymmetric manner, with one being blunt or near blunt and the other bearing a 3′ ssDNA overhang of up to the size of an Okazaki fragment. We find that Mre11 preferentially binds blunt ends and is required to evict Ku from these DSB ends and to promote end resection. In contrast, the ends predicted to have 3′ overhangs have minimal Ku binding, and resection at these break ends can proceed in a mostly Mre11-independent manner through either the Exo1 or Dna2-Sgs1 long-range resection mechanisms. These findings indicate that resection proceeds differently at replication-dependent DSBs than at canonical DSBs and reveal that Ku selectively binds blunt ends, potentially explaining why replication-dependent DSBs are poorly repaired by nonhomologous end joining.",

From our anatomical tracing study, our findings reveal that neurons located in the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ADN) specifically project onto MEC interneurons, with a strong preference for MEC VIP cells. Additionally, MEC VIP cells receive input from the hippocampus, the subicular complex, and the retrosplenial cortex, suggesting a specialized role for MEC VIP cells in spatial memory. Indeed, we find that MEC VIP cells exhibit increased c-Fos expression in a spatial memory task and show that chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons impairs task performance. Together, these data reveal a specific projection of head-direction (HD) information onto MEC interneurons and confirm that MEC VIP-expressing cells play a critical role in spatial memory.",

It is also used to separate red blood cells (RBCs) by age, as they lose water and become denser over their lifespan. When the density gradient is prepared with Percoll, discrete bands of RBCs are systematically observed along the gradient, despite the continuous density distribution of RBCs. Early studies suggested that cell aggregation might influence spatial distribution, but it remains debated whether a continuous density population can form discrete bands. We developed a continuity equation incorporating cell aggregation to describe the macroscopic evolution of RBC volume fraction in a density gradient, considering a continuous RBC density distribution. Numerical solutions demonstrate that the competition between net buoyancy and aggregation is sufficient to create band patterns. Our model reproduces the temporal evolution observed in experiments, but also predicts several types of bifurcation-like behaviors for the steady-state patterns in constant gradients, depending on RBC volume fraction and aggregation energy. This demonstrates that the competition between RBC aggregation and net buoyancy is a mechanism driving pattern formation.",

Previous studies have linked the function of a single Krüppel-associated box zinc finger protein (KZFP), ZFP189, in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), with the regulation of transposable elements (TEs), immune genes, and social behaviors. Here, we expand the scope of inquiry to explore the relationship between collective PFC KZFP function and social behaviors by altering the function of the cognate KZFP interacting protein TRIM28 within the PFC of male and female mice. We reprogrammed natural TRIM28 WT by replacing the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive domain with a synthetic, enhanced transcriptional activation domain VP64-p65-Rta (TRIM28 VPR ) or by excising the transcriptional regulatory domain (TRIM28 NFD ). Upon intra-PFC viral-mediated delivery of TRIM28 variants, we observed that inversion of TRIM28 transcriptional control via HSV-TRIM28 VPR selectively produced deficits in social behaviors, without affecting nonsocial behaviors. RNA sequencing of manipulated PFC revealed that HSV-TRIM28 VPR drove transcriptional escape of all classes of TEs, particularly those located within intronic and enhancer regions proximal to downregulated immune genes. HSV-TRIM28 VPR -mediated social deficits were reversible by intra-PFC repletion of interferon cytokines. These data point to PFC KZFP–TRIM28 interactions as necessary to stabilize genomic TEs to enable cis -regulation of key immune gene expression, which enhances organismal capacity for complex, prosocial behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The activation of the vesicular trafficking system, including endosomal recycling and extracellular vesicle (EV) release, represents an adaptive mechanism in cancer cells to counteract cellular stress or necroptotic death signals, which hampers cancer therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Indeed, our study demonstrate that inhibition of valosin-containing protein (VCPi) induces EV release and necroptosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), but does not achieve a synergistic effect with immunotherapy. Mechanistically, VCPi delays the degradation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a critical regulator of necroptosis and endosomal trafficking. Knockdown of MLKL reduces VCPi-mediated necroptosis, EV release, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) recycling. VCPi leads to MLKL accumulation, which recruits the retromer complex and GTPase-activating protein TBC1D5 to inactivate Rab7A. This redirects PD-L1-loaded vesicles to the cell surface via the retromer complex, thereby resulting in immunosuppression. Notably, targeting the retromer complex enhances the therapeutic efficacy of combined VCP inhibitors and anti-PD-L1 therapy in CRC, offering a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. Our study elucidates the role of the retromer complex in mediating PD-L1 recycling during VCPi-induced necroptosis and reveals that dual inhibition of VCP and the retromer complex potentiates immunotherapy efficacy in CRC.",

However, it remains unclear whether other transcriptional programs operate beyond the central androgen/AR signaling in promoting WD development. We found that mesenchyme-specific deletion of the transcription factor Gata2 resulted in defective epididymal coiling in the corpus and caudal regions. The defective coiling did not result from androgen signaling deficiency, as there were no abnormalities in testicular androgen production, AR/ Ar expression, or androgen-responsive genes, and dihydrotestosterone supplementation did not restore epididymal coiling in cultured WDs. Instead, Gata2 deletion led to the loss of epididymal identity, as evidenced by the reduced expression of epididymal mesenchymal markers. The epididymal defect persisted into adulthood, with the uncoiled corpus and caudal epididymis exhibiting abnormal epithelial morphology and lumen environments, resulting in an unfavorable environment for sperm storage. Our results demonstrate the androgen-independent role of mesenchymal GATA2 in promoting epididymal development and highlight the importance of proper fetal development in male reproduction.",

          "abstract": "The predictive coding hypothesis proposes that top–down predictions are compared with incoming bottom–up sensory information, with prediction errors signaling the discrepancies between these inputs. While this hypothesis explains the presence of prediction errors, recent experimental studies suggest that prediction error signals can emerge within a local circuit, that is, from bottom–up sensory input alone. In this paper, we test whether local circuits alone can generate predictive signals by training a recurrent spiking network using local plasticity rules. Our network model replicates experimentally observed features of prediction errors, such as biphasic neural activity patterns and context dependency. Our findings shed light on how synaptic plasticity can shape prediction errors and enable the acquisition and updating of an internal model of sensory input within a recurrent neural network.",

          "abstract": "The magnitude and shape of phenotypic variation depends on properties of the genotype-to-phenotype (GP) map, which itself can evolve over time. The evolution of GP maps is particularly interesting in variable environments, as GP maps can evolve to bias variation in the direction of past selection, increasing the evolvability of the population over time. However, the degree and manner in which environmental variation shapes GP maps and influences evolutionary dynamics may depend on properties of the fitness landscape. To explore how evolutionary dynamics are affected by variable environments across a wide range of different pairs of fitness landscapes, we evolved GP maps to produce spatial-temporal gene expression patterns that matched two-dimensional patterns generated by different elementary cellular automata rules. We found remarkable variation in how populations evolved in variable environments. In some cases, changing the environment helped populations find higher fitness peaks; in others, it hindered them. The evolution of evolvability also depended on the fitness landscape pair. In some experiments, the ability to generate adaptive phenotypic variation upon environment change increased over time, while in some others, populations found shared areas between fitness landscapes. On the other hand, environmental variability consistently resulted in higher fitness landscape exploration, average fitness, and mutational robustness compared to evolution in static environments, which we hypothesize are tightly connected. In conclusion, work presented here sheds light on important general consequences of environmental variability, while also demonstrating dependency on properties of fitness landscapes, which future research on the evolution of evolvability should consider.",

          "abstract": "Motivated by the experimental discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect, we develop a theory of doping-induced transitions out of the ν = 2 / 3 lattice Jain state in the presence of quenched disorder. We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge 2 / 3 anyons leads to a chiral superconductor through a direct second-order transition for a smooth random potential with long-wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. Close to the transition, we show that the superconducting ground state is an “Anomalous Vortex Glass” stabilized in the absence of an external magnetic field. For short-wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge 1 / 3 anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the resulting phase is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with ρ xy = h / e 2 . At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe 2 near ν = 2 / 3 and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.",

          "abstract": "Preventing autoantibody secretion by rendering self-reactive B cells functionally silent through clonal anergy has long posed the question of why fill the circulating B cell repertoire with cells that cannot secrete antibody? Here we address this question from the perspective of B cells that comprise 5 to 10% of the human circulating repertoire, expressing self-reactive surface immunoglobulins employing the IGHV4-34 heavy chain variable element. Using gene targeting to construct mice expressing a representative human IGHV4-34 antibody on the surface of many B cells, we show these cells are prevented from autoantibody secretion by B cell clonal anergy marked by downregulation of surface IgM, induction of tolerance-response mRNAs, and exclusion from the marginal zone and B1 cell subsets. This functionally tolerant state is overridden when the IGHV4-34 B cells cross-react with a virus, which stimulates the self-reactive B cells to hypermutate in germinal centers. Within 16 d of infection, 99% of daughter cells have acquired one of five heavy chain mutations that diminish binding to self but preserve virus binding, and 33% had combined 2 or 3 of these mutations to make their antibodies genetically self-tolerant and virus specific. These results demonstrate, from the perspective of a pathologically important human autoantibody class and the world’s most successful virus vaccine, how human antibody specificity is sculpted in the progeny of anergic B cells to yield antibodies that bind a virus but not self.",

There are thousands of new hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths per week in the United States, many of whom develop long COVID. Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here, we report an untargeted, longitudinal plasma metabolomics study of COVID-19 patients. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. Targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a preexisting contributor to disease trajectory—patients that show aberrant one-carbon metabolite levels and that are homozygous for the MTHFR C677T, have higher incidence of severe COVID. Our results raise the possibility that MTHFR variant status may inform precision COVID-19 treatment strategies.",

          "abstract": "Motile cilia are eukaryotic organelles with essential chemo- and mechanosensing functions across evolution, from single cell organisms to humans. Motile cilia of the mammalian nervous, respiratory, and reproductive systems are characterized by unique motility proteins to generate fluid flow essential for transporting metabolites and removing mucus. The molecular mechanism underlying motile cilia assembly remains unknown. Here, we use high-resolution imaging, proteomics, in situ cryotomography, and single-molecule motility assays to identify mammalian KIF27, a motor protein of the Kinesin-4 family and homologue of the Hedgehog pathway regulator COS2/KIF7, as a key regulator of motile cilia assembly in vivo. We show that KIF27 promotes the integrity of the transition zone (TZ), a diffusion barrier situated at the cilium base. Loss of KIF27 results in specific and profound defects in axonemal structure and disrupts cilia beating, which collectively lead to organismal phenotypes that recapitulate primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). We show that the motile properties of KIF27 are dispensable for its function in motile cilia assembly. Instead, KIF27 acts as a microtubule scaffold to regulate the TZ architecture and enable correct ciliary incorporation of motility-generating proteins. Given that KIF27 orthologues exist in different evolutionarily lineages, we propose that the ancestral activity of KIF27/KIF7 kinesins was to form a microtubule-associated scaffold for protein–protein interactions pertinent to cilia formation and signaling. The transition-zone-associated KIF27 activities may represent a general building principle for the motile cilia assembly in diverse species and cell types.",

          "abstract": "Cement-based products sequester CO 2 in the atmosphere throughout their life cycle. The extent of sequestration highly depends on the context. We implement a bottom–up model of different cement end-use applications (buildings, pavements, bridges, pipelines, and other infrastructure) in the United States and Mexico to estimate the in-use and end-of-life carbon uptake in cement. We show that carbon uptake in 2024 could sequester approximately 13% of process emissions associated with cement consumption, which is around 6.7 Mt CO 2 . We observe a four-fold variation in the uptake per square area across all the states due to regional differences in the distribution of building types, concrete mix designs, and climates. The building sector uptake is almost twice as large as infrastructure systems. In Mexico, the current stock of cement-based products sequesters around one-quarter of the industry’s annual process emissions, implying the importance of local differences in end-use context, which can dramatically alter the extent of carbon uptake. Where prudent, enhancing carbon uptake in cement-based products is a valuable strategy to move toward carbon neutrality in the construction sector. The findings in this paper provide a fundamental shift in understanding how anthropogenic materials interact with the carbon cycle, which changes how national greenhouse gas inventories are calculated.",

However, the extent to which EV ncRNAs resemble overall cellular RNAs and the benefits to host cells of packaging them into EVs remain unknown. Here, we purified EVs from the culture media of mouse and human cells and characterized their RNA components using high-throughput sequencing and Northern blotting. We report that EVs are enriched for numerous aberrant ncRNAs, including ncRNA fragments, ncRNAs that have failed to mature, and short structured introns. Many RNAs contain oligouridine tails, a modification that can promote degradation by DIS3L2, an exoribonuclease that degrades defective structured ncRNAs. Both the numbers of EVs released and the fractions of tailed RNAs in EVs increase on DIS3L2 depletion, indicating that EV packaging of aberrant ncRNAs occurs in competition with DIS3L2 decay. Multiple type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are upregulated on DIS3L2 depletion, and cells treated with a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor that reduces exosome biogenesis show moderate ISG upregulation, an effect that is enhanced in DIS3L2-depleted cells and accompanied by accumulation of aberrant ncRNAs in cellular RNA. Thus, DIS3L2 degradation and packaging of aberrant RNAs into vesicles may prevent these RNAs from activating innate immune sensors and triggering an interferon response.",

Here, using Cd as a model system, we demonstrate that the formation of a metastable intermediate, Cd 2 SO 4 (OH) 2 , plays a crucial role in facilitating the efficient electrochemical reduction of low-concentration Cd(II) to metallic Cd 0 in acidic solutions. A combination of experimental and theoretical analyses reveals that in situ generated OH − at the cathode, in conjunction with bulk-phase SO 4 2− , drives the formation of this metal-inorganic complex, which mediates electron transfer by overcoming redox limitations. By optimizing flow dynamics and incorporating hierarchical electrode configurations, we enhance intermediate formation and achieve 96.81% Cd recovery from real AMD, with effluent Cd concentrations below 0.5 mg L −1 . Economic analysis estimates a net-positive return of 2.32 CNY per ton of treated AMD. Life cycle assessment further shows that the electroextraction process substantially outperforms lime neutralization with respect to all major environmental indicators. This work establishes a mechanistically driven, economically viable, and environmentally superior strategy for recovering valuable metals from AMD, advancing the prospects of circular resource recovery and sustainable wastewater management.",

          "abstract": "We all likely agree that tactile experience contributes to the emergence of the feeling of ownership over one’s own body. Is the opposite true? We answered this question by testing whether and how the sense of body ownership gates our tactile experience. In two experiments, we exploited a well-known multisensory illusion (Rubber Hand Illusion) to induce participants to feel a fake hand as belonging to their body, while their own hand was left in a disembodiment state (illusory-phases). After each illusory phase, a tactile stimulus was delivered to either the fake (embodied) hand or the real (disembodied) hand (testing-phases). Experiment 1 shows that the illusory phase significantly modulates the subjective feeling of touch experienced in the testing-phase, increasing tactile sensations when participants observed the fake (embodied) hand being touched (visual-touch), and decreasing them when the real (disembodied) hand was touched (real-touch). Experiment 2 investigated, by using TMS-EEG, the neural mechanism supporting this diametrical modulation of subjective feeling of touch, focusing on alpha-band oscillatory networks as the neural correlate of somatosensory awareness. S1 alpha-band connectivity fully matches the behavioral results, significantly increasing in visual-touch and decreasing in real-touch. In both experiments, a greater embodiment experienced in the illusory-phase significantly predicted higher behavioral and neurofunctional responses to visual-touch and lower responses to real-touch in the testing-phase. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the sense of body ownership exerts a top-down modulation on tactile awareness and may do so by increasing or decreasing the strength of the somatosensory network involved in tactile awareness.",

          "abstract": "In sign languages, linguistic information is transmitted through the simultaneous movement of several bodily articulators. This study investigates cortical tracking of sign language and whether experience and knowledge of sign language can modulate the tracking. We used a camera with a depth sensor to record videos of semispontaneous sign language narratives while tracking articulators’ movement in 3D space. These videos served to characterize the temporal periodicity of the sign language visual signal and as stimuli for the experiment. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we recorded the neurophysiological activity of two groups of hearing participants—proficient signers and sign-naive individuals—while they watched videos in a known and unknown sign language. Coherence between the preprocessed MEG data and the visual linguistic signal extracted from different articulators was used as measure of brain-language tracking. The results show that neural activity tracks sign language input in delta frequency band (0.5 to 2.5 Hz), reflecting the slower periodicity associated with articulator movements. Both groups of participants show similar tracking in occipital areas, reflecting low-level visual processing of the videos. Proficient signers show stronger synchronization compared to sign-naive controls for linguistically relevant articulators in the right temporal cortex. Proficient signers also show greater tracking for the known compared to the unknown sign language. These findings confirm that cortical tracking of language is a feature of language processing beyond the auditory domain, and is modulated by language experience.",

          "abstract": "Intercalary meristems (IcMs), specialized developmental zones that drive rapid stem elongation in monocots, exhibit distinct spatiotemporal dynamics; however, their genetic basis remains poorly understood due to their transient activity and cellular heterogeneity. Moso bamboo ( Phyllostachys edulis )—with its exceptional daily growth rates of up to 114.5 cm, prolonged IcM activity spanning 45 to 60 d, and large, accessible culm structure—provides an ideal system for building a comprehensive IcM cell atlas. Here, we integrated a chromosome-level genome assembly of Moso bamboo with a high-resolution anatomical atlas to delineate three critical developmental stages of IcM activity: the initial cell division phase (ID), the rapid cell division phase (RD), and the rapid cell elongation phase (RE). By combining single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics, we reconstructed a dynamic single-nucleus transcriptomic continuum spanning from proliferative to elongation states. Multiomics integration, along with in situ hybridization and ultrastructural imaging, identified IcM cells as short-columnar cells adjacent to elongating ground tissue parenchyma (Gp) cells, with the IcM1 subpopulation functioning as stem-like cells essential for maintaining the proliferative capacity. Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis revealed transcriptional transitions from stem-like IcM states to differentiated Gp cells. Functional experiments revealed that clrGene008562 , a WOX2 homolog, enhances callus regeneration, indicating its potential role in promoting cell division and differentiation processes relevant to IcM development. These findings provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular framework for understanding IcM function and offer valuable multiomics resources for advancing meristem research in bamboo and other Poaceae species.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years has necessitated the development of effective charging infrastructures. However, charging infrastructure expansion is a multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration of the existing infrastructure, spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands, power-grid capacity, and budget constraints. To approach this complex problem, we present charge-map , a data-driven simulation-optimization framework, focused on ensuring meaningful charging experience for individual EV owners. charge-map integrates three modules: an agent-based simulation module that estimates spatiotemporal distribution of charging demands by modeling EV adopter mobility and charging behavior; an optimization module that determines optimal new charging station/charger locations and capacities, while minimizing expected detour distances and wait-times with a limited number of new stations; and a power module that determines how to connect the stations to the power grid while maintaining its stability. Using the state of Virginia (consisting of 95 counties and 38 independent cities) as a case study, our results show that charge-map can meet the demand of ∼ 198,600 predicted EVs with 1,305 new public charging stations and 2,164 new chargers. It reduces average detour distances for charging by 66% and wait-times at stations by 72% compared to the existing infrastructure. Furthermore, transformer capacity requirement analysis reveals that only 1.8% of residential transformers require upgrades, while over 80% of commercial charging locations can be supported with modest transformer infrastructure (25 to 50 kVA). This indicates that targeted investments can facilitate cost-effective EV integration. Consequently, charge-map provides policymakers and urban planners with crucial data-driven insights for effective EV charging infrastructure expansion.",

In the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , polymorphic TgrB1 and TgrC1 proteins are used to bind sister cells and exclude cheaters, but it remains unknown how cells continually generate their extreme genetic diversity. Here, we created a collection of chromosome-length, whole genome sequences from 10 D. discoideum isolates and sister species to understand the evolution of the large tgr gene family. Our dataset includes AX2-214, a widely used D. discoideum lab strain, as well as complete genomes for two Chlamydia -like endosymbionts harbored within amoebae. We find that tgrB1 and C1 lie in a hypermutational hotspot, with haplotypes that undergo repeated intralocus recombination, duplications, transpositions, and inversions. These structural dynamics are highly localized adjacent to tgrB and C , resulting in the gain and loss of dozens of genes. The tgrBC genes themselves frequently duplicate and recombine, leading to the rapid generation of unique tgrBC repertoires. In the broader tgr gene family, some genes (e.g., tgrN ) are single copy and syntenic across all the genomes, whereas others (e.g., tgrA ) prolifically duplicate at similar rates to Dictyostelium transposons. Thus, the tgr genes are among the most rapidly evolving families genome-wide. We propose that the intense diversification within the tgrBC locus can help explain how these genes acquire such extreme levels of polymorphism, with parallels to the MHC immune genes in mammals and other allorecognition systems. This collection of amoeba genomes is also a useful resource for future comparative genomics and molecular evolution studies in Amoebozoa.",

The challenge then asks whether these steps work together in natural geological environments, absent human intervention. Here, we analyze a six-step Discontinuous Synthesis Model (DSM) for the prebiotic formation of RNA, proposed to be the first informational molecule to support Darwinian evolution, and life, on Earth and/or Mars. DSM requires that borate in multiple steps guide the formation of pentoses from simple carbohydrates and control phosphorylation, in all cases by binding adjacent HO-groups on key intermediates. However, adjacent HO-groups must react in two other steps, which borate might inhibit. Experiments here show that borate does not inhibit these two other steps, but rather facilitates them. This makes the six-step DSM a “no human intervention” route from simple precursors (1 to 3 carbons, 0 to 2 nitrogens) to oligomeric RNA with predominately 3’,5’-linkages at least 6 nucleotides long, but possibly much longer. The process i) exploits privileged chemistry in ii) intermittently irrigated aquifers constrained by basalt that iii) have borate iv) above a redox-neutral mantle v) having access to an atmosphere transiently reduced by a Vesta-sized impactor. In a possible coincidence, such an impact occurred most likely ca. 4.3 billion years ago (Ga), ~100 Mya before some molecular clocks date the divergence of the three kingdoms of life on Earth (4.2 Ga), and ca. 200 Mya before isotopically “light” carbon is reported in zircons dated at 4.1 Ga.

However, gene deletion studies failed to identify a clear functional role for OCLN, despite multiple phenotypic alterations. Importantly, previous studies targeting exon 3 allowed expression of a splice variant starting at exon 4 (isoform 4), that expresses the full carboxy-terminal tail. Here we show that the OCLN carboxy terminus forms a complex with the light intermediate chain (LIC) of dynein to link tight junction cargo to the minus end directed motor protein. Mutational analysis revealed S471 phosphorylation promotes binding to the LIC while S490 phosphorylation is required for trafficking. Expressing OCLN S490A mutant prevented endothelial cell proliferation and collateral angiogenesis. Ocln gene deletion targeting exon 5, preventing full-length and isoform 4 expression, resulted in embryonic lethality. In summary, OCLN links tight junction cargo to the dynein motor, regulating trafficking in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and contributing to both vascular endothelial growth factor-induced vascular permeability and collateral angiogenesis.",

While the influence of boundary-dependent environmental geometry on spatial representations has been extensively studied in 2D spaces, less is known about the role of boundaries for volumetric spatial memory. Research in humans and other animals has demonstrated distinct processing of the vertical and horizontal spatial dimensions, likely related to species-specific modes of locomotion. Here, we investigate whether different locomotion modes, flying and walking, affect the use of vertical boundaries, leading to possibly distinct volumetric representations. In a Virtual Reality experiment, human participants memorized objects within a symmetric 3D enclosure, and then were asked to replace them in either the familiar or geometrically deformed environments. We found that the flying group exhibited lower vertical than horizontal spatial memory precision, whereas the walking group showed the opposite pattern, an effect related to using their body axis as a vertical “ruler”. Within deformed environments, object replacements in the flying group followed the predictions from a 3D-extended boundary-vector-cell-like computational model of spatial mapping that treated all boundaries equally, whereas those in the walking condition favored a modified model that prioritized the ground boundary. Our findings suggest that gravity-related movement constraints promote different utilization of geometric and body-related cues, resulting in flexible representations of volumetric space.",

          "abstract": "Strong coupling photonics, in which coupling strengths significantly exceed decay factors, holds great promise for applications in energy conversion and information processing. However, the effective and scalable design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures requires precise determination of the transition boundaries between strong and weak coupling regions. Traditional trial-and-error methods and classical machine learning (ML) algorithms struggle to achieve this due to the inherent difficulty in measuring decay factors during coupling. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid ML framework that integrates physics-informed modeling with uncertainty quantification. This approach enables accurate determination of strong–weak coupling transition boundaries—even with inaccessible decay factors. By leveraging this capability, our method facilitates efficient and large-scale design of strongly coupled polaritonic structures with sparse data, achieving a computational speedup of ~10 4 times compared to conventional simulations. Guided by this framework, we experimentally constructed a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) polariton coupling structure and observed strong coupling via near-field spectroscopy. This work establishes a generalizable optimization methodology for strongly coupled photonic devices, opening a broad avenue for polariton-enhanced energy conversion and optical information modulation.",

To systematically address these barriers, we i) introduced a high surface-area Ni-based anode specifically selected for enhancing HOR kinetics and minimizing solvent oxidation; ii) substituted the conventionally used tetrahydrofuran solvent with dimethoxyethane (DME) to significantly improve chemical stability; and iii) developed a tailored flow cell configuration to enhance gas–liquid mass transport and stabilize reaction intermediates. Employing in-situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we provided direct evidence of stabilized calcium nitride formation, elucidating the crucial roles of solvent stability and electrode composition in sustaining reactive intermediates. As a result of these combined innovations, our system demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 34.35 ± 1.76% in short-term tests and sustaining ~20% FE over extended continuous operation (~56 h). At elevated current densities, the improved gas–liquid interface stability enables robust ammonia production, reaching partial current densities of approximately 219 mA cm − 2 at ~29% FE. Isotope-labeling studies with 15 N 2 confirmed the direct electroreduction of N 2 , while kinetic analyses underscored the impact of anode material selection on HOR efficiency and overall electrochemical stability.

          "abstract": "Multicellular organisms utilize epithelial folding to achieve remarkable three-dimensional forms. During embryonic development, stereotypical epithelial folds emerge from underlying active cellular and molecular processes including cell shape change and differential cell growth. However, the origin of epithelial folding in early animals and how folding may be harnessed in synthetic systems remain open questions. Here, we identify a modality of behavior-induced epithelial folding and unfolding arising from cilia–substrate adhesion and ciliary walking in the basal animal Trichoplax adhaerens (phylum Placozoa). We show that T. adhaerens is capable of exhibiting dynamic nonstereotyped folding states, providing a 3D perspective to an organism previously only characterized in its 2D state. We correlate these folding states to local substrate geometry, revealing that the animal conforms to available substrate surface area, promoting the maintenance of a folded state. Using 4D fluorescence light sheet microscopy, we characterize fold geometry, curvature evolution during unfolding, and the nonstereotypy of unfolding behavior. Through repeated unfolding trials, we reveal the robustness and timescales associated with unfolding behavior and employ scaling analysis and toy model simulations to establish how collective ciliary activity can robustly drive unfolding. In this way, despite lacking any folding–unfolding “pathway,” transitions between folding and unfolding states emerge as a function of the animal’s environment and motility. Our work reveals a remarkable behavior exhibited by a brainless, nerveless animal, and demonstrates the capacity for 3D–2D transitions in folding epithelial sheets using ciliary activity.",

ATM plays a central role in regulating cellular responses to DNA breakage [M. B. Kastan, J. Bartek, Nature 432 , 316–323 (2004)], but several cellular and physiologic abnormalities associated with ATM dysfunction suggest the possibility of noncanonical roles for ATM as well. Herein, we identified the HSP90 paralogue, GRP94, as an ATM interactor/substrate and found that ATM influences N- glycosylation of GRP94 and its subsequent activation/translocation to the plasma membrane, where it serves as a scaffold protein and stabilizer for several membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as EGFR and IGF1-R. In selected cell types, ATM loss/inhibition resulted in increased cell surface expression of RTKs and overactivation of RTK pathways, alterations that were rescued by specific inhibition of cell surface GRP94. This ATM/GRP94 pathway also regulated the activation of microglial cells, manifest as increased cytokine production and phagocytosis activity associated with ATM loss/inhibition and reversal of that activation with GRP94 inhibition. These results identified GRP94 as an ATM interactor and apparent substrate and demonstrated specific critical regulatory roles for ATM outside of DNA damage signaling. These insights provide potential explanations for several of the phenotypes associated with ATM dysfunction and potential opportunities for novel approaches to blunt clinical symptoms in A-T, and also suggest that other neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders might benefit from selective inhibition of cell surface GRP94.",

Our model shares with the classic neutral theory of biodiversity the assumption that all species are equivalent, but crucially differs in requiring cooperation between species for replication. With low migration, our model displays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode associated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for maintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at very small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the steady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for diversity, number of species, and residence times.

Here, we revisit the August 2003 heat wave in France, a canonical event in a region with rich climate and mortality data, to understand these influences. We find that standard heat–mortality exposure–response functions underpredict excess deaths in August 2003 by 55% but that accounting for the temporally compounding effects of hot days better matches observed mortality. After accounting for compounding effects and applying a machine learning approach to single-event climate attribution, we attribute 6,079 deaths in August 2003 to climate change.

In rodents, tactile sensation, a fundamental sense, is largely mediated via the vibrissae and the barrel cortex. However, it remains unclear how tactile perception reshape the brain when exploring a novel environment. Here, we showed that exposure to an enriched environment (EE) failed to enhance adult neurogenesis and cognition in the mice with defective touch perception due to loss of a mechanotransduction channel Piezo2 in Merkel cells. Moreover, we found an EE-activated neuraxis, in which the dentate gyrus received tactile input through a circuit that originated from the somatosensory cortex (S1) and relayed via dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Defective touch perception diminished the S1 to SNc afferent, thereby reducing dopamine release. Notably, stimulation of the S1 to SNc afferent restored EE-induced adult neurogenesis and cognition in the mice with defective touch perception. Therefore, our study highlighted the important role of intact tactile processing in brain function.",

          "abstract": "Many coral reefs have fish stocks that are depleted below the level at which sustainable production is maximized. Lower production means that millions of people are losing out on potential food, income, and livelihoods. Rebuilding these stocks to maximize sustainable production can contribute toward ending hunger and malnutrition but requires active and effective fisheries management. Yet, for fish stock recovery plans to be implemented, recovery benefits, targets, and timeframes need to be quantified. Here, using 1,211 individual reef sites and 23 jurisdictions identified globally as being below maximum sustainable production levels, we show that reefs have the potential to increase sustainable yields by nearly 50% if allowed to recover toward their maximum production levels. For individual jurisdictions, this recovery represents from 20,000 up to 162 million additional sustainable servings of reef fish per year in comparison to current sustainable production, meeting recommended seafood intake for up to 1.4 million additional people a year. However, such growth and food provisioning will require fish stocks to double their standing biomass (increase by a median of 32 t/km 2 ). Recovery timeframes range from 6.4 y under the most stringent scenario (a moratorium) to 49.7 y under the maximum harvest scenario that results in recovery. We find that locations with the greatest potential for sustainable gains in yield are among those with the greatest food and micronutrient deficiencies, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in recovering fish assemblages to achieve their maximum sustainable potential.",

SPPL2a contains nine transmembrane helices with a conserved fold for the SPP and presenilin families. In the ligand-free state, an antiparallel β-hairpin is already formed near the active site, reminiscent of presenilin 1 (PS1) in its substrate-bound state. Binding by the small molecule inhibitor L685,458 triggers further conformational rearrangement in SPPL2a. Together with the cryo-EM structure of compound E-bound PS1, our findings reveal insights into selective inhibitor recognition and substrate gating by aspartyl intramembrane proteases.

In contrast, CAR T cells targeting solid tumors do not encounter cognate antigen in the periphery, resulting in limited expansion and subtherapeutic peak concentrations. To overcome this, we engineered dual-targeted and dual-costimulated CAR T cells (CD19/28ζ-M5BBζ) that recognize CD19+ B cells, thereby promoting peripheral expansion and increasing the pool of solid tumor-directed CAR T cells available for tumor infiltration without the need for lymphodepletion. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma, these dual-targeted CAR T cells demonstrated enhanced peripheral expansion, improved anti-tumor efficacy, and increased survival without added dysfunction or toxicity compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. We translated our findings to human CAR T cells by developing a pancreatic/xenograft model with CD19 + B cells in the periphery and again demonstrated that treatment with dual CAR T cells showed significantly enhanced tumor clearance and survival compared to single antigen-targeted CAR T cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that dual-targeted CAR T cells boost peripheral expansion, and anti-tumor efficacy, providing a strategy for enhancing outcomes for patients treated with clinical CAR T products targeting solid tumors.",

However, there have been no guaranteed routes of microfluidics that can achieve widespread adoption in mainstream chemistry and biomedical research. Inspired by the cooperative multiple cilia of biological organisms and tissues to generate flow, we propose an open microfluidic platform, lab on an end (LoE), to pump spatially and temporally continuous flow for multifunctional micromanipulation with the acoustohydrodynamic pillar array as an end effector. LoE brings together the micromanipulation of individual entities, liquid operations, and cell processing onto an acoustic end effector. These operations are mainly driven by acoustic radiation and two unique frequency-dependent microstreaming profiles: out-of-plane vortex near a single pillar and in-plane transmission flow surrounding the entire pillar array. Applications in embryo engineering, local morphological phenotyping of Caenorhabditis elegans for neuron research, efficient chemical reactions, and multifunctional cell processing indicate that the LoE could potentially lead to breakthroughs in understanding and using microfluidics. Its capability of integrating multiple sequential processes, inherent high accessibility, easy use, and low cost provide an end-to-end solution to mainstream chemistry and biomedical research.",

Evidence of acute health effects of wildfire particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is growing, but less is known about long-term effects related to repeated exposures. Using a cohort of 1,250,083 Kaiser Permanente Southern California members aged ≥60, we estimated the association between all-cause mortality and 3-y exposure to five different census tract–level wildfire smoke metrics (mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 , mean daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 during the peak wildfire week, number of days with daily wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 0 μg/m 3 , number of weeks with average wildfire-specific PM 2.5 &gt; 5 μg/m 3 , and number of smoke waves). We applied a discrete-time approach with pooled logistic regressions, adjusting for sex, age, race and ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, requiring an interpreter, calendar year, and census tract–level poverty and population density. When comparing those highly exposed (95th percentile) to those minimally exposed (5th percentile), we found an increased odds of mortality across all five wildfire smoke metrics. Mean daily wildfire PM 2.5 was the metric most strongly associated with mortality (odds ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.09). We observed greater vulnerability to the long-term effects of smoke for individuals under age 75, or with Black or Other racial/ethnic identity, or living in a census tract with higher poverty. Identifying the most harmful long-term wildfire smoke metric and most-at-risk populations can help focus attention for developing effective adaptation strategies in a changing climate.",

In a randomized, double-blind crossover study of 110 young women, we examined how exogenous estradiol (E2) modulates threat neurocircuitry, timed precisely to ovarian phase. E2 increased engagement of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and, in the early luteal phase, reduced central and corticomedial amygdala reactivity to threat in women with little trauma history, but not those with PTSD. Fluctuations in E2 therefore modulate neural responses to threat, and sensitivity to these fluctuations may underlie women’s heightened vulnerability to stress-related disorders.",

A popular mouse model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), could serve to develop such a therapy, provided we can better understand the nature and importance of the autoantibodies involved. Here, we report the finding of autoantibody-secreting extrafollicular plasmablasts in EAE induced with specific myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antigens. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that these cells produce nonaffinity-matured IgG antibodies. These include pathogenic antibodies competing for shared binding space on MOG’s extracellular domain. Interestingly, the synthetic anti-MOG antibody 8-18C5 can prevent the binding of pathogenic antibodies from either EAE mice or people with MOG antibody disease. Moreover, an 8-18C5 variant carrying the NNAS mutation, which inactivates its effector functions, can reduce EAE severity and promote functional recovery. In brief, this study provides not only a comprehensive characterization of the humoral response in EAE models but also a proof of concept for a therapy to antagonize pathogenic anti-MOG antibodies.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between magnetism and flat-band (FB) instability is a central theme in quantum materials research. A striking example is the emergence of magnetic order in a nominally nonmagnetic compound when a flat band is tuned near the Fermi energy ( E F ). In this study, we investigate this phenomenon in the Pauli paramagnet SrCo 2 As 2 , where an FB associated with Co e g orbitals lies close to E F . Remarkably, a minute substitution of the nonmagnetic element Pd onto the Co site ( ∼ 2%) induces antiferromagnetic order with a transition temperature as high as T N = 25 K. Temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent magnetic and transport measurements, complemented by zero-field neutron diffraction, reveal a helical magnetic order for x ≤ 0.10 in Sr(Co 1− x Pd x ) 2 As 2 , transitioning to a complex ferromagnetic state at higher Pd concentrations. Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical band structure calculations demonstrate that electron doping shifts the flat band closer to E F , significantly enhancing the Stoner parameter. This enhancement drives a strong ferromagnetic instability, leading to helical magnetic ordering dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic interactions. The emergence of robust magnetic ordering through substitution with nonmagnetic elements is a unique phenomenon that underscores the pivotal role of flat-band instability in tuning magnetism in itinerant systems.",

For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the “dynamical climate” of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, its variant, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness have been achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. In addition, two real-world ecological benchmark datasets: the microbial time-series dataset and global population dynamics database, are tested to demonstrate the applicability of the meta-learning framework to the real world.

          "abstract": "Oxytocin, a hormone linked to reproduction and health, may mediate life-history trade-offs across the human life course. Yet, how oxytocin naturally varies with age remains poorly understood. Here, working with the Tsimane, forager-horticulturalists of lowland Bolivia, we collected the largest sample of oxytocin measurements to date (n = 1,242 samples, n = 405 individuals, age = 2 to 84 y, 51% female), and i) examined how oxytocin varies throughout the life course in females and males, and ii) investigated potential drivers of age- and sex-specific variation. Our sample provides rare insight into the relationship between oxytocin and age in a context where energy is limited and trade-offs between reproduction and somatic maintenance are more salient. We found that oxytocin follows a nonlinear sex-specific trajectory throughout the life course. In females, oxytocin levels were high during the reproductive years and declined in the early to midforties, a pattern largely explained by breastfeeding and, to a lesser extent, childcare and good self-rated health. In males, oxytocin was low in early adulthood but high in old age, and although higher oxytocin was linked to good self-rated health, this did not explain the rise in oxytocin in later life. These findings suggest that oxytocin is instrumental for reproduction and caregiving in females and may also be associated with health in both males and females. Together, our work highlights oxytocin’s broader biological significance across the human life course, suggesting that it may play a pivotal role in coordinating age- and sex-specific trade-offs involving reproduction and health.",

          "abstract": "Physical exercise affects multiple physiological processes, including those regulated by hormones, such as energy balance, stress responses, and pain perception. The prohormone precursor proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gives rise to β-endorphin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, β-lipotropin, and the melanocyte-stimulating hormones (MSH), which act through melanocortin (MC1-5) and opioid receptors to influence these key physiological responses. Here, we identified a mechanism by which full-length POMC interacts with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) in the circulation. In healthy adults, the fraction of plasma POMC associated with sEVs increased fourfold following intense exercise, despite unchanged POMC and sEV concentrations. POMC-positive sEVs contained leukocyte or megakaryocyte/platelet markers, suggesting hematopoietic origin. A substantial subset of circulating sEVs expressed MC1–MC5 and μ-opioid receptors, and coimmunoisolation assays demonstrated binding of unprocessed POMC to MC1 and MC3 receptors. Molecular modeling indicated that POMC undergoes pH-dependent conformational changes that favor MC binding, a finding corroborated by in vitro binding assays under acidic conditions. Functionally, addition of POMC-positive sEVs to B16-F10 melanoma cells induced melanogenesis, consistent with POMC-derived MSH activity. The sEV-associated POMC had higher rates of transport than unbound POMC in assays mimicking the blood–brain barrier. These findings establish that exercise-induced, pH-dependent binding of POMC to circulating sEVs may facilitate hormone precursor transport and potentially influence transfer across the blood–brain barrier. This mechanism represents a separate paradigm for endocrine regulation, providing insight into how exercise modulates sEV interactions with systemic hormone distribution and signaling.",

          "abstract": "Tumor cells heavily depend on proteasome-mediated protein turnover, making the proteasome an attractive therapeutic target. Clinically, proteasome inhibitors are effective against hematologic cancers but show limited success with solid tumors, and the reasons for this difference are not well understood. Activation of yes-associated protein (YAP)/TAZ, the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, is a key mechanism behind drug resistance in cancers. Here, we demonstrate that proteasome stress acts as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway in solid tumor cells. When the proteasome is inhibited, RAP2 undergoes ubiquitination and becomes inactive, which in turn disrupts the RAP2–MAP4Ks–NF2–LATS1/2 signaling pathway, leading to the activation of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ activation promotes cell survival and resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Conversely, blocking YAP/TAZ can overcome this resistance and restore cancer cell sensitivity to these drugs. In diffuse-type gastric cancer—an aggressive solid tumor with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options—combined inhibition of the proteasome and YAP/TAZ effectively suppresses tumor growth. Therefore, this study identifies proteasome stress as an upstream signal of the Hippo pathway and provides a mechanistic basis for combination cancer therapy.",

          "abstract": "Like human decision-making under real-world constraints, artificial neural networks may balance free exploration in parameter space with task-relevant adaptation. In this study, we identify consistent signatures of criticality during neural network training and provide theoretical evidence that such scaling behavior arises naturally from information-driven self-organization: a dynamic balance between the maximum entropy principle that promotes unbiased exploration and mutual information constraint that relates updates with task objective. We numerically demonstrate that the power-law exponent of updates remains stable throughout training, supporting the presence of self-organized criticality. Furthermore, we show that the loss landscape exhibits exponential ruggedness under small perturbations, transitioning to power-law ruggedness at larger scales, in the absence of mini-batch noise, indicating an intrinsic geometric landscape. We also observe a power-law distribution in the intervals between large updates, indicating an intermittent learning process. Together, these findings suggest that neural network learning reflects a nonequilibrium process governed by the fundamental trade-off between randomness and relevance, highlighting its dynamic nature and offering insights into the interpretability of AI systems.",

This literature review summarizes recent evidence from multiple domains on the acquisition of world-class performance. We review published papers and synthesize developmental patterns of international top scientists, musicians, athletes, and chess players. The available evidence is highly consistent across domains: (i) Young exceptional performers and later adult world-class performers are largely two discrete populations over time. (ii) Early (e.g., youth) exceptional performance is associated with extensive discipline-specific practice, little or no multidisciplinary practice, and fast early progress. (iii) By contrast, adult world-class performance is associated with limited discipline-specific practice, increased multidisciplinary practice, and gradual early progress. These discoveries advance understanding of the development of the highest echelons of human achievement.",

In this study, we established a gastric CSC population marked by the water channel protein aquaporin-5 (AQP5), which resides in human and mouse pyloric tumors. Using multiple organoid and mouse models, we found a requirement for AQP5 + CSCs in both initiating and sustaining cancer progression and demonstrated that AQP5 expression also directly promotes tumor growth and invasion in a WNT, PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)–dependent manner. Beyond primary cancers, AQP5 further enriches for a functional CSC population in metastatic tumors.

In this study, by combining a suite of operando microscopy methods, we explored electrode strain evolution and observed intricate particle cluster rearrangement under electrochemical stimuli. We show that early-stage strain accumulation in intercalation cathodes occurs during the period of interparticle charge transfer and redox reactions stemming from asynchronous coupling and decoupling between chemical (de)intercalation and physical grain motion. This interplay drives heterogeneous redox activity, localized charge equilibration, and multiscale strain cascades that propagate through an asynchronous network of chemical-mechanical interactions. Together, these findings reveal how collective particle dynamics and hierarchical strain transmission dictate electrode deformation and degradation in intercalation cathodes.",

Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified a transient intermediate state within the Src conformational ensemble, positioned between its active and inactive states. This intermediate state facilitates the rapid release of adenosine diphosphate following adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, ensuring efficient catalytic turnover. Depletion of the intermediate state abrogated processive phosphorylation by Src, Lck, and Hck, impairing function.

We identified an estrogen-responsive paracrine pathway in which two enteroendocrine cell types, peptide YY (PYY)–expressing L cells and serotonergic EC cells, communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females. We demonstrate that estrogen signaling up-regulates the bacterial metabolite short-chain fatty acid receptor Olfr78 on colonic L cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells by means of NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain. We propose that hormonal fluctuations, in conjunction with internal (stress) or environmental (diet) factors, amplify this local estrogen-responsive colonic circuit, resulting in maladaptive gut sensitivity.",

In the nonfruiting species Nicotiana benthamiana , CsLOB1 likewise promotes Xanthomonas growth, showing that its activity is not strictly dependent on a ripening program. Transcriptomics and reporter assays revealed PthA4-dependent activation of the Xcc xylan CUT system, triggered by host-derived xylose and including a type II–secreted xylanase. Thus, PthA4-driven cell wall remodeling activates bacterial xylan use, establishing a TIII–TII effector feedforward loop that fuels Xcc proliferation.",

          "abstract": "During eukaryotic transcription, Pol II must overcome nucleosome obstacles and, because of DNA’s helical structure, must also rotate relative to DNA, generating torsional stress. However, there is limited understanding of how Pol II transcribes through nucleosomes while supercoiling DNA. Here, we determined that Pol II generates a torque of 9 pN·nm alone and 13 pN·nm with TFIIS, making it a powerful rotary motor. When Pol II encounters a nucleosome, passage becomes more efficient on a chromatin substrate than on a single-nucleosome substrate, demonstrating that chromatin significantly buffers torsional stress during transcription. Furthermore, topoisomerase supercoiling relaxation allows Pol II to transcribe through multiple nucleosomes. Our results reveal a role of chromatin beyond the more conventional view of it being just a roadblock to transcription.",

Many functional genomic methods, however, require multiple steps that cannot yet be scaled to high throughput, including assays on living cells. Here we develop capsules with amphiphilic gel envelopes (CAGEs), which selectively retain cells and large analytes while being freely accessible to media, enzymes and reagents. Capsules enable high-throughput multistep assays combining live-cell culture with genome-wide readouts. We establish methods for barcoding CAGE DNA libraries, and apply them to measure persistence of gene expression programs in cells by capturing the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of expanding clones in CAGEs. The compatibility of CAGEs with diverse enzymatic reactions will facilitate the expansion of the current repertoire of single-cell, high-throughput measurements and their extension to live-cell assays.",

          "abstract": "The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater on Mars, which once contained a lake of liquid water. We report the rock properties encountered by Perseverance during a ten-kilometer traverse extending over 400 meters in elevation, from beneath Jezero's western sedimentary fan to the upper crater rim. These rocks consist of coarse-grained olivine, magnesium- and iron-carbonates, silica, and phyllosilicates, including some of the oldest materials exposed within Jezero. We infer these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide that caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals. Aqueous alteroverlingation is more pronounced at lower elevations. Higher elevation exposures on the crater rim appear similar to olivine-rich rocks distributed over the wider Nili Fossae region.",

          "abstract": "Continued development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers is essential for advancing molecular imaging in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. A long-standing limitation in radiochemistry for PET imaging has been the lack of general methods for radiolabeling trifluoromethyl (CF 3 ) groups at C(sp 3 ) sites, despite their growing prevalence in bioactive molecules and radiopharmaceuticals. Here, we present a general approach for late-stage installation of either a [ 18 F]CF 3 or [ 11 C]CF 3 group at a C(sp 3 ) site. This method leverages unusual copper-mediated radiotrifluoromethylation of alkyl halides and alkyl carboxylic acids by halogen atom transfer and photoredox catalysis, respectively. More than 50 complex molecules and pharmaceutical agents were efficiently labeled with fluorine-18 ( 18 F) or carbon-11 ( 11 C). Two long-sought-after radioligands, [ 18 F]SL25.1188 and [ 18 F]PS13, were synthesized, providing longer-lived 18 F analogs of their 11 C counterparts with great promise for human PET imaging.",

The conserved AvrBs2 family effectors are among the most important virulence factors in xanthomonads, but how AvrBs2 promotes infection remains elusive. We found that AvrBs2 is a glycerophosphodiesterase-derived synthetase that catalyzes uridine 5′-diphosphate-α- d -galactose into a sugar phosphodiester, bis-(1,6)-cyclic dimeric α- d -galactose-phosphate, which is referred to as xanthosan. Xanthosan is synthesized by AvrBs2 in host cells and released into apoplastic spaces. Xanthomonas bacteria uptake xanthosan through the XanT transporter and hydrolyze it through the XanP phosphodiesterase for nutrition. AvrBs2, XanT, and XanP form a xanthosan “generation-uptake-utilization” system to provide a dedicated nutritional strategy to feed xanthomonads. Furthermore, elucidation of the AvrBs2-XanT-XanP virulence mechanism inspired us to develop an “anti-nutrition” strategy that should be applicable to control a wide variety of Xanthomonas diseases.",

          "abstract": "From populations of multicellular organisms to selfish genetic elements, conflicts between levels of biological organization are central to evolution. Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that face selective pressures from their hosts but also compete within the host cell for replication resources. Although theory indicates that within-cell selection matters for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of these dynamics has remained elusive. We measured within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterized their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time owing to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends nontrivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Heat extremes pose substantial health risks during pregnancy and early childhood. High humidity exacerbates heat strain, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly understood. We compare the effect of prenatal exposure to extreme humid heat versus heat alone on child growth in South Asia, where high rates of child stunting meet rapidly accelerating hot-humid extremes. After adjusting for sociodemographic, seasonal, and spatial confounders, we use within-community variation in children’s ages to isolate the impact of prenatal exposures. We find that hot-humid exposures are much more detrimental to health than hot temperatures alone, with the potential to increase stunting in South Asia by over 3 million children by 2050. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for humidity when estimating and localizing climate change impacts.",

          "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease with no effective curative therapies. Necroptosis, a regulated necrotic cell death pathway controlled by receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), has emerged as a potential driver of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic liver disorders. We investigated the role of necroptosis in PSC and whether RIPK1 inhibition could modify disease course and progression. Spatial profiling of human PSC biopsies revealed that necroptosis primarily affects cholangiocytes, while apoptosis was more frequent in hepatocytes and nonbiliary cells. In vitro, necroptosis inhibition protected cholangiocytes, and RIPK1 deletion conferred resistance to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. In a murine model of PSC, pharmacological RIPK1 inhibition reduced cholestatic injury, hepatic inflammation, and biliary fibrosis. Multiomic analyses comprehensively demonstrated reprogramming toward wild-type–like profiles following treatment. These findings identify necroptosis as a critical effector in PSC and highlight RIPK1 inhibition as a promising disease-modifying approach, opening the door to targeted necroptosis-based therapies for this otherwise untreatable disease.",

The induction of auxin signaling by immune receptors for antiviral immunity is poorly understood despite its notable role in plant defense against viral pathogens. Here, we report that plant NLR Sw-5b initiates and amplifies auxin signaling through auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAAs)–ARF19 and YUC8–transport inhibitor response1/auxin-signaling F-box (TIR1/AFB) modules to promote callose-mediated antiviral defense. Upon recognizing viral effector, Sw-5b associates with and relieves repressors Aux/IAAs on transcription factor ARF19. ARF19 then activates callose synthase gene GSL5/8 to deposit callose at plasmodesmata, inhibiting viral cell-to-cell spread. Meanwhile, ARF19 activates auxin biosynthesis gene YUC8 to boost auxin production; this further amplifies callose deposition signaling via TIR1/AFB receptors and Aux/IAAs-ARF19–glucan synthase-like (GSL) module, thereby restricting the virus in localized cell death. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism by which plant immune receptors induce phytohormone signaling pathways to combat pathogens.",

We used mass spectrometry to interrogate vaccinia virus infection to reveal that up to 90% of epitopes were presented as fast as their source proteins were translated, but that protein amounts failed to correlate with epitope levels. Unexpectedly, epitope levels on infected cells also failed to correlate with immunogenicity. However, by extending our analysis to produce the first measurements of viral epitope levels from infected mice, we found a significant but moderate correlation with immunogenicity.

We report that gate voltage applied to the conducting laminar MXene membrane can modulate the permeation rate of ions and neutral solutes, as well as its effective size rejection. In operando wide-angle x-ray scattering measurements reveal that these changes are not driven by electrically induced variations in the d spacing of the MXene layers. Instead, experimental data and continuum electrokinetic modeling reveal that ion transport through the MXene channels is primarily affected by Donnan equilibrium at the membrane-solution interface. We also report a strong increase in the permeation rates through the membrane under a low-frequency ac voltage gating regime that we attribute to diffusioosmotic flow oscillations induced in the membrane. Overall, MXene “transistor” membranes provide a previously unidentified approach to dynamic control of molecular separations.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks, widely recognized for their role in machine learning, are also transforming the study of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), bridging data-driven modeling with classical dynamical systems as well as enabling the development of infinitely deep neural models. However, their practical applicability remains, in this context, constrained by the opacity of the learned dynamics, which operate as black-box systems with limited explainability, thereby hindering trust in their deployment. Existing approaches for the analysis of neurally driven dynamical systems are now scarce and restricted to first-order gradient information due to computational constraints, thereby limiting the depth of achievable insight. Here, we introduce event transition tensors as a new tool containing high-order differential information that provides a rigorous mathematical description of NeuralODE dynamics on event manifolds. We demonstrate its versatility across diverse applications: characterizing uncertainties in a data-driven prey-predator control model, analyzing neural optimal feedback dynamics, and mapping landing trajectories in a three-body neural Hamiltonian system. In all cases, our method allows for the interpretability of NeuralODEs and their analytical verification by expressing their behavior through previously unknown explicit mathematical structures. The neural dynamics are thereby fully encapsulated within a set of compact, computationally efficient tensors, which retain all the necessary information for rigorous system analysis and certification. Our findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for event-triggered neural differential equations and provide a mathematical construct for explaining complex system dynamics.",

Yet, how T cells release ATP themselves and its effects remain poorly investigated. Here, we found vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT), critical for vesicular ATP storage/release, is highly expressed in T H 1 cells and selectively restricts their differentiation and effector functions. Mechanistically, VNUT facilitates lysosomal ATP import and its extracellular release upon T cell receptor engagement. This eATP then activates the purinergic receptor P2X7R and downstream SRC kinase, triggering a signaling cascade involving heightened Ca 2+ influx and hyperphosphorylation of JNK and FOXO3a, which ultimately impairs Eomes-directed IFN-γ production in T H 1 cells. Genetic/pharmacological of VNUT inhibition significantly potentiates T H 1 effector functions against Listeria infection and transplanted tumors. These findings identify VNUT as a critical checkpoint in limiting T H 1 immunity, coupling vesicular ATP transport to transcriptional control via the P2X7R-JNK-FOXO3a-Eomes axis, offering a target for treating infection and cancer.",

A proposed facilitator of apoptotic cell clearance is the fragmentation of these cells into apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs) through cell-autonomous processes involving caspases and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Although this fragmentation process is considered a hallmark of apoptosis, its progression in tissue environments remains underexplored. Here, we examine the in vivo apoptotic dynamics of mouse thymocytes and pluripotent cells from zebrafish embryos. We show that the in vivo biogenesis of ApoBDs is independent of known cell-intrinsic regulators. Instead, fragmentation depends on actin-rich protrusions from neighboring resident phagocytes, which mechanically compress apoptotic cells to break them into smaller particles. Four-dimensional in vivo tracking of apoptotic cells reveals that both phagocyte-mediated fragmentation and phagocytosis are size sensitive, indicating that apoptotic size reduction mediated by phagocytes enhances their own clearance abilities. This non–cell-autonomous fragmentation ensures rapid apoptotic cell clearance, crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis in physiological settings.",

The aim of this study was to develop iPSC-derived “minimal injectable unit” chondrogenic micropellets (MIUChons) for delivery via intra-articular injections for OA therapy. To create transplantable allogeneic cartilage tissue, we optimized good manufacturing practice or clinical-grade production of iPSC-derived injectable chondrogenic spheroids and tested them in OA animal models. MIUChons were delivered to damaged cartilage through a single injection. In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that MIUChon treatment effectively reduced cartilage degeneration and deterioration.

          "abstract": "For more than two centuries, digoxin has been used to treat heart failure by increasing the strength of cardiac contraction and, more recently, is used for heart rate control. The proposed, yet unproven, mechanism underlying digoxin’s positive inotropic effect is as follows: By inhibiting the Na + -K + ATPase (NKA), digoxin partially dissipates the transmembrane Na + gradient, which is used by the Na + -Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX1) to extrude Ca 2+ from myocytes, thus causing accumulation of cytosolic Ca 2+ and therefore increased cardiac contractility. Here, we demonstrate that digoxin critically relies on a specific allosteric regulation of NCX1, known as Na + -dependent inactivation, to exert its positive inotropic effect, establishing the precise mechanism of action of this historic drug. These findings identify a distinct molecular target for the development of positive inotropes that avoid the undesirable effects associated with the blockade of NKA. As the structural information for the region involved with NCX1 Na + -dependent inhibition is well resolved, we provide the mechanistic foundation for drug development.",

The risk allele increases GPNMB transcription and GPNMB protein levels in the CSF highlighting GPMNB as a potential biomarker for Parkinson’s disease. However, a lack of knowledge of GPNMB’s function and mechanism of secretion has hindered an interpretation of secreted GPNMB levels. In this study, we assessed the mechanism of GPNMB secretion by macrophages, the primary cell type expressing GPNMB in the brain. We show that GPNMB is secreted in response to lysosomal stress via lysosomal exocytosis and highlight the Parkinson’s disease risk factor LRRK2 as a strong modulator of GPNMB secretion.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions remain largely incomplete. In this study, we report that the SLFN family member SLFN14 has potent anti–HIV-1 activity. Specifically, SLFN14 binds to the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), thereby preventing HIV-1 Tat-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter and causing an arrest of viral transcription. Furthermore, this P-TEFb–targeted inhibiting activity also allows SLFN14 to regulate the transcription of a subset of cellular genes. Thus, our data identify SLFN14 as an inhibitor of the important transcription elongation factor P-TEFb complex, which unveils the crucial role of SLFN14 in both cellular antiviral defense and other important cellular processes that rely on the function of this complex.",

These modifications influence chromatin function, but how they occur cotranslationally on these exceptionally abundant and small proteins was not understood. Here, we show that the nascent polypeptide-associated complex controls the cotranslational modification of histones H2A and H4 by recruiting NatD and the upstream enzyme MetAP1 to ribosomes.

Furthermore, heat stress induces the sequestration of TOR and its core complex components, RAPTOR1B and LST8, into SGs. TOR activity is rapidly suppressed by heat stress, independently of SG formation. In contrast, TOR reactivation following heat stress relief is dependent on the rate of SG disassembly, implicating SG recovery dynamics as a key regulator of TOR reactivation.

In this study, we show that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of TSK recognizes the N-terminal tails of histone variants H2A.X and H2A.W—key for DNA repair in euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively—but not the H2A.Z variant. A unique motif containing multiple basic and acidic residues (BAR motif) in H2A.Z prevents TSK binding. Moreover, disrupting TSK-H2A.X/W binding impairs TSK-mediated DNA repair. Genetic analyses reveal functional complementation between H2A.X and H2A.W in DNA repair, with the H2A.X N terminus being essential.

Our method produces continuous, spatially varying permeability profiles that preserve field uniformity around complex geometries, including faceted and multi-lobed configurations. Using material parameters drawn from commercially available superconductors, we demonstrate low-distortion cloaking performance with permeability values within manufacturable ranges.

Here, we present a method to suppress t 1 -noise in 13 C– 13 C double-quantum–single-quantum (DQ-SQ) spectra by converting DQ coherences into longitudinal two-spin order ( zz -terms), enabling selective removal of uncoupled 13 C magnetization. This zz -filter, compatible with both J - and dipolar-based sequences, markedly improves the spectral quality on both commercial (100 K) and custom-built helium-spinning (30 K) MAS-DNP setups. Up to a fivefold increase in signal-to-noise ratio in the indirect dimension allows detection of previously hidden long-range correlations, including intermolecular contacts. This method yields the first artifact-free 13 C– 13 C DQ-SQ spectrum at 30 K, expanding the analytical reach of MAS-DNP NMR for characterizing molecular assemblies at natural abundance.",

Subsequent biochemical assays showed that Ser 479 of MAP4K1 is directly phosphorylated by SRK2E/OST1, a central ABA kinase.

Combining live-cell imaging, atomic force microscopy, and optical tweezers, we decode that the indispensable step in microchannel network construction is organized cross-convergence of adjacent channels. The convergence is precisely directed by mechanical bridges composed of aligned collagen bundles between adjacent channels, which transmit orientation cues to induce multicellular force coordination. Integrating single-cell sequencing and off-lattice agent-based model, we identify mechanically responsive leader cells enriched for integrin-RhoA/YAP signaling and matrix metalloproteinase 14, which sense bridge cues and initiate cross-convergence.

However, current fabrication methods often suffer from limited gradient precision, restricted material compatibility, and poor reproducibility. Here, we introduced gradient regulation via acoustofluidic dynamic engineering (GRADE), a programmable system to generate high-fidelity gradient biomaterials across different material systems. By incorporating focused interdigital transducers with the pulsed surface acoustic wave actuation, GRADE can achieve tunable and directional acoustic streaming (0 to 22 millimeters per second), which allows accurate regulation of the gradient magnitude and length. Its open microchannel design enables nondestructive extraction of centimeter-scale gradients and supports device reuse, enhancing practicality and scalability. In contrast to magnetic or electrospinning techniques that are limited to specific material types, the GRADE approach supports composition-independent fluid manipulation of a diverse group of biomaterials and cross-linking methods, thus providing greater versatility and translational potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate stiffness-dependent mechanosensation in stem cells cultured on customized gradient substrates, which validates the platform’s usability. The experimental results show that GRADE has the ability to uncover mechanobiological responses in physiologically relevant contexts. All these results establish GRADE as a powerful and versatile platform for gradient biomaterial fabrication.

The plant hormones auxin and cytokinin shape the morphologies associated with each transition, but little is known about the factors that integrate florigen function with phytohormone signaling during these transitions. Here, we show that in rice, Hd3a activates the transcription of FT-LIKE1 ( OsFTL1 ), which encodes a mobile FT-like protein that promotes the transition from the IM to the FM, whereas cytokinin signaling suppresses its transcription. We performed single-cell resolution three-dimensional imaging to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution of Hd3a, cytokinin, and auxin signaling during the SAM-to-IM and IM-to-FM transitions, finding that Hd3a accumulation and cytokinin signaling occupy opposite domains in the IM. Hd3a accumulated at the center of the meristem and activated the OsFTL1 promoter, while OsFTL1 was present throughout the IM, suggesting that a “florigen relay” consisting of Hd3a from the leaves moves to the SAM and induces OsFTL1 expression within the SAM. We propose an antagonistic mechanism mediated by Hd3a and cytokinin that modulates the abundance of OsFTL1 and thus regulates reproductive development in rice.",

Moreover, achieving stereoselective transformations of light olefins remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a visible-light–mediated photoredox-catalyzed chemo-divergent and regioselective radical difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylsulfonylation and difluoromethylation/polyfluoroarylation of structurally diverse alkenes through switchable sulfur dioxide reintegration. The method demonstrates broad applicability across styrenes, unactivated alkenes, and gaseous ethylene/propylene substrates. The photocatalyst functions as a switch, and Sodium difluoromethanesulfinate (CF 2 HSO 2 Na) acts as a bifunctional reagent, enabling controllable divergence radical conversion via radical-polar crossover pathways. Notably, chiral alcohol–derived polyfluoroarenes efficiently induce stereoselectivity control in the coupling of alkyl radicals with sulfur dioxide via dynamic kinetic resolution. Density functional theory calculations indicate noncovalent interaction between alkyl/aryl groups and polyfluorocarbons plays critical roles for the ultralong-distance (&gt;9 atoms) stereochemical induction. The key to achieving chemo-divergent and stereocontrolled transformations lies in the precise sorting of a dynamic intermediate pool containing alkyl radicals, sulfonyl radicals, and anions.",

We use a database of individual size measurements for US stream fishes to test for direct and indirect effects of traits, flow regimes, and land use on the interspecific ISD exponent. Path analysis indicates that traits have strong, direct effects on ISD. Flow and land use effects on the exponent are largely indirectly mediated by their influences on species traits. ISD exponents increase (abundances of larger-bodied individuals increase, relative to smaller-bodied) when environments favor higher trophic levels, warmer thermal tolerances, and periodic life histories. Alternatively, ISD exponents decrease in systems that favor opportunistic life histories. Our flexible modeling framework that includes direct and indirect effects of traits, flow regimes, and land use on ISD could be expanded to incorporate additional variables that interact with flow (e.g., temperature and physical habitat) to assess of effects of multiple stressors on aquatic ecosystem functioning.",

The climate system influences fire in many ways, including through vegetation, fuel dryness, fire weather, and ignition. Furthermore, fire’s impacts are highly diverse, spanning threats to human and ecological values and beneficial ecosystem and cultural services. Here, we discuss the art and science of projecting climate change impacts on landscape fire. This not only includes how fire, its drivers, and its impacts are modeled, but critically it also includes how projections of the climate system are developed. By raising and discussing these issues, we aim to foster the development of more robust and useful fire projections, help interpret existing assessments, and support society in charting a course toward a sustainable fire future.",

These neurons drive sensitization through a C4da-Goro circuit, where Neurexin modulates presynaptic GABA B receptor signaling to control nociceptive excitability.

Experiments and molecular simulations reveal that molecular amphiphilicity-driven spontaneous confinement and directional alignment of framework-building units at the organic/aqueous interface instigate the vertical growth of COF monolayers. The superior sieving ability of sub–4 angstrom interlayer nanochannels enables vertically aligned COF membranes to efficiently intercept salt ions, electrically neutral small molecules, and hazardous chemicals, outperforming conventional COF membranes. The implemented strategy can be extended to other building blocks and framework topologies, opening up avenues for fine-tuning the pore structure of 2D COF membranes.",

Across regions, in situ diversification was consistently elevated during heightened phases of tectonic activity.

Here we report, both in theory and experiment, the concept of moiré plasmonic skyrmion clusters, where multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster. By leveraging twistronics engineering of plasmonic nanostructures, we demonstrate both periodic and quasi-periodic optical skyrmions, revealing a large degree of topological control.

This leads to three key findings: First, we provide computational evidence that task-specific selection drives bifurcation in eye evolution. Second, we reveal how optical innovations naturally emerge to resolve fundamental trade-offs between light collection and spatial precision. Third, we uncover scaling laws between visual acuity and neural processing that provide insights into long-standing hypothesis behind eye and brain size.

The 2.0-angstrom resolution crystal structure of SFL reveals a boat-like module comprising an N-terminal helical bundle and three zinc fingers at the C terminus. A hyperphosphorylation loop (HPL) buried between the helical bundle and the zinc finger 1 harbors four phosphorylated residues (p-S249, p-T250 p-T253, and p-S256), which are important to protein folding. SFL forms monomers in solution and binds the HIV-1 −1 PRF sequence with nanomolar affinity ( K D  = 5.7 nanomolar). Disruption of HPL phosphorylation decreased the RNA binding affinity and undermined the SFL-mediated −1 PRF inhibition of various viruses. Proximity-dependent biotinylation identified three cellular Ser/Thr kinases—EEF2K, NEK9, and PBK—that phosphorylate SFL in cells.

Using a computer vision approach on three-dimensional x-ray microtomography scans of 880 specimens from 507 species, we show that larger colonies were facilitated by reducing exoskeleton investment rather than miniaturizing workers. Reduced cuticle investment was associated with accelerated diversification rates in ants, whereas other candidates—colony size and worker size—did not correlate with diversification.

Transgenic experiments in growth chamber and two latitudinal field trials confirmed their positive roles in promoting BB.

A major challenge is to simultaneously maximize the on/off ratio and the transit frequency, because a high transit frequency requires a small channel length, which often leads to short-channel effects, including a large off-state drain current. Here, we lift this fundamental compromise and demonstrate organic TFTs that exhibit a complete absence of detrimental short-channel effects for channel lengths down to 300 nm, making it possible to simultaneously achieve the largest on/off current ratio (10 10 ) and the highest transit frequency (40 MHz) reported to date for flexible organic TFTs, despite the fact that these TFTs operate at very low voltages (≤3 V). These organic TFTs therefore meet the fundamental static and dynamic performance requirements for flexible, high-frequency, low-voltage, low-power electronic systems.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between light and matter can be enhanced by spatially concentrating the light field and extending photon dwell time. Plasmonic structures can provide strong light confinement but suffer from ohmic losses. Recent advances in dielectric nanostructures enable strong light localization without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily focused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing light-matter interactions. Here, we demonstrate a nanolaser that colocalizes photons and excited carriers within a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light and matter yields a subdiffraction-limited mode volume and a subwavelength carrier volume without lateral quantum confinement. We observe a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution, where enhanced mode localization produces stronger carrier confinement. By suppressing carrier surface recombination, this platform not only enables continuous-wave lasing at room temperature but also achieves a substantially reduced lasing threshold. We quantify the intensified interaction with an interaction volume, generalizing mode volume to a broad class of active media.",

Here, we introduce a single electromagnetic actuator-driven insect-scale robot, developed by integrating geometric and mass asymmetries into a deformable hexagonal frame. This asymmetric configuration induces nonlinear dynamic behaviors in the robot, allowing it to perform a variety of complex actions (e.g., forward and backward locomotion, active flipping, and lateral movement) and respond to challenging scenarios (e.g., granular media and safe landing) through posture transitions. To facilitate the behavior modulation and design optimization of the proposed insect-scale robot, a nonlinear dynamic model is established to map the relationship between motion behaviors and input parameters. Last, an untethered prototype that can work in outdoor environments is constructed to further demonstrate the practical applications.",

Here, we experimentally construct various TIs in synthetic frequency dimension and study temporal scattering processes over the whole band. Different temporal operation scenarios are studied, including band shifting, band unfolding/folding, and also band variation in a two-dimensional case. We develop the spectral tomography method to retrieve wave function distributions after wave scatterings at different TIs and then demonstrate the momentum conservation over the whole band.

          "abstract": "Helical polymers are fascinating materials, yet retaining their helicity in the solid state remains a key challenge for practical applications. Here, we present a regiospecific topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition for synthesizing crystalline covalent helical polymers via a single–crystal–to–single–crystal transformation. Building on our prior glycine-proline–based systems, we investigated the effect of subtle modification: introducing a hydroxyl group to the proline unit. This minor change induced a helicity reversal (left- to right-handed) and a substantial reduction in pitch (8.9 to 4.9 Å). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction revealed that this profound reordering is driven by intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (C─H⋯O and O─H⋯N), acting as supramolecular bridges between helices, enabling denser packing. Consequently, the glycine-hydroxyproline–based polymer exhibited markedly enhanced mechanics, with a Young’s modulus of 18.57 ± 2.01 GPa and hardness of 1.09 ± 0.13 GPa, surpassing natural collagen. This study provides insights into controlling polymer topology and mechanics through subtle modifications, establishing a powerful paradigm for the design of next-generation helical materials with tailored functionalities.",

We discovered that the initial translation leading to growth hormone (GH) synthesis in engram cells is required for their maturation in the mouse dentate gyrus. Time-course experiments with a translation inhibitor suggested that the key molecule is immediately translated during learning. We identified GH as the crucial factor, specifically translated within the first few minutes of consolidation in engram cells. Blocking GH activity with a dominant-negative (G118R) mutation blocked engram maturation, whereas facilitating activity-dependent GH uptake alleviated engram maturation deficits caused by translation inhibition. Together, our findings propose GH as a key mediator of hippocampal engram cell maturation.",

Here, we report phosphorus-lithium double-helix nanoribbons with a well-ordered helical architecture and high structural stability under harsh conditions such as in air up to 225°C, water, and even acidic solutions. Comprehensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses show that the stability arises from a synergistic combination of Zintl phase formation between phosphorus and lithium atoms, noncovalent interhelical interactions, and geometric protection offered by the distinctive helical architecture. The nanoribbons show tunable optical properties dependent on temperature, thickness, and polarization state. It is demonstrated that these properties enabled nanoribbon-based hydrogels with self-healability and highly efficient photothermal conversion, showing a general approach for stabilizing active low-dimensional materials and paving the way for applying phosphorus-based nanostructures in biomedical engineering and quantum technologies.",

Integrating laser-induced graphene (LIG) with a deformable cavity, RAGSD provides continuous tuning from 922.12 to 1762.90 hertz. A dynamic, continuously tunable electro-mechano-acoustical model explains the mechanism and predicts frequency with R 2 = 0.990 . In emission, a 25.34-decibel sound pressure level gain was observed at resonance, enabling controllable, frequency-selective voice amplification for personalized output. In sensing, the LIG piezoresistive readout delivers sensitive transduction, while resonance matching amplifies weak, high-frequency cardiac sounds. Wearable tests on healthy volunteers and patients recorded clear S1/S2 and pathological murmurs. Integrated with AuscNet-H, a deep learning algorithm designed for heart sound classification, the system achieved 99.375% accuracy across four clinical classes. Under inflation, no false negatives occurred, and misclassifications among similar diseases were fewer than with a commercial electronic stethoscope. These results demonstrate a practical path toward intelligent, wearable auscultation.",

          "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are powerful cis-regulatory drivers of gene expression, particularly during early development when many TEs become de-repressed. MERVL elements are transiently up-regulated in mouse totipotent two-cell (2C) embryos during major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and 2C-like cells in vitro. One of the most powerful activators of MERVL is the pioneer transcription factor, Dux. However, apparent differences lie in the requirement for Dux versus MERVL activation in embryos. Moreover, sustained Dux activation causes cell toxicity, which may or may not be linked to MERVL. Using a CRISPR activation system, we unpick the relative role of Dux and MERVL in ZGA, totipotent-like characteristics, and cell toxicity. We find that MERVL activation drives a portion of the Dux-dependent transcriptome, sufficient for expanded fate potential, but not other totipotency features. Conversely, Dux-induced pathology is independent of MERVL activation and involves the proapoptotic factor, Noxa. Our study highlights the complexity of the Dux-MERVL transcriptional network and uncovers a previously unknown player in Dux-driven pathology.",

This was done by direct and quantitative examination of the interaction between EGFR and cholesterol on the PM of a living cell. Structural analysis using molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further revealed that cholesterol in the inner leaflet is critically important for the transition of the dimeric transmembrane domain (TMD) of the receptor to the active conformation. We also identified the specific pattern of residues Ile 640 -Gly 641 -Leu 642 of EGFR TMD regulating inner leaflet cholesterol binding and ligand-activated EGFR by screening via site-directed mutagenesis.

However, their high-pressure application is severely hampered by the mechanical fragility stemming from weak interactions at grain boundaries.

These graphene oxide nanosheets act as a rigid wall, bridging soft MOF grains and dispersing accumulated stresses at grain boundaries under external loadings, thereby preventing structural cracking and enhancing the mechanical robustness of crystal membranes. By fine-tuning the morphology and content of nanosheets, the optimized NB–ZIF-8 membranes are endowed with unprecedented 50-bar pressure resistance and superior C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 separation performance, with a separation factor &gt;240 maintained above 300 hours at industry-relevant pressure. We also confirm our strategy’s versatility by fabricating pressure-resistant NB–ZIF-67 membrane and commercial polymer-supported NB-MOF membranes.

Their release is predominantly attributed to mechanical abrasion or ultraviolet exposure, both requiring substantial external energy inputs. The role of aquatic factors (e.g., air bubbles) in the generation of MNPs is poorly understood. Here we show microbubbles that spontaneously form on seven typical plastics across a wide temperature range (25° to 95°C) and in various water types (deionized, tap, river, and marine water) can erode plastic surfaces and drive MNP release. Nucleation, expansion, and movement of microbubbles generate shear stresses capable of dislodging polymer protrusions at surface defect sites. This sweeping action, combined with the unbalanced surface tension forces at the three-phase contact line, generates O-shaped ring structures composed of accumulated polymers, which ultimately fragment leading to the release of MNPs into the aquatic environment. Our findings demonstrate that microbubble-induced erosion represents a low-energy pathway for micropollutant release.",
