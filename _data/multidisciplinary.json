          "abstract": "Mitochondria serve a crucial role in cell growth and proliferation by supporting both ATP synthesis and the production of macromolecular precursors. Whereas oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depends mainly on the oxidation of intermediates from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the mitochondrial production of proline and ornithine relies on reductive synthesis1. How these competing metabolic pathways take place in the same organelle is not clear. Here we show that when cellular dependence on OXPHOS increases, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS)—the rate-limiting enzyme in the reductive synthesis of proline and ornithine—becomes sequestered in a subset of mitochondria that lack cristae and ATP synthase. This sequestration is driven by both the intrinsic ability of P5CS to form filaments and the mitochondrial fusion and fission cycle. Disruption of mitochondrial dynamics, by impeding mitofusin-mediated fusion or dynamin-like-protein-1-mediated fission, impairs the separation of P5CS-containing mitochondria from mitochondria that are enriched in cristae and ATP synthase. Failure to segregate these metabolic pathways through mitochondrial fusion and fission results in cells either sacrificing the capacity for OXPHOS while sustaining the reductive synthesis of proline, or foregoing proline synthesis while preserving adaptive OXPHOS. These findings provide evidence of the key role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in maintaining both oxidative and reductive biosyntheses in response to changing nutrient availability and bioenergetic demand.",

          "abstract": "Neuropeptides have important roles in neural plasticity, spiking and behaviour1. Yet, many fundamental questions remain regarding their spatiotemporal transmission, integration and functions in the awake brain. Here we examined how MC4R-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVHMC4R) integrate neuropeptide signals to modulate feeding-related fast synaptic transmission and titrate the transition to satiety2,3,4,5,6. We show that hunger-promoting AgRP axons release the neuropeptide NPY to decrease the second messenger cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons, while satiety-promoting POMC axons release the neuropeptide αMSH to increase cAMP. Each release event is all-or-none, stochastic and can impact multiple neurons within an approximately 100-µm-diameter region. After release, NPY and αMSH peptides compete to control cAMP—the amplitude and persistence of NPY signalling is blunted by high αMSH in the fed state, while αMSH signalling is blunted by high NPY in the fasted state. Feeding resolves this competition by simultaneously elevating αMSH release and suppressing NPY release7,8, thereby sustaining elevated cAMP in PVHMC4R neurons throughout a meal. In turn, elevated cAMP facilitates potentiation of feeding-related excitatory inputs with each bite to gradually promote satiation across many minutes. Our findings highlight biochemical modes of peptide signal integration and information accumulation to guide behavioural state transitions.",

          "abstract": "All animals develop from a single-celled zygote into a complex multicellular organism through a series of precisely orchestrated processes1,2. Despite the remarkable conservation of early embryogenesis across animals, the evolutionary origins of how and when this process first emerged remain elusive. Here, by combining time-resolved imaging and transcriptomic profiling, we show that single cells of the ichthyosporean Chromosphaera perkinsii—a close relative that diverged from animals about 1 billion years ago3,4—undergo symmetry breaking and develop through cleavage divisions to produce a prolonged multicellular colony with distinct co-existing cell types. Our findings about the autonomous and palintomic developmental program of C. perkinsii hint that such multicellular development either is much older than previously thought or evolved convergently in ichthyosporeans.",

Targeted multisensory engagement of these afferent units, however, faces persistent challenges, especially for wearable, programmable systems that need to operate adaptively across the body8,9,10,11. Here we present a miniaturized electromechanical structure that, when combined with skin as an elastic, energy-storing element, supports bistable, self-sensing modes of deformation. Targeting specific classes of mechanoreceptors as the basis for distinct, programmed sensory responses, this haptic unit can deliver both dynamic and static stimuli, directed as either normal or shear forces. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies establish foundational principles and practical criteria for low-energy operation across natural anatomical variations in the mechanical properties of human skin. A wireless, skin-conformable haptic interface, integrating an array of these bistable transducers, serves as a high-density channel capable of rendering input from smartphone-based 3D scanning and inertial sensors. Demonstrations of this system include sensory substitution designed to improve the quality of life for patients with visual and proprioceptive impairments.",

          "abstract": "The yeast SWR1 complex catalyses the exchange of histone H2A–H2B dimers in nucleosomes, with Htz1–H2B dimers 1–3 . Here we used single-molecule analysis to demonstrate two-step double exchange of the two H2A–H2B dimers in a canonical yeast nucleosome with Htz1–H2B dimers, and showed that double exchange can be processive without release of the nucleosome from the SWR1 complex. Further analysis showed that bound nucleosomes flip between two states, with each presenting a different face, and hence histone dimer, to SWR1. The bound dwell time is longer when an H2A–H2B dimer is presented for exchange than when presented with an Htz1–H2B dimer. A hexasome intermediate in the reaction is bound to the SWR1 complex in a single orientation with the ‘empty’ site presented for dimer insertion. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed different populations of complexes showing nucleosomes caught ‘flipping’ between different conformations without release, each placing a different dimer into position for exchange, with the Swc2 subunit having a key role in this process. Together, the data reveal a processive mechanism for double dimer exchange that explains how SWR1 can ‘proofread’ the dimer identities within nucleosomes.",

          "abstract": "Ion-conducting polymer membranes are essential in many separation processes and electrochemical devices, including electrodialysis 1 , redox flow batteries 2 , fuel cells 3 and electrolysers 4,5 . Controlling ion transport and selectivity in these membranes largely hinges on the manipulation of pore size. Although membrane pore structures can be designed in the dry state 6 , they are redefined upon hydration owing to swelling in electrolyte solutions. Strategies to control pore hydration and a deeper understanding of pore structure evolution are vital for accurate pore size tuning. Here we report polymer membranes containing pendant groups of varying hydrophobicity, strategically positioned near charged groups to regulate their hydration capacity and pore swelling. Modulation of the hydrated micropore size (less than two nanometres) enables direct control over water and ion transport across broad length scales, as quantified by spectroscopic and computational methods. Ion selectivity improves in hydration-restrained pores created by more hydrophobic pendant groups. These highly interconnected ion transport channels, with tuned pore gate sizes, show higher ionic conductivity and orders-of-magnitude lower permeation rates of redox-active species compared with conventional membranes, enabling stable cycling of energy-dense aqueous organic redox flow batteries. This pore size tailoring approach provides a promising avenue to membranes with precisely controlled ionic and molecular transport functions.",

          "abstract": "The chromosomal theory of inheritance dictates that genes on the same chromosome segregate together while genes on different chromosomes assort independently 1 . Extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are common in cancer and drive oncogene amplification, dysregulated gene expression and intratumoural heterogeneity through random segregation during cell division 2,3 . Distinct ecDNA sequences, termed ecDNA species, can co-exist to facilitate intermolecular cooperation in cancer cells 4 . How multiple ecDNA species within a tumour cell are assorted and maintained across somatic cell generations is unclear. Here we show that cooperative ecDNA species are coordinately inherited through mitotic co-segregation. Imaging and single-cell analyses show that multiple ecDNAs encoding distinct oncogenes co-occur and are correlated in copy number in human cancer cells. ecDNA species are coordinately segregated asymmetrically during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with simultaneous copy-number gains in multiple ecDNA species before any selection. Intermolecular proximity and active transcription at the start of mitosis facilitate the coordinated segregation of ecDNA species, and transcription inhibition reduces co-segregation. Computational modelling reveals the quantitative principles of ecDNA co-segregation and co-selection, predicting their observed distributions in cancer cells. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs enables co-amplification of specialized ecDNAs containing only enhancer elements and guides therapeutic strategies to jointly deplete cooperating ecDNA oncogenes. Coordinated inheritance of ecDNAs confers stability to oncogene cooperation and novel gene regulatory circuits, allowing winning combinations of epigenetic states to be transmitted across cell generations.",

          "abstract": "Crystalline solids typically show robust long-range structural ordering, vital for their remarkable electronic properties and use in functional electronics, albeit with limited customization space. By contrast, synthetic molecular systems provide highly tunable structural topologies and versatile functionalities but are often too delicate for scalable electronic integration. Combining these two systems could harness the strengths of both, yet realizing this integration is challenging owing to distinct chemical bonding structures and processing conditions. Two-dimensional atomic crystals comprise crystalline atomic layers separated by non-bonding van der Waals gaps, allowing diverse atomic or molecular intercalants to be inserted without disrupting existing covalent bonds. This enables the creation of a diverse set of layered hybrid superlattices (LHSLs) composed of alternating crystalline atomic layers of variable electronic properties and self-assembled atomic or molecular interlayers featuring customizable chemical compositions and structural motifs. Here we outline strategies to prepare LHSLs and discuss emergent properties. With the versatile molecular design strategies and modular assembly processes, LHSLs offer vast flexibility for weaving distinct chemical constituents and quantum properties into monolithic artificial solids with a designable three-dimensional potential landscape. This opens unprecedented opportunities to tailor charge correlations, quantum properties and topological phases, thereby defining a rich material platform for advancing quantum information science.",

Here we sought to define immune responses in heart, tumour and blood in patients with irMyocarditis by leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy and proteomics analyses of samples from 28 patients with irMyocarditis and 41 unaffected individuals. Analyses of 84,576 cardiac cells by single-cell RNA sequencing combined with multiplexed microscopy demonstrated increased frequencies and co-localization of cytotoxic T cells, conventional dendritic cells and inflammatory fibroblasts in irMyocarditis heart tissue. Analyses of 366,066 blood cells revealed decreased frequencies of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, conventional dendritic cells and B lineage cells but an increased frequency of other mononuclear phagocytes in irMyocarditis. Fifty-two heart-expanded TCR clones from eight patients did not recognize the putative cardiac autoantigens α-myosin, troponin I or troponin T. Additionally, TCRs enriched in heart tissue were largely nonoverlapping with those enriched in paired tumour tissue. The presence of heart-expanded TCRs in a cycling blood CD8 T cell population was associated with fatal irMyocarditis case status.

          "abstract": "The fast increase of convergence rate between India and Eurasia around 65 million years ago (Ma)—from approximately 8 cm yr−1 to a peak rate of approximately 18 cm yr−1—remains a complex geological event to explain1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding the tectonic history and the intricate interplay of forces influencing plate speed9,10,11. Here we use a combination of geochemical analysis and geodynamic modelling to propose that this rapid convergence can be explained by sediment subduction derived from the northern Indian passive margin. Through isotope and trace element analysis, we find an enhanced contribution of terrigenous sediment melt to the mantle source of the Gangdese magmatic rocks around 65 Ma, concurrent with the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence. Numerical experiments suggest that subduction of sediments more than 1 km thick covering an approximately 1,000-km-wide ocean basin abutting the northern Indian passive margin starting from 65 Ma could have spurred the increased convergence rate and further led to significant crustal extension, consistent with empirical observations. Our study implies that the acceleration of India–Eurasia convergence marks the arrival of passive-margin-derived sediments, constraining the initial India–Eurasia collision to be around 60 Ma. It further suggests that temporary accelerations in subduction rates might be a common feature at the final stage of continental assembly.",

By annotating 705,241 radiology reports, MSK-CHORD also uncovers predictors of metastasis to specific organ sites, including a relationship between SETD2 mutation and lower metastatic potential in immunotherapy-treated lung adenocarcinoma corroborated in independent datasets.

However, emerging evidence suggests a potential role for ‘activity-silent’ synaptic mechanisms 3–5 . This issue remains controversial because evidence for either view has largely relied either on datasets that fail to capture single-trial population dynamics or on indirect measures of neuronal spiking. We addressed this controversy by examining the dynamics of mnemonic information on single trials obtained from large, local populations of lateral prefrontal neurons recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing a working memory task. Here we show that mnemonic information does not persist in the spiking activity of neuronal populations during memory delays, but instead alternates between coordinated ‘On’ and ‘Off’ states. At the level of single neurons, Off states are driven by both a loss of selectivity for memoranda and a return of firing rates to spontaneous levels. Further exploiting the large-scale recordings used here, we show that mnemonic information is available in the patterns of functional connections among neuronal ensembles during Off states. Our results suggest that intermittent periods of memorandum-specific spiking coexist with synaptic mechanisms to support working memory.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major contributor to treatment resistance and poor outcome for patients with cancer 1,2 . Here we examine the diversity of ecDNA elements across cancer, revealing the associated tissue, genetic and mutational contexts. By analysing data from 14,778 patients with 39 tumour types from the 100,000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate that 17.1% of tumour samples contain ecDNA. We reveal a pattern highly indicative of tissue-context-based selection for ecDNAs, linking their genomic content to their tissue of origin. We show that not only is ecDNA a mechanism for amplification of driver oncogenes, but it also a mechanism that frequently amplifies immunomodulatory and inflammatory genes, such as those that modulate lymphocyte-mediated immunity and immune effector processes. Moreover, ecDNAs carrying immunomodulatory genes are associated with reduced tumour T cell infiltration. We identify ecDNAs bearing only enhancers, promoters and lncRNA elements, suggesting the combinatorial power of interactions between ecDNAs in trans . We also identify intrinsic and environmental mutational processes linked to ecDNA, including those linked to its formation, such as tobacco exposure, and progression, such as homologous recombination repair deficiency. Clinically, ecDNA detection was associated with tumour stage, more prevalent after targeted therapy and cytotoxic treatments, and associated with metastases and shorter overall survival. These results shed light on why ecDNA is a substantial clinical problem that can cooperatively drive tumour growth signals, alter transcriptional landscapes and suppress the immune system.",

          "abstract": "Autonomous laboratories can accelerate discoveries in chemical synthesis, but this requires automated measurements coupled with reliable decision-making 1,2 . Most autonomous laboratories involve bespoke automated equipment 3–6 , and reaction outcomes are often assessed using a single, hard-wired characterization technique 7 . Any decision-making algorithms 8 must then operate using this narrow range of characterization data 9,10 . By contrast, manual experiments tend to draw on a wider range of instruments to characterize reaction products, and decisions are rarely taken based on one measurement alone. Here we show that a synthesis laboratory can be integrated into an autonomous laboratory by using mobile robots 11–13 that operate equipment and make decisions in a human-like way. Our modular workflow combines mobile robots, an automated synthesis platform, a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometer and a benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer. This allows robots to share existing laboratory equipment with human researchers without monopolizing it or requiring extensive redesign. A heuristic decision-maker processes the orthogonal measurement data, selecting successful reactions to take forward and automatically checking the reproducibility of any screening hits. We exemplify this approach in the three areas of structural diversification chemistry, supramolecular host–guest chemistry and photochemical synthesis. This strategy is particularly suited to exploratory chemistry that can yield multiple potential products, as for supramolecular assemblies, where we also extend the method to an autonomous function assay by evaluating host–guest binding properties.",

Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the humoral immune response to XBB and JN.1 human exposure. We demonstrate the antigenic distinctiveness of XBB and JN.1 lineages in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals, and JN.1 infection elicits superior plasma neutralization against its subvariants. We highlight KP.3’s strong immune evasion and receptor binding capability, supporting its foreseeable prevalence. Extensive analysis of the BCR repertoire, isolating ~2000 RBD-specific antibodies with their targeting epitopes characterized by deep mutational scanning (DMS), underscores the superiority of JN.1-elicited memory B cells 4,5. Class 1 IGHV3-53/3-66-derived neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) contribute majorly within wildtype-reactive NAbs against JN.1. However, KP.2 and KP.3 evade a substantial subset, even those induced by JN.1, advocating for booster updates to KP.2/KP.3. JN.1-induced Omicron-specific antibodies also demonstrate high potency across Omicron. Escape hotspots of these NAbs have already been mutated, resulting in higher immune barrier to escape, considering probable recovery of escaped NAbs. Additionally, the prevalence of IGHV3-53/3-66-derived antibodies, and their capability of competing with all Omicron-specific NAbs suggests their inhibitory role on the activation of Omicron-specific naive B cells, potentially explaining the heavy immune imprinting in mRNA-vaccinated individuals 6–8. These findings delineate the evolving antibody response to Omicron antigenic shift from XBB to JN.1, and highlight the importance of developing JN.1-lineage, especially KP.2/KP.3-based vaccine boosters.",

          "abstract": "Various bacteria are suggested to contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) development1,2,3,4,5, including pks+Escherichia coli, which produces the genotoxin colibactin that induces characteristic mutational signatures in host epithelial cells6. However, it remains unclear how the highly unstable colibactin molecule is able to access host epithelial cells to cause harm. Here, using the microbiota-dependent ZEB2-transgenic mouse model of invasive CRC7, we demonstrate that the oncogenic potential of pks+E. coli critically depends on bacterial adhesion to host epithelial cells, mediated by the type 1 pilus adhesin FimH and the F9 pilus adhesin FmlH. Blocking bacterial adhesion using a pharmacological FimH inhibitor attenuates colibactin-mediated genotoxicity and CRC exacerbation. We also show that allelic switching of FimH strongly influences the genotoxic potential of pks+E. coli and can induce a genotoxic gain-of-function in the probiotic strain Nissle 1917. Adhesin-mediated epithelial binding subsequently allows the production of the genotoxin colibactin in close proximity to host epithelial cells, which promotes DNA damage and drives CRC development. These findings present promising therapeutic routes for the development of anti-adhesive therapies aimed at mitigating colibactin-induced DNA damage and inhibiting the initiation and progression of CRC, particularly in individuals at risk for developing CRC.",

          "abstract": "Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometre-scale space. These complex systems manifest a variety of shapes 1–3 , traditionally explored using non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies 4,5 . However, at these energies, their instantaneous shapes are obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, making direct observation challenging. Here we introduce the collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method, which images the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analysing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution within the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, imprints patterns on the particle momentum distribution observed in detectors 6,7 . We benchmark this method in collisions of ground-state uranium-238 nuclei, known for their elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings show a large deformation with a slight deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state, aligning broadly with previous low-energy experiments. This approach offers a new method for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances our understanding of the initial conditions in high-energy collisions and addresses the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across energy scales.",

However, understanding the precise physiological state and genetic basis of persister formation has been a longstanding challenge. Here we generated a high-resolution single-cell2 RNA atlas of Escherichia coli growth transitions, which revealed that persisters from diverse genetic and physiological models converge to transcriptional states that are distinct from standard growth phases and instead exhibit a dominant signature of translational deficiency. We then used ultra-dense CRISPR interference3 to determine how every E. coli gene contributes to persister formation across genetic models. Among critical genes with large effects, we found lon, which encodes a highly conserved protease4, and yqgE, a poorly characterized gene whose product strongly modulates the duration of post-starvation dormancy and persistence. Our work reveals key physiologic and genetic factors that underlie starvation-triggered persistence, a critical step towards targeting persisters in recalcitrant bacterial infections.",

We previously found that either deficiency or inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) promotes human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer cell death in hypoxia by activation of RNF213 (ref. 3), a large protein with multiple AAA-ATPase domains and two ubiquitin ligase domains (RING and RZ) implicated in Moyamoya disease, lipotoxicity and innate immunity4. Here we report that PTP1B and ABL1/2 reciprocally control RNF213 tyrosine phosphorylation and, consequently, its oligomerization and RZ domain activation. The RZ domain ubiquitylates and induces the degradation of the major NF-κB regulator CYLD/SPATA2. Decreased CYLD/SPATA2 levels lead to NF-κB activation and induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome which, together with hypoxia-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, triggers pyroptotic cell death. Consistent with this model, CYLD deletion phenocopies, whereas NLRP3 deletion blocks, the effects of PTP1B deficiency on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer xenograft growth. Reconstitution studies with RNF213 mutants confirm that the RZ domain mediates tumour cell death. In concert, our results identify a unique, potentially targetable PTP1B–RNF213–CYLD–SPATA2 pathway critical for the control of inflammatory cell death in hypoxic tumours, provide new insights into RNF213 regulation and have potential implications for the pathogenesis of Moyamoya disease, inflammatory disorders and autoimmune disease.",

The most common AKT1 alteration replaces Glu17 with Lys (E17K) in the regulatory pleckstrin homology domain1, resulting in constitutive membrane localization and activation of oncogenic signalling. In clinical studies, pan-AKT inhibitors have been found to cause dose-limiting hyperglycaemia2,3,4,5,6, which has motivated the search for mutant-selective inhibitors. We exploited the E17K mutation to design allosteric, lysine-targeted salicylaldehyde inhibitors with selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) over wild-type AKT paralogues, a major challenge given the presence of three conserved lysines near the allosteric site. Crystallographic analysis of the covalent inhibitor complex unexpectedly revealed an adventitious tetrahedral zinc ion that coordinates two proximal cysteines in the kinase activation loop while simultaneously engaging the E17K–imine conjugate. The salicylaldimine complex with AKT1 (E17K), but not that with wild-type AKT1, recruits endogenous Zn2+ in cells, resulting in sustained inhibition. A salicylaldehyde-based inhibitor was efficacious in AKT1 (E17K) tumour xenograft models at doses that did not induce hyperglycaemia. Our study demonstrates the potential to achieve exquisite residence-time-based selectivity for AKT1 (E17K) by targeting the mutant lysine together with Zn2+ chelation by the resulting salicylaldimine adduct.",

At present, there are no ecDNA-specific treatments. Here we show that enhancing transcription–replication conflict enables targeted elimination of ecDNA-containing cancers. Stepwise analyses of ecDNA transcription reveal pervasive RNA transcription and associated single-stranded DNA, leading to excessive transcription–replication conflicts and replication stress compared with chromosomal loci. Nucleotide incorporation on ecDNA is markedly slower, and replication stress is significantly higher in ecDNA-containing tumours regardless of cancer type or oncogene cargo. pRPA2-S33, a mediator of DNA damage repair that binds single-stranded DNA, shows elevated localization on ecDNA in a transcription-dependent manner, along with increased DNA double strand breaks, and activation of the S-phase checkpoint kinase, CHK1. Genetic or pharmacological CHK1 inhibition causes extensive and preferential tumour cell death in ecDNA-containing tumours. We advance a highly selective, potent and bioavailable oral CHK1 inhibitor, BBI-2779, that preferentially kills ecDNA-containing tumour cells. In a gastric cancer model containing FGFR2 amplified on ecDNA, BBI-2779 suppresses tumour growth and prevents ecDNA-mediated acquired resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor infigratinib, resulting in potent and sustained tumour regression in mice. Transcription–replication conflict emerges as a target for ecDNA-directed therapy, exploiting a synthetic lethality of excess to treat cancer.",

          "abstract": "The phosphorylation of synaptic proteins is a significant biochemical reaction that controls the sleep–wake cycle in mammals1,2,3. Protein phosphorylation in vivo is reversibly regulated by kinases and phosphatases. In this study, we investigate a pair of kinases and phosphatases that reciprocally regulate sleep duration. First, we perform a comprehensive screen of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family genes by generating 40 gene knockout mouse lines using prenatal and postnatal CRISPR targeting. We identify a regulatory subunit of PKA (Prkar2b), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1; Pppr1r9b) and catalytic and regulatory subunits of calcineurin (also known as PP2B) (Ppp3ca and Ppp3r1) as sleep control genes. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated stimulation of PKA and PP1–calcineurin activities, we show that PKA is a wake-promoting kinase, whereas PP1 and calcineurin function as sleep-promoting phosphatases. The importance of these phosphatases in sleep regulation is supported by the marked changes in sleep duration associated with their increased and decreased activities, ranging from approximately 17.3 h per day (PP1 expression) to 4.3 h per day (postnatal CRISPR targeting of calcineurin). Localization signals to the excitatory post-synapse are necessary for these phosphatases to exert their sleep-promoting effects. Furthermore, the wake-promoting effect of PKA localized to the excitatory post-synapse negated the sleep-promoting effect of PP1–calcineurin. These findings indicate that PKA and PP1–calcineurin have competing functions in sleep regulation at excitatory post-synapses.",

Using intelligent reconstruction algorithms, multi-channel images can be recovered from each frame, realizing real-time hyperspectral imaging. Following this framework, we fabricated a broadband visible–near-infrared (400–1,700 nm) hyperspectral image sensor using photolithography, with an average light throughput of 74.8% and 96 wavelength channels. The demonstrated resolution is 1,024 × 1,024 pixels at 124 fps. We demonstrated its wide applications, including chlorophyll and sugar quantification for intelligent agriculture, blood oxygen and water quality monitoring for human health, textile classification and apple bruise detection for industrial automation, and remote lunar detection for astronomy. The integrated hyperspectral image sensor weighs only tens of grams and can be assembled on various resource-limited platforms or equipped with off-the-shelf optical systems.

          "abstract": "Memories are encoded in neural ensembles during learning 1–6 and are stabilized by post-learning reactivation 7–17 . Integrating recent experiences into existing memories ensures that memories contain the most recently available information, but how the brain accomplishes this critical process remains unclear. Here we show that in mice, a strong aversive experience drives offline ensemble reactivation of not only the recent aversive memory but also a neutral memory formed 2 days before, linking fear of the recent aversive memory to the previous neutral memory. Fear specifically links retrospectively, but not prospectively, to neutral memories across days. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the recent aversive memory ensemble is reactivated during the offline period after learning. However, a strong aversive experience also increases co-reactivation of the aversive and neutral memory ensembles during the offline period. Ensemble co-reactivation occurs more during wake than during sleep. Finally, the expression of fear in the neutral context is associated with reactivation of the shared ensemble between the aversive and neutral memories. Collectively, these results demonstrate that offline ensemble co-reactivation is a neural mechanism by which memories are integrated across days.",

          "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the mammalian ultradian sleep rhythm—the alternation of rapid-eye-movement (REM) and slow-wave (SW) states—are not well understood but probably depend, at least in part, on circuits in the brainstem 1–6 . Here, we use perturbation experiments to probe this ultradian rhythm in sleeping lizards ( Pogona vitticeps ) 7–9 and test the hypothesis that it originates in a central pattern generator 10,11 —circuits that are typically susceptible to phase-dependent reset and entrainment by external stimuli 12 . Using light pulses, we find that Pogona ’s ultradian rhythm 8 can be reset in a phase-dependent manner, with a critical transition from phase delay to phase advance in the middle of SW. The ultradian rhythm frequency can be decreased or increased, within limits, by entrainment with light pulses. During entrainment, Pogona REM (REM P ) can be shortened but not lengthened, whereas SW can be dilated more flexibly. In awake animals, a few alternating light/dark epochs matching natural REM P and SW durations entrain a sleep-like brain rhythm, suggesting the transient activation of an ultradian rhythm generator. In sleeping animals, a light pulse delivered to a single eye causes an immediate ultradian rhythm reset, but only of the contralateral hemisphere; both sides resynchronize spontaneously, indicating that sleep is controlled by paired rhythm-generating circuits linked by functional excitation. Our results indicate that central pattern generators of a type usually known to control motor rhythms may also organize the ultradian sleep rhythm in a vertebrate.",

          "abstract": "The physical manifestations of memory formation and recall are fundamental questions that remain unresolved1. At the cellular level, ensembles of neurons called engrams are activated by learning events and control memory recall1,2,3,4,5. Astrocytes are found in close proximity to neurons and engage in a range of activities that support neurotransmission and circuit plasticity6,7,8,9,10. Moreover, astrocytes exhibit experience-dependent plasticity11,12,13, although whether specific ensembles of astrocytes participate in memory recall remains obscure. Here we show that learning events induce c-Fos expression in a subset of hippocampal astrocytes, and that this subsequently regulates the function of the hippocampal circuit in mice. Intersectional labelling of astrocyte ensembles with c-Fos after learning events shows that they are closely affiliated with engram neurons, and reactivation of these astrocyte ensembles stimulates memory recall. At the molecular level, learning-associated astrocyte (LAA) ensembles exhibit elevated expression of nuclear factor I-A, and its selective deletion from this population suppresses memory recall. Taken together, our data identify LAA ensembles as a form of plasticity that is sufficient to provoke memory recall and indicate that astrocytes are an active component of the engram.",

          "abstract": "Electrically induced amorphization is uncommon and has so far been realized by pulsed electrical current in only a few material systems, which are mostly based on the melt–quench process1. However, if the melting step can be avoided and solid-state amorphization can be realized electrically, it opens up the possibility for low-power device applications2,3,4,5. Here we report an energy-efficient, unconventional long-range solid-state amorphization in a new ferroic β″-phase of indium selenide nanowires through the application of a direct-current bias rather than a pulsed electrical stimulus. The complex interplay of the applied electric field perpendicular to the polarization, current flow parallel to the van der Waals layer and piezoelectric stress results in the formation of interlayer sliding defects and coupled disorder induced by in-plane polarization rotation in this layered material. On reaching a critical limit of the electrically induced disorder, the structure becomes frustrated and locally collapses into an amorphous phase6, and this phenomenon is replicated over a much larger microscopic-length scale through acoustic jerks7,8. Our work uncovers previously unknown multimodal coupling mechanisms of the ferroic order in materials to the externally applied electric field, current and internally generated stress, and can be useful to design new materials and devices for low-power electronic and photonic applications.",

          "abstract": "Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events detected from beyond the Milky Way. FRB emission characteristics favour highly magnetized neutron stars, or magnetars, as the sources1, as evidenced by FRB-like bursts from a galactic magnetar2,3, and the star-forming nature of FRB host galaxies4,5. However, the processes that produce FRB sources remain unknown6. Although galactic magnetars are often linked to core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe)7, it is uncertain what determines which supernovae result in magnetars. The galactic environments of FRB sources can be used to investigate their progenitors. Here, we present the stellar population properties of 30 FRB host galaxies discovered by the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Our analysis shows a marked deficit of low-mass FRB hosts compared with the occurrence of star formation in the Universe, implying that FRBs are a biased tracer of star formation, preferentially selecting massive star-forming galaxies. This bias may be driven by galaxy metallicity, which is positively correlated with stellar mass8. Metal-rich environments may favour the formation of magnetar progenitors through stellar mergers9,10, as higher-metallicity stars are less compact and more likely to fill their Roche lobes, leading to unstable mass transfer. Although massive stars do not have convective interiors to generate strong magnetic fields by dynamo11, merger remnants are thought to have the requisite internal magnetic-field strengths to result in magnetars11,12. The preferential occurrence of FRBs in massive star-forming galaxies suggests that a core-collapse supernova of merger remnants preferentially forms magnetars.",

Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been investigated through, for example, measurements of the phase coherence8,9,10 and gapless Goldstone modes13, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases14,15 and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order11,16,17, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase (SSP). Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids.

Classical molecular dynamics simulation is fast but lacks chemical accuracy4,5. Quantum chemistry methods such as density functional theory can reach chemical accuracy but cannot scale to support large biomolecules6. Here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based ab initio biomolecular dynamics system (AI2BMD) that can efficiently simulate full-atom large biomolecules with ab initio accuracy. AI2BMD uses a protein fragmentation scheme and a machine learning force field7 to achieve generalizable ab initio accuracy for energy and force calculations for various proteins comprising more than 10,000 atoms. Compared to density functional theory, it reduces the computational time by several orders of magnitude. With several hundred nanoseconds of dynamics simulations, AI2BMD demonstrated its ability to efficiently explore the conformational space of peptides and proteins, deriving accurate 3J couplings that match nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and showing protein folding and unfolding processes. Furthermore, AI2BMD enables precise free-energy calculations for protein folding, and the estimated thermodynamic properties are well aligned with experiments. AI2BMD could potentially complement wet-lab experiments, detect the dynamic processes of bioactivities and enable biomedical research that is impossible to conduct at present.",

          "abstract": "To flexibly adapt to new situations, our brains must understand the regularities in the world, as well as those in our own patterns of behaviour. A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world 1–6 . However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown. Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios. We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations. The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space. These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly. Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step. Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step. These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep. Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.",

It might therefore seem reasonable to think of the nucleus as a tiny, point-like ball. Further investigation, however, reveals that nuclei take on a range of shapes, with ellipsoids being the most common. Information about nuclear shape is typically obtained by shooting a beam of particles onto a fixed target at velocities of a few per cent of the speed of light1. Writing in Nature, the STAR Collaboration2 reports that detailed imaging of nuclear shapes is also possible using data collected when heavy ions collide at velocities that approach the speed of light.",

          "abstract": "Theories of how humans came to be so ecologically dominant increasingly centre on the adaptive abilities of human culture and its capacity for cumulative change and high-fidelity transmission. Here we revisit this hypothesis by comparing human culture with animal cultures and cases of epigenetic inheritance and parental effects. We first conclude that cumulative change and high transmission fidelity are not unique to human culture as previously thought, and so they are unlikely to explain its adaptive qualities. We then evaluate the evidence for seven alternative explanations: the inheritance of acquired characters, the pathways of inheritance, the non-random generation of variation, the scope of heritable variation, effects on organismal fitness, effects on genetic fitness and effects on evolutionary dynamics. From these, we identify the open-ended scope of human cultural variation as a key, but generally neglected, phenomenon. We end by articulating a hypothesis for the cognitive basis of this open-endedness.",

          "abstract": "In many contemporary democracies, political polarization increasingly involves deep-seated intolerance of opposing partisans. The decades-old contact hypothesis suggests that cross-partisan interactions might reduce intolerance if individuals interact with equal social status. Here we test this idea by implementing collaborative contact between 1,227 pairs of citizens (2,454 individuals) with opposing partisan sympathies in Mexico, using the online medium to credibly randomize participants’ relative social status within the interaction. Interacting under both equal and unequal status enhanced tolerant behaviour immediately after contact; however, 3 weeks later, only the salutary effects of equal contact endured. These results demonstrate that a simple, scalable intervention that puts people on equal footing can reduce partisan polarization and make online contact into a prosocial force.",

          "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of cyberbullying victimization has become a commonplace issue globally. Although research has explored various predictors and consequences of cyberbullying victimization, most focus on a narrow range of variables or contexts, highlighting the need to comprehensively review and synthesize the wealth of empirical findings. We conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses on cyberbullying victimization, incorporating 56 meta-analyses and 296 effect sizes (sample size range 421–1,136,080, sample size median 53,183; searched via EBSCOhost ERIC, EBSCOhost PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, 13 cyberbullying-related journals, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) to address the following critical questions: (1) What are the crucial sociodemographic and psychological profiles of cyberbullying victims? (2) What critical contextual and environmental factors are associated with cyberbullying victimization? (3) What are the key psychological and behavioural consequences of cyberbullying victimization? (4) How effective are existing interventions in mitigating impacts of cyberbullying? Included meta-analyses had to focus on cyberbullying victimization and report at least one predictor or consequence. A quality assessment was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Instrument for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses. Findings suggest that females, school-aged populations, traditional bullying victims and frequent internet users were more likely to be cyberbullied. Unregulated school environments and unsupportive parental relationships were also associated with increased cyberbullying victimization. Cyberbullying victimization was consistently associated with negative psychological outcomes, lower school performance and maladaptive coping behaviours. More importantly, the current review found that cyberbullying intervention programmes show promising results. The current review underscores the importance of devoting adequate resources to mitigating cyberbullying victimization.",

However, despite substantial improvements in primary school enrolment, most students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) fail to learn to read by age 10. We report reading assessment data from over half a million pupils from 48 LMICs tested primarily in a language of instruction and show that these pupils are failing to acquire the most basic skills that contribute to reading comprehension. Pupils in LMICs across the first three instructional years are not acquiring the ability to decode printed words fluently and, in most cases, are failing to master the names and sounds associated with letters. Moreover, performance gaps against benchmarks widen with each instructional year. Literacy goals in LMICs will be reached only by ensuring focus on decoding skills in early-grade readers.

          "abstract": "We use the rise of Black Lives Matter and the sentiment of racial sympathy to examine the interplay between the social movement and citizens’ sympathetic actions in supporting Black people. Using detailed food order flow information from one of the largest online food delivery platforms in the USA, we find that the total number of food orders from Black-owned restaurants increased by 39% relative to nearby non-Black-owned restaurants in the 140 days following the murder of George Floyd on the basis of a difference-in-difference model. The platform company’s strategic traffic allocation acted as an accelerator, enhancing the sympathetic responses of individuals, but it did not drive the entire surge in food orders. Protests resulting in severe injuries and those linked to demands for defunding the police diminished the positive sympathetic responses, highlighting a potential risk associated with protests. Our study provides large-scale, micro-level evidence that social movements and increased sympathy can foster collective actions to support marginalized communities.",

Here we performed a large-scale exome analysis of white British individuals from UK Biobank, revealing the role of coding variants in neuroticism. For rare variants, collapsing analysis uncovered 14 neuroticism-associated genes. Among these, 12 (PTPRE, BCL10, TRIM32, ANKRD12, ADGRB2, MON2, HIF1A, ITGB2, STK39, CAPNS2, OGFOD1 and KDM4B) were novel, and the remaining (MADD and TRPC4AP) showed convergent evidence with common variants. Heritability of rare coding variants was estimated to be up to 7.3% for neuroticism. For common variants, we identified 78 significant associations, implicating 6 unreported genes. We subsequently replicated these variants using meta-analysis across other four ancestries from UK Biobank and summary data from 23andMe sample. Furthermore, these variants had widespread impacts on neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive abilities and brain structure. Our findings deepen the understanding of neuroticism’s genetic architecture and provide potential targets for future mechanistic research.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is constructive in nature. Instead of passively retaining information, WM reorganizes complex sequences into hierarchically embedded chunks to overcome capacity limits and facilitate flexible behaviour. Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying hierarchical reorganization in WM, we performed two electroencephalography and one magnetoencephalography experiments, wherein humans retain in WM a temporal sequence of items, that is, syllables, which are organized into chunks, that is, multisyllabic words. We demonstrate that the one-dimensional sequence is represented by two-dimensional neural representational geometry in WM arising from left prefrontal and temporoparietal regions, with separate dimensions encoding item position within a chunk and chunk position in the sequence. Critically, this two-dimensional geometry is observed consistently in different experimental settings, even during tasks not encouraging hierarchical reorganization in WM and correlates with WM behaviour. Overall, these findings strongly support that complex sequences are reorganized into factorized multidimensional neural representational geometry in WM, which also speaks to general structure-based organizational principles given WM’s involvement in many cognitive functions.",

          "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that technologies evolve with recombinant inventions. However, it remains unknown whether technologies developed using different approaches would exhibit different features during evolution. In particular, would technologies developed mainly based on accumulated experience in practices—formulas of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are typical examples of such technologies—have similar evolution features found in modern technologies? This study applied network science to explore the evolution of TCM from the perspective of recombinant inventions based on 59,063 TCM formulas documented over the last two thousand years, with each formula being a combination of components that are mostly herbs. Our results show that similar to modern technological systems, the TCM component networks maintained the core–periphery structures during evolution, and the (weighted) degrees of components followed heavy-tailed distributions. Moreover, simple tuples, which are frequently used combinations of TCM components, serve as building blocks for complex ones. A significant difference with modern technological systems is that the TCM core components were quite stable, while substitutions of core components are frequently observed in modern technological systems, leading to new technological trajectories. TCM comprises ancient knowledge and wisdom. This research provides insight into how it will be like in the future and what is important for its future.",

Our findings reveal a different type of MademoiseLLE domain (MLLE) featuring a seven-helical bundle that provides a distinct binding interface. A comparative analysis with the canonical MademoiseLLE domain of the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1 disclosed unique characteristics of both domains. Deciphering the MLLE binding code enabled prediction and verification of previously unknown Rrm4 interactors containing short linear motifs. Importantly, we demonstrated that the human MLLE domains, such as those of PABPC1 and UBR5, employed a similar principle to distinguish among interaction partners.

Methionine oxidation can result in structural damage or be the basis of functional regulation of enzymes. In addition to participating in redox reactions, methionines play an important role as the initiator residue of translated proteins where they are commonly modified at their α-amine group by formylation or acetylation. Here, we investigated how formylation and acetylation of initiator methionines impact their propensity for oxidation and reduction. We show that in vitro, N-terminal methionine residues are particularly prone to chemical oxidation and that their modification by formylation or acetylation greatly enhances their subsequent enzymatic reduction by MsrA and MsrB. Concordantly, in vivo ablation of methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (MTF) in Escherichia coli increases the prevalence of oxidized methionines within synthesized proteins. We show that oxidation of formylated initiator methionines is detrimental in part because it obstructs their ensuing deformylation by peptide deformylase (PDF) and hydrolysis by methionyl aminopeptidase (MAP). Thus, by facilitating their reduction, formylation mitigates the misprocessing of oxidized initiator methionines.",

          "abstract": "The choroid is the thin, vasculature-filled layer of the eye situated between the sclera and the retina, where it serves the metabolic needs of the light-sensing photoreceptors in the retina. Illumination of the interior surface of the back of the eye (fundus) is a critical regulator of subretinal fluid homeostasis, which determines the overall shape of the eye, but it is also important for choroidal perfusion. Noted for having some of the highest blood flow rates in the body, the choroidal vasculature has been reported to lack intrinsic, intravascular pressure-induced (myogenic) autoregulatory mechanisms. Here, we ask how light directly regulates choroid perfusion and ocular fluid homeostasis, testing the hypothesis that light facilitates ocular fluid absorption by directly increasing choroid endothelial permeability and decreasing choroid perfusion. Utilizing ex vivo pressurized whole-choroid and whole-eye preparations from mice expressing cell-specific Ca 2+ indicators, we found that the choroidal vasculature has two intrinsically light-sensitive Ca 2+ -signaling mechanisms: One increases Ca 2+ -dependent production of nitric oxide in choroidal endothelial cells; the other promotes vasoconstriction through Ca 2+ elevation in vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, we found that choroidal flow, or pressure, modulates endothelial and smooth muscle photosensitivity and trans-retinal absorption of fluid into the choroid. These results collectively suggest that the choroid vasculature exhibits an inverted form of autoregulatory control, where pressure- and light-induced mechanisms work in opposition to regulate blood flow and maintain fluid balance in response to changes in light and dark, aligning with the metabolic needs of photoreceptors.",

The vast majority of these appear to be sporadic cases associated with small contamination episodes and do not trigger investigations. A “contamination episode” refers to one or more contamination events from a single source over a period of time. We examine clusters of sequenced clinical isolates of Salmonella , Escherichia coli , Campylobacter , and Listeria that differ by only a small number of mutations (SNPs) to identify features of the underlying contamination episodes. These analyses provide additional evidence that the youngest age groups have greater susceptibility to infection by Salmonella , E. coli , and Campylobacter than older age groups. This age bias is weaker for the common Salmonella serovar Enteritidis than Salmonella in general. A large fraction of the contamination episodes causing sickness appear to have a long duration. For example, 50% of the Salmonella cases are in clusters that persist for almost 3 y. For all four pathogen species, the majority of the cases were part of genetic clusters with illnesses in multiple states and likely to be caused by contaminated commercially distributed foods. Salmonella infections in infants under 3 mo are predominantly acquired from the same contaminated food, pet food, or environmental sources as older individuals, rather than infant formula contaminated during production.",

          "abstract": "The role of nonneuronal cells in the resolution of cerebral ischemia remains to be fully understood. To decode key molecular and cellular processes that occur after ischemia, we performed spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the male mouse brain during the first week of injury. Cortical gene expression was severely disrupted, defined by inflammation and cell death in the lesion core, and glial scar formation orchestrated by multiple cell types on the periphery. The glial scar was identified as a zone with intense cell–cell communication, with prominent ApoE-Trem2 signaling pathway modulating microglial activation. For each of the three major glial populations, an inflammatory-responsive state, resembling the reactive states observed in neurodegenerative contexts, was observed. The recovered spectrum of ischemia-induced oligodendrocyte states supports the emerging hypothesis that oligodendrocytes actively respond to and modulate the neuroinflammatory stimulus. The findings are further supported by analysis of other spatial transcriptomic datasets from different mouse models of ischemic brain injury. Collectively, we present a landmark transcriptomic dataset accompanied by interactive visualization that provides a comprehensive view of spatiotemporal organization of processes in the postischemic mouse brain.",

We quantify the precision of axonemal oscillations after controlled chemical removal of dynein motors, providing an experimental test for the theory prediction that the quality factor of motor oscillations should increase with motor number.

We determined ORF7b interactions with cellular TM leucine zipper proteins using both biochemical and NMR approaches, providing evidence for ORF7b interaction with the TM domains of E-cadherin, as well as phospholamban.

By contrast, plastidial genomes of photosynthetic land plants generally possess a complete set of tRNA genes and the existence of plastidial tRNA import remains a long-standing question. The early vascular plants of the Selaginella genus show an extensive loss of plastidial tRNA genes while retaining photosynthetic capacity, and represent an ideal model for answering this question. Using purification, northern blot hybridization, and high-throughput tRNA sequencing, a global analysis of total and plastidial tRNA populations was undertaken in Selaginella kraussiana. We confirmed the expression of all plastidial tRNA genes and, conversely, observed that nucleus-encoded tRNAs corresponding to these plastidial tRNAs were generally excluded from the chloroplasts. We then demonstrated a selective and differential plastidial import of around forty nucleus-encoded tRNA species, likely compensating for the insufficient coding capacity of plastidial-encoded tRNAs. In-depth analysis revealed differential import of tRNA isodecoders, leading to the identification of specific situations. This includes the expression and import of nucleus-encoded tRNAs expressed from plastidial or bacterial-like genes inserted into the nuclear genome. Overall, our results confirm the existence of molecular processes that enable tRNAs to be selectively imported not only into mitochondria, as previously described, but also into chloroplasts, when necessary.",

In the absence of N6AMT1 , or when its catalytic activity is abolished, RNA processing within mitochondria is impaired, leading to the accumulation of unprocessed and double-stranded RNA, thus preventing mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, and leading to an immune response.

In this study, we identified an unconventional P450 enzyme, PtmB, which catalyzes the dimerization of purine nucleobases and tryptophan-containing diketopiperazines (TDKPs), yielding C3-nucleobase pyrroloindolines and nucleobase-TDKP dimers. Unlike typical TDKP P450 enzymes reliant on NAD(P)H cofactors and electron transfer systems, PtmB, and its analogs exhibit remarkable peroxidase activity in synthesizing adenine and other modified 6-aminopurine nucleobase-TDKP dimers. Structural analysis of the PtmB–substrate complex, mutation assays, and computational investigations reveal adenine’s dual role as both substrate and acid–base catalyst in activating H 2 O 2 to generate Compound I (Cpd I). This initiates a specific radical cascade reaction, facilitating the formation of precise C─C and C─N bonds. Biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that adenine’s 6-NH 2 hydrogen-bonding networks induce necessary conformational changes for H 2 O 2 activation, thereby driving peroxidase activity. This study unveils an unusual catalytic mechanism for the P450 peroxidase system and underscores the pivotal role of nucleobases in enzyme-mediated reactions, which offers different prospects for developing P450 peroxidases and nucleobase-based biocatalysts.",

          "abstract": "Frictional slip between bodies having different elastic or geometrical properties (bimaterial interfaces) creates a unique type of rupture, bimaterial “slip pulses.” These slip pulses propagate along the interfaces separating elastically different contacting bodies. They exhibit highly localized slip with accompanying local normal stress reduction. These pulses do not result from properties of “friction laws” but, instead, are formed via the elastic mismatch of the contacting bodies. Here, we experimentally study slip pulse dynamics, evolution, and structure in seven different bimaterial interfaces. We find that slip pulses are a major vehicle for frictional motion in bimaterial interfaces, they exist in well-defined velocity windows and undergo unstable growth consistent with theoretical predictions coined the “Adams instability.” When scaled properly, slip pulses exhibit both universal spatial structure and growth dynamics. While slip pulse amplitudes vary considerably within different interfaces, this variation is, surprisingly, not highly dependent on the contrast of the elastic properties of the contacting materials. Instead, slip pulse amplitudes are closely related to the interfaces’ aging properties and, hence, to material plasticity at the interface. As bimaterial interfaces are generic, these results are fundamentally important to both frictional dynamics and the dynamics of earthquakes within a wide class of natural faults.",

For nearly 70 y, channeling of this intermediate from the active site of glutamate 5-kinase to the active site of GP reductase has been believed to protect GP from cyclization to a dead-end product. However, the evidence presented in support of this idea is not conclusive. We show that changes in the structures of the kinase or reductase that should preclude a protein–protein interaction do not compromise proline synthesis in Escherichia coli , demonstrating that channeling does not occur. We calculate that the half-life of GP is 320 ms. Although GP is indeed unstable, it should diffuse the length of an E. coli cell in less than 3 ms. Thus, most GP produced by glutamate 5-kinase should encounter the active site of GP reductase before cyclization occurs.",

Comparison with nvTRPM2 without nucleotide reveals that nucleotide binding-induced movements in the protein’s three “core” layers deconvolve into a set of rigid-body rotations conserved from cnidarians to man. By covalently crosslinking engineered cysteine pairs we systematically trap the cytosolic layers in specific conformations and study effects on gate opening/closure. The data show that nucleotide binding in Layer 3 disrupts inhibitory intersubunit interactions, allowing rotation of Layer 2 which in turn expands the gate located in Layer 1.

In Vibrio cholerae colonies, a program of spatial-temporal cell death is among the QS-controlled traits. Cell death occurs in two phases, first along the colony rim, and subsequently, at the colony center. Both cell death phases are driven by the type 6 secretion system (T6SS). Here, we show that HapR, the master QS regulator, does not control t6ss gene expression nor T6SS-mediated killing activity. Nonetheless, a Δ hapR strain displays no cell death at the colony rim. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses reveal that HapR activates expression of an operon containing four genes of unknown function, vca0646-0649. Epistasis and overexpression studies show that two of the genes, vca0646 and vca0647 , are required to drive cell death in both a Δ hapR and a Δ hapR Δ t6ss strain. Thus, vca0646 - 0649 are regulated by HapR but act independently of the T6SS machinery to cause cell death, suggesting that a second, parallel pathway to cell death exists in V. cholerae .",

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the transition barrier vanishes at the transition temperature. The simulations further show that two low-frequency vibrational–librational modes are directly related to the order parameter that describes this phase transition, which is supported by experimental Raman spectroscopy studies.

Defrosting the planet would result in a plume of fresh glacial meltwater with a different chemical composition from underlying hypersaline seawater, generating both vertical and lateral salinity gradients. Here, we test the plumeworld hypothesis using lithium isotope compositions in the Ediacaran Doushantuo cap dolostone that accumulated in the aftermath of the Marinoan snowball Earth along a proximal–distal (nearshore–offshore) transect in South China. Our data show an overall decreasing δ 7 Li trend with distance from the shoreline, consistent with the variable mixing of a meltwater plume with high δ 7 Li (due to incongruent silicate weathering on the continent) and hypersaline seawater with low δ 7 Li (due to synglacial distillation). The evolution of low δ 7 Li of synglacial seawater, as opposed to the modern oceans with high δ 7 Li, was likely driven by weak continental chemical weathering coupled with strong reverse weathering on the seafloor underneath silica-rich oceans. The spatial pattern of δ 7 Li is also consistent with the development and then collapse of the meltwater plume that occurred at the time scale of cap dolostone accumulation. Therefore, the δ 7 Li data are consistent with the plumeworld hypothesis, considerably reduced chemical weathering on the continent during the Marinoan snowball Earth, and enhanced reverse weathering on the seafloor of Precambrian oceans.",

Here, we demonstrate that 5hmU contents vary among different dinoflagellates and are generated through thymidine hydroxylation. Importantly, we identified the enzyme, which is a putative dinoflagellate TET/JBP homolog, catalyzing 5hmU production using both in vivo and in vitro biochemical assays. Based on the near-chromosomal level genome assembly of dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae , we depicted a comprehensive 5hmU landscape and found that 5hmU loci are significantly enriched in repeat elements. Moreover, inhibition of 5hmU via dioxygenase inhibitor leads to transcriptional activation of 5hmU-marked transposable elements, implying that 5hmU appears to serve as an epigenetic mark for silencing transposon. Together, our results revealed the biogenesis, genome-wide landscape, and molecular function of dinoflagellate 5hmU, providing mechanistic insight into the function of this enigmatic DNA mark.",

          "abstract": "The proton-motive force (PMF), consisting of a pH gradient and a membrane potential (ΔΨ) underpins many processes essential to bacterial growth and/or survival. Yet bacteria often enter a bioenergetically diminished state characterized by a low PMF. Consequently, they have increased tolerance for diverse stressors, including clinical antibiotics. Despite the ubiquity of low metabolic rates in the environment, the extent to which bacteria have agency over entry into such a low-bioenergetic state has received relatively little attention. Here, we tested the hypothesis that production of redox-active metabolites (RAMs) could drive such a physiological transition. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that produces phenazines, model RAMs that are highly toxic in the presence of molecular oxygen (O 2 ). Under oxic conditions, the phenazines pyocyanin and phenazine-1-carboximide, as well as toxoflavin—a RAM produced by Burkholderia species—suppress the ΔΨ in distinct ways across distributions of single cells, reduce the efficiency of proton pumping, and lower cellular adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels. In planktonic culture, the degree and rate by which each RAM lowers the ΔΨ correlates with the protection it confers against antibiotics that strongly impact cellular energy flux. This bioenergetic suppression requires the RAM’s presence and corresponds to its cellular reduction rate and abiotic oxidation rate by O 2 ; it can be reversed by increasing the ΔΨ with nigericin. RAMs similarly impact the bioenergetic state of cells in (hyp)oxic biofilm aggregates. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bacteria can suppress their bioenergetic state by the production of endogenous toxins in a manner that bolsters stress resilience.",

          "abstract": "A faster cruising speed increases drag and thereby the thrust ( T ) needed to fly, while weight and lift ( L ) requirement remains constant. Birds can adjust their wingbeat in multiple ways to accommodate this change in aerodynamic force, but the relative costs of different strategies remain largely unknown. To evaluate the efficiency of several kinematic strategies, I used a robotic wing [E. Ajanic, A. Paolini, C. Coster, D. Floreano, C. Johansson, Adv. Intell. Syst. 5 , 2200148 (2023)] and quantitative flow measurements. I found that, among the tested strategies, changing the mean wingbeat elevation provides the most efficient solution to changing thrust-to-lift ratio ( T / L) , offering insight into why birds tend to beat their wings with a greater ventral than dorsal excursion. I also found that although propulsive efficiency (η p ) may peak at a Strouhal number ( St , measure of relative flapping speed) near 0.3, the overall efficiency of generating force decreases with St . This challenges the expectance of a specific optimal St for flapping flight and instead suggest the chosen St depends on T / L . This may explain variation in preferred St among birds and why bats prefer flying at higher St than birds [G. K. Taylor, R. L. Nudds, A. L. Thomas, Nature 425 , 707–711 (2003)], since their body shape imposes relatively higher thrust requirements [F. T. Muijres, L. C. Johansson, M. S. Bowlin, Y. Winter, A.

However, some putative diazotrophic bacteria, like Roseiflexus sp. RS-1, lack the nifEN genes, suggesting an alternative pathway for maturation of FeMo-co that does not require NifEN. In this study, the Roseiflexus NifH, NifB, and apo-NifDK proteins produced in Escherichia coli are shown to be sufficient for FeMo-co maturation and insertion into the NifDK protein to achieve active nitrogenase. The E. coli expressed NifDK RS contained P-clusters but was devoid of FeMo-co (referred to as apo-NifDK RS ). Apo-NifDK RS could be activated for N 2 reduction by addition of preformed FeMo-co. Further, it was found that apo-NifDK RS plus E. coli produced NifB RS and NifH RS were sufficient to yield active NifDK RS when incubated with the necessary substrates (homocitrate, molybdate, and S -adenosylmethionine [SAM]), demonstrating that these proteins can replace the need for NifEN in maturation of Mo-nitrogenase. The E. coli produced NifH RS and NifB RS proteins were independently shown to be functional. The reconstituted NifDK RS demonstrated reduction of N 2 , protons, and acetylene in ratios observed for Azotobacter vinelandii NifDK. These findings reveal a distinct NifEN-independent pathway for nitrogenase activation involving NifH RS , NifB RS , and apo-NifDK RS .",

Dendritic Ca 2+ spikes are generally thought to produce plateau-like dendritic depolarization and somatic complex spike burst (CSB) firing, which can initiate rapid changes in spatial coding properties of hippocampal pyramidal cells (PCs). However, here we reveal that a morpho-topographically distinguishable subpopulation of rat and mouse hippocampal CA3PCs exhibits compound apical dendritic Ca 2+ spikes with unusually short duration that do not support the firing of sustained CSBs. These Ca 2+ spikes are mediated by L-type Ca 2+ channels and their time course is restricted by A- and M-type K + channels. Cholinergic activation powerfully converts short Ca 2+ spikes to long-duration forms, and facilitates and prolongs CSB firing. We propose that cholinergic neuromodulation controls the ability of a CA3PC subtype to generate sustained plateau potentials, providing a state-dependent dendritic mechanism for memory encoding and retrieval.",

In this study, we focus on the metabolic interactions of Mycobacterium abscessus with Drosophila melanogaster . We identify MAB_1132c as an asparagine transporter required for pathogenicity in M. abscessus . We show that this requirement is specifically associated with damage to the host: flies infected with MAB_1132c knockout bacteria, or with wild-type bacteria grown in asparagine-restricted conditions, are longer lived without showing a significant change in bacterial load. This is associated with a reduction in the host innate immune response, demonstrated by the decreased transcription of antimicrobial peptides as well as a significant reduction in the ability of the infection to disrupt systemic insulin signaling. Much of the increase in host survival during infection with asparagine-limited M. abscessus can be attributed to alterations in unpaired cytokine signaling. This demonstrates that asparagine transport in M. abscessus prior to infection is not required for replicative fitness in vivo but does significantly influence the interaction with the host immune responses.",

While kirigami metamaterials have been fabricated by various methods, such as 3D printing, cutting, casting, and assemblage of building blocks, the “folded kirigami” claim their distinctive properties from the universal folding protocols. For a target kirigami pattern, we design an extended high-genus pattern with appropriate sets of creases and cuts, and proceed to fold it sequentially to yield the cellular structure of a 2D lattice endowed with finite out-of-plane thickness. The strategy combines two features that are generally mutually exclusive in canonical methods: fabrication involving a single piece of material and realization of nearly ideal intercell hinges. We test the approach against a diverse portfolio of triangular and quadrilateral kirigami configurations. We demonstrate a plethora of emerging metamaterial functionalities, including topological phase-switching reconfigurability between polarized and nonpolarized states in kagome kirigami, and availability of nonreciprocal mechanical response in square-rhombus kirigami.",

          "abstract": "Many seabirds congregate in large colonies for breeding, a time when they are central place foragers. An influential idea in seabird ecology posits that competition during breeding results in an area of reduced prey availability around colonies, a phenomenon known as Ashmole’s halo, and that this limits colony size. This idea has gained empirical support, including the finding that species coexisting within a colony might be able to do so by foraging on a single prey species but at different distances. Here, we provide a comprehensive mathematical model for central place foragers exploiting a single prey in a two-dimensional environment, where the prey distribution is the result of intrinsic birth and death, movement in space, and mortality due to foraging birds (we also consider a variant tailored toward colonial social insects). Bird predation at different distances occurs according to an ideal free foraging distribution that maximizes prey delivery under flight and search costs. We fully characterize the birds’ ideal free distribution and the prey distribution it generates. Our results show that prey depletion halos around breeding colonies are a robust phenomenon and that the birds’ ideal free distribution is sensitive to prey movement. Furthermore, coexistence of several seabird species on a single prey easily emerges through behavioral niche partitioning whenever trait differences between species entail trade-offs between efficiently exploiting a scarce prey close to the colony and a more abundant prey far away. Such behavioral-based coexistence-inducing mechanism should generalize to other habitat and diet choice scenarios.",

However, the contribution of the APR and its interactions with the conoid remain unclear. To gain insight into the APR architecture, ultrastructure expansion microscopy was applied to pinpoint known and newly identified APR proteins (APR2 to APR7). Our results revealed that the APR is constructed as a fixed multilayered structure. Notably, conditional depletion of APR2 resulted in significant impairments in motility and invasion. Electron microscopy and cryoelectron tomography revealed that depletion of APR2 alters APR integrity, affecting conoid extrusion and causing cytosolic leakage of F-actin.

          "abstract": "High-resolution full waveform seismic tomography of the Earth’s mantle beneath the south and central Atlantic Ocean brings into focus a series of asthenospheric low shear velocity channels, or “fingers” on both sides of the southern and central mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR), elongated in the direction of absolute plate motion with a spacing of ∼ 1,800 to 2,000 km, and associated with bands of shallower residual seafloor depth anomalies that suggest channeled flow over thousands of kilometers. Each of the three most clearly resolved fingers on the African side of the MAR corresponds to a separate group of whole mantle plumes rooted in distinct patches at the core–mantle boundary, feeding hotspots, and volcanic lines with distinct isotopic signatures. Plumes of a given group appear to merge at the top of the lower mantle before separating again, suggesting interaction of deep mantle flow with a more vigorous mesoscale circulation in the upper mantle. The corresponding hotspots are generally offset from the location of the deep mantle plume roots. The distinct isotopic signatures of these hotspot groups are also detected in the mid-ocean ridge basalts at the location where the fingers meet the ridge. Meanwhile, at least some of the variability within each plume group could originate in the upper mantle and extended transition zone where plumes in a given group appear to merge and pond. This study also adds to mounting evidence that the African large low shear velocity province is not a uniform, unbroken pile of dense material rising high above the core–mantle boundary, but rather a collection of mantle plumes rooted in patches of distinct composition.",

Accordingly, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13 , two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing a high number of CTCF sites, potentially isolating Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster and thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes. These defects were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant Embryonic Stem (ES) cells grown as pseudoembryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in detail the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB , and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations were already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.",

This instability captures the interplay of Coulomb repulsion, Pauli exclusion, and twofold fermionic spin degeneracy. In materials with spin–orbit coupling, this fermionic spin is generalized to a twofold degenerate pseudospin which is typically believed to have symmetry properties as spin. Here, we identify a distinct symmetry of this pseudospin that forbids it to couple to a Zeeman field. This “spinless” property is required to exist in five nonsymmorphic space groups and has nontrivial implications for superconductivity and magnetism. With Coulomb repulsion, Fermi surfaces composed primarily of this spinless pseudospin property give rise to Stoner instabilities into magnetic states that are qualitatively different than ferromagnets. These spinless-pseudospin ferromagnets break time-reversal symmetry, have a vanishing magnetization, are noncollinear, and exhibit momentum-dependent energy band spin-splittings. In superconductors, for all pairing symmetries and field orientations, this spinless pseudospin extinguishes paramagnetic limiting.

Herein, we present a technique, lamination-based organoid spatially resolved transcriptomics (LOSRT), for organoid-spatially resolved transcriptomics based on organoid lamination. Primary mouse lung and liver-derived organoids were used in this study. The organoids were formulated using the droplet-engineering method and laminated using a homemade device with weight compression. This technique preserved most cells in individual organoids while maintaining delicate epithelium structures in laminated domains that can be recognized through visual segmentation. The mouse lung and liver organoids were resolved comprising various cell types, including alveolar cells, damage-associated transient progenitor cells, basal cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes, and hepatic stellate cells. The distribution and count of cells were confirmed using immunohistology and identified with spatial transcriptomic features.

Here, we demonstrate that a newborn F-box gene, Cni-neib-1 , of the nematode Caenorhabditis nigoni specifically inactivates an essential phosphoglucomutase encoded by Cbr-shls-1 in its sister species Caenorhabditis briggsae and their hybrids. Zygotic expression of Cni-neib-1 specifically depletes Cbr- SHLS-1, but not Cni- SHLS-1, in approximately 40 min starting from gastrulation, causing embryonic death. Cni-neib-1 is one of thirty-three paralogues emerging from a recent surge in F-box gene duplication events within C. nigoni , all of which are evolving under positive selection. Cni-neib-1 undergoes turnover even among C. nigoni populations. Differential expansion of F-box genes between the two species could reflect their distinctive innate immune responses. Collectively, we demonstrate how recent duplication of genes involved in protein degradation can cause incidental destruction of targets in hybrids that leads to HI, providing an invaluable insight into mechanisms of speciation.",

          "abstract": "To maintain CO 2 fixation in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle, multistep regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF 1 F o ) is crucial to balance the ATP output of photosynthesis with protection of the apparatus. A well-studied mechanism is thiol modulation; a light/dark regulation through reversible cleavage of a disulfide in the CF 1 F o γ-subunit. The disulfide hampers ATP synthesis and hydrolysis reactions in dark-adapted CF 1 F o from land plants by increasing the required transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient ( Δ μ ∼ H + ). Here, we show in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that algal CF 1 F o is differently regulated in vivo. A specific hairpin structure in the γ-subunit redox domain disconnects activity regulation from disulfide formation in the dark. Electrochromic shift measurements suggested that the hairpin kept wild-type CF 1 F o active, whereas the enzyme was switched off in algal mutant cells expressing a plant-like hairpin structure. The hairpin segment swap resulted in an elevated Δ μ ∼ H + threshold to activate plant-like CF 1 F o , increased by ~1.4 photosystem (PS) I charge separations. The resulting dark-equilibrated Δ μ ∼ H + dropped in the mutants by ~2.7 PSI charge separation equivalents. Photobioreactor experiments showed no phenotypes in autotrophic aerated mutant cultures. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements under heterotrophic dark conditions point to an altered dark metabolism in cells with the plant-like CF 1 F o as the result of bioenergetic deviations from wild-type. Our results suggest that the lifestyle of C. reinhardtii requires a specific CF 1 F o dark regulation that partakes in metabolic coupling between the chloroplast and acetate-fueled mitochondria.",

          "abstract": "Collagens are the foundational component of diverse tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, and basement membranes, and are the most abundant protein class in animals. The fibrillar collagens are large, complex, multidomain proteins, all containing the characteristic triple helix motif. The most prevalent collagens are heterotrimeric, meaning that cells express at least two distinctive procollagen polypeptides that must assemble into specific heterotrimer compositions. The molecular mechanisms ensuring correct heterotrimeric assemblies are poorly understood – even for the most common collagen, type-I. The longstanding paradigm is that assembly is controlled entirely by the ~30 kDa globular C-propeptide (C-Pro) domain. Still, this dominating model for procollagen assembly has left many questions unanswered. Here, we show that the C-Pro paradigm is incomplete. In addition to the critical role of the C-Pro domain in templating assembly, we find that the amino acid sequence near the C terminus of procollagen’s triple-helical domain plays an essential role in defining procollagen assembly outcomes. These sequences near the C terminus of the triple-helical domain encode conformationally stabilizing features that ensure only desirable C-Pro-mediated trimeric templates are committed to irreversible triple-helix folding. Incorrect C-Pro trimer assemblies avoid commitment to triple-helix formation thanks to destabilizing features in the amino acid sequences of their triple helix. Incorrect C-Pro assemblies are consequently able to dissociate and search for new binding partners. These findings provide a distinctive perspective on the mechanism of procollagen assembly, revealing the molecular basis by which incorrect homotrimer assemblies are avoided and setting the stage for a deeper understanding of the biogenesis of this ubiquitous protein.",

We propose a set of dynamic models of increasing complexity to dissect the roles of target cell limitation, innate immunity, and adaptive immunity in determining the observed viral kinetics. We introduce an approach for modeling the effect of humoral immunity that describes a decline in infectious virus after immune activation. We fit our models to viral load and infectious titer data from all the untreated infected participants in the study simultaneously. We found that a power-law with a power h &lt; 1 describes the relationship between infectious virus and viral load. Viral replication at the early stage of infection is rapid, with a doubling time of ~2 h for viral RNA and ~3 h for infectious virus. We estimate that adaptive immunity is initiated ~7 to 10 d postinfection and appears to contribute to a multiphasic viral decline experienced by some participants; the viral rebound experienced by other participants is consistent with a decline in the interferon response. Altogether, we quantified the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, shedding light on the early dynamics of the virus and the potential role of innate and adaptive immunity in promoting viral decline during infection.",

          "abstract": "Skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1) mutations are a prevalent cause of skeletal myopathies consistent with ACTA1’s high expression in skeletal muscle. Rare de novo mutations in ACTA1 associated with combined cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported, but ACTA1 represents only ~20% of the total actin pool in cardiomyocytes, making its role in cardiomyopathy controversial. Here we demonstrate how a mutation in an actin isoform expressed at low levels in cardiomyocytes can cause cardiomyopathy by focusing on a unique ACTA1 variant, R256H. We previously identified this variant in a family with dilated cardiomyopathy, who had reduced systolic function without clinical skeletal myopathy. Using a battery of multiscale biophysical tools, we show that R256H has potent effects on ACTA1 function at the molecular scale and in human cardiomyocytes. Importantly, we demonstrate that R256H acts in a dominant manner, where the incorporation of small amounts of mutant protein into thin filaments is sufficient to disrupt molecular contractility, and that this effect is dependent on the presence of troponin and tropomyosin. To understand the structural basis of this change in regulation, we resolved a structure of R256H filaments using cryoelectron microscopy, and we see alterations in actin’s structure that have the potential to disrupt interactions with tropomyosin. Finally, we show that ACTA1 R256H/+ human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes demonstrate reduced contractility and sarcomeric organization. Taken together, we demonstrate that R256H has multiple effects on ACTA1 function that are sufficient to cause reduced contractility and establish a likely causative relationship between ACTA1 R256H and clinical cardiomyopathy.",

Recent work has revealed clear latitudinal patterns in C:N:P, yet the relative importance of ecological, physiological, or biochemical processes in creating these patterns is unclear. We present high-resolution, concurrent measurements of particulate C:N:P, macromolecular composition, environmental conditions, and plankton community composition from a transect spanning a subtropical-subpolar boundary, the North Pacific Transition Zone. We find that the summed contribution of macromolecules to particulate C, N, and P is consistent with, and provides interpretation for, particulate C:N:P patterns. A decline in particulate C:N from the subtropical to subpolar North Pacific largely reflects an increase in the relative contribution of protein compared to carbohydrate and lipid, whereas variation in C:P and N:P correspond to shifts in protein relative to polyphosphate, DNA, and RNA. Possible causes for the corresponding trends in C:N and macromolecular composition include physiological responses and changes in community structure of phytoplankton, which represented approximately 1/3 rd of particulate C across the transect. Comparison with culture experiments and an allocation-based model of phytoplankton macromolecular composition suggest that physiological acclimation to changing nutrient supply is the most likely explanation for the latitudinal trend in C:N, offering both a mechanistic interpretation and biochemical basis for large-scale patterns in C:N:P.",

          "abstract": "Stroke causes pronounced and widespread slowing of neural activity. Despite decades of work exploring these abnormal neural dynamics and their associated functional impairments, their causes remain largely unclear. To close this gap in understanding, we applied a neurophysiological corticothalamic circuit model to simulate magnetoencephalography (MEG) power spectra recorded from chronic stroke patients. Comparing model-estimated physiological parameters to those of controls, patients demonstrated significantly lower intrathalamic inhibition in the lesioned hemisphere, despite the absence of direct damage to the thalamus itself. We hypothesized that this disinhibition could instead be related to secondary degeneration of the thalamus, for which growing evidence exists in the literature. Further analyses confirmed that spectral slowing correlated significantly with overall secondary degeneration of the ipsilesional thalamus, encompassing decreased thalamic volume, altered tissue microstructure, and decreased blood flow. Crucially, this relationship was mediated by model-estimated thalamic disinhibition, suggesting a causal link between secondary thalamic degeneration and abnormal brain dynamics via thalamic disinhibition. Finally, thalamic degeneration was correlated significantly with poorer cognitive and language outcomes, but not lesion volume, reinforcing that thalamus damage may account for additional individual variability in poststroke disability. Overall, our findings indicate that the frequently observed poststroke slowing reflects a disruption of corticothalamic circuit dynamics due to secondary thalamic dysfunction, and highlights the thalamus as an important target for understanding and potentially treating poststroke brain dysfunction.",

Although mutations in single genes that confer resistance to Cry proteins have been identified in lab-selected and gene-edited strains of H. zea and other lepidopteran pests, the genetic basis of field-evolved resistance to Cry proteins in H. zea has remained elusive. We used a genomic approach to analyze the genetic basis of field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac in 937 H. zea derived from 17 sites in seven states of the southern United States. We found evidence for extensive gene flow among all populations studied. Field-evolved resistance was not associated with mutations in 20 single candidate genes previously implicated in resistance or susceptibility to Cry proteins in H. zea or other lepidopterans. Instead, resistance in field samples was associated with increased copy number of a cluster of nine trypsin genes. However, trypsin gene amplification occurred in a susceptible sample and not in all resistant samples, implying that this amplification does not always confer resistance and mutations in other genes also contribute to field-evolved resistance to Cry1Ac in H. zea . The mismatch between lab-generated and field-evolved resistance in H. zea is unlike other cases of Bt resistance and reflects challenges for managing this pest.",

          "abstract": "All life forms depend on the conversion of energy into biomass used in growth and reproduction. For unicellular heterotrophs, the energetic cost associated with building a cell scales slightly sublinearly with cell weight. However, observations on multiple Daphnia species and numerous other metazoans suggest that although a similar size-specific scaling is retained in multicellular heterotrophs, there is a quantum leap in the energy required to build a replacement soma, presumably owing to the added investment in nonproductive features such as cell adhesion, support tissue, and intercellular communication and transport. Thus, any context-dependent ecological advantages that accompany the evolution of multicellularity come at a high baseline bioenergetic cost. At the phylogenetic level, for both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, the energetic expense per unit biomass produced declines with increasing adult size of a species, but there is a countergradient scaling within the developmental trajectories of individual metazoan species, with the cost of biomass production increasing with size. Translation of the results into the universal currency of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolyses provides insight into the demands on the electron-transport/ATP-synthase machinery per organism and on the minimum doubling times for biomass production imposed by the costs of duplicating the energy-producing infrastructure.",

In this manner, we demonstrate a general approach to exert a continuously tunable, triaxial, tensile strain, defying the Poisson ratio of the embedded material and achieving the exotic condition of “negative pressure.” This approach is hypothetically generalizable to materials of low modulus and high thermal expansion coefficient, and we use it here to achieve negative pressure in perovskite-phase CsPbI 3 embedded within the cylindrical pores of anodic aluminum oxide membranes. Through controlled thermal hysteresis, the perovskite crystal structure can be continuously tuned toward higher symmetry when confined in a scaffold with pore size &lt;40 nm, in contrast with the symmetry-reducing action of any other mechanical perturbation. We use this effect to control the octahedral rotation angle that is critical to the remarkable photovoltaic attributes of halide perovskites. Under hundreds of megapascals of apparent negative pressure, the bandgap tunability is observed to follow the same quantitative trend observed for hydrostatic positive pressure, exploring the negative pressure region and demonstrating the relative dominance of bond stretching effects over average octahedral rotation angle on electronic structure.

It is proposed this relies on abstracting and generalizing past experiences. While previous research has explored how humans detect and generalize single sequential processes, we have a limited understanding of how humans adapt to more naturalistic scenarios, for example, complex, multisubprocess environments. Here, we propose a candidate computational mechanism that posits compositional generalization of knowledge about subprocess dynamics. In two samples ( N = 238 and N = 137), we combined a novel sequence learning task and computational modeling to ask whether humans extract and generalize subprocesses compositionally to solve new problems. In prior learning, participants experienced sequences of compound images formed from two graphs’ product spaces (group 1: G1 and G2, group 2: G3 and G4). In transfer learning, both groups encountered compound images from the product of G1 and G3, composed entirely of new images. We show that subprocess knowledge transferred between task phases, such that in a new task environment each group had enhanced accuracy in predicting subprocess dynamics they had experienced during prior learning. Computational models utilizing predictive representations, based solely on the temporal contiguity of experienced task states, without an ability to transfer knowledge, failed to explain these data. Instead, behavior was consistent with a predictive representation model that maps task states between prior and transfer learning. These results help advance a mechanistic understanding of how humans discover and abstract subprocesses composing their experiences and compositionally reuse prior knowledge as a scaffolding for new experiences.",

          "abstract": "Cellular deconvolution via bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) presents a cost-effective and efficient alternative to experimental methods such as flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) for analyzing the complex cellular composition of tumor microenvironments. Despite challenges due to heterogeneity within and among tumors, our innovative deep learning–based approach, DeSide, shows exceptional accuracy in estimating the proportions of 16 distinct cell types and subtypes within solid tumors. DeSide integrates biological pathways and assesses noncancerous cell types first, effectively sidestepping the issue of highly variable gene expression profiles (GEPs) associated with cancer cells. By leveraging scRNA-seq data from six cancer types and 185 cancer cell lines across 22 cancer types as references, our method introduces distinctive sampling and filtering techniques to generate a high-quality training set that closely replicates real tumor GEPs, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) bulk RNA-seq data. With this model and high-quality training set, DeSide outperforms existing methods in estimating tumor purity and the proportions of noncancerous cells within solid tumors. Our model precisely predicts cellular compositions across 19 cancer types from TCGA and proves its effectiveness with multiple additional external datasets. Crucially, DeSide enables the identification and analysis of combinatorial cell type pairs, facilitating the stratification of cancer patients into prognostically significant groups. This approach not only provides deeper insights into the dynamics of tumor biology but also highlights potential therapeutic targets by underscoring the importance of specific cell type or subtype interactions.",

          "abstract": "Neural manifolds summarize the intrinsic structure of the information encoded by a population of neurons. Advances in experimental techniques have made simultaneous recordings from multiple brain regions increasingly commonplace, raising the possibility of studying how these manifolds relate across populations. However, when the manifolds are nonlinear and possibly code for multiple unknown variables, it is challenging to extract robust and falsifiable information about their relationships. We introduce a framework, called the method of analogous cycles, for matching topological features of neural manifolds using only observed dissimilarity matrices within and between neural populations. We demonstrate via analysis of simulations and in vivo experimental data that this method can be used to correctly identify multiple shared circular coordinate systems across both stimuli and inferred neural manifolds. Conversely, the method rejects matching features that are not intrinsic to one of the systems. Further, as this method is deterministic and does not rely on dimensionality reduction or optimization methods, it is amenable to direct mathematical investigation and interpretation in terms of the underlying neural activity. We thus propose the method of analogous cycles as a suitable foundation for a theory of cross-population analysis via neural manifolds.",

In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, experiments and theory increasingly attest that these networks can and do consume biochemical energy. How does this dissipation enable cellular behaviors forbidden in equilibrium? This open question demands quantitative models that transcend thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we study the control of simple, ubiquitous gene regulatory networks to explore the consequences of departing equilibrium in transcription. Employing graph theory to model a set of especially common regulatory motifs, we find that dissipation unlocks nonmonotonicity and enhanced sensitivity of gene expression with respect to a transcription factor’s concentration. These features allow a single transcription factor to act as both a repressor and activator at different concentrations or achieve outputs with multiple concentration regimes of locally enhanced sensitivity. We systematically dissect how energetically driving individual transitions within regulatory networks, or pairs of transitions, generates a wide range of more adjustable and sensitive phenotypic responses than in equilibrium. These results generalize to more complex regulatory scenarios, including combinatorial control by multiple transcription factors, which we relate and often find collapse to simple mathematical behaviors. Our findings quantify necessary conditions and detectable consequences of energy expenditure. These richer mathematical behaviors—feasibly accessed using biological energy budgets and rates—may empower cells to accomplish sophisticated regulation with simpler architectures than those required at equilibrium.",

          "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nvAMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the elderly in the developed world. While the introduction of therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has provided the first opportunity to significantly improve vision in patients with nvAMD, many patients respond inadequately to current anti-VEGF therapies. It was recently demonstrated that expression of a second angiogenic mediator, angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), synergizes with VEGF to promote choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice and correlates with reduced response to anti-VEGF therapy in patients with nvAMD. Here, we report that expression of ANGPTL4 in patients with nvAMD increases following treatment with anti-VEGF therapy and that this increase is dependent on accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α in response to inhibition of VEGF/KDR signaling in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We therefore explored HIF-1 inhibition with 32-134D, a recently developed pharmacologic HIF-inhibitor, for the treatment of nvAMD. 32-134D prevented the expression of both VEGF and ANGPTL4 and was at least as effective as aflibercept in treating CNV in mice. Moreover, by preventing the increase in HIF-1α accumulation in the RPE in response to anti-VEGF therapy, combining 32-134D with aflibercept was more effective than either drug alone for the treatment of CNV. Collectively, these results help explain why many patients with nvAMD respond inadequately to anti-VEGF therapy and suggest that the HIF inhibitor 32-134D will be an effective drug—alone or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies—for the treatment of patients with this blinding disease.",

Mucus conditions, in particular, are important biomarkers for indicating inflammation and stent patency but remain challenging to monitor. Current methods, reliant on computational tomography imaging and bronchoscope inspection, pose risks due to radiation and lack the ability to provide continuous real-time feedback outside of hospitals. Inspired by the sensing ability of biological cilia, we report wireless sensing mechanisms in sensory artificial cilia for detecting mucus conditions, including viscosity and layer thickness, which are crucial biomarkers for disease severity. The sensing mechanism for mucus viscosity leverages external magnetic fields to actuate a magnetic artificial cilium and sense its shape using a flexible strain-gauge. Additionally, we report an artificial cilium with capacitance sensing for mucus layer thickness, offering unique self-calibration, adjustable sensitivity, and range, all enabled by external magnetic fields. To enable prolonged and wireless data access, we integrate Bluetooth Low Energy communication and onboard power, along with a wearable magnetic actuation system for sensor activation. We validate our method by deploying the sensor independently or in conjunction with an airway stent within a trachea phantom and sheep trachea ex vivo. The proposed sensing mechanisms and devices pave the way for real-time monitoring of mucus conditions, facilitating early disease detection and providing stent patency alerts, thereby allowing timely interventions and personalized care.",

Those processes often involve nonlinear structure formations in phase-space, spanned by real-space and velocity-space coordinates, that significantly influence heating efficiency. To date, experimental knowledge of phase-space structure formation physics is severely limited, due to lack of experimental diagnostic schemes. Here, state-of-the-art hardware and software approaches for phase-space perturbative structure detection are introduced. A bifurcation in the phase-space structure formation is found, which affects the plasma heating efficiency.

The most common lexicalization strategies are the reuse and combination of existing words, but they have typically been studied separately in the areas of word meaning extension and word formation. Here, we offer an information-theoretic account of how both strategies are constrained by a fundamental tradeoff between competing communicative pressures: Word reuse tends to preserve the average length of word forms at the cost of less precision, while word combination tends to produce more informative words at the expense of greater word length. We test our proposal against a large dataset of reuse items and compounds that appeared in English, French, and Finnish over the past century. We find that these historically emerging items achieve higher levels of communicative efficiency than hypothetical ways of constructing the lexicon, and both literal reuse items and compounds tend to be more efficient than their nonliteral counterparts. These results suggest that reuse and combination are both consistent with a unified account of lexicalization grounded in the theory of efficient communication.",

          "abstract": "Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells metabolize glucose to organism-specific by-products instead of fully oxidizing it to carbon dioxide and water—a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg Effect. The benefit to a cell is not fully understood, given that partial metabolism of glucose yields an order of magnitude less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per molecule of glucose than complete oxidation. Here, we test a previously formulated hypothesis that the benefit of the Warburg Effect is to increase ATP production rate by switching from high-yielding respiration to faster glycolysis when excess glucose is available and respiration rate becomes limited by proteome occupancy. We show that glycolysis produces ATP faster per gram of pathway protein than respiration in Escherichia coli , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and mammalian cells. We then develop a simple mathematical model of energy metabolism that uses five experimentally estimated parameters and show that this model can accurately predict absolute rates of glycolysis and respiration in all three organisms under diverse conditions, providing strong support for the validity of the ATP production rate maximization hypothesis. In addition, our measurements show that mammalian respiration produces ATP up to 10-fold slower than respiration in E. coli or S. cerevisiae , suggesting that the ATP production rate per gram of pathway protein is a highly evolvable trait that is heavily optimized in microbes. We also find that E. coli respiration is faster than fermentation, explaining the observation that E. coli , unlike S. cerevisiae or mammalian cells, never switch to pure fermentation in the presence of oxygen.",

Further, the information (in bits) that graded patterns of expression provide about a cell’s position can be decomposed into information about fractional or scaled position and information about absolute position or embryo length; all information available is about scaled position, with &lt; 2% error. These findings imply that the underlying genetic network’s behavior exhibits scale invariance in a more precise mathematical sense.

Despite this, important details pertaining to the structure and dynamics of MAOM remain unknown. In the present study, we use replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the structure of MAOM on the surface of prototypical phyllosilicate clay and Fe-oxide minerals, montmorillonite and goethite, fine-grained minerals that strongly impact soil carbon dynamics in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. We examine the impact of aqueous chemistry through the presence of either Na + or Ca 2 + charge balancing counterions. Our results are consistent with the hypothesized multilayer sorption (“onion-skin”) model of MAOM and help to explain previous observations regarding the patchy distribution of SOM on mineral surfaces. In particular, the SOM coatings are partial and laterally heterogeneous, and water retains extensive access to mineral surfaces even when significant SOM sorption occurs. Low molecular weight neutral SOM molecules ( &lt; 200 Da) infrequently interact with the mineral surfaces nor their sorbed organic matter coatings and are increasingly labile with decreasing molecular weight. This observation is inconsistent with a central feature of the predominant soil continuum model of SOM and suggests that further iterations of the conceptual model may be required.",

By conducting a comprehensive regional survey of 4279 1 × 1 m 2 plots at 517 sites across China’s drylands and a 13-y manipulative experiment in a semiarid grassland within the same region, we show that greater soil and ecosystem C stocks in restored than degraded lands result predominantly from decreased surface soil C loss via suppressed wind erosion. This biophysical pathway is always overlooked in model evaluation of land-based C mitigation strategies. Surprisingly, stimulated plant growth plays a minor role in regulating C stocks under ecological restoration. In addition, the overall enhancement of C stocks in the restored lands increases with both initial degradation intensity and restoration duration. At the national scale, the rate of soil C accumulation (7.87 Tg C y −1 ) due to reduced wind erosion and surface soil C loss under dryland restoration is equal to 38.8% of afforestation and 56.2% of forest protection in China. Incorporating this unique but largely missed biophysical C-conserving mechanism into land surface models will greatly improve global assessments of the potential of land restoration for mitigating climate change.",

Genetic analyses linked OST-A to HSP90B1, an ER chaperone for membrane receptors, and CCDC134, an ER luminal protein. During its translocation into the ER, an N-terminal peptide in HSP90B1 templates the assembly of a translocon complex containing CCDC134 and OST-A that protects HSP90B1 during folding, preventing its hyperglycosylation and degradation. Disruption of this pathway impairs WNT and IGF1R signaling and causes the bone developmental disorder osteogenesis imperfecta.

          "abstract": "The structurally symmetric mammalian brain hemispheres are interconnected by commissural axons across the midline. However, the functions of interhemispheric connectivity remain largely unknown. We found that in mice, transection of the anterior commissure (AC), which connects the rostroventral forebrain, impaired avoidant behaviors. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the mouse projects to the contralateral nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the AC, independent of its ipsilateral projections. Aversive stimuli activated contralateral BLA-NAc projections. Positive stimuli, however, activated ipsilateral projections. Selective activation of contralateral BLA-NAc projections activated D2-positive medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs), reduced NAc dopamine levels, and caused aversion, whereas selective activation of ipsilateral BLA-NAc projections activated D1-MSNs, increased NAc dopamine levels, and induced reward. The contralateral BLA-AC-NAc pathway is crucial for encoding negative valence, demonstrating distinct functions of intra- and interhemispheric circuits in brain physiology.",

The COVID-19 pandemic provided a singular opportunity to evaluate how influenza circulation worldwide was perturbed by human behavioral changes. We combine molecular, epidemiological, and international travel data and find that the pandemic’s onset led to a shift in the intensity and structure of international influenza lineage movement. During the pandemic, South Asia played an important role as a phylogenetic trunk location of influenza A viruses, whereas West Asia maintained the circulation of influenza B/Victoria. We explore drivers of influenza lineage dynamics across the pandemic period and reasons for the possible extinction of the B/Yamagata lineage. After a period of 3 years, the intensity of among-region influenza lineage movements returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the exception of B/Yamagata, after the recovery of global air traffic, highlighting the robustness of global lineage dispersal patterns to substantial perturbation.",

We report that liver molecular clock dysfunction is signaled to the brain through the hepatic vagal afferent nerve (HVAN), leading to altered food intake patterns that are corrected by ablation of the HVAN. Hepatic branch vagotomy also prevents food intake disruptions induced by high-fat diet feeding and reduces body weight gain. Our findings reveal a homeostatic feedback signal that relies on communication between the liver and the brain to control circadian food intake patterns.

TIR domains across different kingdoms possess NADase activities and can produce phosphoribosyl adenosine monophosphate/diphosphate (pRib-AMP/ADP) or cyclic ADPR (cADPR) isomers. Lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and PAD4, transduce immune signals from sensor TIR-NLRs to a helper NLR called ADR1, which executes immune function. We report the structure and function of Arabidopsis EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 (EPA) heterotrimer in complex with pRib-AMP/ADP activated by plant or bacterial TIR signaling. 2’cADPR can be hydrolyzed into pRib-AMP and thus activates EPA signaling. Bacterial TIR domains producing 2’cADPR also activate EPA function. Our findings suggest that 2’cADPR may be the storage form of the unstable signaling molecule pRib-AMP.",

In this work, by methodically mapping node-net relationships among 53 basic edge-transitive nets, we conceived a signature net map to identify merging net pairs, resulting in the enumeration of 53 merged nets. We developed a practical design algorithm and proposed more than 100 multicomponent metal-organic framework platforms. The effectiveness of this approach is commended by the successful synthesis of four classes of materials, which is based on merging three-periodic nets with the four possible net periodicities.

We introduce upgraded orthogonal DNA replication (OrthoRep) systems that radically accelerate the evolution of chosen genes under selection in yeast. When applied to a maladapted biosynthetic enzyme, we obtained collections of extensively diverged sequences with patterns that revealed structural and environmental constraints shaping the enzyme’s activity. Our upgraded OrthoRep systems should support the discovery of factors influencing gene evolution, uncover previously unknown regions of fitness landscapes, and find broad applications in biomolecular engineering.",

We report that Piezo2-dependent mechanosensation mediates wet dog shakes evoked by water or oil droplets applied to back hairy skin of mice. Unmyelinated C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were activated by oil droplets, and their optogenetic activation elicited wet dog shakes. Ablation of C-LTMRs attenuated this behavior. Moreover, C-LTMRs synaptically couple to spinoparabrachial neurons, and optogenetically inhibiting spinoparabrachial neuron synapses and excitatory neurons in the parabrachial nucleus impaired both oil droplet– and C-LTMR–evoked wet dog shakes. Thus, a C-LTMR–spinoparabrachial pathway promotes wet dog shakes for removal of water and mechanical irritants from back hairy skin.",

Mutations in OsTIR ( TIR-only protein ), OsEDS1 ( Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 ), OsPAD4 ( Phytoalexin Deficient 4 ), and OsADR1 ( Activated Disease Resistance 1 ) all abolish enhanced disease resistance of rod1 plants. OsTIR catalyzes the production of second messengers 2′-(5′′-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP), which trigger formation of an OsEDS1-OsPAD4-OsADR1 (EPA) immune complex. ROD1 interacts with OsTIR and inhibits its enzymatic activity while mutation of ROD1 leads to constitutive activation of the EPA complex.

However, there is marked variation across plant species in the number of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors, which form a cornerstone of defense. The growth–defense trade-off hypothesis predicts costs associated with defense investment to generate variation in these traits. Our analysis comparing features of the intracellular immune-receptor repertoires with trait data of 187 species shows that in wild plants, the size of the molecular defense repertoire correlates negatively with growth. By contrast, we do not find evidence for a growth–defense trade-off in agricultural plants. Our cross-species approach highlights the central role of defense investment in shaping ecological trait variation and its sensitivity to domestication.",

Inhibition of reverse transcriptase or deficiency for cGAS or STING had little or no effect on hematopoiesis in nonpregnant mice but depleted HSCs and erythroid progenitors in pregnant mice, reducing red blood cell counts.

Here, we generalize this approach to incorporate two additional features: an element of randomness or luck that leads to upset wins, and a “depth of competition” variable that measures the complexity of a game or hierarchy. Fitting the resulting model, we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be “deep,” meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow, and in most cases, there is little evidence of upset wins.",

To address how erupted steam bursts from underwater volcanoes generate tsunamis, we present the experiments, using pressurized steam injected vertically into a water tank. Results over various eruption conditions identify three eruption regimes, namely, shallow-, intermediate-, and deep-water eruptions, according to the combined effects of water depths, source strengths, and source durations. The transition between shallow and intermediate eruptions is characterized by critical depths maximizing tsunami wave heights, while the transition between intermediate and deep eruptions is characterized by containment depths inhibiting surface disturbances. Water depth and source intensity are the dominant factors controlling maximum wave amplitudes, more so than aspects of jet duration and condensation. These experiments and supporting dimensional analysis improve our understanding of how underwater volcanic eruptions form tsunamis, while also providing a complete dataset for advancing tsunami generation models.",

Iridium-based oxide catalysts are widely studied for electrocatalytic technologies, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis, but insufficient techniques for quantifying electrochemically accessible iridium active sites impede accurate assessment of intrinsic activity improvements. We develop mercury underpotential deposition and stripping as a reversible electrochemical adsorption process to robustly quantify iridium sites and consistently normalize OER performance of benchmark IrO x electrodes to a single intrinsic activity curve, where other commonly used normalization methods cannot. Through rigorous deconvolution of mercury redox and reproportionation reactions, we extract net monolayer deposition and stripping of mercury on iridium sites throughout testing using a rotating ring disk electrode. This technique is a transformative method to standardize OER performance across a wide range of iridium-based materials and quantify electrochemical iridium active sites.",

          "abstract": "Historically, meteorological drought in the western United States (WUS) has been driven primarily by precipitation deficits. However, our observational analysis shows that, since around 2000, rising surface temperature and the resulting high evaporative demand have contributed more to drought severity (62%) and coverage (66%) over the WUS than precipitation deficit. This increase in evaporative demand during droughts, mostly attributable to anthropogenic warming according to analyses of both observations and climate model simulations, is the main cause of the increased drought severity and coverage. The unprecedented 2020–2022 WUS drought exemplifies this shift in drought drivers, with high evaporative demand accounting for 61% of its severity, compared to 39% from precipitation deficit. Climate model simulations corroborate this shift and project that, under the fossil-fueled development scenario (SSP5-8.5), droughts like the 2020–2022 event will transition from a one-in-more-than-a-thousand-year event in the pre-2022 period to a 1-in-60-year event by the mid-21st century and to a 1-in-6-year event by the late-21st century.",

To date, how they coordinate their functions to regulate cell cycle–dependent gene expression is not clear. Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), which we named DREAMer , that bridges the interaction between E2f1 and the dREAM complex to regulate endoreplication specifically in Drosophila salivary gland. We show that E2f1 directly stimulates DREAMer expression, whereas DREAMer mediates the repression of e2f1 transcription by modulating the recruitment of the dREAM complex to the e2f1 promoter via a direct interaction with the dREAM component E2f2. The depletion of DREAMer impairs dREAM binding, leading to derepression of e2f1 transcription, which ultimately increases E2f1 activity and promotes the endoreplication. Furthermore, the transcriptomic analysis revealed profound changes in cell cycle–related gene expression in DREAMer KO salivary glands. Together, our findings reveal an lncRNA-mediated link between the dREAM complex and E2f1, which regulates endoreplication during development.",

Such reinforced films, even when based on gelatin ( T g ~ 60°C), can endure processes over 200°C. We demonstrate dip-coated ethyl cellulose films for commercially viable reflow soldered circuitry. The films offer high flexibility, more than 80% transparency, and surface roughness below 5.5 nm. Advanced OPDs and OECTs fabricated on these films perform comparably to those on glass and the low material cost and simple fabrication process yields a minimal carbon footprint of 1.6 kgCO 2 /m 2 . This work thus opens a vista of possibilities for biodegradable polymers heretofore considered unsuitable for making temperature-stable substrates for state-of-the-art electronics applications.",

While few studies have reported chemistry within zero-dimensional pores and one-dimensional nanotubes, organic reactions in confined spaces between two-dimensional materials have yet to be explored. Here, we demonstrate that reactants confined between atomically thin sheets of graphene or hexagonal boron nitride experience pressures as high as 7 gigapascal, which allows the propagation of solvent-free organic reactions that ordinarily do not occur under standard conditions. Specifically, we show that cyclodehydrogenation of hexaphenylbenzene without catalysts as a proof of concept and oxidative polymerization of dopamine into sheet-like crystalline structure are enabled by the effective high pressure experienced by the reactants between the graphene layers. Our results demonstrate a facile, general approach for performing high-pressure chemistry based on confinement of reactants within two-dimensional materials.",

Photonic processors, which use photons instead of electrons, promise optical neural networks with ultralow latency and power consumption. However, existing optical neural networks, limited by their designs, have not achieved the recognition accuracy of modern electronic neural networks. In this work, we bridge this gap by embedding parallelized optical computation into flat camera optics that perform neural network computations during capture, before recording on the sensor. We leverage large kernels and propose a spatially varying convolutional network learned through a low-dimensional reparameterization. We instantiate this network inside the camera lens with a nanophotonic array with angle-dependent responses. Combined with a lightweight electronic back-end of about 2K parameters, our reconfigurable nanophotonic neural network achieves 72.76% accuracy on CIFAR-10, surpassing AlexNet (72.64%), and advancing optical neural networks into the deep learning era.",

Aging is a known deterministic driver of growth asymmetry; however, its role in gene expression heterogeneity remains elusive. Here, we show that aging mother cells undergo a progressive decline in old pole activity, generating asymmetry in protein partitioning, gene expression, and cell morphology. We demonstrate that mother cells, when compared to their daughters, exhibit lower product inheritance and gene expression rates independently of promoter dynamics. The declining activity of maternal old poles generates gene expression gradients that manifest as mother-daughter asymmetry upon division, showing that asymmetry is progressively built over time within the maternal intracellular environment. Moreover, old pole aging correlates with a gradual increase in cell length, leading to morphological asymmetry. These findings provide further evidence for aging as a mechanism to enhance phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations, with possible consequences for stress response and survival.",

Previous research has identified dopaminergic alterations related to maternal THC consumption. However, the consequences that prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) has on striatum-based processing during reward pursuit have not been determined. Here, we characterize PCE rats during food or opioid-maintained reward seeking. We find that the supramotivational phenotype of PCE rats is independent of value-based processing and is instead related to augmented reinforcing efficiency of opioid rewards. Our findings reveal that prenatal THC exposure leads to increased cue-evoked dopamine responses and an overrepresentation of effort-driven striatal encoding patterns. Recapitulating clinical findings, drug-related PCE adaptations were more pronounced in males, who showed increased vulnerability for relapse. Collectively, these findings indicate that prenatal THC exposure in male rats engenders a pronounced neurodevelopmental susceptibility to addiction-like disorders.",

Ethanol exposure induced elevated CD68 expression and morphological changes in microglia, with differential responses between high-PRS and low-PRS microglial cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed expression differences in MHCII complex and phagocytosis-related genes following ethanol exposure; high-PRS microglial cells displayed enhanced phagocytosis and increased CLEC7A expression, unlike low-PRS microglial cells. Synapse numbers in cocultures of induced neurons with microglia after alcohol exposure were lower in high-RPS cocultures, suggesting possible excess synapse pruning.

We simulate a wisdom of the crowd effect with LLMs. Specifically, we use an ensemble of 12 LLMs to make probabilistic predictions about 31 binary questions, comparing them with those made by 925 human forecasters in a 3-month tournament. We show that the LLM crowd outperforms a no-information benchmark and is statistically indistinguishable from the human crowd. We also observe human-like biases, such as the acquiescence bias. In another study, we find that LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) improve when exposed to the median human prediction, increasing accuracy by 17 to 28%. However, simply averaging human and machine forecasts yields more accurate results.

Quantum error correction can preserve coherence through active feedback wherein quantum information is encoded into a logical state with a high degree of symmetry. Perturbations are detected by measuring the symmetries of the state and corrected by applying gates based on these measurements. To measure the symmetries without perturbing the data, ancillary quantum states are required. Shor error correction uses a separate quantum state for the measurement of each symmetry. Steane error correction maps the perturbations onto a logical ancilla qubit, which is then measured to check several symmetries simultaneously. We experimentally compare Shor and Steane correction of bit flip errors using the Bacon-Shor code implemented in a chain of 23 trapped atomic ions. We find that the Steane method produces fewer errors after a single round of error correction and less disturbance to the data qubits without error correction.",

This adaptive nature of synapses is considered one of the key features contributing to the superior energy efficiency of the brain.

We show that a train of voltage spikes dynamically modifies the membrane’s ionic permeability in a process involving competitive bicationic transport. This process is shown to be repeatable after a given resting period. Because of a combination of subnanometer pore size and the atomic thinness of the membrane, this system exhibits energy dissipation of 0.1 to 100 aJ per voltage spike, which is several orders of magnitude lower than 0.1 to 10 fJ per spike in the human synapse.

          "abstract": "Solid cancers frequently relapse with distant metastasis, despite local and systemic treatment. Cellular dormancy has been identified as an important mechanism underlying drug resistance enabling late relapse. Therefore, relapse from invisible, minimal residual cancer of seemingly disease-free patients call for in vitro models of dormant cells suited for drug discovery. Here, we explore dormancy-inducing 3D engineered matrices, which generate mechanical confinement and induce growth arrest and survival against chemotherapy in cancer cells. We characterized the dormant phenotype of solitary cells by P-ERK low :P-p38 high dormancy signaling ratio, along with Ki67 − expression. As underlying mechanism, we identified stiffness-dependent nuclear localization of the four-and-a-half LIM domain 2 (FHL2) protein, leading to p53-independent high p21 Cip1/Waf1 nuclear expression, validated in murine and human tissue. Suggestive of a resistance-causing role, cells in the dormancy-inducing matrix became sensitive against chemotherapy upon FHL2 down-regulation. Thus, our biomaterial-based approach will enable systematic screens for previously unidentified compounds suited to eradicate potentially relapsing dormant cancer cells.",

In previous studies, the temporally intertwined dynamics of need and motivation have made it challenging to differentiate these two components. On the basis of classic homeostatic theories, we established a normative framework to derive computational models for need-encoding and motivation-encoding neurons. By combining the model-based predictions and naturalistic experimental paradigms, we demonstrated that agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and lateral hypothalamic leptin receptor (LH LepR) neuronal activities encode need and motivation, respectively. Our model further explains the difference in the dynamics of appetitive behaviors induced by optogenetic stimulation of AgRP or LH LepR neurons. Our study provides a normative modeling framework that explains how hypothalamic neurons separately encode need and motivation in the mammalian brain.",

However, the state-of-the-art single-photon sources are mostly limited to two-level states or scalar vortex beams. Direct generation of high-dimensional structured single photons remains challenging, being still in its infancy. Here, we propose a general strategy to design highly entangled high-dimensional spin-orbital single-photon sources by taking full advantage of the spatial freedom to design QE-coupled composite (i.e., Moiré/multipart) metasurfaces. We demonstrate the generation of arbitrary vectorial spin-orbital photon emission in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, mapping the generated states on hybrid-order Bloch spheres. We further realize single-photon sources of high-dimensional spin-orbital quantum emission and experimentally verify the entanglement of high-dimensional superposition states with high fidelity. We believe that the results obtained facilitate further progress in integrated solutions for the deployment of next-generation high-capacity quantum information technologies.",

However, how mitochondrial dynamics influences metastatic progression remains poorly understood. Here, we show that breast cancer cells with low metastatic potential exhibit a more fused mitochondrial network compared to highly metastatic cells. To study the impact of mitochondrial dynamics on metastasis, we promoted mitochondrial elongation in metastatic breast cancer cells by individual genetic deletion of three key regulators of mitochondrial fission (Drp1, Fis1, Mff) or by pharmacological intervention with leflunomide. Omics analyses revealed that mitochondrial elongation causes substantial alterations in metabolic pathways and processes related to cell adhesion. In vivo, enhanced mitochondrial elongation by loss of mitochondrial fission mediators or treatment with leflunomide notably reduced metastasis formation. Furthermore, the transcriptomic signature associated with elongated mitochondria correlated with improved clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. Overall, our findings highlight mitochondrial dynamics as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",

This study used a comprehensive approach combining correlation and information flow to explore relationships among phytoplankton biomass, marine environment, and climate forcing based on global observations over the past multi-decadal period. Correlation and causality between phytoplankton biomass and environmental factors exhibit spatial asymmetry—regions where environmental factors directly drive biomass variations were concentrated in oceanic currents and subtropical circulations. Temperature, light, and mixed layer depth show pronounced influences on global phytoplankton interdecadal variations. Climate forcing over interdecadal timescales directly affects phytoplankton biomass in the equatorial Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Oceans, with more uncertain biomass variability in the equatorial Pacific due to multiple climate events. Our findings revealed that environment and climate changes directly affect phytoplankton interdecadal variability only in specific regions at the oceanic scale.",

Meanwhile, the southeastern Arctic Ocean evolved from optimal conditions toward a perennial sea ice cover with cooling. We hypothesize that sea level, which determines the depth of Bering Strait and the submergence of the Arctic shelves, has led to enhanced production of seasonal sea ice and an increased freshwater export to the North Atlantic Ocean, since the onset of the present interglacial until preindustrial time.",

Inspired by these findings, we successfully developed hydrazided hyaluronic acid–modified zinc copper oxide (HZCO) nanoparticles as a PANoptosis inducer to potentiate immunotherapy. Bioactive HZCO actively delivered Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ while disrupting the cellular intrinsic ion metabolism pathway, resulting in double-stranded DNA release and organelle damage in cancer cells. Simultaneously, this process triggered the formation of PANoptosome and the activation of PANoptosis. HZCO-induced PANoptosis inhibited tumor growth and activated potent antitumor immune response, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of anti–programmed cell death 1 therapy.

Using noncontact laser-based dynamic experiments of tunable elastodynamic properties and numerical demonstrations of spatio-temporal ultrasound wave propagation, we explore the tunable static and elastodynamic property relation.

We demonstrate prediction performance in all three samples comparable to that reported in larger prediction studies and a boost of up to 116% relative to classical models trained directly in the smaller samples.

The wildland-urban interface (WUI) represents the nexus of human-nature interactions, where the risk of exposure to natural hazards such as wildfire is most pronounced. However, quantifying long-term global WUI change and the corresponding driving factors at fine resolution remain challenging. Here, we mapped and analyzed the global WUI at 30-meter resolution in 2000, 2010, and 2020. Our analysis revealed that the global WUI expanded by 35.6% since 2000, reaching 1.93 million square kilometer in 2020. Notably, 85% of this growth occurred between 2010 and 2020. The increase in WUI was primarily driven by the unprecedented expansion of global urbanization, contributing an additional 589,914 square kilometer of WUI. In addition, the number of small fires occurring in WUI areas has increased substantially since 2010. These findings underscore the rising wildfire risk to human society and highlight the urgency of implementing tailored fire management strategies in WUI areas.",

We show that microzooplankton grazing dissolves 92 ± 7% of ingested coccolith calcite, which may explain 50 to 100% of the observed CaCO 3 dissolution in supersaturated surface waters. Microzooplankton grazing on coccolithophores is thus a substantial, previously unrecognized biological mechanism affecting the ballasting of organic carbon to deeper waters, the ecology and fitness of microzooplankton themselves due to buffering of food vacuole pH, and ultimately the continued ability of the surface ocean to take up atmospheric carbon dioxide.",

Incident light with a specific wavelength induces linear -to- cyclic isomerization of DASAs, which generates an absorption gap at the wavelength and accordingly switches the color.

Multiple alternating jets, resembling those of Jupiter’s atmosphere, are sustained by these baroclinic eddies. We establish a theoretical model of the stratification and circulation and present scaling laws for the magnitude of the meridional heat transport. These are tested against numerical simulations.

Across evolution, the substrates of DNA methylation have diversified between kingdoms. In plants, chromomethylase3 (CMT3) and CMT2 mediate CHG and CHH methylation, respectively. However, how these two methyltransferases diverge on substrate specificities during evolution remains unknown. Here, we reveal that CMT2 originates from a duplication of an evolutionarily ancient CMT3 in flowering plants. Lacking a key arginine residue recognizing CHG in CMT2 impairs its CHG methylation activity in most flowering plants. An engineered V1200R mutation empowers CMT2 to restore CHG and CHH methylations in Arabidopsis cmt2cmt3 mutant, testifying a loss-of-function effect for CMT2 during evolution. CMT2 has evolved a long and unstructured amino terminus critical for protein stability, especially under heat stress, and is plastic to tolerate various natural mutations. Together, this study reveals the mechanism of chromomethylase divergence for context-specific DNA methylation in plants and sheds important lights on DNA methylation evolution and function.",

          "abstract": "Solar-warmed surface waters subduct beneath Antarctica’s ice shelves as a result of wind forcing, but this process is poorly observed and its interannual variability is yet to be assessed. We observe a 50-meter-thick intrusion of warm surface water immediately beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Temperature in the uppermost 5 meters decreases toward the ice base in near-perfect agreement with an exponential fit, consistent with the loss of heat to the overlying ice. Ekman forcing drives a heat transport into the cavity sufficient to contribute considerably to near-front melting; this transport has increased over the past four decades, driven by the increasing heat content of the ice-front polynya. Interannual variability of the heat transport is driven by zonal wind stress. These results provide a benchmark against which model performance may be assessed as we seek to reduce uncertainty around the contribution of basal melting to sea level rise.",

          "abstract": "Tailoring the losses of optical systems within the frame of non-Hermitian physics has appeared very fruitful in the past few years. In particular, the description of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators has become widespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is crucial for integrated nanophotonics but requires fine control techniques of the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional emission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated waveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency and loss couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to reach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of nanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to unidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Stieglitz",
          "abstract": "Human foragers avoid noncommunicable diseases that are leading causes of mortality, partly because physically active lifestyles promote healthy aging. High activity levels also promote tissue damage accumulation from wear-and-tear, increase risk of injury and disability which compromise productivity, and reduce energetic investments in somatic maintenance given constrained energy expenditure. Constraints intensify when nutrient supply is limited and surplus energy is directed toward pathogen defense and reproduction, as occurred throughout hominin evolution. This paper reviews evidence linking exposomes to musculoskeletal health in subsistence populations, focusing on effects of physical activity, pathogens, diet, and reproduction. Chronic musculoskeletal conditions are common for humans and possibly prehistoric hominins but rarer in quadrupedal apes. We propose that transition to bipedalism ~6 to 8 million years ago constituted an early “mismatch scenario,\" increasing hominin susceptibility to musculoskeletal conditions vis-à-vis quadrupedal apes due to changes in mechanical loading environments. Mismatched musculoskeletal traits were not targets of selection because of trade-offs favoring bipedal extractive foraging and higher fertility.",

We know much about stomatal mechanics, yet efforts to accelerate stomatal responsiveness have been limited despite the breadth of potential targets for manipulation. Here, we use mechanistic modeling to establish a hierarchy of putative targets affecting stomatal kinetics. Counterintuitively, modeling predicted that overexpressing plasma membrane H + -ATPases could speed stomata and enhance WUE under fluctuating light, even though overexpressed H + -ATPases is known to promote stomatal opening and reduce WUE in the steady state. Experiments validated the prediction, implicating an unexpected role of the H + -ATPases in improving WUE under fluctuating light. It suggests that H + -ATPases have a dual function, acting as a facilitator of carbon assimilation and water use, depending on the light conditions. These findings highlight the importance of integrating in silico modeling with experiments in future efforts toward enhancing stomatal function.",

Both recurrence rates and the global surface area fraction with daily mean surface air temperatures exceeding 30° and 40°C provide further evidence for extremely hot years becoming more common and widespread. A similar analysis for precipitation highlighted some regions with more record-high annual total precipitation and others with record-low annual precipitation typically associated with drought. A multimodel ensemble of 306 runs with global climate models [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2-45 (SSP2-45)] reproduced the statistics of record-breaking high temperatures, but there were some differences for the reanalysis precipitation record-breaking recurrence rates. The global climate model simulations suggested a slightly altered geographical pattern for record-breaking annual precipitation recurrence rates.",

How pores form and traverse two membranes, and how DMVs organize RNA synthesis, is unknown. Using structure prediction and functional assays, we show that the nonstructural viral membrane protein nsp4 is the key pore organizer, spanning the double membrane and forming most of the pore lining. Nsp4 interacts with nsp3 on the cytoplasmic side and with the viral replicase inside the DMV. Newly synthesized mRNAs exit the DMV into the cytoplasm, passing through a narrow ring of conserved nsp4 residues. Steric constraints imposed by the ring predict that modified nucleobases block mRNA transit, resulting in broad-spectrum anticoronaviral activity.",

LC is leveraged as a real-time display of the polymerization conditions and particle emergence, captured using an in situ long–focal range microscope. Detailed image analysis unravels key LC-guided mechanisms during polymerization. pDVB forms nanospheres due to poor solubilization by nematic LC. The nanospheres partition to the LC-solid interface and further assemble into microgel clusters whose orientation is guided by the LC molecular alignment. On further polymerization, microgel clusters transition to microspheroids that resemble liquid drops. We identify key energetic factors that guide trajectories along the synthesis pathway, providing the fundamental basis of a framework for engineering particle synthesis with shape control.",

The detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) like perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid is critical due to their environmental prevalence and toxicity. Here, we investigate selective interactions between PFAS and four cyclodextrin (CD) variants (α-, β-, γ-, and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-CD) within an α-hemolysin nanopore. We demonstrate that PFAS molecules can be electrochemically sensed by interacting with a γ-CD in a nanopore. Using HP-γ-CDs with increased steric resistance, we can identify homologs of the perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid and the perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acid families and detect common PFAS in drinking water at 0.4 to 2 parts per million levels, which are further lowered to 400 parts per trillion by sample preconcentration. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying chemical mechanism of PFAS-CD interactions. These insights pave the way toward nanopore-based in situ detection with promises in environmental protection against PFAS pollution.",

Endosomal adaptor TAPE regulates the endosomal TLR and cytosolic RLR pathways. The potential interplay between RIG-I signaling and endosomes has been explored. Here, we report that endosomes act as platforms for facilitating RIG-I polyubiquitination and complex formation. RIG-I was translocated onto endosomes to form signaling complexes upon activation. Ablation of endosomes impaired RIG-I signaling to type I IFN activation. TAPE mediates the interaction and polyubiquitination of RIG-I and TRIM25. TAPE-deficient myeloid cells were defective in type I IFN activation upon RNA ligand and virus challenges. Myeloid TAPE deficiency increased the susceptibility to RNA virus infection in vivo.

Catch-up saccades are accurately directed to the moving target but the motion stimulus appears to jump in space with each saccade. Our results reveal four major findings about perception and the visuomotor system: (i) Pursuit fails for certain types of motion; (ii) pursuit and catch-up saccades are independently controlled; (iii) prediction of saccade consequences is independent from saccade control; and (iv) the visual stability of moving objects relies on similar motion mechanisms as pursuit.",

The precise circuit mechanisms underlying different symptoms remain poorly understood. We identified two distinct basal forebrain cholinergic subpopulations in mice projecting to the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) or ventral hippocampus (vHPC), which exhibited distinct input organizations, electrophysiological characteristics, transcriptomics, and responses to positive and negative valences of stimuli and were critical for cognitive and emotional modulation, respectively. Moreover, chronic stress induced elevated anxiety levels and cognitive deficits in mice, accompanied by enhanced vHPC but suppressed dHPC cholinergic projections. Chemogenetic activation of dHPC or inhibition of vHPC cholinergic projections alleviated stress-induced aberrant behaviors. Furthermore, we identified that the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil combined with blockade of muscarinic receptor 1–type muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the vHPC rescued both stress-induced phenotypes. These data illuminated distinct septo-hippocampal cholinergic circuits mediated specific symptoms independently under stress, which may provide promising strategies for circuit-based treating of stress-related psychiatric disorders.",

This method was applied in saturated flow boiling experiments within chemically etched aluminum and copper tubes. Although the surfaces have self-similar surface structures, our findings revealed varied heat transfer coefficient enhancements, with increases of up to 391% on aluminum and 41% on copper. Using boroscopy, we identified key mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement. We further used mercury porosimetry to determine the impact of pore size distribution on thermal performance.
