Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06410-z (2023).\n\nTo effectively conserve biodiversity, policymakers must know the extent to which protected areas (PAs) benefit biodiversity. By leveraging impressive datasets on three measures of biodiversity for Southeast Asia, Brodie et al.1 claim to have detected a positive impact of protection within PAs, and spillovers of these impacts into the wider landscape. We argue that their analyses do not provide strong evidence about the benefits of PAs for biodiversity because their design cannot eliminate the most likely rival explanations for the patterns observed in the data, and their interpretations of the two tests for spillovers are flawed. Our concerns have important implications for balancing the trade-offs between investing in more PAs and managing the existing network better, as well as for the better use of causal inference methods in conservation science.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic flux, or the rate of metabolic reactions, is one of the most fundamental metrics describing the status of metabolism in living organisms. However, measuring fluxes across the entire metabolic network remains nearly impossible, especially in multicellular organisms. Computational methods based on flux balance analysis have been used with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict network-level flux wiring1,2,3,4,5,6. However, such approaches have limited power because of the lack of experimental constraints. Here, we introduce a strategy that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a large-scale Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS) dataset for roughly 900 metabolic genes7, we show that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the metabolic network model to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells.",

          "abstract": "For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots 1,2 . Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots 3 . How they navigate these design challenges is unclear 4 . Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network 5 . Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.",

We preview a selection of next-generation technologies—low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching.",

          "abstract": "In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance 1,2 . Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging 3–6 . We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti 75.25 Al 20 Cr 4.75 , this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 10 3 kg m − 3 ) and a high specific strength (185 × 10 3 Pa m 3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases.",

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in wearable technologies1,2, barriers remain in achieving distributed computation located persistently on the human body. Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting.",

          "abstract": "The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1,2,3,4,5,6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7,8,9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation–abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12,13,14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail.",

A cardinal sign of cardiac arrest is sudden loss of pulse4. Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the significant prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5–7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography (PPG), we show that wearable PPG measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced via an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation (VF). Based on the similarity of the PPG signal (from VF or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Once developed, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval, 64.32%–70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model.

Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens . Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka.",

          "abstract": "Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1,2,3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4,5,6, such as those with moiré superlattices7,8,9,10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG.",

          "abstract": "Gliomas are incurable malignancies notable for having an immunosuppressive microenvironment with abundant myeloid cells, the immunomodulatory phenotypes of which remain poorly defined1. Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages specialize in phagocytosis, a cellular process that eliminates extracellular matter, including microorganisms, through internalization and degradation1,2. Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on the host cell are poorly understood. In this study, we show that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. By tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfies the bioenergetic needs of macrophages. Metabolic recycling of microbially derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1 and is intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live bacteria, are enriched in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, sustain the cellular adenosine monophosphate pool and subsequently activate adenosine monophosphate protein kinase to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced interleukin-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results provide a new insight into the fate of engulfed microorganisms and highlight a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention for various immune-related pathologies.",

          "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state 1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.",

However, state-of-the-art networks5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 use only a single optically addressed qubit per node; this constrains both the quantum communication bandwidth and memory resources, greatly impeding scalability. Solid-state platforms15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 provide a valuable resource for multiplexed quantum networking in which multiple spectrally distinguishable qubits can be hosted in nano-scale volumes. Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25,26,27,28,29,30,31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35. These results lay the groundwork for scalable quantum networking based on rare-earth ions.",

However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models 1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse 5 . Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.",

Here we constructed a kilowatt-scale elastocaloric cooling device using compressive tubular NiTi in an ‘SMAs in series–fluid in parallel’ architecture, referred to as the multi-cell architecture. A large specific cooling power of 12.3 W g−1 was achieved by the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of thin-walled tubular NiTi at high-frequency operation (3.5 Hz), complemented by graphene nanofluid as an efficient heat transfer agent. Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6.",

The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure 5,6 . Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models 7 , viscoelastic deformation calculations 8 and radar observations 6 . We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field 9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate 10 . Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 10 22 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars 11,12 .",

Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives 3–5 . Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography 6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode 8–10 . Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.",

The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health.",

However, their target genes and functional contributions to human brain development remain largely uncharacterized. Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their species-specific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. Thus, our study sheds new light on the endogenous gene regulatory functions of HARs and their potential contribution to human brain evolution.",

By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (‘loneliness’) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion 3–5 . The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social need, similar to physiological drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep 3,6 . In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.",

However, their genomic complexity and interspecies genetic differences remain unclear4. Here, we present a complete genome assembly of a crab-eating macaque, revealing 46% fewer segmental duplications and 3.83 times longer centromeres than those of humans5,6. We also characterize 93 large-scale genomic differences between macaques and humans at a single-base-pair resolution, highlighting their impact on gene regulation in primate evolution. Using ten long-read macaque genomes, hundreds of short-read macaque genomes and full-length transcriptome data, we identified roughly 2 Mbp of fixed-genetic variants, roughly 240 Mbp of complex loci, 16.76 Mbp genetic differentiation regions and 110 alternative splice events, potentially associated with various phenotypic differences between the two macaque species. In summary, the integrated genetic analysis enhances understanding of lineage-specific phenotypes, adaptation and primate evolution, thereby improving their biomedical applications in human disease research.",

Intuitively, disorder is considered detrimental, requiring efforts to mitigate its effects in conventional topological photonics6,7,8,9. We propose a counter-intuitive approach that exploits a real–momentum topological photonic crystal that harnesses real-space disorder to generate a Pancharatnam–Berry phase10,11, without disrupting the momentum-space singularity originating from bound states in the continuum12. This methodology allows flat optical devices to encode spatial information or even extra topological charge in real space while preserving the topology of bound states in the continuum in momentum space with inherent alignment. Here, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate the simultaneous and independent generation of a real-space broadband vortex or a holographic image alongside resonant momentum-space vortex beams with a narrow bandwidth, which cannot be achieved with conventional methods. Such engineered disorder contributes to vast intrinsic freedoms without adding extra dimensions or compromising the optical flatness13,14. Our findings of real–momentum duality not only lay the foundation for disorder engineering in topological photonics but also open new avenues for optical wavefront shaping, encryption and communications.",

Artificial atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to quantum confinement3,4,5,6,7,8.

Signatures of interatomic bond formation have been extensively observed in various artificial atoms9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However, direct evidence of the intra-atomic orbital hybridization in the artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms through experiments.

Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.",

Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice 1 . The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought 1 , but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide.",

The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms 1,2 . Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.",

Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6,7,8,9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10,11,12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life.",

Although many examples of transcriptional metabolic rewiring have been reported4, a systems-level study of how metabolism is rewired in response to metabolic perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)—a high-throughput method combining whole-animal RNA-interference and RNA-sequencing5—to around 900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modelling, we identify a design principle of transcriptional rewiring that we name the compensation–repression (CR) model. The CR model explains most transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass. We provide preliminary evidence that the CR model may also explain transcriptional metabolic rewiring in human cells.",

Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and throughout a metropolitan region. We also report that most Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Entobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii) are shared in a nursing home. Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing.

The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20,21,22,23,24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

Yet, how the different SMC complexes affect each other and how their interactions orchestrate the dynamic folding of the three-dimensional genome remain unclear. Here we engineered all possible cohesin and condensin configurations on mitotic chromosomes to delineate the concerted, mutually influential action of SMC complexes. We show that condensin disrupts the binding of extrusive cohesin at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, thereby promoting the disassembly of interphase topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops during mitotic progression. Conversely, extrusive cohesin impedes condensin-mediated mitotic chromosome spiralization. Condensin reduces peaks of cohesive cohesin, whereas cohesive cohesin antagonizes condensin-mediated longitudinal shortening of mitotic chromosomes. The presence of both extrusive and cohesive cohesin synergizes these effects and inhibits mitotic chromosome condensation. Extrusive cohesin positions cohesive cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. However, cohesive cohesin by itself cannot be arrested by CTCF molecules and is insufficient to establish TADs or loops. Moreover, it lacks loop-extrusion capacity, which indicates that cohesive cohesin has nonoverlapping functions with extrusive cohesin. Finally, cohesive cohesin restricts chromatin loop expansion mediated by extrusive cohesin. Collectively, our data describe a three-way interaction among major SMC complexes that dynamically modulates chromatin architecture during cell cycle progression.",

          "authors": "Kelly-Ann Allen",
          "abstract": "What makes a great university? Academics say they value seeing their efforts recognized, witnessing the impact of their work on students and society, and working in a collegial environment. In my studies as a research fellow in educational psychology, I’ve found that students expect more than just a sound education — they want friendship with other students, emotional growth and skills that will help them to secure jobs. None of these factors can be adequately assessed using the dominant measure of success in academia: publications.\n\nPublishing well-cited papers in high-impact journals is central to researchers’ career progression. This results in intense pressure to perform well in this one area, often at the expense of other scholarly activities. Although citation metrics can indicate expertise, they can also amplify power imbalances, because highly cited scholars attract ever-more citations and influence.\n\nThe postdoc experience is broken. Funders such as the NIH must help to reimagine it\n\nEfforts to change evaluation systems have gained momentum over the past decade. The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment — signed by almost 25,000 scientists and organizations — and the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics both advocate for research to be evaluated beyond impact factors. A range of metrics, from policy citations to social-media engagement, can be tracked using online tools. Yet the citation-based h-index remains one of the most predominant ways to evaluate academic impact.\n\nIn my view, we could make academic life more rewarding by systematically scoring the underappreciated behaviours and conduct that researchers value. The product might be called the ‘G+ index’ — G representing generosity, giving and other ‘good things’ in academia. This index could either stand alone or complement existing citation measures.\n\nFor senior academics, mentorship could be judged in terms of the number of first- or last-author papers that are co-authored by early-career researchers, signalling investment in developing others’ careers. To account for varying team sizes, formal acknowledgements of trainees in publications could also be factored in. Early-career researchers could be exempt until a set career stage.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nCollaboration scores could measure co-authorships across institutions, countries and disciplines. They could include co-authorship with policymakers, community organizations and industry partners, and with individuals with lived experiences relevant to the research. Care would be needed to avoid disadvantaging scholars with limited resources, who might be less able to make connections.\n\nThe index could reflect good science practices — for instance, by recognizing replication studies. And public reach could be measured in terms of open-science practices — data-sharing, pre-registering protocols and communicating through podcasts, blogs and media contributions.\n\nIn some fields, publishing in practice-based journals could be rewarded to ensure that research reaches professional communities. Similarly, editorial and peer-review work for these journals — and work for scientific societies, regardless of prestige — could be valued.\n\nUltimately, the full list of metrics should be decided by the academic community, reflecting a collective vision for a healthier workplace. Funding bodies and institutions could then incorporate the index into their evaluation criteria, providing both the infrastructure and incentives for adoption. Many of the metrics are already tracked in existing data repositories, but improved systems to collect and amalgamate the data are needed.",

I was on parental leave from my work as a policy officer at the Academy of Medical Sciences, headquartered in London. The Academy’s policy work covers a range of topics, from climate change and health inequities to the funding and regulation of research. My focus before taking leave in April was the impact of early-childhood health on long-term health and well-being, and how this influences national productivity, innovation and prosperity.\n\nI moved into policy work in March 2022, starting with a 10-month position at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, a trade association based in London. But my first experience of policymaking was during a three-month internship in 2021 at the Initiative for Science in Europe, an umbrella body for learned societies and research institutes, based in Strasbourg, France.\n\nI joined the Academy of Medical Sciences after completing a PhD in cell biology at King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute, also in London. I was invited to speak about my career at a conference for early-career researchers, run by King’s College London’s Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine.\n\nA conference with a baby\n\nOn the day of my talk, held at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London, Aidan and I set ourselves up in the speaker ‘green room’, a repurposed seminar room, which had plenty of space for him to crawl around and feed before the session began. We then moved to the main hall for a panel of speaker flash talks introducing our journeys in science, before switching again to roundtable discussions, during which attendees asked more detailed questions about specific career areas.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well the day went. There wasn’t great deal of prep required for the talk or the discussions, but I realized I was out of practice speaking to an audience. However, I took inspiration from the other panel members. Some of the audience questions went beyond the practicalities of my career move, instead tackling the nuances of how the policy sector works as well as the challenges of working with different stakeholders and conflicting interests. These definitely challenged me to switch on my professional brain, but it was a positive experience — I enjoyed reconnecting with my work, and I was reminded of why I care so much about my job.\n\nThings that helped the day go successfully\n\nAn accessible and inclusive conference venue. The location had a room for breast-feeding and expressing milk, baby-changing facilities and step-free access so I could bring along a buggy easily, which made the practical side of the day as smooth as possible.\n\nAn enthusiastic and positive environment. At the conference, people told me that they’d love to see more scientists attending events while on parental leave. Two conference attendees kindly offered me extra help if needed. The conference organizers were adaptable and practical in their planning, and excellent at ensuring that we were accommodated.\n\nA supportive manager. My manager followed my lead on how I wanted to engage with work while on leave — I asked to be updated during check-in days about progress on the projects I was involved in, and I planned to think about career development once I returned to work. The reminders of my professional strengths during these conversations, at a time when I was disconnected from work and out of practice with public speaking, helped to give me the confidence to accept the invitation to speak at a conference.",

The resulting brain patterns are similar to those seen in people who have obesity.\n\nA junk-food splurge shifted brain patterns in healthy young men despite their body weight and composition remaining unchanged, according to the study, published on 21 February in Nature Metabolism.\n\n“I didn’t expect the effect to be so clear in a healthy population,” says neuroscientist Stephanie Kullmann at the University of Tübingen in Germany, who led the study.\n\nBut another scientist says that there are limitations to the study, which relied on a nasal spray to deliver the digestive hormone insulin. “The authors give very large doses of insulin,” some of which enters the bloodstream, potentially confounding the results, says physiologist Christoph Buettner at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, who was not involved in the study. Kullmann responds that her team studied and controlled for the effect of insulin entering the bloodstream.\n\nChocolate and chips\n\nAfter a bite of food, the pancreas releases insulin to aid metabolism. Some of that insulin enters the brain, where it works to dampen appetite. But the brain’s response to the hormone is weakened in some people with obesity2. This ‘brain insulin resistance’ affects how the body processes food.\n\nTo learn more about the effects of insulin in the brain, Kullmann and her colleagues recruited 29 healthy male volunteers (Kullmann has a forthcoming study in women). Eighteen went on a high-calorie diet for five days. A nutritionist made customized 1,500-calorie packs of high-fat, high-sugar snacks for each participant to eat on each of the five days — but the men succeeded in increasing their caloric intake by an average of only 1,200 calories per day. “At the beginning, they were kind of excited,” says Kullmann, but by day 4, eating the extra processed food was a slog. Control participants ate their normal diet during the same period.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet",

What the craft finds could have big ramifications for NASA’s plans to send astronauts to this part of the Moon in the coming years.\n\nMoon mission failure: why is it so hard to pull off a lunar landing?\n\nOne of the missions is a commercial lander; it aims to touch down closer to the Moon’s south pole than any previous mission, carrying NASA instruments including an ice-hunting robot drill. The other spacecraft, NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, is an orbiter with the goal of producing the highest-resolution maps of water on the Moon.\n\nLunar water could provide a resource for expanded lunar exploration, such as by supplying the raw ingredients for rocket fuel at Moon bases. Scientists have known since 2009 that such water exists, but they want to know much more about where it is and how much there is. The two new spacecraft “are going after really important pieces of that puzzle”, says Parvathy Prem, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, who is not affiliated with either mission.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on 6 March. It is the second attempt by Intuitive Machines, a company based in Houston, Texas, whose first lunar spacecraft tipped over on landing last year.\n\nLunar Trailblazer will follow a leisurely trajectory and reach the Moon in several months. If all goes well, it will enter its final science-mapping orbit around August.\n\nSearching for water\n\nMany space agencies and scientists are keen to learn more about water at the lunar poles, which hold a geological record of the Solar System’s early history. The Indian mission Chandrayaan-2 is currently orbiting the Moon and building up its own data on where water might exist, as is a Korean probe that carries a NASA instrument to peer into shadowed, potentially ice-rich craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines’ new lander, named Athena, is headed for the Mons Mouton region of the Moon. Researchers think there is water in the lunar soil there, perhaps bound up in minerals or in pores in the soil.\n\nThese six countries are about to go to the Moon — here’s why\n\nAthena will search for water in several ways, including the use of NASA’s ice-mining drill, TRIDENT. If Athena lands successfully, operators will command TRIDENT to penetrate the lunar soil, drilling up to one metre deep to pull up the soil and leave it in a crumbly pile on the surface. A mass spectrometer on board will analyse the pile for signs of water and other volatile substances that might be escaping as gases. That ability to drill and analyse simultaneously provides “critical data on how lunar soils behave”, says Jackie Quinn, the drill’s project manager at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida.",

We’re talking about the mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationship between plants and fungi, specifically the mycorrhizal fungi that attach to plant roots and exchange key resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus trapped in primordial rock, for food from plants3.

When a metal is stretched, defects form in its crystal lattice and thereby dissipate the strain energy (the energy stored from applied stress). This limits the amount of deformation that can be recovered (the recoverable strain) to less than 0.5% and causes permanent shape change. Metals are therefore good at permanently retaining their shape and are resistant to breaking, but they are not suitable for applications in which a material cycles through large shape changes.

          "authors": "Jianzhuang Xiao, Shuai Zou, Chi Sun Poon, Man Lung Sham, Zongjin Li, Surendra P. Shah",
          "abstract": "Cheap, strong and versatile, concrete is the second most consumed material globally after water, with 30 billion tonnes used annually (Nature 597, 593–594; 2021). Production of concrete is energy intensive and is responsible for more than 7% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions — of which cement accounts for the vast majority.\n\nExtraction of the minerals and other materials used to make concrete is also environmentally unfriendly. For example, around 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel1, and more than 5 billion tonnes of limestone are mined annually, resulting in habitat loss, soil erosion and pollution. These impacts will only worsen, as the global market for concrete continues to grow.\n\nThe construction industry needs to become more sustainable by minimizing carbon emissions and reducing resource and energy use2. Such a vision was set out, in part, in 2023 at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai through the Cement and Concrete Breakthrough Initiative. Launched by 45 world leaders, this initiative aims to reduce the emissions associated with producing one tonne of cement by around 20% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. Strategies include increasing the use of alternative fuels and other cement-like materials, using construction materials more efficiently, and implementing carbon capture and storage.\n\nReducing emissions is achievable. But a more comprehensive strategy for sustainable concrete is also needed, with the ultimate goals of net-zero carbon emissions and use of 100% recycled materials (see ‘Steps to net-zero concrete). Here we set out the key ingredients of a ‘net zero concrete’ strategy.\n\nSource: Analysis by J. Xiao et al.\nDesign more efficient kilns\n\nCement is produced by heating a blend of limestone and clay in a kiln. This process releases CO2 as limestone decomposes. It is also energy hungry — the chemical reactions involved require temperatures as high as 1,500 °C. Most kilns run on fossil fuels and have poor thermal insulation.\n\nWhat’s the best way to tackle climate change? An ‘evidence bank’ could help scientists find answers\n\nUpgrading kilns can save energy and reduce carbon emissions. For example, over the past few decades, much of the world has moved away from vertical shaft kilns, which work much like a blast furnace — material is added at the top of the column and this is heated from below using gas or coal, to eventually form the cement component clinker. These are being replaced by rotary kilns, which feature a horizontally inclined, rotating shaft that helps move materials through the kiln.\n\nRotary kilns outperform shaft kilns in terms of production capacity, product quality and operational flexibility, and can process 60 times more cement than the average shaft kiln. Their energy efficiency can be improved by 20–50% by using technologies that conserve or recover waste heat3. Improving insulation and optimizing operations using computer modelling and real-time data can increase the efficiency further.\n\nTo make kilns even more efficient, next-generation technologies are being explored. These include all-electric kilns and ones that suspend raw materials in hot air to speed up reactions. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and biomass, as well as hydrogen, can be deployed, as can carbon capture and storage technologies to lower carbon emissions. Leading Chinese cement manufacturers, including Anhui Conch Cement, China National Building Material and China Resources Cement, have established next-generation technology pilot projects.\n\nUse less clinker\n\nReducing the amount of cement clinker used in concrete can also bring down emissions. Some of it can be substituted with materials that require less energy to produce, including industrial by-products such as fly ash from coal combustion, ground blast-furnace slag from iron production, and recycled powders derived from materials such as glass, brick and concrete.\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nHowever, current standards in China (GB 175-2020) and Europe (BS EN 197-1 2011) only allow up to 20% of the clinker in commonly used types of cement to be substituted by ash and slag. There are ways to replace more of it, while maintaining performance in construction. Updating these standards to reflect ongoing technological advancements is essential to widen adoption.\n\nIn limestone calcined clay cement (LC3), half of the clinker is replaced with a type of clay and a combination of limestone and gypsum, which cuts CO2 emissions by 40% while maintaining the required physical properties4. Major cement manufacturers, such as the Swiss firm Holcim and Germany’s Heidelberg Materials, have already adopted this technology; it is used in the Swiss embassy building in New Delhi, for example.\n\nMoving forwards, it is essential to understand better the properties of various clay sources and to optimize their processing to ensure homogeneity and stability. Long-term durability studies need to be conducted across diverse environmental conditions. And large-scale trials are needed to address manufacturing challenges. Developing standards and increasing awareness among stakeholders is crucial.\n\nUse less cement\n\nReducing the proportion of cement paste in concrete is another strategy. Conventional concrete typically contains about 30% ordinary Portland cement paste by volume. Using less can make concrete harder to work with as it becomes stiffer. But research on optimizing the packing of concrete particles indicates that the volume of paste can be reduced to 18–20% while maintaining performance.\n\nThe world must rethink plans for ageing oil and gas platforms\n\nThe ultra-green concrete5 project, announced in 2023 and supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, has set an ambitious target to reduce the paste content even more, to as low as around 13% by volume. This goal relies on the material having a dense particle structure, known as advanced high-packing, and the incorporation of materials, such as modern superplasticizers. Challenges to overcome include the entrenched misconception that using less paste will affect the concrete’s strength and ensuring that this close-packed concrete meets practical tests, including durability and workability.\n\nAdvances in big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence can also play a part in designing more-sustainable concrete. For example, producers mainly depend on the 28-day compressive-strength benchmark specified in current standards. Through computer modelling, researchers can identify other time points to guide concrete design.\n\nUse less conventional concrete\n\nReducing concrete consumption by extending service life, optimizing the design of structures and using advanced construction technologies, such as 3D printing, offer other ways to reduce carbon emissions and material use.\n\nRisks of bridge collapses are real and set to rise — here’s why\n\nConcrete formulations can be tailored for specific projects to minimize the unnecessary consumption of concrete and its environmental footprint. Options include foamed concrete, or those including a high proportion of recycled content. Old concrete components can be reused by casting them in fresh concrete. And other materials such as fibre-reinforced polymers and steel sleeves can be incorporated to enhance structural performance while using less concrete.\n\nAlthough constructing a building requires a lot of energy, clever designs that lower the amount of energy needed to run it once it is built can save more. For example, using lightweight aggregate, honeycomb structures or composite materials in concrete can enhance the thermal insulation of buildings, so that they can run with smaller and more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.\n\nPhotovoltaic technology could be embedded in concrete, although many research challenges remain, including optimizing their efficiency, quality control during manufacture, degradation, environmental impacts and end-of-use recycling. Advancing these technologies will require close collaboration between material scientists, engineers and architects.\n\nSequester CO2 in concrete\n\nConcrete can be engineered to absorb and store CO2 during its manufacturing, curing, servicing and recycling stages. One study6 estimated that economically viable CO2 mineralization in concrete materials could mitigate up to 15% of CO2 emissions from cement clinker production, and theoretically almost 60% is possible.\n\nThe problem is that some CO2 mineralization technologies are still expensive compared with manufacture of conventional products and other carbon capture and storage methods. For example, producing a carbonated concrete block is around 35% more expensive than producing it with ordinary Portland cement, at a cost of €161 (US$166) to avoid one tonne of carbon emissions6. For now, this limits its use.",

          "abstract": "The administration of US President Donald Trump has already laid off thousands of government workers.Credit: Tierney L. Cross/Getty\n\nAgencies across the US government have been ordered to initiate another punishing round of layoffs at the same time Congress is moving forward with a plan to slash their budgets — a potential blow to science.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nOn Wednesday, Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), sent a memo directing agency heads to submit two-step plans for significant ‘reductions in force’ (RIFs) by 13 March and 14 April. The memo does not provide absolute numbers, but calls for “maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated”.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump “has targeted every single federal worker and does not seem to care how much turmoil they cause for either the employees or the American public,” the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing about 800,000 workers, said in a 26 February statement. “The chaos is the point.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on this and other statements in this story.\n\nStarving the government\n\nThe OMB memo is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce, which it has said is corrupt, inefficient and commits overreach in its regulation of businesses. Science agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) — two major funders of US academic science — have already endured sizable layoffs. Over the past two weeks, agencies have fired thousands of ‘probationary’ employees, who were newly hired or had recently transferred into new positions, although a federal judge ruled yesterday that some of these firings were illegal. The Trump administration has also purged hundreds of people who worked on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives or programmes for the federal government, calling them “illegal and immoral discrimination programs”.\n\nRussell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, sent a memo earlier this week calling for significant reductions in force across government agencies.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nFiring permanent employees en masse, as called for in the latest memo, would represent a significant escalation and could also face significant legal challenges. RIFs at government agencies require a valid reason, such as budgetary constraints, according to Nick Bednar, a legal scholar at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. But the administration might soon have all of the justification it needs: Trump’s Republican allies in Congress are working to pass a budget bill that seeks to cut at least US$1.5–2 trillion from the federal budget beginning in fiscal year 2026. By comparison, the entire discretionary budget — the portion that Congress allocates each year and includes funding for science agencies — was less than $1.7 trillion in 2024.\n\nVought has long advocated slashing government budgets. In a 2023 report making federal budget suggestions, Vought, then-president of a right-wing organization based in Washington DC called the Center for Renewing America, used war-like terms to describe the coming battle to dismantle a “woke and weaponized” federal government, including a “small scientific elite”, that feeds on taxpayer resources. “That is the central and immediate threat facing the country — the one that all our statesmen must rise tall to vanquish,” he wrote, advocating that the government can be “starved in order to dismantle it”.\n\nDisappearing programmes\n\nThe sheer scale of the Trump administration’s effort to downsize the US government has no modern precedent. In the 1990s, then-US president Bill Clinton ordered agencies to reduce their workforces, but the reductions were comparatively mild: at least 4% of the workforce was cut, and the work to do so was spread across 3 years and primarily accomplished by attrition strategies such as leaving positions vacant when people retired.\n\n‘Targeted and belittled’: scientists at US environmental agency speak out as layoffs begin\n\nSome agencies have seen even larger swings in their workforce over the years. During Trump’s first presidency, from 2017 to 2021, for example, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) culled around 1,100 people, or 7% of its staff members, despite congressional efforts to block budget cuts.\n\nIf the latest RIFs are carried out at the scale specified, they could permanently weaken science agencies, policy specialists say.\n\nAt the NSF, a reduction as high as 50% of the workforce — about 800 of 1,600 people — was suggested by multiple NSF sources on the basis of projected budget cuts for 2026. “We are concerned that entire programmes and divisions will disappear,” says an NSF employee who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak with the press.\n\nThese extreme cuts in workforce mirror the scale of Vought’s 2023 proposal: in it, he suggests reducing the agency’s budget by more than half, from about $9 billion to less than $4 billion. The agency wouldn't “able to fulfill its statutory mission — it can’t do that with $4 billion,” says Kenny Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “NSF as we know it could cease to exist.” (The NSF awards about $8.5 billion in research grants each year.)",

          "title": "How scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope",
          "authors": "Harini Nagendra",
          "abstract": "Science is necessary, but clearly not sufficient, for conveying the climate crisis. The past two years have been the hottest on record. Denial of climate change is still widespread and false claims about products’ environmental benefits, or ‘greenwashing’, are on the rise. What can researchers do?\n\nA decade ago, many scientists tended to argue that the best way they could contribute to the climate debate was to publish good ‘policy-relevant’ research — and then leave it to governments and civil-society actors to translate this science into action. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has done tremendous work in collating evidence that demonstrates the dangers of global warming and charting pathways to action. Yet, total annual global greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to be more than 60% higher in 2025 than they were in 1990, when the first IPCC report was published.\n\nClimate scientists study a world in which change is the only constant, where the collapse of our planet’s systems is widespread and evident. Most of these researchers battle a deep sense of sadness, coupled with anxiety about the future and the young people they love and care for, who will inherit a damaged planet. We must continue to document change, model impacts and describe solutions — but we cannot stop there.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nIncreasingly, many climate scientists are embracing climate activism. I am a huge admirer of those who do, and have engaged in it myself — although, some scientists critique activism for its purported bias (U. Büntgen npj Clim. Action 3, 36; 2024). But there are other things we can do, too.\n\nClimate communication is an important pathway to action that we don’t speak about enough. Many academic scientists, who are also teachers, are already deeply invested in it. But we haven’t paid enough attention to communication beyond the classroom.\n\nIn May 2019, Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, launched the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (now called the School of Climate Change and Sustainability), aiming to strengthen India’s response to the climate crisis. Over the past five years, my colleagues and I have conducted public lectures and written media articles; taught short courses to upskill professionals including climate journalists, writers and practitioners; and used illustrated books, games and videos to reach diverse audiences. Three years ago, the university launched a multilingual climate festival attended by tens of thousands of young visitors across India.\n\nThrough these experiences and experimentation — ones that are relevant to other low- and middle-income country contexts — I have gathered five important lessons for climate communication.\n\nDon’t only mourn the loss of nature\n\nClimate change, biodiversity collapse and pollution are classic ‘dismal disciplines’, which can plunge young people — the main target of our communication efforts — into depression. I have seen my own students struggle to seek hope when confronted with the realities of climate change. Public communication must move beyond stories of doom and gloom, which — although realistic — have the unfortunate effect of making many people step away, instead of engaging in the conversation.\n\nTo spur climate action, educators must get personal\n\nIn real life, people interact with nature using their senses, and that’s where climate festivals can be effective. Our festivals have included art installations, movie screenings, theatre and folk-art performances, nature walks, leaf painting and mushroom collecting, as well as traditional Indian games with seeds and shells. Such immersive approaches that engage people with nature can help visitors to go beyond passively viewing scientific information and towards a more joyous and active way of interacting with climate research. This enables individuals to personalize and internalize the elements of nature in their own minds and bodies. I hope that these experiences will remain with people for their whole lives.\n\nThe names of these events use the metaphor of the Indian festival or ‘mela’ to celebrate a different facet of nature each year. In 2022, we focused on the ‘Rivers of life’ — moving to ‘Forests of life’ in 2023, ‘Mountains of life’ in 2024 and now ‘Coasts and oceans of life’ this year. We are not being unrealistically optimistic — these festivals showcase the grim realities of vanishing forests, collapsing mountains, polluted rivers and warming oceans. But we also use photoessays and the voices of local people to document the beauty of a snow-capped mountain, the joy of an Indigenous forest festival and the intimate relationship of a shaman with her river goddess. Over time, we find that these are the areas of the festival where people linger, read and interact — their eyes lighting up with hope. Celebrations pull in the crowd — and people stay to discuss the challenges.\n\nUse multilingual communication\n\nClimate-change education is not only for those who speak English, or whatever the dominant language of a region might be. India is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, yet most scientific discussions in India are restricted to a relatively small section of the population — those who speak English. This leaves out the majority of the country’s people, who also have a stake in India’s climate future and are often highly motivated to act.\n\nAlthough the School of Climate Change and Sustainability develops its climate material in English, it has translated it into Kannada, Hindi and Assamese, and is now interpreting it in other languages. This is not without challenges. For instance, how do you take a technical term such as ‘sustainability’ and translate it into a local Indian language? A direct translation of the term in Kannada is ‘susthirate’, which means permanence, or freedom from instability. It doesn’t work. Instead, the material contains many of these technical terms, written in local script — or uses alternative ways to communicate the same idea without using the term.\n\nAzim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, hosts an annual, multilingual climate festival.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nThe university casts its net widely to find people who can complete the translations. Professional translators, who are used to translating literature and poetry, often use complex language with a literary flourish. However, the comprehensibility of such language can be a barrier for children from low-income, underserved public schools, who constitute about half of the visitors at our climate-change festivals.\n\nThe festival organizers now work with committed middle- and high-school language teachers, who are used to communicating complex ideas using relatively simple vocabulary. This process helps to improve the teachers’ climate-change communication skills, and strengthens the festival’s partnership with teachers, building a larger community.\n\nInvolve young people\n\nThe success of student movements around climate change, such as Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, demonstrates the importance of involving young people in climate communication. However, far too often, some scientists think of young people as recipients of their knowledge, not as communicators with unique perspectives and ways to connect with others of their generation.\n\nOver the past three years, we have worked with more than 200 young interns as part of the climate festivals, who have visited different parts of India to document climate and environmental change on the ground. This has had two important outcomes.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nFirst, it has built on their capacity and commitment to the subject, transforming them into lifelong climate champions. Some of our youngest student interns — including 14-year-olds — have delivered powerful projects, including a terrarium that was the centrepiece of our art exhibits, and a display exploring the ethics around elephant capture and training in India.\n\nAnother high-school student documented an island in the Sundarbans, a mangrove forest area in the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, that is being swallowed by rising sea levels. Realizing that the residents were also dealing with other challenges, including an inadequate public-health system, the student raised money to help the islanders. Several of our younger visitors have returned to our university, applying to undergraduate programmes and seeking to contribute to climate activities.\n\nSecond, we have found that young people are more likely to react to messages delivered by other young people, rather than to more scientifically advanced, but less accessible, lectures by trained specialists. When students see other young people who have completed exciting projects, it inspires them to join forces and contribute.\n\nElevate traditional knowledge\n\nMost efforts to communicate climate science to the public use researchers to inform and influence people. But scientists and sustainability specialists are not the only people with expert knowledge. They can learn from society, as well as inform.\n\nClimate justice is a central focus for us. Although we work with many scientists, climate practitioners and activists who are excellent at communicating with wider audiences, we have also found that preaching, moralizing and proselytizing — such as by telling people that they are ‘bad’ for consuming more, using plastic, travelling by aeroplane and so on — only turns audiences away. And students often tune these messages out.\n\nExhibitions at an annual climate festival in Bengalaru, India, are used to inspire students.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nRather than receiving information through didactical lectures, it is much more effective to get the audience to arrive at such conclusions for themselves — by showing them photographs of people living on the coast whose lives are affected by plastic, for instance.\n\nIndigenous communities, with their deep connection to nature and different epistemological approaches, include experts of a different kind and have been too long ignored by scientists. In November 2023, the two-week ‘Forests of life’ climate festival held at our campus, was inaugurated by Soliga tribal elders. Instead of giving a specialist talk, they performed a traditional harvest dance on stage and invited students to join them. By the end of the performance, even the teachers and security and support staff were dancing with the group, transforming the atmosphere into something transcendental and joyous — a perfect launchpad for the festival.",

          "abstract": "Emergency: COVID-19 and the Uneven Valuation of Life Claire Laurier Decoteau Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nIn May 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In response, US government and public-service officials promised marginalized communities that they would make real efforts to tackle racial injustice.\n\nYet, says sociologist Claire Laurier Decoteau, both the pandemic and those promises now seem long forgotten in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn Emergency, Decoteau interviews 110 of the city’s residents and 65 officials to methodically dissect COVID-19’s impact on marginalized groups. Her analysis reveals how policies that intended to tackle racial injustice instead produced an endless cycle of inequality.\n\nWhy we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments\n\nAt the time of Floyd’s death, Black Americans accounted for 60% of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Chicago, despite comprising only 30% of its population, a pattern mirrored in many other US cities and Western countries. The increased risk of death is attributable to what Decoteau calls “converging ‘demics’” — the confluence of structural injustices, including poor access to health care, housing and employment, that disproportionately affect Black, Latinx and immigrant Chicagoans.\n\nChicago’s initial response to the pandemic was poor, asserts the author. Instead of addressing systemic problems, public-health officials plugged the gap with short-term interventions, such as welfare payments to cover rent or sick days. Although such policies might have benefited less-vulnerable people, they condemned people on the margins to a “slow or quick death”.\n\nTenants who had informal landlord agreements or an undocumented status struggled to access emergency rental payments, because their landlords frequently would not comply with administrative processes. As a result, vulnerable people who should have been shielding themselves from the virus were unable to do so — instead, they had to work to minimize the risk of being evicted and becoming homeless.\n\nDecreasing the number of cases and deaths among Black and Latinx people became the focus of some public-health efforts. But that did not produce long-term changes for the communities most affected by COVID-19. Although many well-intentioned people have used statistics to show that racism is a public-health crisis, Decoteau cautions against reducing the complex history that produced today’s structural inequalities to quantifiable targets.\n\nCommunity care\n\nDecoteau’s interviews highlight how mutual-aid groups and community organizers were the pandemic’s unsung heroes, often achieving what governments could or would not. Many of the stories are bleak, illustrating how systemic discrimination, from poor housing to police brutality, has a physical and mental toll. Yet I found a hopefulness in their tales of community cooperatives that ran food banks and provided COVID-19 tests by employing people enrolled in drug-recovery programmes.\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, community-led cooperatives, such as food banks, are a lifeline for many.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty\n\nOne volunteer at a community service proclaims: “We need more organizations like this one. We need to grow bigger. We grew up here in the struggle. We know how to cope.” I could not agree more.\n\nIn 2018, I founded a community-based organization in London called Decolonising Contraception, which ran events centred on sexual and reproductive health. Decoteau does a great job of showing what I discovered, too: a top-down approach often has minimal impact on those who require urgent assistance. Too often, red tape and bureaucracy mean that those who are most vulnerable cannot access government support and, instead, end up relying on grass-roots organizations.\n\nMisguided policies\n\nNext, Decoteau illustrates how racial ‘biocapitalism’ — the creation of wealth through the exploitation of people who have been racially categorized — produced policies that caused the death of essential, yet often poorly paid, workers, many of whom in Chicago were Black and Latinx. For example, one such policy introduced extra payments to essential workers in the city. But Candice, a Black woman and former nurse, remarks that: “Every two weeks when you got paid, you got an extra $350 but you couldn’t miss a day. So if you missed a day, you didn’t get the $350.” This policy encouraged people to lie about being unwell, increasing the risk of viral spread.",

          "title": "PhD scientists who forged a career off the beaten track",
          "authors": "Katie L. Burke",
          "abstract": "On the rugged, uninhabited Archipelago of the Recherche off the coast of Western Australia, marine ecologist Jennifer Lavers has front-row access to the wildlife she studies, because she lives nearby. In 2022, Lavers set up her successful marine-ecology research group in the tiny hamlet of Esperance, or Kepa Kurl, on the coast of southwest Australia, a seven-hour drive from the nearest city, Perth. As a researcher studying how plastic pollution affects seabirds and the marine food web, Lavers finds a closeness with nature in such an isolated place, and has used that closeness in her collaborations with the local Aboriginal communities. “The birds sing during the day, the frogs at night and the kangaroos mow our lawn for us,” she says of her home. “It gives me the quiet life that I keep seeking, but also the opportunity to truly embed myself with the Aboriginal community.”\n\nLavers’ career trajectory is unusual, because she’s had to think creatively to build her life and do the work that she wants. Academics tend to move to urban institutions as they progress in their careers (E. Yan et al. Quant. Sci. Stud. 1, 1451–1467; 2020). Most career advice that PhD students receive is biased towards urban or suburban locations; indeed, most of their mentors have followed such paths themselves. But some PhD holders want to live in a place far from a research hub or a university town.\n\nWant to make a difference? Try working at an environmental non-profit organization\n\nIn an academic job market that offers fewer and fewer stable positions, more science PhD holders are forging their own paths in the places where they want to live — whether that means launching a business or a non-profit organization or finding remote work. But doing so isn’t always easy. Small towns and rural areas can have fewer resources than cities do and can leave scientists feeling isolated and without mentorship. Still, the benefits in flexibility, community and autonomy are worth it, say trailblazers on an unusual path.\n\nThe most common reason that people interviewed by Nature’s careers team gave for living in such places was to be near family — many have parenting or caring responsibilities. People also valued a sense of place, living close to nature and the mental-health benefits of their autonomy and community. Some wanted to see their skills benefit the community in which they grew up or, like Lavers, wanted to live long term near field-research locations.\n\n“I advise PhDs with extreme geographical restrictions to think broadly and widely about what they can do,” says Karen Kelsky, a career coach who founded the consultancy The Professor Is In. “It is becoming more normative to not work in academia.” Kelsky, who founded her business after leaving a tenured academic position, needed to stay in Eugene, Oregon, because she shared custody of her children with her ex-spouse. “I wish more academics would be entrepreneurial,” she says, noting that it’s been gratifying for her.\n\nSolopreneurs and start-up firms\n\nFor PhD scientists living outside major research hubs who want to continue using their expertise, a common path is to start their own business, either as a consulting firm or as a freelancer. For instance, ecologist Reilly Dibner founded a science-animation and voice-over acting studio called Ecosystem Films in Laramie, Wyoming. “In creating my business, I found I knew a lot more about being an entrepreneur than I ever imagined, simply because I understood how to navigate the academic landscape. So many skills are transferable,” says Dibner. For example, academics know how to seek out and apply for funding, test ideas, quickly learn new skills and organize ambitious, long-term projects. “I understand discomfort and I know how to bust through work challenges,” Dibner adds. “And I have knowledge, resources and networks of people to tap into for their expertise.”\n\nReilly Dibner works on an animation project at her Ecosystem Films studio.Credit: Gregory Nickerson\n\nTo prepare for being self-employed, networking is key. Entrepreneurs say that their first work usually came from colleagues. Social scientist and writer Luis Alexis Rodríguez-Cruz, who runs a science-writing and research business from his hometown of Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico, says, “Networks of solidarity, trust and friendship expanded the opportunities that I use to build a life and a home.” Although some people interviewed by Nature began consulting part time before leaving a full-time position, many relied on a partner’s income or lived with family while getting their businesses off the ground.\n\nSome business owners don’t want to just go solo; instead, they join forces to build a larger firm. Anna Ortega, co-founder and lead researcher of the Western Wildlife Research Collective, started a business because none of the conventional routes for PhD holders in wildlife biology seemed the right fit for her. She also wanted to move back to her home of Durango, Colorado, to raise her children near their grandparents. “I didn’t want to work for the federal government, I didn’t want to work for a state agency and I didn’t want to work in academia,” she says. “At the same time, I wanted to advance science.” Now, she and two team members do consulting work analysing wildlife data for academic laboratories, state and federal agencies and conservation non-profit organizations.\n\n‘Research that touches the heart’: the scientists who study sex and lov\n\nBusiness owners such as Ortega must navigate the administrative and logistical load of setting up a small firm. Once a business is off the ground, such work can be outsourced, but at the start, the owner usually has to deal with the personnel and financial paperwork. Ortega read widely on business management as she was finishing her PhD and setting up her business.\n\nMark Crane, who splits his time between a small town on the edge of the Cotswolds region, UK, and the mountains of southern Spain, sees the ability to outsource this work as a boon. When he built his agricultural toxicology business, WCA Environment, in Faringdon, UK, in 2005, his team was fully remote. This meant that he could recruit the talent he wanted because he could pay specialists well to work from home. “We would win bids because we were cheaper. We had almost no overhead,” he says. “We contracted out everything that wasn’t scientific on an as-needed basis.” This strategy of recruiting the best talent and keeping overheads low allowed him to compete with much larger companies. In 2012, Crane sold the company back to his employees, giving him the funds necessary for developing his next project, a sustainable almond farm in Spain, and helping his wife to run her environmental consultancy.\n\nSelf-employed PhD scientists working far from research hubs must prevent becoming isolated from an academic community. Ortega says that starting a business with a friend has helped her to feel connected because they communicate weekly about their shared projects. She also goes to conferences often to meet colleagues and has company subscriptions to key journals to stay up to date with the literature.\n\nFounding a non-profit organization\n\nScientists with mission-oriented research that has a low overhead can establish a non-profit organization. When Lavers found herself in a particularly difficult workplace situation after ten successful years in academia, she decided to strike out on her own. She started Adrift Lab, a research group focused on seabirds and marine plastics that collaborates with other scientists around the world. She founded Adrift Lab four years before she left her job at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, so that she could transition to Esperance without disrupting her long-term data collection.\n\n“The ivory tower makes you believe that the only way you can do real science is by being in academia,” says Lavers. “Our model demonstrates quite clearly that that is not a requirement.” Lavers and her two co-supervisors have seen nine master’s and four PhD students graduate over the course of six years in conjunction with the University of Tasmania, where one of her colleagues has a full-time position. The advantage of their model shows in their students’ success. “Most of our PhD students graduate with 5–7 publications as first author,” Lavers says. Lavers holds several part-time positions that allow her to stay involved in academic activities.\n\nJennifer Lavers and her colleagues set up an independent research group called Adrift Lab to study how plastic pollution affects marine and seabird lifeCredit: Blue The Film/Northern Pictures\n\nThinking about non-conventional funding is key, says Lavers. She and her colleagues have found that standard funding, such as grants from national funders, is harder to get as a principal investigator without a customary institutional affiliation. “We have survived because of the generosity of two philanthropists,” she says. “We have 20-year data sets, including the longest-running plastic-ingestion data set in the Southern Hemisphere. And yet we’ve never been successful with state or federal government funding.”\n\nLavers says that her relationship with the lab’s donors has been one of the surprising rewards of this non-profit work model. The philanthropists have come along on field excursions, gotten to know students and even been involved in data collection. “Those relationships have become long-lasting and really close in a way that you would never have with a government department. It builds that sense of community spirit within the lab. Funders get as much out of it as we do,” she says. And this funding model saves Lavers precious time. “I don’t spend weeks of every year writing these long reports that get sent off to the government,” says Lavers. “Instead, I divert that energy to writing papers, helping my students and doing all the things that actually matter.”\n\nHow five researchers fared after their ‘great resignation’ from academia\n\nThe study of marine pollution is a rapidly evolving discipline, and Lavers can pivot quickly to pursue emerging issues in a way that government and university structures don’t allow. She also doesn’t have to fit her research into a department or research institution’s priorities and so can investigate interdisciplinary questions as she sees fit.\n\nLavers notes that establishing an independent lab was easier for her because she already knew how to run a conventional one. She understood the processes in her discipline and what it took to keep fieldwork and a lab running. Without that experience, she acknowledges, it would have been a lot tougher.\n\nLavers’ isolated locale isn’t for everyone. “The nearest major hospital is seven hours away,” she says. “We only have one tiny little airport. There are no major shopping malls or clothing stores or anything like that.” But, for Lavers, the upshot is that she lives a quiet, peaceful life close to nature.",

Both are stalled at the US National Science Foundation, an agency facing the prospect of large budget cuts. She can’t do the research needed to support her tenure bid without those grants. “I’m dead in the water if I can’t get one,” she says.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nAfter a month of repeated threats to US science funding, many early-career researchers such as Autrey are fearing for their careers. These scientists are especially vulnerable: graduate students, postdocs and scientists who are just starting their own laboratories are the researchers most likely to be living pay cheque to pay cheque, most reliant on federal grants for their income and least likely to have job security. Some are considering changing jobs, leaving the country or abandoning research altogether.\n\n“Disruption and uncertainty are the enemy of science,” says Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. And when disruption and uncertainty strike, she adds, “the people who lose their jobs are students and postdocs”.\n\nIf that happens now, science in the United States could undergo its own generational shift, she says: “Early-career scientists are the future.”\n\nDiminished prospects\n\nDuring its chaotic first month, US President Donald Trump’s administration moved to sharply curtail federal funding for research. Some of the administration’s changes, such as freezing research funds and curtailing reimbursement for overhead costs on federal grants, have been temporarily blocked by the courts. But the administration’s push to shrink the size of the government is clear, and many researchers fear that the system of federal support they have come to rely on is eroding.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nTheir anxiety was on display at a protest in Washington DC on 19 February, when about 250 graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research technicians gathered outside the US Department of Health and Human Services to protest against the chaos unleashed by mass layoffs, leadership changes and promises of budget cuts at federal agencies. “Last week aged me a year,” says Alexander Jordan Lara, a research fellow at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Lara’s career is in limbo after his principal investigator, a high-ranking NIH scientist, abruptly retired on 11 February amid the turmoil created by the Trump team’s directives , leaving the fate of the laboratory and its members up in the air.\n\nThat fear radiates beyond employees of federal agencies. At the University of Maryland in College Park, an NIH diversity grant pays neuroscience postdoc Haroon Popal’s salary. Popal counts himself lucky: this year’s salary has already been allocated. But the Trump administration has threatened any funding that falls under the rubric of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and Popal is not counting on getting paid next year. He’s looking for other jobs now, especially any that do not rely on federal funds — even if that means leaving science. “I love my research,” he says, “but I cannot afford to lose a pay cheque.”\n\nFaced with that uncertainty, some young scientists might choose to leave the country rather than leave science, says Ginther. But the United States churned out more than 34,000 science PhD graduates in 2023. Not all of them will choose to stay in science, but whether those who do and seek to leave the United States could be absorbed by other countries is unclear. “I don’t know that the world’s scientific enterprise can absorb the potential loss of talent that we’re creating in the United States,” says Ginther.\n\nFading allure\n\nThe United States has long attracted scientific talent from around the globe. Just a few weeks ago, Adam Pavlinek, a developmental neuroscientist at King’s College London, had planned to start a postdoc at an NIH laboratory later this year. Now, he tracks the recent firings at federal agencies and waits to learn of the fate of the team that he had hoped to join.\n\nNIH pay rise for postdocs and PhD students could have US ripple effect\n\nThe instability in the United States has Pavlinek thinking twice about his plans. “I’m worried that four or five months after I move all my stuff there, I’ll be told, ‘Actually there’s no more funding,’” he says. He has started looking for positions in the United Kingdom.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "If the number of on-camera screams is any indication, Kim Kardashian’s first encounter with epigenetics was a thrilling one.\n\nThe reality-television star and her family shrieked and squealed in the season finale of The Kardashians in Los Angeles, California, last July as they each learnt the results of a commercial blood test that purportedly assessed their “biological ages”. Although Kardashian was 43, the placement of chemical markers on her DNA — her ‘epigenetic profile’ — matched that of a 34-year-old, according to the test. Her body, moreover, was ageing 18% more slowly than most people of her age.\n\n“You should give yourself a pat on the back,” said Matthew Dawson as he relayed the results. (Dawson is chief executive of TruDiagnostic in Lexington, Kentucky, the company that sells the test.)\n\nOn the other side of the country, neuropsychologist Terrie Moffitt says she was “mortified” when she saw the segment. Moffitt, who works at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, had spent decades with her colleagues collecting data from around 1,000 people to create the basis for one of the tests provided by TruDiagnostic. She had hoped that her work might one day inform medical decisions or provide a way for researchers to assess whether an anti-ageing treatment is having a positive effect on health. A stunt on a reality-TV show was not the kind of publicity she was aiming for. “I have a snob’s view of reality TV,” she adds.\n\nMixed feelings of enthusiasm and apprehension were common among researchers who spoke to Nature about efforts to develop tests that measure the impact of ageing on the body. With money pouring into the field and an unprecedented level of public attention and excitement, scientists are publishing a steady stream of papers on ways to measure how rapidly a person’s body is declining. Many of the measures look at chemical marks on DNA known as methylation, or at proteins or metabolites that can be found in the blood. These biological markers, or biomarkers, could prove incredibly useful as part of burgeoning efforts to develop drugs and other therapies that would forestall the negative effects of ageing and increase what gerontologists refer to as the healthy lifespan.\n\nOften, however, test results that use these biomarkers are interpreted and presented without a full reckoning of the uncertainties that plague them. It’s a problem not just for commercial tests, but also for media articles and even scientific publications. “There’s a lot of confusion,” says Brian Chen, a molecular epidemiologist at California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute in San Francisco. “I’ve seen, in academia, scientists trying to promote and hype up ‘biological age’ and ageing research in general to generate more interest and funding.”\n\nChen and others worry about the risk of elevated expectations as scientists take on the long and arduous task of validating these tests. “Whether or not at the end of the day this kind of thing is going to be positive or negative for the field is hard to know,” says Matt Kaeberlein, chief executive at Optispan, a health-care technology company in Tukwila, Washington. “If you lose your reputation, that’s hard to get back.”\n\nMarking time\n\nFor the moment, the field is on fire. In December 2024, the US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced a programme to develop and validate biomarkers of ageing. Hevolution Foundation, a charity in Riyadh, has invested US$400 million in healthspan research. And organizers of XPRIZE Healthspan — a competition to find treatments for conditions associated with ageing — are planning a 7-year, $101-million global competition that is dedicated to improving healthspan.\n\nA smorgasbord of tests to assess ageing already exists. Geneticist Steve Horvath, now at Altos Labs in Cambridge, UK, developed one of the first epigenetic clocks more than a decade ago1. He analysed data from 7,800 samples to catalogue which sites in the genome were tagged with methyl groups — a chemical modification to DNA that helps to regulate the expression of genes. He then fed these data, along with the ages of the study participants, into a machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm produced a collection of 353 methylation sites that, taken together, correlated with participants’ chronological ages. Some of these sites were more methylated with age; others were less so.\n\nThose markers became the basis for a test that can predict a person’s chronological age with remarkable accuracy, says Chen, who worked with Horvath. But the test was not as good at predicting how long a person might expect to remain healthy, or when they might die.\n\nSo, Horvath’s team and others began to build new tests, searching for methylation sites that correlate with other age- and health-related measures, such as white-blood-cell counts, the amount of glucose in the blood and levels of a protein that serves as a marker for inflammation2. This time, the goal was to create a clock that reflected a person’s time to death, rather than merely the number of years lived.\n\nPregnancy advances your ‘biological’ age — but giving birth turns it back\n\nA younger ‘age’ based on this test tended to associate with a variety of lifestyle factors, including high income and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. An older age score was associated with factors such as cigarette smoking or the risk of heart disease, among other ailments.\n\nMoffitt and her colleagues took this a step further, returning to the same study participants every few years to collect a fresh round of health data3. This allowed them to create an epigenetic test that assessed the rate at which age takes its toll on the body, rather than one static number. “It’s capturing the slow, gradual progression of biological decline,” Moffitt says.\n\nThe biology underlying these tests, however, remains a puzzle. There is no clear mechanism that links the patterns of methylation measured in the tests with changes in a person’s health — the patterns are simply correlations fished out from large data sets, with no obvious cause. “Why did the methylation go up, and what went wrong?” asks Horvath. “What does it mean?”\n\nOther kinds of test can provide a clearer link to mechanisms. Those that measure changes in the abundance of certain proteins or in the chemical products of metabolism allow researchers to draw conclusions about what triggered the change. “This is why I chose metabolomics,” says Eline Slagboom, a molecular epidemiologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, referring to tests that try to survey all of the metabolites in an organism or tissue. “When we have a marker, we also understand a little about why it is important: is it an inflammation marker, a lipid marker? Is it related to glucose?”\n\nSlagboom and her colleagues created a test called MetaboHealth, which is based on 14 metabolites found in the blood that correlate with the likelihood of death from disease4. Others have turned to tests based on proteins: a team led by UK researchers developed one using data from more than 45,000 people that measures the levels of around 200 proteins in blood5.\n\nTurning back time with epigenetic clocks\n\nFor now, however, some researchers are forgoing molecular biomarkers in their clinical trials. Therapies, interventions or lifestyle changes aimed at extending a person’s healthy lifespan must come with a measurable benefit, says Jamie Justice, a gerontologist in Grand Junction, Colorado, who is executive vice-president of health at the XPRIZE Foundation in Culver City, California. “When we talk about that benefit, we’re talking about the way that a person functions, feels or survives” — not simply the chemical composition of their DNA, she says. Experimental therapies tested in the XPRIZE Healthspan programme will not be evaluated on the basis of epigenetic tests. Instead, the competition will focus on factors such as muscle strength and cognition, as well as assays for immune function.\n\nThe prize will be structured so that teams gather data and samples in a standardized way. Justice also hopes to raise funds for a competition in which teams develop and test other biomarkers using those data. “I love biomarkers,” she says. “I love them and I hate them, because I know how hard it is to actually get one developed.”\n\nSeeking validation\n\nResearchers sometimes recoil when they learn just how much work it takes to vet a biomarker fully so it can be used in clinical trials, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. Such tests must be studied repeatedly in a variety of populations, and under the specific conditions in which they will be used in the clinic. A biomarker of ageing that is based on data from people in their forties and fifties, for example, might have little relevance to a frail 80-year-old who has multiple health conditions, says Slagboom. “We have a tendency to try to sell how valuable our marker is,” she says. “But valuable for which purpose?”\n\nThe hype surrounding ageing research has also created a false impression of how well tested the markers have been in different populations, or in different settings, says Moqri. Although epigenetic-clock markers have been used in a vast range of studies, they typically have not been sufficiently validated for use as primary outcomes in clinical trials, he says. “Even those who are running clinical trials, they think that these biomarkers are more advanced than they actually are,” he says.\n\nThere is also disagreement in the field about what the clocks really measure. Despite frequent references to ‘biological age’ in both the media and scientific articles, a 2024 study found little agreement in the community as to what the term means6. In a survey of more than 100 participants at a scientific conference on ageing research, about 30% defined ageing as the loss of function that comes with time. Other definitions included the accumulation of damage with time; a developmental stage; and an increase in disability and death. “Defining biological age is a whole touchy subject in itself,” says Marije Sluiskes, a biostatistician at Leiden University Medical Center.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how",

          "title": "Can AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people",
          "authors": "Carrie Arnold",
          "abstract": "Beginning in late 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, the mobile phones of tens of thousands of impoverished villagers in Togo pinged with good news. Their money was ready. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), these villagers in the narrow strip of land in West Africa had been approved to receive around US$10 every two weeks, delivered directly to their mobile money accounts. Although that might not sound like much, it could keep people from going hungry.\n\nConventional poverty-relief projects rely on data gathered through in-person surveys — which were not possible during the pandemic. But Togo’s effort, dubbed Novissi, which means ‘solidarity’ in the local Éwé language, incorporated AI to determine who should receive aid. The project, led by Cina Lawson, the Togo Minister of Digital Economy and Transformation, along with scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the non-governmental organization (NGO) GiveDirectly, analysed satellite images and data from mobile-phone networks to estimate the wealth of particular regions and individuals1. “We needed a surgical approach,” says Lawson. It was an important moment for the use of AI in anti-poverty work, she says.\n\nSome 700 million people around the globe live in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 per day. Ending that poverty, one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, requires an understanding of who is in need and what their needs are. But measuring poverty has long been a challenge, in large part because of the time and cost involved in trying to collect data from the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\n\nCombine AI with citizen science to fight poverty\n\nAI allowed Lawson to leapfrog the conventional hurdles of using old and incomplete data to quickly make the most of her limited budget. It’s an approach that is garnering both interest and controversy, says Joshua Blumenstock, a computer scientist at University of California, Berkeley, who collaborated on Novissi.\n\nAI tools can not only be fast, says Ariel BenYishay, a development economist at the AidData Research Lab at William & Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Virginia, but they can also include a larger, more representative portion of the population than household surveys do, and identify patterns in data that even specialists could miss. AI might also help researchers to evaluate how well programmes meet their objectives and demonstrate how investments in areas such as health, agriculture, education and infrastructure pay off — or not. The World Bank recognizes this value and has been developing advanced AI tools to try to forecast food crises and violent conflicts, and to pull insights from large swathes of data gathered after an aid intervention. It concluded its Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet report2 in October 2024 by noting that anti-poverty “efforts should focus on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence models to close data gaps and enable more timely monitoring”.\n\nBut there are reasons to be cautious, says human geographer Ola Hall at Lund University in Sweden, who researches the intersection of AI and poverty. AI models have been criticized for being racist, sexist and otherwise biased. Just as household surveys often miss the poorest families because they do not have permanent housing, AI-driven programmes might not help individuals who do not have digital data trails, Hall says. They are nowhere near accurate enough to determine who qualifies for aid or cash subsidies and who doesn’t, he says.\n\nHowever flawed AI might be, though, current systems of evaluating poverty are just as abysmal, says BenYishay. “The baseline isn’t perfect data. It’s actually very crappy data,” he says.\n\nMeasuring poverty\n\nBritish social reformer Charles Booth undertook an early effort to quantify poverty from 1886 to 1903 when he criss-crossed London’s cobblestones collecting data on people’s incomes and social class. He created a colour-coded map of the city and reported his findings in a treatise titled Life and Labour of the People in London. English sociologist Seebohm Rowntree and his team interviewed 11,560 families in York, UK, and published the findings in a 1901 book called Poverty: A Study of Town Life. The team calculated poverty on the basis of the ability to meet a person’s “physical efficiency”, or their minimal nutritional requirements. A sample minimal diet might include bread, porridge, boiled bacon, potatoes, skimmed milk and little else.\n\nAfter US President Lyndon Johnson declared a ‘War on Poverty’ in 1964, the Office of Economic Opportunity adopted a poverty threshold devised by economist Mollie Orshansky that took a similar approach. It defined poverty as the bare minimum income required to cover food, shelter and other basic costs. Around the same time, India performed similar calculations for its populace. Although each expert tinkered with their formulae to account for local variations in rent and food costs, they all defined poverty on the basis of how much money a person lives on per day.\n\nThe dollar-per-day approach is blunt and easy to communicate, says Dean Jolliffe, an economist at the World Bank in Washington DC. Yet, how much money a person spends to get by is just one aspect of poverty. Economist and Anglican priest Sabina Alkire advocates for a more nuanced way to define poverty. “I want to know how many poor people lack a house, how many poor people have a kid out of school, so I can actually respond in very tangible, direct ways,” says Alkire, who is the director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\nMobile phone data can be used alongside satellite imagery and other data to estimate poverty across regions and countries.Credit: Kelvin Juma\n\nIn the early 2000s, Alkire wanted a way to capture poverty’s various affects on people. Just because someone has enough money to buy food doesn’t mean they have enough for medical care or school fees, says Alkire. In 2008, Alkire worked with James Foster, an economist at the George Washington University in Washington DC, to develop what’s called the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)3. The approach estimates a unified measure of poverty by tallying up the deprivations and their intensity, with a total of ten indicators, including nutrition, school attendance, access to drinking water and what a household uses for cooking fuel.\n\nFor the field of poverty, this was a sea change. It allowed policymakers and others to measure, dissect and target the interacting variables that contribute to poverty at the household level. The United Nations Development Programme replaced its Human Poverty Index, which focused on survival, literacy and standard of living, with Alkire and Foster’s MPI in 2010, although certain United Nations agencies along with the World Bank continue to rely on the dollar-per-day definition.\n\n‘It is chaos’: US funding freezes are endangering global health\n\nResearchers and aid agencies have developed myriad ways other than the MPI to define poverty. These methods vary in the factors they include, depending on what they want to measure and the data at hand, says Jennifer Davis, who heads the Program on Water, Health & Development at Stanford University in California. In a 2024 paper, a team led by Davis and her graduate student Christine Pu evaluated four definitions of poverty that are used in the field, including daily per capita expenditure but not MPI, and found massive differences in how those definitions rank households in Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda4. “When we did our analysis, not only did we not find much agreement at all for the full sample, we didn’t find it for urban households, or for the bottom 20%, or for the bottom 1% where we might expect the greatest need,” says Pu.\n\nAlong with the lack of agreement on definitions, there’s the problem of time. Even a well-oiled field team needs several hours to survey a single family, says Jolliffe. Although poverty researchers have refined their metrics and are incorporating the latest computational methods for analysing data, they often continue to rely on on-the-ground surveys to collect those data. A lot of people are surprised that we still do household surveys, says Jolliffe. But, “this notion that we have data on everything about everybody is very much a rich-world perspective”.\n\nTurning to AI\n\nAs a PhD student in agricultural and resource economics, Marshall Burke was familiar with laborious data collection. To learn about farming and agriculture practices in East Africa, Burke travelled to Kenya and Uganda, where he spent months talking to farmers and walking their fields. But when Burke started the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab at Stanford University in 2015, he wondered whether the computer revolution might offer better approaches.\n\nThese experiments could lift millions out of dire poverty\n\nDavid Lobell, who had vast experience in remote sensing, occupied the office next to him. Around the same time, a specialist in AI and image recognition, Stefano Ermon, also joined Stanford University. The trio’s discussions turned to how the ever-increasing data from satellite images could be used to help identify people living in poverty around the world. Knowing that night-time lighting can be a rough proxy for wealth, the researchers used night-time satellite imagery of areas across Africa alongside daytime imagery to teach computer models to identify features associated with wealth.\n\nAsking a computer to compare images of areas that are already known to be extremely rich or extremely poor is an electronic version of the game “spot the difference”, Burke says. The algorithms compare the distribution and condition of roads, the amount of green space, the size and spacing of buildings and a multitude of other variables. “All the sorts of things you and I would think to look for in an image are a little bit predictive,” says Burke. “A machine can sort through all that data,” and determine what aspects are most relevant.\n\nIn 2016, the team reported that the AI analyses of the satellite images correlated strongly with on-the-ground measurements of poverty5. As machine learning advanced, Lobell, Burke and Ermon refined their models by incorporating the latest techniques.\n\nUsing a pan-African data set of publicly available satellite images, the trio tested an updated approach in May 2020. When the team compared its machine-learning predictions with wealth-related survey data from 20,000 villages, the algorithm performed just as well as the laborious surveys, but at a fraction of the effort and cost6 (see ‘Poverty predictions’).\n\nSource: Ref. 6\n\n“This was a pretty seminal improvement concept for the development community,” says BenYishay. Other teams are joining the experiment, throwing out a lot of different ideas, he says. Scientists are applying machine learning to look for patterns in satellite images and mobile-phone data, and to analyse the impacts of drought, agricultural productivity, infrastructure investments and more, he says.\n\nMuch of this effort remains confined to academic research simply because the field is so young, says Abe Tarapani, chief executive of Atlas AI, a public benefit corporation in Palo Alto, California, co-founded by Burke, Lobell and Ermon. The stakes are too high to just dive in head first, says Tarapani. But when the pandemic hit, Lawson felt she had no other option.",

          "abstract": "The drive had been lazy, uneventful. Window open, AC off, no online activity for hours, no cravings of any kind. On a whim, Akili had decided to visit the new megastore on the outskirts of the outskirts. Someone had told him it would be worth it. They hadn’t been wrong.\n\nThe building stood alone in an empty field, walls all glass, like the skin had been peeled off and one was now privy to its inner workings. On the inside, the aisles were brimming with wonders in all sorts of guises. Clothes, tools, foodstuffs, gadgets and things Akili didn’t even recognize. But the key in this particular store was that the aisles weren’t static: to save storage space they ebbed and flowed, came together and moved apart like the bellows on a harmonium in a mechanical waltz. Plus, it was not just the transparency, somehow Akili could see things more clearly inside the store than in the field it occupied; the colours were more vivid, he could identify details on the products his brain told him he shouldn’t be able to detect at this distance; even hints of pleasant smells were in the air, which, again, seemed impossible. But most impressive was that the hypnotic movement inside the store was synchronized, it had purpose. As the aisles joined and separated, diligent robots replaced items as others picked them up, taking them to be packed and loaded on delivery drones, which zapped constantly in and out, their hum filling the air as if setting the aisle movements to music.\n\nThere were few people in sight except for the ad-hoc tourists like Akili. Just a couple of technicians who wandered around unjamming and lubricating, probably just fulfilling the Minimum Human Employment Law, but at any rate spoiling the show. Wherever they went, the aisles froze in static, parallel, safe-distance normality, jumping back to life the second motion sensors decided it was safe; like in the old tales of workshops animating to dance and song in the absence of their owners. Of course, all this poetic efficiency was mostly for show. These were lightweight short-range drones; the heavy lifters for larger objects or transatlantic delivery were much farther out, on even cheaper land, probably in much more drab warehouses, with normal boring aisles.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAkili mused that, all in all, it was an interesting and novel spectator sport. Until it wasn’t.\n\nSuddenly, one of those ubiquitous AI-generated, androgynous, race-ambiguous holograms materialized in front of him, eyes the usual disturbing mix of vacant and piercing.\n\n“You have been standing on company property for over five minutes.” The tone was calm, even soothing, but decisive. “According to the terms and conditions of the lease you have tacitly agreed to be approached by a Non-Person Associate.”\n\nThe hologram paused for about half a second and Akili instinctively knew what was happening. He had probably given access to his identity details, and, thus, to his socials, which were being combed through. Not that it mattered, there would probably have been many other ways of getting to the same place even if he had flatly refused, which no one he knew ever did. Why bother? It usually meant you were denied access, got stuck in the middle of something, or that tasks took longer than your attention span. No one craves any of that.\n\n“It looks like you have not made purchases recently,” the hologram stated helpfully. “But do not worry, we have many affordable suggestions that fit your likes and needs. Please make your choice now.”",

          "abstract": "Erika Cheung found herself in the spotlight when she helped to expose scientific misconduct.Credit: Xiaomei Chen/Zuma/Alamy\n\nMost people who have endured and survived a toxic workplace don’t end up as a character in an award-winning TV show. But Erika Cheung is not like most people, in more ways than one. She risked her livelihood, right to privacy and professional relationships by speaking out about scientific fraud.\n\nCheung’s journey from researcher to whistle-blower began when she was a junior scientist, not long after she graduated in 2013 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor’s degree in molecular and cellular biology.\n\nShe landed a job at Theranos, one of the most exciting companies in California at the time. Elizabeth Holmes had founded the company in 2003, aged just 19, and had claimed that Theranos was going to revolutionize disease diagnostics. The days of multiple blood samples and intrusive medical investigations would be replaced by the start-up’s technology, one that could detect everything from cholesterol to cocaine.\n\nTheranos claimed that cancers, diabetes, anaemia, herpes, HIV/AIDS and many other ailments could all be diagnosed by the company’s ‘Edison device’, using just a few drops of blood from a finger-prick test.\n\nAt its zenith in 2015, Theranos was running close to 900,000 tests per year. It did so without the vigorous oversight of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the lack of which has since been criticized by legal experts as a significant loophole in the regulatory process. Theranos’s activities were classified as ‘laboratory-developed tests’, which the FDA defines as “a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory”. This classification meant that Theranos didn’t need to have its tests evaluated before they were offered and sold to patients.\n\nA promising prognosis\n\nCheung still remembers the excitement of the job interview, although the company wouldn’t divulge much of the detail behind Theranos’s technology, citing concerns over corporate espionage. “You're kept in the dark, and the explanation was trade secrets,” and “you’d find out more when you get inside”, says Cheung. That seemed fair enough to her, given that the company was awash with millions of dollars of investment capital from famous names such as media baron Rupert Murdoch and the Walgreens chain of pharmacies. It was also reassuring that the likes of former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and William Foege, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were on Theranos’s board. Holmes, for her part, was often proclaimed by the media to be the next Steve Jobs, a comparison made in part because, like the founder of the computer company Apple, she frequently wore a black turtleneck sweater.\n\nIt all seemed legitimate, and Cheung was pleased to have landed a job as a lab assistant at Theranos. She was looking forward to a fruitful career at the cutting edge of medical research.\n\nWould that it were all above board.\n\nIn fact, the science was bogus, the technology was unproven and the boss was a fraud. In 2022, Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for defrauding investors and was ordered to pay back US$452 million. The jury acquitted Holmes of conspiracy to defraud patients and of three counts of fraud against individual patients, and did not reach a verdict regarding three further counts of defrauding individual investors.\n\nElizabeth Holmes verdict: researchers share lessons for science\n\nIt wasn’t too long before Cheung began to suspect that the whole enterprise didn’t pass the sniff test. After she started her job in 2013, the secrecy that defined the interview carried on in the workplace. “The smoke and mirrors didn’t end,” she says. “There were all of these different laboratories that you didn’t have access to,” with something bigger and better supposedly happening behind those doors.\n\nBut in the short term at least, Cheung was preoccupied with making a good impression and settling in. “It takes a while to onboard and just figure out what’s happening at a company, especially a start-up where everything is in chaos and the turnover is so high that they are basically having people quit at the rate they’re hiring,” she says.\n\nEventually, however, Cheung wanted answers to reasonable questions. How did the technology work? How did its results compare with those from conventional testing techniques? Her questions went down like a lead balloon.\n\nShe started digging around the company’s computer records, trying to piece together a research and development (R&D) timeline. “Initially, I bought into the start-up idea, that is, ‘you’re here to fix these problems’. And I was super invested and committed to fixing things. I was definitely stressed; sometimes I was working at least 12 and sometimes 16 hours for 14 days in a row,” she says. But as she started to raise more questions, her access to certain hard drives was cut. To make matters worse, the high turnover of staff meant that it wasn’t clear who she could approach to ask about the history of the technology.\n\n“I didn’t have access to the digital memory of these things,” she says, and ”there were a lot of deliberate ways in which the company had organized itself in order to prevent people from being able to see the full picture”.\n\nSelf-doubt\n\nCheung can’t remember when she first concluded that something pernicious and illegal was afoot. There was no smoking-gun moment. In reality, it was a slow drip, drip of suspicion, followed by fear and then a sense of moral rectitude that led her to the truth about Theranos.\n\nCheung is keen to stress that she wasn’t supremely confident, and was constantly second-guessing herself and her convictions. “I was 22 and I had doubt, asking myself: is this how all lab diagnostics are run?” It seemed outrageous to her, but she “still wasn't too sure”, she recalls.\n\nThe most frustrating thing was the lack of hard information to back up her instincts. “I think that’s an issue for most scientists,” she says, the idea that “if I don’t have the full picture, I could be wrong”.\n\nThis second-guessing and tortured self-doubt comes from an earnest desire to do the right thing, says Rachel Peterson, one of Cheung’s closest friends at university, who became her confidant for all things Theranos. “She is one of the most genuine and brave and tough people I’ve ever met,” she says. ‘\n\n‘Brave’ isn’t an adjective that Cheung likes to use for herself — because she was so conflicted throughout the process. “I don't know if that's how I'd explain how I felt at the time,” she says.\n\nFortunately for Cheung, she happened across a research engineer who became her ally at Theranos —Tyler Shultz, whose grandfather, George Shultz, a former US secretary of state, happened to be on the company’s board. Cheung had worked with Tyler during a night shift in the R&D department.\n\nA scene from the TV miniseries The Dropout, with Camryn Mi-young Kim (left) as Erika Cheung.Credit: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\nShe and Shultz examined the results of some of Theranos’s diagnostic tests, comparing them with the outcomes of conventional tests. “We saw things weren’t right,” says Cheung. “The cancer markers could be threefold different to the standard test. It was the difference between telling someone they don’t have prostate cancer when they do, or telling someone they have hyperthyroidism when they don’t. Crazy stuff.”\n\nIn early 2014, the pair began to work in tandem, gathering as much data as possible so that they couldn’t be easily ignored when they took their findings to someone in authority. They planned to present a dossier of evidence to Shultz’s grandfather and implore him to influence Holmes and the rest of the board to take Theranos’s technology off the market and back into the development labs. In April 2014, they went to George Shultz’s house for dinner and made their case.\n\nThey explained that Theranos’s technology was unsound. “They basically tried to make blood tests for small sample sizes and so they jerry-rigged a bunch of FDA-approved machines. The Edison device was just terrible,” says Cheung. It had a robotic arm, and was supposed to titrate blood samples and add antibodies or reagents to identify a molecule indicating the presence of a disease. “It was like a very impressive PhD project, but it wasn’t ready to be tested on patients and be commercialized,” says Cheung. Over time and with more experience of real labs, she realized “how horrendous this was”, she says.\n\nIn reality, most of Theranos’s testing was being done conventionally by human scientists at the lab bench, although they did not have full blood samples to ensure accuracy.\n\nBut Cheung says that George Shultz was unconvinced. He dismissed their concerns and tried to reassure them that the company was well led by people who were at the top of their game. That came as a blow, not least to Tyler Shultz, who now had to decide whether to go against his grandfather or toe the company line.\n\nThe human cost\n\nCheung already knew in her heart of hearts what she needed to do — she knew before she even had dinner with the Shultzes, when she had seen a patient’s name printed on a blood-sample label. It was a rare moment of clarity for hert. “I started to realize that I wasn’t a scientist tinkering in a lab,” she says. ”I was, in fact, a health-care professional and I could see the names of the people we were providing these faulty results for.” If George Shultz and the rest of the board weren’t going to help, she would have to take a different line of attack.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nThings were starting to take their toll on Cheung, says Peterson. “The number of times when I held her while she was sobbing, just full-on sobbing, even in the years after Theranos, was a constant theme,” remembers Peterson.\n\nWhen the full extent of fraud at Theranos became clear, Peterson told Cheung to get her house in order. “My advice was very American: it was to talk to a lawyer. I said she should then quit and file a complaint with the government,” says Peterson.\n\nCheung took that counsel to heart, quitting the company in 2014; Tyler Shultz left shortly before she did. That same year, Holmes was named one of the richest women in the United States and Theranos raised a further $400 million in funding.\n\nIn 2014, after consulting her lawyer, Cheung filed a complaint with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a US federal agency responsible for administering the government’s health-insurance programmes. Shultz defied his grandfather, using an alias to report Theranos to the New York state authorities.\n\nAlthough Cheung submitted evidence to the CMS under her real name, she asked to be kept anonymous. But the investigations that Cheung’s and Shultz’s whistle-blowing kicked off led to legal action, and it was no longer possible for their names to be kept out of the spotlight. She became an oft-cited name in news coverage of the Theranos hearings.",

Gene therapy to restore the barrier reduced inflammation in the brain and improved learning and memory in aged mice. The work was published today in Nature1.\n\nThe finding shines a spotlight on a cast of poorly understood molecules called mucins that coat the interior of blood vessels throughout the body and give mucus its slippery texture, says Carolyn Bertozzi, a Nobel-prizewinning chemist at Stanford University in California and a lead author of the study. “Mucins play a lot of interesting roles in the body,” she says. “But until recently, we didn’t have the tools to study them. They were invisible.”\n\nSnotty barrier\n\nMucins are large proteins decorated with carbohydrates that form linkages with one another, creating a water-laden, gel-like substance. They are crucial constituents of the blood–brain barrier, a system that restricts the movement of some molecules from the blood into the brain.\n\nResearchers have long sought ways to sneak medicines past this barrier to treat diseases of the brain. Previous work also showed that the integrity of the barrier erodes with age2, suggesting that it could be an important target for therapies to combat diseases associated with ageing, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nConquering Alzheimer’s: a look at the therapies of the future\n\nBut scientists knew little about the contribution of mucins to these changes, until Sophia Shi, a graduate student at Stanford, decided to focus on a mucin-rich layer called the glycocalyx, which lines blood vessels. Shi and her colleagues looked at what happens to the glycocalyx in the brain as mice age. “The mucins on the young blood vessels were thick and juicy and plump,” says Bertozzi. “In the old mice, they were thin and lame and patchy.”\n\nThe team went on to find that mucins in a particular class were less abundant in old mice than in young mice. The scientists also showed that a decrease in the activity of enzymes needed to produce these mucins caused the blood–brain barrier to become leakier.\n\nAnd bolstering the activity of those enzymes in old mice reduced the leakage and improved the animals’ performance on learning and memory tests. Old mice can be forgetful, says Bertozzi. “They can’t get out of the maze like they used to. But they do better on those tests after we restore the mucin barrier.”",

Credit: Gordon Scammell/Loop Images/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nA crucial ocean-current system seems unlikely to collapse even in the face of severe climate change ― despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. That’s the finding of a study1 suggesting that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century.\n\nThe study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios.\n\nThe authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support this finding, even though the climate models they analysed do not perfectly mirror reality. “Unlikely isn’t impossible,” says Jonathan Baker, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at the Met Office in Exeter, UK. “But we have confidence in our results.” The work is published today in Nature.\n\nWater-moving machine\n\nThe AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt in the Atlantic Ocean: warm water travels in the upper layers from south to north. Once the water reaches its northernmost point, it sinks and travels southwards in a cold, deep layer until it reaches the southern oceans, where it rises back up to the surface. The AMOC therefore has a crucial role in the global distribution of heat, salt and other components of seawater.\n\nThe system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (warm water in red, cold water in blue; artist’s illustration) would survive, although in weakened form, even with extreme climate change.Credit: Jonathan Baker (Met Office) and co-authors\n\nThe intensity of the AMOC has declined over time2, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change. Although scientists agree that the collapse of the AMOC would have devastating consequences for local and regional climates, they are divided on whether and when such an event would occur.\n\nStudies of the AMOC’s future generally rely on analyses of its past behaviour and on models that simulate future scenarios under different climate conditions. Some have concluded that the AMOC would reach a tipping point sometime between 2025 and 2095, then abruptly shut down3. Other research indicates that a collapse is unlikely before the end of the century2, but scientists had not previously identified the factors that might be stopping it from happening.\n\nA passel of models\n\nBaker and his team used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to 2 extreme scenarios: a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels from pre-industrial levels; and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse.",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring her PhD at the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, South Korea, biochemist Babita Paudel studied antioxidant compounds from lichens and mosses that thrive in Antarctica. On returning to her home country, Nepal, she shifted to studying molecules produced by high-altitude microbes and medicinal plants found there. She co-founded the Center for Natural and Applied Sciences (CENAS) in Kathmandu, where she studies groups of bacteria called actinomycetes, known for producing compounds with antimicrobial activity. To isolate these bacteria, her team collected soil samples from extreme environments, including the base camps at Mount Everest and Annapurna, looking for potential products to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n\nBeyond her research, Paudel leads efforts to boost the numbers of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in Nepal. Supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, her Women in STEM Nepal team travels across the country to conduct capacity-building training for early- and mid-career women. The team organizes sessions on academic writing, building CVs, professional networking and writing grant proposals. In addition, it created Nepal's Women in STEM Nepal database, listing around 650 female researchers. The initiative has connected around 3,200 women interested in STEM careers. Paudel spoke to Nature about what inspired her to take the reins of this countrywide project.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nWhat drives me to help female students to thrive at my Ugandan university\nIt wasn’t a singular event. From the start, my passion was fuelled by strong family support. My father was the principal at a public secondary school. I was a bright student and having good scores encouraged my family to support my science education. At that time, only a small number of female students opted for science subjects. There were very few female professors teaching STEM courses, but seeing their commitment — despite the major household responsibilities that Nepalese society puts on women — inspired me to continue my career as a scientist.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?\n\nI've been fortunate to have my husband as a significant influence and mentor. We both are researchers in biochemistry, and his unwavering support has enabled me to pursue my career despite the responsibilities of raising our two children.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle gender inequality in science?\n\nIn 2021, while participating in an event organized by the Nepal German Academic Association, an alumni body, I was asked to give a presentation on the status of women in science in Nepal. It took me a month to prepare that presentation because there wasn’t any proper database of women scientists. I had to meticulously review data from a government body, the University Grants Commission, and visit department home pages of each of Nepal’s universities to gather information. One 2010 statistic from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO was particularly shocking: women comprised just 7.9% of the STEM workforce in Nepal, a proportion that was among the lowest in Asia. I realized the urgent need to do something about this.\n\nWere there other surprises that came out of your work?\n\nIn Nepal, there is a substantial disparity for women in STEM owing to various social norms such as domestic and childcare responsibilities, the lack of female-friendly policies in the workplace, and insufficient capacity-building activities, inspiration and motivation.\n\nI found that most Nepalese women in STEM tend to marry after completing their bachelor’s or master’s degrees. This often results in an academic break, one that often leads to a significant loss of confidence, contributing to imposter syndrome. I didn’t realize how pervasive this problem was until I started travelling the country and hearing women’s stories.\n\nAlso, Nepalese society is still patriarchal, and a lot of panel discussions at scientific conferences still tend to exclude female experts. I was surprised by the extent of this inequality. Women are expected to sacrifice the most, not just for their families, but also academically. Even women with advanced degrees often find themselves limited to sometimes entry-level, contract-limited and temporary lecturer positions in universities, with few opportunities for further promotion.\n\nHow does your initiative try to address these disparities?\n\nI’m a Palestinian scientist building a more inclusive future\nWe are building capacity for female students in STEM careers and creating networks of female researchers. In 2022 and 2023, we organized 10 capacity-building activities across 7 provinces in Nepal, engaging 421 female researchers in workshops on professional networking, how to explore work and study opportunities, CV preparation, proposal writing and plagiarism in research. In addition, we hosted ten webinars and published a comprehensive database of national and international funding agencies, scholarships and fellowships on the CENAS website.\n\nWe also created a Facebook group for team members to network, and to disseminate information on scholarships, funding agencies and opportunities. The group has more than 4,000 members. In 2022 and 2023, we also provided travel grants for 25 female students and early-career researchers to participate in and present their research at national and international conferences across Nepal.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something female researcher in Nepal?",

UKRI describes it as the largest real-terms stipend increase since 2003.

          "abstract": "Researchers all over the world are funded by the National Institutes of Health.Credit: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty\n\nResearchers worldwide who are funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research — are facing uncertainty about the future of their grants, after the administration of US President Donald Trump seeded turmoil at the agency.\n\nScientists in dozens of countries receive grants from the NIH, which disburses some US$47 billion in funding each year for science in areas such as cancer and infectious disease. Although international funding does not seem to be specifically threatened by the latest NIH policy changes, some overseas researchers say that concerns about the future of the agency’s funding has spurred them to seek support from other sources.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\n“The global research endeavour is enormously complex and enormously interdependent, and if a big part of it starts sputtering, the whole thing slows down,” says Ethan Scott, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who is a lead investigator on an NIH grant. “It’s difficult to overstate the degree to which the US NIH is one of the major engines behind global biomedical research.”\n\nGrants frozen\n\nAs part of efforts to slash US government spending and bureaucracy, the Trump administration has implemented policies that freeze NIH funding and grant reviews. This month, the NIH said it would slash funding for indirect costs, which pay for necessities such as electricity and waste removal at US research institutions. It proposed cutting the rate from an average of around 40% to 15% of grant awards — although the policy is facing legal challenge.\n\nOn its website, the NIH lists 811 grants to international teams in more than 60 countries, together worth more than $340 million. The nations with the most awards are South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. Grant sizes range from a few thousand dollars to $7 million.\n\nThe policy developments “cast a shadow across future planning”, especially for international collaborations involving interdisciplinary research, says Scott, whose grant looks at how the brain of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) processes visual and auditory information. The NIH has “a very generous and outward-looking policy” of funding researchers overseas, grounded in a philosophy of expanding knowledge and advancing medical research, he says. “The uncertainty that arises for international researchers is whether the NIH will consider continuing to send money overseas.”\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\nInternational collaborations\n\nA researcher in Australia who uses genomic techniques to study health equity and prostate cancer spent their Christmas holiday applying for non-US grants as a backup for the millions of dollars they receive from the NIH and the US Department of Defense. The researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of fears about their project’s future, says that the collaboration involves some 50 research staff in Australia, the United States and several African countries, among others. “This year I was meant to take a break and just enjoy doing research,” they say. “Instead of taking a break, I’ve just been writing every grant I possibly can,” — for funding from agencies in countries including Australia and the United Kingdom — “anywhere but America”.\n\nThe scientist says that applying for other grants could make those application pools more competitive.",

          "title": "US universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Some universities across the United States are reducing or halting their PhD admissions because of federal-funding uncertainties stemming from actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Few universities have released public statements about their strategies, so prospective graduate students have remained mostly in the dark about which institutions are cutting back. Nature spoke to several young scientists caught up in the confusion. Some have received e-mails from universities indicating that they would have been accepted if not for funding uncertainties; others have been told that programmes are completely paused.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, some prospective students even received informal offers to join the graduate programme, only to later have them rescinded, according to the institution’s newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian.\n\n“The whole thing is horrendous,” says a professor at the university, who requested anonymity because they are involved in admissions. “They’re cutting the heart of the intellectual mission of the university.” The university did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt the centre of most of the turmoil is the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which, with an annual budget of US$47 billion, is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research. Funding of NIH research grants has mostly been frozen for the past month, owing to actions taken by the Trump administration to reduce federal spending. The freeze has persisted despite a federal judge’s order to release the money. Separately, under Trump, the NIH has attempted to slash the rate paid to US research institutions for the ‘overhead costs’ that, for instance, keep electricity on and pay the rent in researchers’ workspaces. The agency proposed cutting the rate from between 40% and 70% to a flat 15% — a potential loss of billions of dollars for universities. A coalition of universities, as well as the attorneys-general of 22 states sued to halt the policy, which they say is illegal, and a federal judge temporarily blocked it from taking effect.\n\nBecause of the dearth of information from universities curtailing their admissions, researchers have crowdsourced information about affected institutions on social media. Nature contacted nearly 30 universities from one list of programmes, posted to the platform Bluesky, to verify the information. Some, such as the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, confirmed they had paused admissions. Others, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, said that their cuts were not made in response to the current federal-funding situation. More than 60% did not reply.\n\nUncertain futures\n\nAlthough many of the affected programmes are in the biomedical sciences, as reporting in STAT has detailed, uncertainty about federal funds exists across a number of disciplines. A prospective PhD student who applied to the physics programme at the University of Arizona in Tucson received a temporary rejection e-mail, which they shared with Nature. “We are truly impressed by your outstanding academic record,” the correspondence states, but “recent uncertainties in U.S. federal funding policies have significantly impacted our admissions process. At this time, we are unable to extend an offer to you, despite your strong ranking in our applicant pool”. The University of Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\n“It’s awfully demoralizing,” says the prospective student who, along with others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity out of fear for their admissions opportunities. “I feel terrible for the departments, too, whose professors spent so much time reading applications and picking out their new students only to find out they cannot be funded. I think everyone has had the rug completely pulled out from under them.” The student says they are thankful to have got into other programmes.\n\nBut not every student has been so lucky. One who applied to a social-sciences programme at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, received an informal offer of acceptance in January. Three weeks later, they received a letter from the school stating that admissions for the programme had been paused for the year. “Right now I don’t have any offers, and I’m not sure if I want to stay in research or not,” they say. Vanderbilt did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome universities have also stopped and restarted admissions in the past few weeks, creating more confusion. For instance, a student working in the post-baccalaureate programme at the NIH had applied to be a graduate student at the University of Pittsburgh. They received a letter from the university on 24 February that said it was suspending admission of all graduate students. One day later, the university told Nature that the pause has now been lifted. “Our goal is to properly support existing community members while also responsibly adding new members to the community,” a spokesperson says.",

          "title": "Will AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct",
          "authors": "Felice Frankel",
          "abstract": "One of the privileges of being on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge is seeing glimpses of the future, from advances in quantum computing and energy sustainability and production, to designing new antibiotics. Do I understand it all deeply? No, but I am able to wrap my head around much of it when I am asked to create an image to document the research.\n\nThe joy of being a science photographer is that I must learn about the things I am documenting to produce communicative and trustworthy images, intended as a form of data, for the researchers who welcome me into their laboratories.\n\nBut now, with the wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools, lots of questions must be asked. Will there be a point at which, with just a few keystrokes and prompts, a scientist can create a ‘visual’ of their research, as I do with my camera, and consider that image a record of the work? Will researchers, journals and readers be able to spot artificially created images and understand that they do not truly document the work? And finally, from a personal point of view, will there still be a place for a science photographer like me to advance the communication of research? Here’s what I have found out while experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) image generators.\n\nReality and representation\n\nFirst, let’s remind ourselves of the differences between a photograph, in which each pixel corresponds to real-world photons, and a genAI visual, created with a diffusion model — a complex computational process that generates something that seems real but might never have existed.\n\nTo explore these differences, I decided to experiment with genAI visuals made with Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E diffusion models to reproduce the work shown in one of my most popular science photographs — with help from scientific-visualization researcher Gaël McGill at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1997, Moungi Bawendi, a chemist at MIT, asked me to take a picture of his nanocrystals (quantum dots). When excited with ultraviolet light, these crystals fluoresce at different wavelengths depending on their size. Bawendi, who later shared a Nobel prize for this work, did not like the first image (see ‘Three views’), in which I had placed the vials flat on the lab bench, taking a top-down photograph. You can tell that was how I had placed them, because you can see the air bubbles in the tubes. It was intentional; I thought it made the image more interesting.\n\nCredit: Felice Frankel\n\nThe second iteration was used on the November 1997 cover of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B (see ‘Three views’). That photograph provides a straightforward record of the research and highlights the importance of collaborating with the scientist — an essential part of my process.\n\nTo generate a comparable image in DALL-E, I used the prompt “create a photo of Moungi Bawendi’s nanocrystals in vials against a black background, fluorescing at different wavelengths, depending on their size, when excited with UV light”.\n\nChina made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation\n\nPeople might think that the image the program produced is attractive (see ‘Three views’), but it is not even close to the reality captured in the original photograph. DALL-E introduced bead-like dots that were not in the prompt. The algorithm presumably found the words ‘quantum dots’ in the data set of the AI model that underlies it and used that information to replace the words “nanocrystals”.\n\nMore troubling is the fact that, in each vial, there are dots with different colours, implying that the samples contain a mix of materials that fluoresce at a range of wavelengths — this is inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the dots are shown lying on the surface of the table. Was that an aesthetic decision made by the model? I find the resulting visual fascinating (see Supplementary Information).\n\nThe results of my AI experimentation are often cartoon-like images that can hardly pass as reality — let alone documentation — but there will be a time when they will be. In conversations with colleagues in research and computer-science communities, they all agree that we should have clear standards on what is and is not allowed. In my opinion, a genAI visual should never be allowed as documentation.\n\nManipulated versus AI generated\n\nThe advent of AI means that we need to clarify three core issues related to visual communication: the difference between illustration and documentation, the ethics of image manipulation and the desperate need for visual-communication training for scientists and engineers.\n\nDecisions about how to frame an image — what to include or leave out — are already a manipulation of reality. The tools that people decide to use are also part of the manipulation. Each digital camera creates a distinct photograph. An Apple iPhone’s algorithm enhances image colours differently to that of a Samsung phone. Similarly, the near-infrared images produced by the James Webb Space Telescope are designed to be different from, yet complement, the Hubble Space Telescope’s optical scans.\n\nHow AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history\n\nTaking the point even further, the colours we see in all of those amazing images of the Universe are digitally enhanced and give us yet more renditions of reality. Seen through this lens, it is clear that humans have been, in effect, artificially generating images for years, without necessarily labelling them as such. However, there is a crucial difference between enhancing a photograph with software to depict reality and creating a reality from trained data sets.\n\nAs a science photographer, I am acutely aware of the difference between an illustration and a documentary photograph, but I am less confident that AI programs can make this distinction. An illustration or diagram is a representation of something, subjectively translating and visually describing a concept or structure using notations, colours, shapes and so on. A documentary optical photograph, or one made using scanning or transmission electron microscopy, is created with photons and electrons and is therefore a representation of an item, even if it is not the item itself. The difference between the two is in the intent.\n\nWith illustration, the intent is to describe and clarify the work. GenAI visuals will probably excel in that task. But for a documentary photograph, the intent is to bring us as close to reality as we can. Both are, in essence, already a form of manipulation or an act of artificial generation, and therein lies the importance of defining and discussing their ethics before we include genAI tools.\n\nPublishers now have software in place to identify various manipulations in images that already exist (see Nature 626, 697–698; 2024), but, frankly, AI programs will eventually be able to circumvent these fail-safes. There are efforts under way to find ways to trace the provenance of a photograph or to document any manipulation of the original. For example, the forensic photography community, through the global Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, provides technical information to camera manufacturers regarding the ability to trace the provenance of a photograph by keeping a record in the camera of any manipulation. As one can imagine, not all manufactures are on board.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe scientific community still has time to create a system of transparency and form guidelines regarding AI-generated images. At a minimum, every genAI visual should be clearly labelled as such, and the process and tools used to create it should be clearly stated and include, where possible, credit for any source images provided to the AI engine. However, listing the sources poses a challenge.\n\nTwo articles have raised an important issue by highlighting potential privacy and copyright violations when using diffusion models (N. Carlini et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/grqmsb (2023); and see go.nature.com/4jqyevn). Credit is only feasible in a closed system (which diffusion models are not) for which the training data are known and fully documented. For example, Springer Nature, which publishes Nature (Nature is independent of its publisher), has recently included an exception into its policy for Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold program to cover this sort of use (for models trained on a specific set of scientific data). However, people should keep in mind that AlphaFold is not a genAI tool that creates images — it generates structural models (coordinate data) that are then turned into images by people (not by genAI tools).\n\nHappily, efforts are addressing privacy issues. Creators can now use a kind of ‘tamper-evident’ metadata called Content Credentials to, as Adobe explains in its manual, “obtain proper recognition and promote transparency in the content creation process” (see go.nature.com/3wx92ng).\n\nEthical standards\n\nFor years, I have suggested that scientists need to be trained in the ethics of visual communication, and the easy availability of AI image-creation software adds urgency to this discussion.\n\nFor example, I recall one experience with an engineer who altered a photograph that I had made of their research and wanted to publish it, along with the submitted article (see Supplementary Information). The researcher did not consider that altering the image was, in fact, similar to changing their data because they had not been taught the basic ethics of image manipulation and visual communication.",

          "authors": "Jian-Wei Pan",
          "abstract": "In fields such as computing, information security and precise measurement, quantum systems promise to outperform classical ones. And there’s been much progress over the century since the formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum computers have reached the ‘quantum advantage’ milestone: they are able to solve problems that classical supercomputers cannot. And one method of secure communication, quantum cryptography, uses keys that are known only to the parties involved — a form of unconditional security, which means the protection cannot be broken even with unlimited computer power.\n\nHow to introduce quantum computers without slowing economic growth\n\nQuantum sensors are measuring both time and gravity with unprecedented precision. For instance, gravimeters for detecting earthquakes and for navigation are already commercially available.\n\nHowever, other than these encryption devices and quantum sensors, few quantum technologies have practical applications. In the next few years, quantum simulations will probably advance fields such as quantum chemistry and high-temperature superconductivity. The community is making progress, but the development of noise-resilient quantum computers that can be used for a wide range of problems will take another 10–15 years. Current challenges include protecting the fragile states of quantum bits (qubits) from errors and unwanted interference from the environment.\n\nThree steps would help to spur the field.\n\nFirst, calm down the quantum-computing hype. As a quantum physicist with more than 30 years of experience, I’ve seen how oversold promises have attracted a lot of capital and attention but can lead to unrealistic expectations. Some companies suggest that they can provide quantum-computing services, for example, when they have merely demonstrated small-scale quantum algorithms.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nExaggerated claims can mislead the public and investors and undermine societal confidence in quantum information technology. For example, January saw a collective plunge in quantum-computing stocks, triggering concerns that this technology bubble has now burst.\n\nTo prevent such stock-market jitters, academic and industrial research communities, as well as the media, must accurately communicate the state of quantum technology to the public, to foster realistic expectations.\n\nSecond, stable and long-term government investment is essential for the continued advancement of quantum information technology. Unlike mature technologies, such as the Internet or mobile phones, quantum information research cannot yet rely fully on market-driven financing.\n\nGovernments in the United States, Europe and China have increased their investments in quantum information research and development over the past few years. For example, the US National Quantum Initiative invested US$3.75 billion in 2023 — nearly triple its five-year budget of $1.3 billion (see go.nature.com/3cw6qtr). The next budget is in the process of being reauthorized, with a plan to allocate $2.7 billion over five years. But the eventual investment might be higher.",

          "authors": "Elisabeth Sweetman",
          "abstract": "Ukrainian researchers hope that research-funding reforms will revitalize the innovation sector.Credit: Ukrinform/Shutterstock\n\nUndaunted by the turmoil of the Russian invasion, the European Union has scaled up its presence in the Ukrainian research sector, establishing funding channels and offices in Kyiv. Scientists hope that these moves will drive reforms in Ukraine’s research-funding system and breathe new life into its struggling innovation sector.\n\nSince a Horizon Europe office was opened in Kyiv in late 2023, some norms have been beginning to shift, but the pace is slow because of the ongoing war. In 2024, for the first time, applications for grants at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science took into account European values such as gender balance, open science and the impact of results on society, says Ganna Tolstanova, vice-rector for research at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. If these developments gain momentum, a new era of Ukrainian research could be in sight.\n\nEU support for Ukrainian research includes three initiatives, launched in December 2023: a Kyiv-based office for Horizon Europe, the EU’s research and innovation (R&I) programme; a commitment to award funding to at least 200 Ukrainian ‘deep-tech’ start-up companies; and a technology and innovation hub in Kyiv. The hub is one of 16 such initiatives that have been opened across central, eastern and southern Europe to boost connections between local businesses, education authorities and researchers.\n\nIn addition to the almost €59 million (US$62 million) in funding that Ukrainian research has so far received through Horizon Europe, the EU says it intends to increase its presence in the country to drive wide-ranging cultural changes in the research sector. “Ukraine’s successful integration into the EU R&I ecosystem will require large-scale policy reforms,” a Council of the European Union memorandum announced in 2023.\n\nFor Tolstanova, the opportunity for Ukraine to emulate the relative transparency and efficiency of the EU’s research-funding system would would be a game-changer. The Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine has announced plans for a comprehensive review of the country’s research infrastructure, including auditing all research institutions to determine the current state of their research practices.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nThese audits have not yet started, and nor has the wider review, owing to the continuing conflict with Russia. As of late 2023, almost 20% of Ukraine’s scientists had left the country1. Power outages occur for several hours each day — often without warning — and at least 35% of the research infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed. According to Peter Berczik, who runs the Department of Physics of Stars and Galaxies at the Main Astronomical Observatory of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU) in Kyiv, the entire antenna system of the Radio Astronomy Institute in Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, was destroyed during the Russian occupation in 2022.\n\nBerczik says Horizon Europe is much more than a fund; its support could help to revitalize Ukrainian R&I by promoting competitiveness and fairness in how grants are allocated. But this will be no small feat. Ukrainians themselves will have to untangle the ageing roots of the research system to make a lasting difference, says Berczik. “Horizon Europe can be a first step, but it will not solve our problems. These are deep and go back more than 30 years.”\n\nDigging up old roots\n\nBerczik’s institution, NASU, is foremost in the minds of Ukrainian researchers who want to see changes in funding allocation. As Ukraine’s premier national research organization, NASU is the target of much criticism, and some scientists see it as antiquated and ineffective.\n\nNASU lacks transparency in how it handles grant applications, and information is sometimes obscured from researchers who might want to apply, one scientist who requested anonymity told Nature Index. The problem, they say, is that funding decisions are made by the directors of individual NASU centres, without involving the wider departments. Information about funding competitions often takes a long time to reach departments, says the scientist, so there is often no time left to submit an application. They note that some of the people who had key roles in allocating funding and managing grant applications have left Ukraine.\n\nBerczik, too, is concerned by what he sees as a lack of accountability and objectivity in funding decisions at NASU, and a stubborn culture of closed networks that makes it difficult for young researchers to progress. NASU did not respond to Nature Index’s requests for comment.\n\nLow salaries for researchers make the funding issue particularly contentious. NASU data show that the gross monthly salaries of PhD staff at NASU institutions amount to around €460, before tax and pension deductions. Researchers have to save their own money to cover the costs of publishing in top research journals. According to Berczik, some of these publications charge around £2,500 (US$3,100) per paper. Funding for scientists who win foreign grants from bilateral projects with EU countries, such as Poland, Lithuania and Austria, pays mainly for research done in the collaborating country. Moreover, the funding excludes accommodation, equipment and food.\n\nUkraine seeks to resume its role in cancer clinical trials\n\nSome Ukrainian research organizations are improving the competitiveness of the grant-application process, according to Tolstanova. She says the National Research Foundation of Ukraine (NRF) in Kyiv, a state budgetary institution established in 2018, is a good example of this. However, the bureaucracy in Ukraine can be oppressive, Tolstanova adds, which means that any improvements will take time. “There’s a lot of paperwork and restrictions.”\n\nFor example, researchers in Ukraine must justify each unit of chemical reagent or other consumables in agreements for research grants from the NRF, says Tolstanova. Any subsequent requirements trigger extra individual requests, creating further administrative burdens. By contrast, Tolstanova cites typical research-procurement processes at EU universities, which require the principal investigator to calculate costs across broad categories, such as equipment, travel expenses and event organization.\n\nThat said, the rigour of the process under the supervision of principal investigators at the NRF maximizes accountability for research, says Tolstanova. “I am confident that every penny of the NRF funding spent on science is spent for the intended purpose, and that the pricing is justified.” One advantage of the current system at the NRF is that government officials — rather than senior academics, as is the case at NASU — assess and award grant proposals. This brings more objectivity to the process, says Tolstanova.",

          "abstract": "The Trump administration prevented NASA’s chief scientist from travelling to climate talks where she was to co-chair a working group.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nA major United Nations climate assessment is moving forwards in China this week without the United States, after the administration of President Donald Trump blocked US officials’ participation and shut down a team providing technical support for the next international climate assessment.\n\nReports emerged last week that the Trump administration had banned NASA chief scientist Katherine Calvin from attending a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that began on Monday in Hangzhou, China. Nature has now confirmed with several sources that the US State Department delegation is not attending the meeting, which is slated to end with the adoption of an outline for the panel’s seventh climate assessment, due for completion by late 2029. The IPCC assessments, which are the gold-standard guide to the pace and effects of climate change, are used by governments to shape their climate policies.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNASA has also cancelled a contract that funded a team including scientists and others to provide administrative and technical support to the climate-assessment effort, says a US official who is familiar with the situation but asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press. The team would have supported Calvin and her co-chair, Joy Jacqueline Pereira, a geologist at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi. The cancellation was reported by the Washington Post and independently confirmed by Nature. A NASA spokesperson said that the move was prompted by guidance “to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts”.\n\nThe absence of the US delegation from the meeting “is obviously a loss for the international community,” says Li Shuo, the director of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s China Climate Hub in Washington DC. “The US plays an important role in the IPCC process, contributing both financial and intellectual support.”\n\nIPCC spokesperson Andrej Mahecic declined to comment, except to say that the organization has not received official notification of any decisions regarding a change in status of the technical support team. For now, the process is moving forwards, he says.\n\nNASA officials confirmed that Calvin would not be attending the meeting in China but declined to make her available for an interview. The White House referred Nature’s queries to the State Department; officials there declined to comment.\n\nOutsized role\n\nThe United States has historically made substantial scientific and monetary contributions to the IPCC. US scientists publish research that informs the assessment and run computer simulations of the climate that feed into it. For the seventh report, Calvin was co-chairing one of three IPCC working groups; hers was assessing the scientific literature on options to reduce emissions and halt global warming.\n\nCalvin’s support team would have helped with everything from reviewing the literature and designing graphics for the final IPCC report to managing travel logistics. The group was funded by a NASA contract but situated in the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a White House organization that coordinates climate work across federal agencies. That contract has now been ended, according to the US official. “We don’t know if Kate will be allowed to continue as a co-chair” of the working group, they said.\n\n“It would be a real shame if the administration pulled Kate out of that role, not just for her, but for the US,” says Andy Miller, who was one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s liaisons to the USGCRP, until his retirement in December. “And it would be a loss for IPCC to lose someone of Kate’s caliber.”\n\nScramble to recover",

          "abstract": "To build and establish essential international networks, gain international experience and secure a position on the academic tenure track, early-career researchers are increasingly seeking employment opportunities abroad1,2. Relocation to a foreign country — particularly one with a different culture and language — is an inherently challenging undertaking. Early-career researchers often encounter difficulties even before departing. A typical example would be the frustrating cycle between residence permit and employment contract: in many cases, obtaining a visa or residence permit is necessary to secure an employment contract. However, without proof of employment and a rental agreement, obtaining a visa can be difficult. In situations in which institutions fail to provide specialized and dedicated support, delays in the researcher’s arrival may occur that limit the ability of the early-career researcher to achieve and show their full potential within the host institution.\n\nAfter arrival, those who do not speak the local language may face additional challenges3. Although researchers typically use a common language (often English), administrative staff of the employing institutions might not, which makes tasks such as completing paperwork and reading email correspondence difficult. These activities frequently require help from a bilingual third party, which is not always available or advisable for sensitive matters. Furthermore, such challenges often extend beyond the walls of the institution into daily life, including in finding accommodation, setting up a local bank account, navigating taxes, and scheduling private or occupational medical appointments.",

          "abstract": "Memorability, the likelihood that a stimulus is remembered, is an intrinsic stimulus property that is highly consistent across people—participants tend to remember or forget the same faces, objects and more. However, these consistencies in memory have thus far only been observed for visual stimuli. Here we investigated memorability in the auditory domain, collecting recognition memory scores from over 3,000 participants listening to a sequence of speakers saying the same sentence. We found significant consistency across participants in their memory for voice clips and for speakers across different utterances. Regression models incorporating both low-level (for example, fundamental frequency) and high-level (for example, dialect) voice properties were significantly predictive of memorability and generalized out of sample, supporting an inherent memorability of speakers’ voices. These results provide strong evidence that listeners are similar in the voices they remember, which can be reliably predicted by quantifiable low-level acoustic features.",

Substantial changes to current systems of care, including regulatory approvals, clinical training and access will all be required to accommodate PAT, a multimodal therapy that combines pharmacological and psychotherapy components that are not routinely available outside clinical research settings. Implementation science can help to reduce the gap in a way that maintains scientific rigour by simultaneously examining the safety, effectiveness and implementation of PAT. Specifically, precision implementation science methods (for example, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs), hybrid study designs, valid measurement of fidelity and use of theory-based models and frameworks for treatment development will accelerate the process of implementation while balancing safety and quality.

Here we analyse US survey data to reveal a nested structure within skill portfolios, where the direction of dependency is inferred from asymmetrical conditional probabilities—occupations require one skill conditional on another. This directional nature suggests that advanced, specific skills and knowledge are often built upon broader, fundamental ones. We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial/ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.",

This is of great interest given the postponement of first births in almost all developed countries during the twentieth century. Here we use an instrumental variable approach (Mendelian randomization) using maternal and paternal polygenic indices (PGIs) for age at first birth—while conditioning on the child’s PGI for age at first birth—to identify the causal effects of maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores based on data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort study. We do not find evidence of positive causal effects of both maternal and paternal age at first birth on children’s test scores at age 10 years once the children’s PGI and correlations among different PGIs are controlled for. We therefore conclude that our results do not provide evidence in favour of sociological theories that predict positive causal effects of parental age on children’s educational attainment.",

Here we conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis on depression (416,437 cases and 1,308,758 controls) and identified 287 risk loci, of which 49 are new. Variant-level fine mapping prioritized potential causal variants and functional genomic analysis identified variants that regulate the binding of transcription factors. We validated that 80% of the identified functional variants are regulatory variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis uncovered the potential target genes regulated by the prioritized risk variants. Gene-level analysis, including transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies, colocalization and Mendelian randomization-based analyses, prioritized potential causal genes and drug targets. Gene prioritization analyses highlighted likely causal genes, including TMEM106B, CTNND1, AREL1 and so on. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of depression risk genes in synapse-related pathways. Finally, knockdown of Tmem106b in mice resulted in depression-like behaviours, supporting the involvement of Tmem106b in depression. Our study identified new risk loci, likely causal variants and genes for depression, providing important insights into the genetic architecture of depression and potential therapeutic targets.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is the process by which we adjust internal models of the body, world and mind in response to sensory feedback. Although adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants’ spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance recovered rapidly following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error. These findings indicate that the computational mechanisms governing the adaptation of motor commands appear to similarly serve to adjust and calibrate spatial cognition.",

          "abstract": "A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.",

We leverage an analytic solution that yields fully time-dependent rational population behavior to obtain, 1) a simple relationship between rational social distancing behavior and the current number of infections; 2) scaling results for how the infection peak and number of total cases depend on the cost of contracting the disease; 3) characteristic infection costs that divide regimes of strong and weak behavioral response; 4) a closed form expression for the value of the utility. We discuss how these analytic results provide a deep and intuitive understanding of the disease dynamics, useful for both individuals and policymakers. In particular, the relationship between social distancing and infections represents a heuristic that could be communicated to the population to encourage, or “bootstrap,” rational behavior.",

Here, we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness—i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time—that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the modus operandi of sociotechnical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system toward the proverbial “edge of a cliff.” Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to critical fragility is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental “excess volatility puzzle” in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing sociotechnical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.",

          "abstract": "High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago.",

When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.",

          "authors": "Yang Cheng, Xuesong Wang, Yike Ding, Houhong Zhang, Zhenyu Jia, Alexander S. Raikhel",
          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Processivity clamps mediate polymerase switching for translesion synthesis (TLS). All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.",

However, the varying degrees of epidemiological dominance among different lineages or clades of H9N2 AIVs have not been fully clarified. The matrix protein M1, a key structural component of the virion, plays a crucial role in maintaining the viral structure and lifecycle. To elucidate the intrinsic relationship between the genetic patterns of M1 and the adaptive dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, this study focused on the five major evolutionary patterns of M1 and conducted in vitro and in vivo investigations from the perspectives of vRNP release after viral uncoating, polymerase activity, mRNA and vRNA levels, the nuclear export of vRNPs, plasma membrane–binding capacity, proliferation capacity, growth competitiveness, and transmission potential. The results revealed a strong correlation between the epidemiological dominance of H9N2 AIVs and the specific patterns of M1, with M1 P5 standing out as particularly significant. This finding highlights the pivotal influence of the M1 gene patterns on the replication and transmission dynamics of H9N2 AIVs, thereby offering valuable insights into the mechanisms driving differences in adaptive evolution and shifts in epidemiological dominance within the H9N2 AIV population.",

          "abstract": "The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in noncentrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in nonmagnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator 1 T ′ -WTe 2 . Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) promise unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties, which can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the composition, size, and morphology. Semiconductor QDs have been synthesized primarily via two approaches, namely, epitaxial growth and wet-chemical synthesis. However, the properties of epitaxial QDs (eQDs) are susceptible to wetting layer formation and substrate dislocations, while colloidal QDs (cQDs) face fluorescence intermittency issues. Here, we report on the synthesis of a class of QDs that can overcome the fundamental limitations of eQDs and cQDs. By exploiting the sp 2 bonding of layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we show that GaN QDs can be epitaxially grown through a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction without two-dimensional wetting layer formation. The photoluminescence intensity of GaN van der Waals quantum dots (vQDs) is more than six times stronger than that of conventional GaN eQDs and no optical blinking was observed from vQDs. We show that the interadatom bond strength is about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that between the adatoms and the hBN substrate. This work shows that vQDs have unique properties that are difficult to achieve using existing QDs synthesis methods and thus can potentially enable new classes of high-performance optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

In our extensive simulation study, the proposed method consistently demonstrates greater power than existing alternatives, achieving a relative increase of over 20% in challenging scenarios where true causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions exist at the same time, while maintaining a lower false positive rate.",

A salient feature emerges: The coherent CDW mode AM exhibits an unusual T 3.56 temperature dependence below 65 K, in addition to the T 2 temperature dependence observed in the 65 to 200 K range. This behavior suggests the enhancement of in-gap electronic excitations below 65 K and the emergence of a new phase of matter. Consequently, the intriguing quantum state leads to a crossover.

          "abstract": "Single-particle tracking has enabled quantitative studies of complex systems, providing nanometer localization precision and millisecond temporal resolution in heterogeneous environments. However, at micro- or nanometer scales, probe dynamics become inherently stochastic due to Brownian motion and complex interactions, leading to varied diffusion behaviors. Typically, analysis of such trajectory data involves certain moving-window operation and assumes the existence of some pseudo–steady states, particularly when evaluating predefined parameters or specific types of diffusion modes. Here, we introduce the stochastic particle-informed neural network (SPINN), a physics-informed deep learning framework that integrates stochastic differential equations to model and infer particle diffusion dynamics. The SPINN autonomously explores parameter spaces and distinguishes between deterministic and stochastic components with single-frame resolution. Using the anomalous diffusion dataset, we validated SPINN’s ability to reduce frame-to-frame variability while preserving key statistical correlations, allowing for accurate characterization of different stochastic processes. When applied to the diffusion of single gold nanorods in hydrogels, the SPINN revealed enhanced microrheological properties during hydrogel gelation and uncovered interfacial dynamics during dextran/tetra-PEG liquid–liquid phase separation. By improving the temporal resolution of stochastic dynamics, the SPINN facilitates the estimation and prediction of complex diffusion behaviors, offering insights into underlying physical mechanisms at mesoscopic scales.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide sequence data are being harnessed to identify species, even in cases in which organisms themselves are neither in hand nor witnessed. But how genome-wide sequence divergence maps to species status is far from clear. While gene sequence divergence is commonly used to delineate bacterial species, its correspondence to established species boundaries has yet to be explored across eukaryotic taxa. Because the processes underlying gene flow differ fundamentally between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, these domains are likely to differ in the relationship between reproductive isolation and genome-wide sequence divergence. In prokaryotes, homologous recombination, the basis of gene flow, depends directly on the degree of genomic sequence divergence, whereas in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, reproductive incompatibility can stem from changes in very few genes. Guided by measures of genome-wide sequence divergence in bacteria, we gauge how genomic criteria correspond to species boundaries in eukaryotes. In recognized species of eukaryotes, levels of gene sequence divergence within species are typically very small, averaging &lt;1% across protein-coding regions in most animals, plants, and fungi. There are even instances in which divergence between sister species is the same or less than that among conspecifics. In contrast, bacterial species, defined as populations exchanging homologous genes, show levels of divergence both within and between species that are considerably higher. Although no single threshold delineates species, eukaryotic populations with &gt;1% genome-wide sequence divergence are likely separate species, whereas prokaryotic populations with 1% divergence are still able to recombine and thus can be considered the same species.",

          "abstract": "Scaffold proteins are key players in many signaling pathways where they ensure spatial and temporal control of molecular interactions by simultaneous tethering of multiple signaling components. The protein JIP1 acts as a scaffold within the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by assembling three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, into a macromolecular complex that enables their specific activation. The recruitment of these kinases depends on the 450-amino acid intrinsically disordered tail of JIP1, however, the structural details of this tail and the molecular mechanisms by which it binds kinases have remained elusive. Here, we provide an atomic resolution structural description of the JIP1 tail, and we study its interaction with the kinase JNK1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that JNK1 not only engages with the well-known docking site motif (D-motif) of JIP1, but also interacts with a noncanonical F-motif. We determine the crystal structure of the JIP1–JNK1 complex at 2.35 Å resolution revealing a bipartite binding mode of JIP1. Our work provides insights into the sequence determinants of F-motifs suggesting that these motifs may be more prevalent in JNK substrates than previously recognized. More broadly, our study highlights the power of NMR spectroscopy in uncovering kinase interaction motifs within disordered scaffold proteins, and it paves the way for atomic-resolution interaction studies of JIP1 with its multitude of interaction partners.",

          "abstract": "Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",

Despite major advancements in the field of metabolic modeling in recent years, prediction of genetic modifications for increased production remains challenging. Here, we present a computational pipeline that leverages the concept of protein limitations in metabolism for prediction of optimal combinations of gene engineering targets for enhanced chemical bioproduction. We used our pipeline for prediction of engineering targets for 103 different chemicals using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a host. Furthermore, we identified sets of gene targets predicted for groups of multiple chemicals, suggesting the possibility of rational model-driven design of platform strains for diversified chemical production.",

          "abstract": "Advances in sequencing technology have unveiled examples of nucleus-encoded polycistrons, once considered rare. Exclusively polycistronic transcripts are prevalent in green algae, although the mechanism by which multiple polypeptides are translated from a single transcript is unknown. Here, we used bioinformatic and in vivo mutational analyses to evaluate competing mechanistic models for translation of bicistronic mRNAs in green algae. High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides , revealed a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before the ORF 2 start codon, which are suitable conditions for leaky ribosome scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in A. protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.",

While surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy delays disease progression, these treatments do not lead to tumor control, and targeted therapies or biologics have failed to further improve survival. Utilizing a transient radiation-induced state of multipotency, we used the adenylcyclase activator forskolin to alter the fate of irradiated glioma cells. The effects of the combined treatment on neuronal marker expression, cell cycle distribution, and proliferation were studied. Gene expression profiling was conducted using bulk RNA-seq. Changes in cell populations were investigated using single-cell RNA-seq. Effects on glioma stem cells (GSCs) were studied in extreme limiting dilution assays, and the effects on median survival were studied in both syngeneic and PDOX mouse models of GBM. The combined treatment induced the expression of neuronal markers in glioma cells, reduced proliferation, and led to a distinct gene expression profile. scRNA-seq revealed that the combined treatment forced glioma cells into a microglia- and neuron-like phenotype. In vivo, this treatment led to a loss of GSCs and prolonged median survival. Collectively, our data suggest that revisiting a differentiation therapy with forskolin in combination with radiation could lead to clinical benefit.",

          "abstract": "B cells generate pathogen-specific antibodies and play an essential role in providing adaptive protection against infection. Antibody genes are modified in evolutionary processes acting on the B cell populations within an individual. These populations proliferate, differentiate, and migrate to long-term niches in the body. However, the dynamics of these processes in the human immune system are primarily inferred from mouse studies. We addressed this gap by sequencing the antibody repertoire and transcriptomes from single B cells in four immune-rich tissues from six individuals. We find that B cells descended from the same pre-B cell (“lineages”) often colocalize within the same tissue, with the bone marrow harboring the largest excess of lineages without representation in other tissues. Within lineages, cells with different levels of somatic hypermutation are uniformly distributed among tissues and functional states. This suggests that the relative probabilities of localization and differentiation outcomes change negligibly during affinity maturation, and quantitatively agrees with a simple dynamical model of B cell differentiation. While lineages strongly colocalize, we find individual B cells nevertheless appear to make independent differentiation decisions. Proliferative antibody-secreting cells, however, deviate from these global patterns. These cells are often clonally expanded, their clones appear universally distributed among all sampled organs, and form lineages with an excess of cells of the same type. Collectively, our findings show the limits of peripheral blood monitoring of the immune repertoire, and provide a probabilistic model of the dynamics of antibody memory formation in humans.",

Our multiomics analysis focusing on APA with KCNJ5 mutations, which represent the most common genetic form, revealed marked cellular heterogeneity. Tumor cell reprogramming initiated from stress-responsive cells to aldosterone-producing or cortisol-producing cells, with the latter progressing to proliferative stromal-like cells. These cell subtypes showed spatial segregation, and APA exhibited genomic intratumor heterogeneity. Among the nonparenchymal cells, lipid-associated macrophages, which were abundant in APA, might promote the progression of cortisol-producing and stromal-like cells, suggesting their role in the tumor microenvironment. Intratumor cortisol synthesis was correlated with increased blood cortisol levels, which were associated with the development of vertebral fractures, a hallmark of osteoporosis. This study unveils the complex cellular ecosystem with clinical relevance in APA with KCNJ5 mutations, providing insights into tumor biology that could inform future clinical approaches.",

          "abstract": "Myosin-IC (myo1c) is a class-I myosin that supports transport and remodeling of the plasma membrane and membrane-bound vesicles. Like other members of the myosin family, its biochemical kinetics are altered in response to changes in mechanical loads that resist the power stroke. However, myo1c is unique in that the primary force-sensitive kinetic transition is the isomerization that follows ATP binding, not ADP release as in other slow myosins. Myo1c also powers actin gliding along curved paths, propelling actin filaments in leftward circles. To understand the origins of this unique force-sensing and motile behavior, we solved actin-bound myo1c cryo-EM structures in the presence and absence of ADP. Our structures reveal that in contrast with other myosins, the myo1c lever arm swing is skewed, partly due to a different actin interface that reorients the motor domain on actin. The structures also reveal unique nucleotide-dependent behavior of both the nucleotide pocket as well as an element called the N-terminal extension (NTE). We incorporate these observations into a model that explains why force primarily regulates ATP binding in myo1c, rather than ADP release as in other myosins. Integrating our cryo-EM data with available crystallography structures allows the modeling of full-length myo1c during force generation, supplying insights into its role in membrane remodeling. These results highlight how relatively minor sequence differences in members of the myosin superfamily can significantly alter power stroke geometry and force-sensing properties, with important implications for biological function.",

          "abstract": "Molluscan brains are composed of morphologically consistent and functionally interrogable neurons, offering rich opportunities for understanding how neural circuits drive behavior. Nonetheless, detailed component-level CNS maps are often lacking, total neuron numbers are unknown, and organizational principles remain poorly defined, limiting a full and systematic characterization of circuit operation. Here, we establish an accessible, generalizable approach, harnessing synchrotron X-ray tomography, to rapidly determine the three-dimensional structure of the multimillimeter-scale CNS of Lymnaea . Focusing on the feeding ganglia, we generate a full neuron-level reconstruction, revealing key design principles and revising cell count estimates upward threefold. Our atlas uncovers the superficial but also nonsuperficial ganglionic architecture, reveals the cell organization in normally hidden regions—ganglionic “dark sides”—and details features of single-neuron morphology, together guiding targeted follow-up functional investigation based on intracellular recordings. Using this approach, we identify three pivotal neuron classes: a command-like food-signaling cell type, a feeding central pattern generator interneuron, and a unique behavior-specific motoneuron, together significantly advancing understanding of the function of this classical control circuit. Combining our morphological and electrophysiological data, we also establish a functional CNS atlas in Lymnaea as a shared and scalable resource for the research community. Our approach enables the rapid construction of cell atlases in large-scale nervous systems, with key relevance to functional circuit interrogation in a diverse range of model organisms.",

          "abstract": "Depletion or inhibition of core stress granule proteins, G3BP1 in mammals and TIAR-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans , increases the growth of spontaneously regenerating axons. Inhibition of G3BP1 by expression of its acidic or “B-domain” accelerates axon regeneration after nerve injury, bringing a potential therapeutic strategy for peripheral nerve repair. Here, we asked whether G3BP1 inhibition is a viable strategy to promote regeneration in injured mammalian central nervous system (CNS) where axons do not regenerate spontaneously. G3BP1 B-domain expression was found to promote axon regeneration in the transected spinal cord provided with a permissive peripheral nerve graft (PNG) as well as in crushed optic nerve. Moreover, a cell-permeable peptide (CPP) to a subregion of B-domain (rodent G3BP1 amino acids 190 to 208) accelerated axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury and promoted regrowth of reticulospinal axons into the distal transected spinal cord through a bridging PNG. G3BP1 CPP promoted axon growth from rodent and human neurons cultured on permissive substrates, and this function required alternating Glu/Asp-Pro repeats that impart a unique predicted tertiary structure. The G3BP1 CPP disassembles axonal G3BP1, G3BP2, and FMRP, but not FXR1, granules and selectively increases axonal protein synthesis in cortical neurons. These studies identify G3BP1 granules as a key regulator of axon growth in CNS neurons and demonstrate that disassembly of these granules promotes retinal axon regeneration in injured optic nerve and reticulospinal axon elongation into permissive environments after CNS injury. This work highlights G3BP1 granule disassembly as a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing axon growth and neural repair.",

Noncovalent coupling strategies using viral RNA binding proteins such as MS2/MCP have been widely applied but are limited by tag size, sensitivity, and dissociation over time. We took inspiration from a sequence-specific, covalent protein–DNA conjugation method based on the Rep nickase of a porcine circovirus called “HUH tag”. Though wild-type HUH protein has no detectable activity toward an RNA probe, we engineered an RNA-reactive variant, called “rHUH”, through 7 generations of yeast display–based directed evolution. Our 13.4 kD rHUH has 12 mutations relative to HUH and forms a covalent tyrosine-phosphate ester linkage with a 10-nucleotide RNA recognition sequence (“rRS”) within minutes.

          "abstract": "Protein O-glycosylation is a critical modification in the brain, as genetic variants in the pathway are associated with common and severe neuropsychiatric phenotypes. However, little is known about the most abundant O-glycans in the mammalian brain, which are N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) linked. Here, we determined the spatial localization, protein carriers, and cellular function of O-GalNAc glycans in the mouse brain. We observed striking spatial enrichment of O-GalNAc glycans in neuronal tracts, and specifically at nodes of Ranvier, specialized structures involved in signal propagation in the brain. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that more than half of the identified O-GalNAc glycans were present on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans termed lecticans, and display both domain enrichment and regional heterogeneity. Inhibition of O-GalNAc synthesis in neurons reduced binding of Siglec-4, a known regulator of neurite growth, and shortened the length of nodes of Ranvier. This work establishes a function of O-GalNAc glycans in the brain and will inform future studies on their role in development and disease.",

          "abstract": "Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and familial frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). To identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression. We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place during FTD development. Loss of neurosurveillance microglia and activation of the complement cascade take place early, when pTDP-43 aggregates are absent or very low, and become more pronounced in late stages, suggesting an initial involvement of microglia in disease progression. Reduction of layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 also occurs early, and the reduction becomes more pronounced as pTDP-43 accumulates. Several unique features were observed only in samples with high levels of pTDP-43, including global alteration of chromatin accessibility in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes; higher ratios of premature oligodendrocytes; increased levels of the noncoding RNA NEAT1 in astrocytes and neurons, and higher amount of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. Our findings reveal progressive functional changes in major cell types found in the prefrontal cortex of C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients that shed light on the mechanisms underlying the pathology of this disease.",

Next, radial glial cells generate tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs) that give rise to cortical astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from cortical neurogenesis to gliogenesis, and the subsequent fate determination of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons, remain unclear. Here, we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a fundamental role in promoting cortical gliogenesis and the generation of Tri-IPCs. Additionally, sonic hedgehog-smoothened-glioma-associated oncogene homolog (SHH-SMO-GLI) activator signaling has an auxiliary function to ERK during these processes. We further demonstrate that, from Tri-IPCs, NOTCH signaling is crucial for the fate determination of astrocytes, while ERK signaling plays a prominent role in oligodendrocyte fate specification, and SHH signaling is required for the fate determination of olfactory bulb interneurons. We provide evidence suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in both mice and humans. Finally, we propose a unifying principle of mammalian cortical gliogenesis.",

Recently, TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been recognized as the pore-forming subunit of the MT channel, but TMC1/2 functional expression in heterologous cells—which is critical for unequivocally identifying them as the bona fide pore-forming subunit of the MT channel—has not been achieved because ectopic TMC1/2 become trapped in the ER. Here, we report that adding a Fyn lipidation tag to mouse TMC1/2 (mTMC1/2) drove their cell-surface expression, and, importantly, full-length mTMC1/2 expressed alone functioned as mechanosensitive channels, underscoring the view that TMC1/2 constitute the sole pore-forming subunit of the MT channel. Moreover, mouse transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) (mTMIE) protein robustly stimulated TMC1/2 channel activity by modulating their gating. Intriguingly, the N-terminal 27 residues of mTMIE were dispensable for regulating TMC1/2 in our in vitro functional assay, whereas, in striking contrast, mutating mTMIE C76C77, the predicted palmitoylation sites, eliminated mTMIE stimulation of mTMC1/2, indicating a crucial role of the palmitoyl group in regulating TMC1/2 gating. mTMC1/2+mTMIE form 18 pS and 24 pS single channels, respectively. mTMC1/2+mTMIE single channels showed biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of the MT channel. Our findings provide insights into several fundamental and debated aspects of the function of TMC1/2 and TMIE, and our functional assay of TMC1/2 and TMIE in heterologous cells will facilitate further functional and structural characterization of these proteins and other MT-complex components.",

          "abstract": "Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life’s work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen–worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen–worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers’ reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.",

          "abstract": "Proteins and the complexes they form are central to nearly all cellular processes. Their flexibility, expressed through a continuum of states, provides a window into their biological functions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an ideal tool to study these dynamic states as it captures specimens in noncrystalline conditions and enables high-resolution reconstructions. However, analyzing the heterogeneous distributions of conformations from cryo-EM data is challenging. We present RECOVAR, a method for analyzing these distributions based on principal component analysis (PCA) computed using a REgularized COVARiance estimator. RECOVAR is fast, robust, interpretable, expressive, and competitive with state-of-the-art neural network methods on heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. The regularized covariance method efficiently computes a large number of high-resolution principal components that can encode rich heterogeneous distributions of conformations and does so robustly thanks to an automatic regularization scheme. The reconstruction method based on adaptive kernel regression resolves conformational states to a higher resolution than all other tested methods on extensive independent benchmarks while remaining highly interpretable. Additionally, we exploit favorable properties of the PCA embedding to estimate the conformational density accurately. This density allows for better interpretability of the latent space by identifying stable states and low free-energy motions. Finally, we present a scheme to navigate the high-dimensional latent space by automatically identifying these low free-energy trajectories.

          "abstract": "Telomerase elongates telomeres to maintain chromosome stability in most eukaryotes. Despite extensive studies across eukaryotic kingdoms, the telomerase holoenzyme in arthropods remains poorly understood. In this study, we purify the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex from the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) and identify a copurified 135-nucleotide telomerase RNA (TR) component. This miniature S. frugiperda TR (sfTR), the smallest TR known to date, retains a universal pseudoknot structure and a structurally defined template. Despite its small size, sfTR assembles with the recombinant S. frugiperda telomerase reverse transcriptase (sfTERT) protein in vivo to reconstitute telomerase activity for the synthesis of insect telomeric DNA repeats (TTAGG)n. The sfTR gene, like other animal TR genes, features an snRNA-type RNA polymerase II promoter. Uniquely, the sfTR transcript harbors a 5′-7-methylguanosine (M 7 G) cap, as opposed to the more typical snRNA-type 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) cap. The difference in 5′-cap is likely because sfTR lacks the H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis domain necessary for cap hypermethylation. Moreover, sfTR also lacks the CR4/5 regulatory domain that is indispensable in vertebrate TRs for telomerase activity. This degenerate sfTR complements an enigmatic sfTERT that is missing certain telomerase-specific elements yet catalytically active in the absence of sfTR. Thus, insects have evolved a simplified telomerase, consisting of a small noncoding RNA that retains only minimal attributes essential for telomerase function. The simplified insect telomerase demonstrates a plausible evolutionary pathway for the emergence of telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex, arising from an ancient reverse transcriptase associated with a simple templating RNA component in early eukaryotes.",

          "abstract": "Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.",

We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men.

Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.",

Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.",

Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.",

          "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is predicted to intensify lake algal blooms globally and result in regime shifts. However, observed increases in algal biomass do not consistently correlate with air temperature or precipitation, and evidence is lacking for a causal effect of climate or the nonlinear dynamics needed to demonstrate regime shifts. We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.",

          "abstract": "Understanding both local and systemic immunity is essential to optimizing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. However, the dynamic alterations in systemic immunity during tumor development are yet to be clearly defined. Here, we identified a previously unrecognized connection that bridges the interaction between the spleen and tumor through erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), which suppress tumor immunity and promote tumor progression. We performed the single-cell RNA-seq and RNA-seq to demonstrate the presence of EPCs and identify the characteristic and an immunomodulatory role of EPCs during tumor progression. These tumor-hijacked EPCs proliferate in situ in spleens and impaired systemic and local antitumor response through the interaction between tumor and spleen. Specifically, the splenic CD45 − EPCs secreted heparin-binding growth factor to regulate PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression of splenic CD45 + EPCs. Educated CD45 + EPCs from the spleen then migrated to the tumors via the CCL5/CCR5 axis, thereby weakening local antitumor immunity. Consequently, targeting EPCs not only revitalized antitumor immunity but also improved the anti-PD-L1 effect by promoting intratumoral T cell infiltration. Importantly, CD45 + EPCs are associated with immunosuppression and reduced survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal the role of EPCs in orchestrating the interaction between the spleen and tumor, which could have significant implications for the development of more effective cancer immunotherapy.",

This study investigated the geochemical properties of Textularia agglutinans, a cosmopolitan agglutinated benthic species from the order Textulariida which has an exceptional inner calcareous test and is evolutionarily basal to Rotaliida. This study confirms the evolutionary link between textulariids and rotaliids based on their geochemistry and establishes T. agglutinans as a geochemical recorder of marine environments. Specimens from the Mediterranean coast of Israel were analyzed using laser ablation ICP-MS and compared to whole-test ICP-MS measurements of rotaliid and miliolid taxa from the same location. An Mg/Ca temperature calibration was established by LA-ICP-MS analyses of cultured specimens at 15, 17, 20, and 25 °C. Results show that T. agglutinans is a mid-Mg species (~19 to ~60 mmol/mol), with an Mg/Ca temperature correlation similar to high-Mg species. Its Pb, Zn, and Mn/Ca ratios are variable, generally overlapping with rotaliids and significantly lower than miliolids. Notably, T. agglutinans exhibits significantly higher Sr/Ca ratios (3.2 to 4.7 mmol/mol) compared to most foraminifera. Raman analyses reveal that the inner wall comprises a mix of aragonite and calcite, explaining these elevated Sr/Ca ratios. Rotaliida are the most prolific group of calcifying foraminifera. Our findings suggest that rotaliid tests evolved from an agglutinated textulariid ancestor with an inner aragonitic wall, a hypothesis that is further supported by the close phylogenetic relationship of the two groups.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R 2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R 2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.",

These experiments provide insight into the interplay of intramolecular coordinates along the reaction coordinate. However, a general theoretical foundation for analyzing, and even for explaining rigorously, these data is lacking. In this work, we study vibrational decoherence in a model VCET reaction using the nearly exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulation method. We explore how analyzing the density matrix with quantum information measures can help elucidate the evolution of vibrational coherence in simulations of dynamics. We examine how vibrational coherence is affected by electron transfer on the timescale of approximately 100 femtoseconds. Our results suggest that electron transfer, in the nonadiabatic model, changes the vibrational equilibrium position abruptly—an example of a “quantum quench” event. This explains the concomitant vibrational decoherence. We find that abrupt vibrational decoherence can be mitigated by wavepacket motion occurring on the timescale of the electron transfer.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 30% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) via accumulating gene mutations. Genomic analyses reveal a complex interplay among mutant genes, with co-occurring and mutually exclusive patterns. Hyperactivation of c-MYB and deficiency of PU.1 have been linked to myeloid disorders. We report a case of AML with concurrent PU.1 and c-MYB mutations, exhibiting early onset, high blast count, chemo-resistance, indicating high-risk features, along with elevated Pelger–Huët anomaly (PHA). However, the synergistic mechanism of c-MYB and PU.1 in sAML remains unclear. Using c-Myb-hyperactivation and Pu.1-deficient double-strain ( c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D ) zebrafish, we investigated MDS/sAML progression. Surprisingly, the double mutant exhibited a distinct type of neutrophil resembling clinical PHA cells and demonstrated a higher rate of MDS/sAML transformation. Further expression analysis revealed reduced lmnb1 expression in double-mutant zebrafish. Knockdown of lmnb1 resulted in PHA and increased blast cells, while overexpression of lmnb1 in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D reduced PHA cell level. This suggests that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency synergistically reduce lmnb1 expression, inducing the development of PHA-like neutrophils and promoting MDS/sAML progression in zebrafish. Moreover, coadministration of cell cycle inhibitor cytarabine (Ara-C) and the differential inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) could effectively relieve the neutrophil expansion and PHA symptoms in c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish. Our findings revealed that c-Myb hyperactivation and Pu.1 deficiency played a synergistic role in sAML development and suggests a phenotypic association between the emergence of PH-like cells and the transformation to sAML. Furthermore, c-myb hyper ;pu.1 G242D/G242D zebrafish might serve as a suitable sAML model for drug screening.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity in sensory cortex is modulated by behavioral and cognitive factors, and this modulation is thought to contribute to the selection of specific sensory information needed to achieve behavioral goals. In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.",

          "abstract": "The Huns appeared in Europe in the 370s, establishing an Empire that reshaped West Eurasian history. Yet until today their origins remain a matter of extensive debate. Traditional theories link them to the Xiongnu, the founders of the first nomadic empire of the Mongolian steppe. The Xiongnu empire dissolved, however, ~300 y before the Huns appeared in Europe, and there is little archaeological and historical evidence of Huns in the steppe during this time gap. Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.",

          "abstract": "The escalating demand for rare earth elements (REEs) highlights the necessity for their sustainable recovery from waste streams and secondary resources. However, this process requires materials with exceptional selectivity and capacity for REEs due to their low concentration and high presence of interfering ions. Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.",

The reflectors dip unidirectionally with inclinations in the range 6° to 20° and are imaged to a thickness of 10 to 35 m along an uninterrupted 1.3 km northward shoreline-perpendicular traverse. The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event.

To address this challenge, we investigate topological homochiral PdGa (TH PdGa) crystals with intrinsically chiral catalytic surfaces for ORR. Through spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we show that both structural chirality and spin–orbit coupling are critical for inducing spin polarization at the surface of TH PdGa. As a result, TH PdGa achieves a kinetic current density over 100 times higher than the achiral PdGa (AC PdGa) at 0.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.

          "abstract": "DNA is heterogeneously packaged into chromatin, which is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) with sharp boundaries. These boundary locations are critical for genome regulation. Here, we explore how the distribution of DNA-packing density across chromatin affects the TAD boundary locations. We develop a polymer-physics-based model that utilizes DNA accessibility data to parameterize DNA-packing density along chromosomes, treating them as heteropolymers, and simulates the stochastic folding of these heteropolymers within a nucleus to yield a conformation ensemble. Such an ensemble reproduces a subset (over 60%) of TAD boundaries across the human genome, as confirmed by Hi-C data. Additionally, it reproduces the spatial distance matrices of 2-Mb genomic regions provided by FISH experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that utilizing DNA accessibility data alone as input is sufficient to predict the emergence and disappearance of key TADs during early T cell differentiation. We show that stochastic folding of heteropolymers in a confined space can replicate both the prevalence of chromatin domain structures and the cell-to-cell variation in domain boundary positions observed in single-cell experiments. Furthermore, regions of lower DNA-packing density preferentially form domain boundaries, and this preference drives the emergence of TAD boundaries observed in ensemble-averaged Hi-C maps. The enrichment of TAD boundaries at CTCF binding sites can be attributed to the influence of CTCF binding on local DNA-packing density in our model. Collectively, our findings establish a strong link between TAD boundaries and regions of lower DNA-packing density, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying TAD formation.",

Here, we show that increased S-nitrosylation of CRTC1 (forming SNO-CRTC1), as seen in cell-based, animal-based, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebrocortical neuron-based AD models, disrupts its binding with CREB and diminishes the activity-dependent gene expression mediated by the CRTC1/CREB pathway.

Using CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, we mutated Cys216 to Ala in hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons bearing one allele of the APP Swe mutation (AD-hiPSC neurons). Introduction of this nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 mutant rescued defects in AD-hiPSC neurons, including decreased neurite length and increased neuronal cell death. Additionally, expression of nonnitrosylatable CRTC1 in vivo in the hippocampus rescued synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that formation of SNO-CRTC1 contributes to the pathogenesis of AD by attenuating the neuronal activity-dependent CREB transcriptional pathway, and suggests a therapeutic target for AD.",

          "abstract": "Mimicking hierarchical structures found in nature, such as nacre and tendon, has led to remarkable successes in the creation of biomimetic materials with exceptional properties. The depth of knowledge derived from nature extends far beyond mere trial-and-error fabrication by providing deep insights into the toughening mechanisms that are integral to natural materials. A key challenge is understanding how these toughening mechanisms can be effectively translated into biomimetic materials. Here, we characterize the multiscale mechanical behavior of tendon-like fibrous hydrogels, unraveling the intricate toughening mechanisms at play across multiple scales—from dynamic molecular interactions and nanoscale fibril sliding, to anisotropic microscale characteristics and macroscopic performance—using a combination of experimental and simulation approaches. Additionally, we address the open question of how hierarchical structures exhibit mechanical properties at different scales, demonstrating that hydrogels, fibrils, and chains take up successively lower levels of strain in a ratio of 11.5:3.2:2. This work establishes a comprehensive framework for exploring nature-inspired materials, marking a significant step forward in the advancement of biomimetic technology.",

          "abstract": "The experience of human parenthood is near ubiquitous and can profoundly alter one’s body, mind, and environment. However, we know very little about the long-term neural effects of parenthood for parents themselves, or the implications of pregnancy and caregiving experience on the aging adult brain. Here, we investigate the link between the number of children parented and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, such that higher number of children parented was associated with higher connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parenthood-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, such that the connections that were positively correlated with number of children were negatively correlated with age. This result suggests that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. Overall, these results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, altering aging trajectories, consistent with animal models of parenthood and preliminary findings of “younger-looking” brain structure in human parents. Observing this effect in both females and males implicates the caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, and highlights the importance of future work to disentangle the underlying mechanisms related to the direct impact of caregiving, the indirect impact of the environment, and the result of covarying sociodemographic factors.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material’s morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalizes puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.",

Through iterative structural and sequence homology-based mining starting with a guide RNA-interaction domain of Cas9, we identified a family of RNA-guided DNA-targeting proteins in phage and parasitic bacteria. Each system consists of a Tandem Interspaced Guide RNA (TIGR) array and a TIGR-associated (Tas) protein containing a Nop domain, sometimes fused to HNH (TasH) or RuvC (TasR) nuclease domains. We show that TIGR arrays are processed into 36-nt RNAs (tigRNAs) that direct sequence-specific DNA binding through a tandem-spacer targeting mechanism. TasR can be reprogrammed for precise DNA cleavage, including in human cells. The structure of TasR reveals striking similarities to box C/D snoRNPs and IS110 RNA-guided transposases, providing insights into the evolution of diverse RNA-guided systems.",

U-Pb dating indicates a basalt age of 2823.0 ± 5.9 Ma and a source 238 U/ 204 Pb ratio (μ-value) of 480 ± 56. This high μ-value indicates that the source contained materials that formed during late stages of lunar magma ocean (LMO) crystallization.

This is accomplished by establishing robust connections between water molecules and the polymer by using sulfuric acid. A sacrificial network is introduced to shield the prime polymer network from collapsing. Under the hydro-locking mode, an alginate-polyacrylamide double-network hydrogel remains soft and stretchable within a temperature range that spans from –115° to 143°C. The strategy works with a range of hydrogels and solutions and may enable the preservation and observation of materials or even living organisms at extreme temperatures.",

We circumvent this problem by focusing on the morphology of deglaciation and inception, which we show depends strongly on the relative phasing of precession versus obliquity. We demonstrate that although both parameters are important, precession has more influence on deglacial onset, whereas obliquity is more important for the attainment of peak interglacial conditions and glacial inception. We find that the set of precession peaks (minima) responsible for terminations since 0.9 million years ago is a subset of those peaks that begin (i.e., the precession parameter starts decreasing) while obliquity is increasing. Specifically, termination occurs with the first of these candidate peaks to occur after each eccentricity minimum. Thus, the gross morphology of 100-thousand-year (100-kyr) glacial cycles appears largely deterministic.",

Genetically impairing erucamide accumulation or exogenous application in Arabidopsis highlighted erucamide’s role in antibacterial immunity. Erucamide binds Hypersensitive response and conserved C (HrcC), a key T3SS component, to block injectisome assembly. Analyses of erucamide analogs and HrcC mutants indicated that the erucamide-HrcC binding is required for inhibiting T3SS in vitro and antibacterial resistance in plants, suggesting an essential role of erucamide-HrcC binding in disease resistance.

We found that self-peptide-specific Treg cells were dispensable for the control of Tconv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis.

Importantly, the Treg cell response to self-peptide did not impact protective Tconv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide.

          "abstract": "Maintaining glucose and lipid homeostasis is crucial for health, with dysregulation leading to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). This study identifies alkylation repair homolog protein 5 (ALKBH5), an RNA N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) demethylase, as a major regulator in metabolic disease. ALKBH5 is up-regulated in the liver during obesity and also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, causing its translocation to the cytosol. Hepatocyte-specific deletion of Alkbh5 reduces glucose and lipids by inhibiting the glucagon receptor (GCGR) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathways. Targeted knockdown of hepatic Alkbh5 reverses T2DM and MAFLD in diabetic mice, highlighting its therapeutic potential. This study unveils a regulatory mechanism wherein ALKBH5 orchestrates glucose and lipid homeostasis by integrating the GCGR and mTORC1 pathways, providing insight into the regulation of metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs) influence Earth’s climate by absorbing sunlight. However, the link between their evolving composition and their absorptive effects is unclear. We demonstrate that brown nitrogen (BrN), the absorptive nitrogenous component of OAs, dominates their global absorption. Using a global model, we quantified BrN abundance, tracked its optical evolution with chemical aging, and assessed its radiative absorption. BrN contributes 76% of OAs’ surface light absorption over the US and 61% of their global absorptive optical depth. Moreover, the observed variability of OAs’ absorptive capacity is primarily driven by the sources and aging of BrN. BrN represents 18% of the global absorptive direct radiative effect of carbonaceous aerosols, with biomass burning being the largest contributor. Our research establishes a nitrogen-centric framework for attributing the climate impacts of OAs.",

          "abstract": "Shape-anisotropic nanocrystals and patchy particles have been explored to construct complex superstructures, but most studies have focused on convex shapes. We report that nonconvex, dumbbell-shaped nanocrystals (nanodumbbells) exhibit globally interlocking self-assembly behaviors governed by curvature-guided depletion interactions. By tailoring the local curvature of nanodumbbells, we can precisely and flexibly adjust particle bonding directionality, a level of control rarely achievable with conventional convex building blocks. These nanodumbbells can undergo long-range ordered assembly into various intricate two-dimensional superlattices, including the chiral Kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Kagome lattice is a thermodynamically stable phase, with depletion interactions playing a crucial role in stabilizing these non–close-packed structures. The emergence of Kagome lattices and other unusual structures highlights the vast potential of nonconvex nanocrystals for creating sophisticated architectures.",

Transplutonium organometallics are rarely isolated and structurally characterized, likely owing to limited isotope inventories, a scarcity of suitable laboratory infrastructure, and intrinsic difficulties with the anaerobic conditions required. Herein, we report the discovery of an organometallic “berkelocene” complex prepared from 0.3 milligrams of berkelium-249. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction shows a tetravalent berkelium ion between two substituted cyclooctatetraene ligands, resulting in the formation of berkelium–carbon bonds. The coordination in berkelocene resembles that of uranocene, and calculations show that the berkelium 5f orbitals engage in covalent overlap with the δ-symmetry orbitals of the cyclooctatetraenide ligand π system. Charge transfer from the ligands is diminished relative to uranocene and other actinocenes, which maximizes contributions from the stable, half-filled 5f 7 configuration of tetravalent berkelium.",

          "abstract": "Collective motion, which is ubiquitous in nature, has traditionally been explained by “self-propelled particle” models from theoretical physics. Here we show, through field, lab, and virtual reality experimentation, that classical models of collective behavior cannot account for how collective motion emerges in marching desert locusts, whose swarms affect the livelihood of millions. In contrast to assumptions made by these models, locusts do not explicitly align with neighbors. While individuals respond to moving-dot stimuli through the optomotor response, this innate behavior does not mediate social response to neighbors. Instead, locust marching behavior, across scales, can be explained by a minimal cognitive framework, which incorporates individuals’ neural representation of bearings to neighbors and internal consensus dynamics for making directional choices. Our findings challenge long-held beliefs about how order can emerge from disorder in animal collectives.",

          "abstract": "Although the dynamics of collisions between a molecule and a solid surface are ultimately quantum mechanical, decohering effects owing to the large number of interacting degrees of freedom typically obscure the wavelike nature of these events. However, a partial decoupling of internal molecular motion from external degrees of freedom can reveal striking interference effects despite significant momentum exchange between the molecule and the bath of surface vibrations. We report state-prepared and state-resolved measurements of methane scattering from a room-temperature gold surface that demonstrate total destructive interference between molecular states related by a reflection symmetry operation. High-contrast interference effects prevail for all processes investigated, including vibrationally excited and vibrationally inelastic collisions. The results demonstrate the distinctly quantum mechanical effect of discrete symmetries in molecular collision dynamics.",

Although genome-wide data are routinely used for discordance-aware phylogenomic analyses, because of modeling and scalability limitations, the current practice leaves out large chunks of genomes. As more high-quality genomes become available, we urgently need discordance-aware methods to infer the tree directly from a multiple genome alignment. In this study, we introduce Coalescence-Aware Alignment-Based Species Tree Estimator (CASTER), a theoretically justified site-based method that eliminates the need to predefine recombination-free loci. CASTER is scalable to hundreds of mammalian whole genomes. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of CASTER in simulations that include recombination and apply CASTER to several biological datasets, showing that its per-site scores can reveal both biological and artifactual patterns of discordance across the genome.",

          "abstract": "Extreme heat is well-documented to adversely affect health and mortality, but its link to biological aging—a precursor of the morbidity and mortality process—remains unclear. This study examines the association between ambient outdoor heat and epigenetic aging in a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 56+ ( N = 3686). The number of heat days in neighborhoods is calculated using the heat index, covering time windows from the day of blood collection to 6 years prior. Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE. More heat days over short- and mid-term windows are associated with increased PCPhenoAge acceleration (e.g., B prior7-dayCaution+heat : 1.07 years). Longer-term heat is associated with all clocks (e.g., B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 2.48 years for PCPhenoAge, B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 1.09 year for PCGrimAge, and B prior6-yearExtremecaution+heat : 0.05 years for DunedinPACE). Subgroup analyses show no strong evidence for increased vulnerability by sociodemographic factors. These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings linking heat to aging-related morbidity and mortality risks.",

To model SCCOHTs, we have established eight patient-derived tumoroid lines from tumor lesions of three patients with SCCOHT. The tumoroids recapitulate genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the corresponding patient tumors and capture intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars. RNA sequencing demonstrated that methotrexate induced TP53 pathway activation and apoptosis.

          "abstract": "Transcription factor ubiquitination is a decisive regulator of growth and development. The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.",

          "abstract": "From fundamental studies of light-matter interaction to applications in quantum networking and sensing, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a toolbox to control interactions between atoms and photons. The coherence of interactions is determined by the single-pass atomic absorption and number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting 1 million roundtrips but with limited material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.",

In contrast, neurobiological circuits can function while simultaneously adapting to changing conditions. Here, we present a brain-inspired Super-Turing AI model based on a synaptic resistor circuit, capable of concurrent real-time inference and learning. Without any prior learning, a circuit of synaptic resistors integrating ferroelectric HfZrO materials was demonstrated to navigate a drone toward a target position while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment, exhibiting significantly superior learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability compared to computer-based artificial neural networks.

We directly observe that PS based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately −55 kHz. After accounting for this PS shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of 276,764,094,712.45 ± 0.86 kHz for the 2 3 S 1 − 2 3 P 0 transition. Combining this result with existing data for 3 He, we derive a value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, which shows a σ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.",

DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a conserved central regulator of dormancy cooperating with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) through negative regulation of ABA HYPERSENSITIVE GERMINATION (AHG) 1 and AHG3 phosphatases. The current molecular mechanism of DOG1 signaling proposes it regulates the activation of central ABA-related SnRK2 kinases. Here, we unveil DOG1’s functional autonomy from the regulation of ABA core signaling components and unravel its pivotal control over the activation of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE FIVE BINDING PROTEINs (AFPs). Our data revealed a molecular relay in which AFPs’ genuine activation by AHG1 is contained by DOG1 to prevent the breakdown of maturation-imposed ABA responses independently of ABA-related kinase activation status. This work offers a molecular understanding of how plants fine-tune germination timing, while preserving seed responsiveness to adverse environmental cues, and thus represents a milestone in the realm of conservation and breeding programs.",

We confirmed these findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model and further identified ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF’s major role in modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing to olfactory loss in CF.",

Corpuscles are composed of a mechanoreceptor afferent surrounded by lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), enclosed by a multilayered outer core. The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.",

Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal.

However, GBHs pose a threat to soil fungal community, although fungi can degrade and use glyphosate as a nutrient source. How fungi respond to GBHs remains enigmatic. Here, we found that, not as in plants, the commercial GBH Roundup does not target the 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the soil-derived fungus Trichoderma guizhouense , whereas it impairs fungal growth. We demonstrate that the herbicide adjuvant Triton CG-110 is more toxic to fungal cells than pure glyphosate. It limits nitrogen uptake, which induces the expression of proteinase YPS1 to catalyze the shedding of the MSB2 extracellular domain from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of the MAPK TMK1 pheromone pathway. The downstream B2H2-type transcription factor STE12 directly regulates ergosterol biosynthesis, affecting membrane fluidity and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that the pheromone pathway is implicated in ergosterol biosynthesis and plasma membrane integrity.",

Compromising Polα genetically induces the local replication-coupled histone incorporation pattern in progenitor cells to resemble that in stem cells, seen by both nuclear localization patterns and chromatin fibers. This is recapitulated using a Polα inhibitor in a concentration-dependent manner. The local old versus new histone asymmetry is comparable between stem cells and progenitor cells at both S phase and M phase. Together, these results indicate that developmentally programmed expression of key DNA replication components is important to shape stem cell chromatin.

Precisely triggered and patterned illumination enabled measuring R m and λ, which both were smallest at diastole. Pharmacological and depolarization-induced reduction of inwardly rectifying K + currents ( I K1 ), gap junction block, and cardiac infarction reduced I thr , showing the importance of high I K1 density and intact cardiomyocyte coupling for preventing arrhythmia initiation. Combining optogenetic current injection and computer simulations was used to classify pro- and anti-arrhythmic mechanisms based on their effects on R m and I thr and allowed to quantify I K1 inward rectification in the intact heart, identifying reduced I K1 rectification as anti-arrhythmic concept.",

We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers.

In the gliding bacterium, Mycoplasma mobile , a dimeric F 1 -like ATPase forms a chain structure within the cell, which is proposed to drive the gliding motility. However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. We determined the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the dimeric F 1 -like ATPase complex. The structure revealed an assembly distinct from those of dimeric F 1 F O -ATPases. The F 1 -like ATPase unit associated by two subunits GliD and GliE was named G 1 -ATPase as an R 1 domain of rotary ATPases. G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism. Overall, the cryo-EM structure provides insights into the mechanism through which G 1 -ATPase drives the Mycoplasma gliding motility.",

Projections of how those hazards will change are affected by uncertainties in the climate sensitivity of climate models, among other factors. While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.",

However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers.

In Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba leaves, FLS2 density was high in the epidermis and vascular parenchyma, low in mesophyll, and absent in sieve elements (SEs). Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility of Atseor1/2 mutants to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants.",

Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability.

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.",

Perovskites have superior optoelectronic properties and structural diversity, making them ideal candidates for high-performing direct full-stokes polarimetry. However, perovskite suffers low chiroptical activity due to inefficient chiral transfer, which greatly limits its circular-polarization-vector discrimination. These issues urgently require remedy. Here, we demonstrate that perovskites’ chiroptical activity is highly related to their structural chiral-distortion extent. We propose using halide mixing to construct asymmetric chiral transfer to heighten its structural chiral-distortion extent. Accordingly, we report a 16-fold increment in the optical chiroptical activity. Further ab initio calculations verify that the enhancement is due to the strengthened magnetic transition dipole in mixed-halide structures. We herein report a self-powered, direct full-Stokes polarimetry with a high detectivity up to 1.2 × 10 12 Jones and low detection errors (Δ S 1–3 ≤ 5.0%).

We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.",

This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity.

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in quantum technologies have highlighted the importance of mitigating system imperfections, including parameter uncertainties and decoherence effects, to improve the performance of experimental platforms. However, most of the previous efforts in quantum control are devoted to the realization of arbitrary unitary operations in a closed quantum system. Here, we improve the algorithm that suppresses system imperfections and noises, providing notably enhanced scalability for robust and optimal control of open quantum systems. Through experimental validation in a superconducting quantum circuit, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms its conventional counterpart for closed quantum systems with an ultralow infidelity of about 0.60%, while the complexity of this algorithm exhibits the same scaling, with only a modest increase in the prefactor. This work represents a notable advancement in quantum optimal control techniques, paving the way for realizing quantum-enhanced technologies in practical applications.",

The macaque is a fundamental model organism in neuroscience, but the translational potential of macaque gene expression rests on the assumption that it is a good proxy for patterns of corresponding proteins (vertical translation) and for patterns of orthologous human genes (horizontal translation). Here, we systematically benchmark regional gene expression in macaque cortex against (i) macaque cortical receptor density and in vivo and ex vivo microstructure and (ii) human cortical gene expression. We find moderate cortex-wide correspondence between macaque gene expression and protein density, which improves by considering layer-specific gene expression. Half of the examined genes exhibit significant correlation between macaque and human across the cortex. Interspecies correspondence of gene expression is greater in unimodal than in transmodal cortex, recapitulating evolutionary cortical expansion and gene-protein correspondence in the macaque. These results showcase the potential and limitations of macaque cortical transcriptomics for translational discovery within and across species.",

We also identified BtMEDOR6 as a key whitefly olfactory receptor of β-myrcene involved in the distinct preference of B. tabaci MED for TYLCV-infected plants. TYLCV inhibits the expression of BtMEDOR6, canceling this preference and thereby facilitating TYLCV transmission to uninfected plants. Greenhouse experiments corroborated the role of β-myrcene in whitefly attraction.

The present work addresses the 13 C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize 13 C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the 13 C relaxation ( T 1 ) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Adjustments to the dynamical nuclear polarization sequence (PulsePol) are performed, as well as slow sample rotation, to improve the NV- 13 C polarization transfer rate. The hyperpolarized 13 C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2-micrometer and 100-nanometer median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29-tesla magnetic field) of 1500 and 940, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the fundamentals of applying a solid-state electrolyte (SSE), typically used in battery technologies, as a membrane material for aqueous lithium extraction. We find that the anhydrous hopping of lithium ions through the ordered and confined SSE lattice is highly distinct from ion migration through the hydrated free volumes of conventional nanoporous membranes, thus culminating in unique membrane transport properties. Notably, we reveal that the SSE provides unparalleled performance with respect to ion-ion selectivity, consistently demonstrating lithium ion selectivity values that are immeasurable by even the part-per-billion detection limit of mass spectrometry. Such exceptional selectivity is shown to be the result of the characteristic size and charge exclusion mechanisms of solid-state ion transport, which may be leveraged in the design of next-generation membranes for resource recovery.",

Here, we realized the entangled antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with diazahexabenzocoronene oligomers (up to 7 units) on Au(111). Extensive low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory and many-body calculations show that even-numbered spin chains host a collective state with gapped excitations, while odd-numbered chains feature a Kondo excitation. We found that a given antiferromagnetic coupling J value between first neighbors in the entangled quantum states is responsible for the quantum phenomena, strongly relating to their parities of the chain.

Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated, phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser 65 . Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain inhibitors. Furthermore, the observed accrual of PINK1 cannot be completely accounted for without an accompanying increase in biosynthesis. We have used a ubiquitylation inhibitor TAK-243 to accumulate cleaved PINK1. Under these conditions, generation of unconjugated “free” phospho-ubiquitin serves as a proxy readout for PINK1 activity. This has enabled us to find a preconditioning phenomenon, whereby an initial depolarizing treatment leaves a residual pool of active PINK1 that remains competent to seed the activation of nascent cleaved PINK1 following a 16-hour recovery period.",

Here, high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy revealed how two clinically relevant inhibitors block CDK7 function. In cells, CDK7 inhibition rapidly suppressed transcription, but constitutively active genes were disproportionately affected versus stimulus-responsive. Distinct transcription factors (TFs) regulate constitutive versus stimulus-responsive genes. Accordingly, stimulus-responsive TFs were refractory to CDK7 inhibition whereas constitutively active “core” TFs were repressed. Core TFs (n = 78) are predominantly promoter associated and control cell cycle and proliferative gene expression programs across cell types. Mechanistically, rapid suppression of core TF function can occur through CDK7-dependent phosphorylation changes in core TFs and RB1. Moreover, CDK7 inhibition depleted core TF protein levels within hours, consistent with durable target gene suppression. Thus, a major but unappreciated biological function for CDK7 is regulation of a TF cohort that drives proliferation, revealing an apparent universal mechanism by which CDK7 coordinates RNAPII transcription with cell cycle CDK regulation.",

However, the neural mechanisms mediating these effects and the role of endogenous central GLP-1 signaling in cocaine seeking remain unknown. Here, we show that voluntary cocaine taking decreased plasma GLP-1 levels in rats and that chemogenetic activation of GLP-1–producing neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius that project to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) decreased cocaine seeking. Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons. Together, these findings suggest that targeting central GLP-1 circuits may be an effective strategy toward reducing cocaine relapse and highlight a functional role of GABAergic GLP-1R–expressing midbrain neurons in drug seeking.",

Our results present evidence for localized, anisotropic structures with a near-zero Poisson’s ratio in the medium surrounding 1 to 2 kilometer–sized earthquake clusters, suggesting that the fault medium is damaged, foliated, and enriched with fluid. Such localized structures may cause stress perturbations on faults that in turn favor the frequent occurrence of deep interplate earthquakes at depths of 60 to 70 kilometers.

Here, we further demonstrate the synchroneity between OJN volcanism and OAE1a by refining the chronology of Pacific volcanogenic sedimentary records on Magellan Rise, nearby OJN, with detailed osmium and carbon isotopic stratigraphy. Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a.

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader. Here, using electron spin resonance, we identify the specific absorption mode in a multiferroic material Sr 2 CoSi 2 O 7 with the spontaneous magnon decay accompanied by the maximum interference, achieving the broadband one-way transparency.",

These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes.

In the long-wavelength IR (8 to 14 μm) region, near-unity emissivity was successfully achieved by 100-μm-deep metal microcavities with ultralow structural aspect ratios, facilitated by laser-textured multiscale surface morphologies that substantially enhance the light-trapping capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that microcavity-based patterns can produce local emissivity, tunable radiative intensity gradients, wide-angle feasibility, and high-temperature resistance, thereby enabling diverse applications in thermal IR displays such as thermal illusion, IR encryption, and grayscale thermal imaging.

We show that the auxin derivative 5-phenyl-indole-3-acetic acid is well tolerated over 2 weeks and drives near-complete CEP192 degradation in less than 1 hour in vivo. CEP192 loss did not affect centriole duplication but decreased γ-tubulin recruitment to centrosomes impairing mitotic spindle assembly.

          "abstract": "In acetylcholine receptor (AChR)–seropositive myasthenia gravis (MG), anti-AChR autoantibodies impair neuromuscular transmission and cause severe muscle weakness. MG therapies broadly suppress immune function, risking infections. We designed a chimeric autoantibody receptor (CAAR) expressing the 210–amino acid extracellular domain of the AChR α subunit (A210) linked to CD137-CD3ζ cytoplasmic domains to direct T cell cytotoxicity against anti-AChRα B cells. A210-CAART incorporating a CD8α transmembrane domain (TMD8α) showed functional but unstable surface expression, partially restored by inhibiting lysosomal degradation. A210-CAART with a CD28 TMD showed sustained surface expression, independent of TMD dimerization motifs. In a mouse xenograft model, A210.TMD8α-CAART demonstrated early control of anti-AChR B cell outgrowth but subsequent rebound and loss of surface CAAR expression, whereas A210.TMD28-CAART induced sustained surface CAAR expression and target cell elimination. This study demonstrates the importance of the CD28 TMD for CAAR stability and in vivo function, laying the groundwork for future development of precision cellular immunotherapy for AChR-MG.",

          "abstract": "Cold-atom magnetometers can achieve an exceptional combination of superior sensitivity and high spatial resolution. One key challenge that these quantum sensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while preserving a high dynamic range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an adaptive entanglement-free cold-atom magnetometry with both superior sensitivity and high dynamic range. Using a tailored adaptive Bayesian quantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent population trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive high-precision detection of a dc magnetic field with high dynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey interferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum limit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of 6.8 ± 0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla, exceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3 ± 0.1 decibels. Our study opens avenues for the next generation of adaptive cold-atom quantum sensors, wherein real-time measurement history is leveraged to improve their performance.",

          "abstract": "Earth’s energy budget is sensitive to the spatial distribution of sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration (SIC) change, but the global radiative effect of changes in SIC spatial distribution has not been quantified. We show that SIC-induced radiation anomalies at the top of the atmosphere are sensitive to the location of SIC reduction in each season, which qualitatively explains how and why the effect of sea ice loss on Earth’s energy budget is determined by its spatial pattern. Idealized experiments indicate that SIC-induced surface warming is greater in the Arctic regions, resulting in a more negative Planck feedback. Global low-level cloud cover responses to Arctic and Antarctic SIC reduction are also distinct, leading to more negative SIC-cloud feedback in Arctic regions. SIC-induced albedo feedback is sensitive to latitude due to inhomogeneous solar radiation at the surface. As a result, the simulated radiative effect of SIC anomalies during 1980–2019 is dominated by variations in the spatial pattern of SIC.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine vital for CD8 + T cell activation and proliferation, holding great potential for cancer immunotherapy. Nevertheless, inherent shortcomings of short half-life, activation of regulatory T (T reg ) cells, and systemic toxicity limit its application. To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "During meiosis, the parental chromosomes are drawn together to enable exchange of genetic information. Chromosomes are aligned through the assembly of a conserved interface, the synaptonemal complex, composed of a central region that forms between two parallel chromosomal backbones called axes. Here, we identify the axis-central region interface in C. elegans , containing a conserved positive patch on the axis component HIM-3 and the negative C terminus of the central region protein SYP-5. Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption. More broadly, our data show that condensation drives tightly regulated nuclear reorganization during sexual reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Site-2 proteases (S2Ps), conserved intramembrane metalloproteases that maintain cellular homeostasis, are associated with chronic infection and persistence leading to multidrug resistance in bacterial pathogens. A structural model of how S2Ps discriminate and accommodate substrates could help us develop selective antimicrobial agents. We previously proposed that the Escherichia coli S2P RseP unwinds helical substrate segments before cleavage, but the mechanism for accommodating a full-length membrane-spanning substrate remained unclear. Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane. Our results suggest that the substrate accommodation by threading through a conserved membrane-associated region stabilizes the substrate-complex and contributes to substrate discrimination on the membrane.",

          "abstract": "Anisotropic heat–conducting materials play crucial roles in designing electronic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric devices, where temperature and thermal stress are important. Despite substantial research efforts, a major obstacle to determining the anisotropic thermal diffusivity tensor in polycrystalline systems is the need for a robust, direct, and nondestructive technique to distinguish between distinct thermal diffusivities. Here, we demonstrate a conceptually unique thermal diffusivity microscope capable of performing high-resolution local measurements of anisotropic thermal diffusivity. The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation. It measures anisotropic thermal diffusivity based on thermal delay from a single heater. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that the anisotropy of the measured thermal diffusivity correlates excellently with the crystallographic direction of prototypical Bi 2 Te 3 . The anisotropic heat transport shows that the lattice contribution dominates the heat transport for both in- and out-of-plane directions.",
