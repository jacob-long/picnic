          "abstract": "To survive in dynamic environments with uncertain resources, animals must adapt their behaviour flexibly, choosing strategies such as persevering with a current choice, exploring alternatives or disengaging altogether. Previous studies have mainly investigated how forebrain regions represent choice costs and values as well as optimal strategies during such decisions 1–5 . However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain implements alternative behavioural strategies such as persevering, exploring or disengaging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a neural hub that is critical for flexible switching between behavioural strategies, the median raphe nucleus (MRN). Using cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations, fibre photometry and circuit tracing in mice performing diverse instinctive and learnt behaviours, we found that the main cell types of the MRN—GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-expressing), glutamatergic (VGluT2 + ) and serotonergic neurons—have complementary functions and regulate perseverance, exploration and disengagement, respectively. Suppression of MRN GABAergic neurons—for instance, through inhibitory input from lateral hypothalamus, which conveys strong positive valence to the MRN—leads to perseverative behaviour. By contrast, activation of MRN VGluT2 + neurons drives exploration. Activity of serotonergic MRN neurons is necessary for general task engagement. Input from the lateral habenula that conveys negative valence suppresses serotonergic MRN neurons, leading to disengagement. These findings establish the MRN as a central behavioural switchboard that is uniquely positioned to flexibly control behavioural strategies. These circuits thus may also have an important role in the aetiology of major mental pathologies such as depressive or obsessive-compulsive disorders.",

          "abstract": "As the body’s primary source of energy, the maintenance of blood glucose is indispensable for overall health and metabolic homeostasis. It is predominantly regulated by the glucagon receptor family which is highly conserved in vertebrates1–4. Compared to other vertebrates, avian blood glucose levels are relatively high5,6, yet its regulatory mechanisms have remained obscure for more than a century. We show that high hepatic expression of the avian glucagon receptor (GCGR) in association with constitutively active Gs signaling was dependent upon the interaction of different domains. In vivo experiments focusing on the regulation of constitutively active GCGR expression in hepatic cells led to correspondingly high blood glucose, rapid hepatic lipid utilization and high metabolic rates via downstream signaling pathway activation in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Furthermore, we identified a point mutation in chicken at the proximal gene region that resulted in GCGR mRNA reduction and weight increase. Overexpressing a natural human GCGR mutation (hsGCGRH339R) with modest constitutive activity in mice, demonstrated that high level expression of this variant augmented high blood glucose, while reducing body weight. The combination of high expression and constitutive activity of the glucagon receptor may have contributed to the evolution of flight in the ancestors of birds.",

          "abstract": "For decades, antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex class I for T cell-mediated immunity has been considered the primary function of proteasome-derived peptides1,2. However, whether the products of proteasomal degradation play additional parts in mounting immune responses remains unknown. Antimicrobial peptides serve as a first line of defence against invading pathogens before the adaptive immune system responds. Although the protective function of antimicrobial peptides across numerous tissues is well established, the cellular mechanisms underlying their generation are not fully understood. Here we uncover a role for proteasomes in the constitutive and bacterial-induced generation of defence peptides that impede bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo by disrupting bacterial membranes. In silico prediction of proteome-wide proteasomal cleavage identified hundreds of thousands of potential proteasome-derived defence peptides with cationic properties that may be generated en route to degradation to act as a first line of defence. Furthermore, bacterial infection induces changes in proteasome composition and function, including PSME3 recruitment and increased tryptic-like cleavage, enhancing antimicrobial activity. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into the role of proteasomes in cell-autonomous innate immunity, our study suggests that proteasome-cleaved peptides may have previously overlooked functions downstream of degradation. From a translational standpoint, identifying proteasome-derived defence peptides could provide an untapped source of natural antibiotics for biotechnological applications and therapeutic interventions in infectious diseases and immunocompromised conditions.",

          "abstract": "More than ten ergot alkaloids comprising both natural and semi-synthetic products are used to treat various diseases1,2. The central C ring forms the core pharmacophore for ergot alkaloids, giving them structural similarity to neurotransmitters, thus enabling their modulation of neurotransmitter receptors3. The haem catalase chanoclavine synthase (EasC) catalyses the construction of this ring through complex radical oxidative cyclization4. Unlike canonical catalases, which catalyse H2O2 disproportionation5,6, EasC and its homologues represent a broader class of catalases that catalyse O2-dependent radical reactions4,7. We have elucidated the structure of EasC by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH)-binding pocket and a haem pocket common to all haem catalases, with a unique homodimeric architecture that is, to our knowledge, previously unobserved. The substrate prechanoclavine unprecedentedly binds in the NADPH-binding pocket, instead of the previously suspected haem-binding pocket, and two pockets were connected by a slender tunnel. Contrary to the established mechanisms, EasC uses superoxide rather than the more generally used transient haem iron–oxygen complexes (such as compounds I, II and III)8,9, to mediate substrate transformation through superoxide-mediated cooperative catalysis of the two distant pockets. We propose that this reactive oxygen species mechanism could be widespread in metalloenzyme-catalysed reactions.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics1,2,3,4,5,6. Experimental efforts so far have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials—typically amorphous metals—and semiconducting quantum Hall7,8,9,10,11 or quantum anomalous Hall12,13 systems. However, the strong interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes14,15,16,17. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials in which the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling ν = −1 as well as a superconducting state at ν ≈ −3.5 at zero magnetic field. Gate voltage can also be used to actuate non-volatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state18, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further show a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at ν = 2/3 (ref. 19)—also stable at zero magnetic field—enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers20,21,22, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket20,21,22,23,24, while leaving the topology of the ν = −1 quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low disorder limit.",

Floating point (FP) computation provides precision exceeding that of integer (INT) formats at the cost of higher power and storage overhead. Multi-level-cell (MLC) memristor compute-in-memory (CIM)13,14,15 provides compact non-volatile storage and energy-efficient computation but is prone to accuracy loss owing to process variation. Digital static random-access memory (SRAM)-CIM16,17,18,19,20,21,22 enables lossless computation; however, storage is low as a result of large bit-cell area and model loading is required during inference. Thus, conventional approaches using homogeneous CIM architectures and computation formats impose a trade-off between efficiency, storage, wakeup latency and inference accuracy. Here we present a mixed-precision heterogeneous CIM AI edge processor, which supports the layer-granular/kernel-granular partitioning of network layers among on-chip CIM architectures (that is, memristor-CIM, SRAM-CIM and tiny-digital units) and computation number formats (INT and FP) based on sensitivity to error. This layer-granular/kernel-granular flexibility allows simultaneous optimization within the two-dimensional design space at the hardware level. The proposed hardware achieved high energy efficiency (40.91 TFLOPS W−1 for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and 28.63 TFLOPS W−1 for MobileNet-v2 with ImageNet), low accuracy degradation (<0.45% for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-100 and for MobilNet-v2 with ImageNet) and rapid wakeup-to-response time (373.52 μs).",

          "abstract": "Pan-genomics and genome-editing technologies are revolutionizing breeding of global crops 1,2 . A transformative opportunity lies in exchanging genotype-to-phenotype knowledge between major crops (that is, those cultivated globally) and indigenous crops (that is, those locally cultivated within a circumscribed area) 3–5 to enhance our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desirable natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between related crops 6,7 . Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum 8 and integrating functional genomics and pan-genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralogue diversification are major obstacles to genotype-to-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, thousands of gene duplications, particularly within key domestication gene families, exhibited dynamic trajectories in sequence, expression and function. By augmenting our pan-genome with African eggplant cultivars 9 and applying quantitative genetics and genome editing, we dissected an intricate history of paralogue evolution affecting fruit size. The loss of a redundant paralogue of the classical fruit size regulator CLAVATA3 ( CLV3 ) 10,11 was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy, followed by a large cultivar-specific deletion, created a single fused CLV3 allele that modulates fruit organ number alongside an enzymatic gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralogue diversifications over short timescales are underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability. Exposing and navigating these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across species.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian behaviour and physiology undergo major changes in early life. Young animals rely on conspecifics to meet their needs and start showing nutritional independence and sex-specific social interactions at weaning and puberty, respectively. How neuronal populations regulating homeostatic functions and social behaviours develop during these transitions remains unclear. We used paired transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to examine the developmental trajectories of neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic region, where cell types with key roles in physiological and behavioural control have been identified 1–6 . These data show a marked diversity of developmental trajectories shaped by the sex of the animal, and the location and behavioural or physiological function of the corresponding cell types. We identify key stages of preoptic development, including early diversification, perinatal emergence of sex differences, postnatal maturation and refinement of signalling networks, and nonlinear transcriptional changes accelerating at the time of weaning and puberty. We assessed preoptic development in various sensory mutants and find a major role for vomeronasal sensing in the timing of preoptic cell type maturation. These results provide new insights into the development of neurons controlling homeostatic functions and social behaviours and lay ground for examining the dynamics of these functions in early life.",

However, in most Earth System Models, the diverse and heterogeneous tropical forest biome is represented as a largely uniform ecosystem with either a singular or a small number of fixed canopy ecophysiological properties 3 . This situation arises, in part, from a lack of understanding about how and why the functional properties of tropical forest canopies vary geographically 4 . Here, by combining field-collected data from more than 1,800 vegetation plots and tree traits with satellite remote-sensing, terrain, climate and soil data, we predict variation across 13 morphological, structural and chemical functional traits of trees, and use this to compute and map the functional diversity of tropical forests. Our findings reveal that the tropical Americas, Africa and Asia tend to occupy different portions of the total functional trait space available across tropical forests. Tropical American forests are predicted to have 40% greater functional richness than tropical African and Asian forests. Meanwhile, African forests have the highest functional divergence—32% and 7% higher than that of tropical American and Asian forests, respectively. An uncertainty analysis highlights priority regions for further data collection, which would refine and improve these maps. Our predictions represent a ground-based and remotely enabled global analysis of how and why the functional traits of tropical forest canopies vary across space.",

Conversely, osseous technologies are apparently exclusive of later hominins from approximately 2 million years ago (Ma)3,4, whereas the earliest systematic production of bone tools is currently restricted to European Acheulean sites 400–250 thousand years ago5,6. Here we document an assemblage of bone tools shaped by knapping found within a single stratigraphic horizon at Olduvai Gorge dated to 1.5 Ma. Large mammal limb bone fragments, mostly from hippopotamus and elephant, were shaped to produce various tools, including massive elongated implements. Before our discovery, bone artefact production in pre-Middle Stone Age African contexts was widely considered as episodic, expedient and unrepresentative of early Homo toolkits. However, our results demonstrate that at the transition between the Oldowan and the early Acheulean, East African hominins developed an original cultural innovation that entailed a transfer and adaptation of knapping skills from stone to bone. By producing technologically and morphologically standardized bone tools, early Acheulean toolmakers unravelled technological repertoires that were previously thought to have appeared routinely more than 1 million years later.",

This is primarily because knowledge of thermal tolerance is taxonomically and geographically biased 3 , compromising global climate vulnerability assessments. Here we used a phylogenetically informed data-imputation approach to predict the heat tolerance of 60% of amphibian species and assessed their vulnerability to daily temperature variations in thermal refugia. We found that 104 out of 5,203 species (2%) are currently exposed to overheating events in shaded terrestrial conditions. Despite accounting for heat-tolerance plasticity, a 4 °C global temperature increase would create a step change in impact severity, pushing 7.5% of species beyond their physiological limits. In the Southern Hemisphere, tropical species encounter disproportionally more overheating events, while non-tropical species are more susceptible in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings challenge evidence for a general latitudinal gradient in overheating risk 4–6 and underscore the importance of considering climatic variability in vulnerability assessments. We provide conservative estimates assuming access to cool shaded microenvironments. Thus, the impacts of global warming will probably exceed our projections. Our microclimate-explicit analyses demonstrate that vegetation and water bodies are critical in buffering amphibians during heat waves. Immediate action is needed to preserve and manage these microhabitat features.",

          "abstract": "The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) governs the entry of pyruvate—a central metabolite that bridges cytosolic glycolysis with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation—into the mitochondrial matrix1,2,3,4,5. It thus serves as a pivotal metabolic gatekeeper and has fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. Moreover, MPC is a key target for drugs aimed at managing diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and neurodegenerative diseases4,5,6. However, despite MPC’s critical roles in both physiology and medicine, the molecular mechanisms underlying its transport function and how it is inhibited by drugs have remained largely unclear. Here our structural findings on human MPC define the architecture of this vital transporter, delineate its substrate-binding site and translocation pathway, and reveal its major conformational states. Furthermore, we explain the binding and inhibition mechanisms of MPC inhibitors. Our findings provide the molecular basis for understanding MPC’s function and pave the way for the development of more-effective therapeutic reagents that target MPC.",

          "abstract": "Tropical deforestation was found to cause large reductions in precipitation using a range of observation-based datasets1. However, the limitations of satellite-based space-for-time statistical analysis have hindered understanding of the roles of reshaped mesoscale atmospheric circulation and regional precipitation recycling at different scales. These effects are considered nonlocal effects, which are distinct from the local effects governed by deforestation-induced reductions in evapotranspiration (ET). Here we show reversed precipitation responses to Amazon deforestation across wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, deforested grids experienced a noteworthy increase in precipitation (0.96 mm month−1 per percentage point forest loss), primarily attributed to enhanced mesoscale atmospheric circulation (that is, nonlocal effect). These nonlocal increases weaken with distance from deforested grids, leading to significant precipitation reductions in buffers beyond 60 km. Conversely, during the dry season, precipitation decreases in deforested grids and throughout all analysis buffers, with local effects from reduced ET dominating. Our findings highlight the intricate balance between local effects and nonlocal effects in driving deforestation–precipitation responses across different seasons and scales and emphasize the urgent need to address the rapid and extensive loss of forest in the Amazon region.",

          "abstract": "Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive strategy for producing green hydrogen1,2,3,4,5. However, direct seawater electrolysis faces many challenges, primarily arising from corrosion and competing reactions at the anode caused by the abundance of halide ions (Cl−, Br−) in seawater6. Previous studies3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 on seawater electrolysis have mainly focused on the anode development, because the cathode operates at reducing potentials, which is not subject to electrode dissolution or chloride corrosion reactions during seawater electrolysis11,15. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent, variable and random, which cause frequent start–shutdown operations if renewable electricity is used to drive seawater electrolysis. Here we first unveil dynamic evolution and degradation of seawater splitting cathode in intermittent electrolysis and, accordingly, propose construction of a catalyst’s passivation layer to maintain the hydrogen evolution performance during operation. An in situ-formed phosphate passivation layer on the surface of NiCoP–Cr2O3 cathode can effectively protect metal active sites against oxidation during frequent discharge processes and repel halide ion adsorption on the cathode during shutdown conditions. We demonstrate that electrodes optimized using this design strategy can withstand fluctuating operation at 0.5 A cm−2 for 10,000 h in alkaline seawater, with a voltage increase rate of only 0.5% khr−1. The newly discovered challenge and our proposed strategy herein offer new insights to facilitate the development of practical seawater splitting technologies powered by renewable electricity.",

          "abstract": "A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter in which its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organization. The existence of the supersolid phase of matter was speculated more than 50 years ago1,2,3,4. However, only recently has there been convincing experimental evidence, mainly using ultracold atomic Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) coupled to electromagnetic fields. There, various guises of the supersolid were created using atoms coupled to high-finesse cavities5,6, with large magnetic dipole moments7,8,9,10,11,12,13, and spin–orbit-coupled, two-component systems showing stripe phases14,15,16. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium context based on exciton–polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound state in the continuum (BiC) with exceptionally low losses, realized in a photonic-crystal waveguide. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a precision of several parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to also measure the local coherence of the supersolid. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.",

Metastasizing cancer cells are uniquely vulnerable to immune attack, as they are initially deprived of the immunosuppressive microenvironment found within established tumours 3 . There is interest in therapeutically exploiting this immune vulnerability to prevent recurrence in patients with early cancer at risk of metastasis. Here we show that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), including aspirin, enhance immunity to cancer metastasis by releasing T cells from suppression by platelet-derived thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). TXA 2 acts on T cells to trigger an immunosuppressive pathway that is dependent on the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, suppressing T cell receptor-driven kinase signalling, proliferation and effector functions. T cell-specific conditional deletion of Arhgef1 in mice increases T cell activation at the metastatic site, provoking immune-mediated rejection of lung and liver metastases. Consequently, restricting the availability of TXA 2 using aspirin, selective COX-1 inhibitors or platelet-specific deletion of COX-1 reduces the rate of metastasis in a manner that is dependent on T cell-intrinsic expression of ARHGEF1 and signalling by TXA 2 in vivo. These findings reveal a novel immunosuppressive pathway that limits T cell immunity to cancer metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin and paving the way for more effective anti-metastatic immunotherapies.",

However, given the instability of newly formed polyploid genomes5,6,7, understanding how WGDs arise in a population, persist, and underpin adaptations remains a challenge. Here, using our ongoing Multicellularity Long Term Evolution Experiment (MuLTEE)8, we show that diploid snowflake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) under selection for larger multicellular size rapidly evolve to be tetraploid. From their origin within the first 50 days of the experiment, tetraploids persisted for the next 950 days (nearly 5,000 generations, the current leading edge of our experiment) in 10 replicate populations, despite being genomically unstable. Using synthetic reconstruction, biophysical modelling and counter-selection, we found that tetraploidy evolved because it confers immediate fitness benefits under this selection, by producing larger, longer cells that yield larger clusters. The same selective benefit also maintained tetraploidy over long evolutionary timescales, inhibiting the reversion to diploidy that is typically seen in laboratory evolution experiments. Once established, tetraploidy facilitated novel genetic routes for adaptation, having a key role in the evolution of macroscopic multicellular size via the origin of evolutionarily conserved aneuploidy. These results provide unique empirical insights into the evolutionary dynamics and impacts of WGD, showing how it can initially arise due to its immediate adaptive benefits, be maintained by selection and fuel long-term innovations by creating additional dimensions of heritable genetic variation.",

Here we use pairs of identical sequences to characterize fine-scale transmission patterns using 114,298 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected through Washington State (USA) genomic sentinel surveillance with associated age and residence location information between March 2021 and December 2022. This corresponds to 59,660 sequences with another identical sequence in the dataset. We find that the location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postcodes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities. We find that transmission patterns between age groups vary across spatial scales. Finally, we use the timing of sequence collection to understand the age groups driving transmission. Overall, this study improves our ability to use large pathogen genome datasets to understand the determinants of infectious disease spread.",

Although extensively characterized using the laboratory mouse, little is known about clonal selection and population dynamics of the haematopoietic stem cell pool during murine ageing. We isolated stem cells and progenitors from young and old mice, identifying 221,890 somatic mutations genome-wide in 1,845 single-cell-derived colonies. Mouse stem cells and progenitors accrue approximately 45 somatic mutations per year, a rate only approximately threefold greater than human progenitors despite the vastly different organismal sizes and lifespans. Phylogenetic patterns show that stem and multipotent progenitor cell pools are established during embryogenesis, after which they independently self-renew in parallel over life, evenly contributing to differentiated progenitors and peripheral blood. The stem cell pool grows steadily over the mouse lifespan to about 70,000 cells, self-renewing about every 6 weeks. Aged mice did not display the profound loss of clonal diversity characteristic of human haematopoietic ageing. However, targeted sequencing showed small, expanded clones in the context of murine ageing, which were larger and more numerous following haematological perturbations, exhibiting a selection landscape similar to humans. Our data illustrate both conserved features of population dynamics of blood and distinct patterns of age-associated somatic evolution in the short-lived mouse.",

Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) is a promising non-opioid target for pain relief, but its clinical use has been limited by centrally mediated psychoactivity and tolerance. We overcame both issues by designing peripherally restricted CB1 agonists that minimize arrestin recruitment. We achieved these goals by computationally designing positively charged derivatives of the potent CB1 agonist MDMB-Fubinaca2. We designed these ligands to occupy a cryptic pocket identified through molecular dynamics simulations—an extended binding pocket that opens rarely and leads to the conserved signalling residue D2.50 (ref. 3). We used structure determination, pharmacological assays and molecular dynamics simulations to verify the binding modes of these ligands and to determine the molecular mechanism by which they achieve this dampening of arrestin recruitment. Our lead ligand, VIP36, is highly peripherally restricted and demonstrates notable efficacy in three mouse pain models, with 100-fold dose separation between analgesic efficacy and centrally mediated side effects. VIP36 exerts analgesic efficacy through peripheral CB1 receptors and shows limited analgesic tolerance. These results show how targeting a cryptic pocket in a G-protein-coupled receptor can lead to enhanced peripheral selectivity, biased signalling, desired in vivo pharmacology and reduced adverse effects. This has substantial implications for chronic pain treatment but could also revolutionize the design of drugs targeting other G-protein-coupled receptors.",

It mediates transcriptional reprogramming by a well-established canonical signalling mechanism. TIR1/AFB auxin receptors are F-box subunits of an ubiquitin ligase complex; after auxin perception, they associate with Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors and ubiquitinate them for degradation, thus enabling the activation of auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factors 1–3 . Here we revise this paradigm by showing that without TIR1 adenylate cyclase (AC) activity 4 , auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs is not sufficient to mediate the transcriptional auxin response. Abolishing the TIR1 AC activity does not affect auxin-induced degradation of Aux/IAAs but renders TIR1 non-functional in mediating transcriptional reprogramming and auxin-regulated development, including shoot, root, root hair growth and lateral root formation. Transgenic plants show that local cAMP production in the vicinity of the Aux/IAA–ARF complex by unrelated AC enzymes bypasses the need for auxin perception and is sufficient to induce ARF-mediated transcription. These discoveries revise the canonical model of auxin signalling and establish TIR1/AFB-produced cAMP as a second messenger essential for transcriptional reprograming.",

The function of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell plasticity in tumour heterogeneity and clonal evolution is poorly understood. Here we clarify the contribution of EMT to malignant progression in pancreatic cancer. We used somatic mosaic genome engineering technologies to trace and ablate malignant mesenchymal lineages along the EMT continuum. The experimental evidence clarifies the essential contribution of mesenchymal lineages to pancreatic cancer evolution. Spatial genomic analysis, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of EMT clarifies its contribution to the emergence of genomic instability, including events of chromothripsis. Genetic ablation of mesenchymal lineages robustly abolished these mutational processes and evolutionary patterns, as confirmed by cross-species analysis of pancreatic and other human solid tumours. Mechanistically, we identified that malignant cells with mesenchymal features display increased chromatin accessibility, particularly in the pericentromeric and centromeric regions, in turn resulting in delayed mitosis and catastrophic cell division. Thus, EMT favours the emergence of genomic-unstable, highly fit tumour cells, which strongly supports the concept of cell-state-restricted patterns of evolution, whereby cancer cell speciation is propagated to progeny within restricted functional compartments. Restraining the evolutionary routes through ablation of clones capable of mesenchymal plasticity, and extinction of the derived lineages, halts the malignant potential of one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.",

However, we know little on how temperature preference behaviour evolves during the colonization of new environments. Here we show that at least two distinct neurobiological mechanisms drive the evolution of temperature preference in flies of the genus Drosophila. Fly species from mild climates (D. melanogaster and D. persimilis) avoid both innocuous and noxious heat, and we show that the thermal activation threshold of the molecular heat receptor Gr28b.d precisely matches species-specific thresholds of behavioural heat avoidance. We find that desert-dwelling D. mojavensis are instead actively attracted to innocuous heat. Notably, heat attraction is also mediated by Gr28b.d (and by the antennal neurons that express it) and matches its threshold of heat activation. Rather, the switch in valence from heat aversion to attraction correlates with specific changes in thermosensory input to the lateral horn, the main target of central thermosensory pathways and a region of the fly brain implicated in the processing of innate valence1,2,3,4,5. Together, our results demonstrate that, in Drosophila, the adaptation to different thermal niches involves changes in thermal preference behaviour, and that this can be accomplished using distinct neurobiological solutions, ranging from shifts in the activation threshold of peripheral thermosensory receptor proteins to a substantial change in the way temperature valence is processed in the brain.",

Ecofriendly ZnSeTe QDs are an ideal alternative to cadmium-based blue QDs1,2, but face issues with colour impurity and inferior stability caused by the aggregated tellurium (Ten≥2) that dominates compositional inhomogeneity3,4. Here we developed an isoelectronic control strategy using congeneric sulfur coordinated with triphenyl phosphite (TPP-S) to construct homogeneous ZnSeTeS QDs with pure-blue emissions and near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. TPP with low electron-donating capability promotes the reactivity balance among anionic precursors, favouring the growth of QDs with uniform composition. The acceptor-like S with high electronegativity weakens the hole localization of the Te atoms by interfering with their surrounding carriers, thereby suppressing the formation of Ten≥2 isoelectronic centres. Furthermore, the congeneric S increases the configurational entropy of the QDs and eliminates the stacking faults and oxygen defects, leading to improved structural stability and reduced non-radiative carrier density. Consequently, the resulting pure-blue QLEDs based on core–shell ZnSeTeS/ZnSe/ZnS QDs emitting at 460 nm show a high external quantum efficiency of 24.7%, a narrow linewidth of 17 nm, and long operational half-lifetime (T50) close to 30,000 hours at 100 cd cm−2, rivalling state-of-the-art cadmium-based blue QLEDs.",

We demonstrate that the data and simulations show compelling agreement in the fingerprint pattern of the ozone response to decreasing ODSs since 2005. We also show that ODS forcing has enhanced ozone internal variability during the austral spring, influencing detection of forced responses and their time of emergence. Our results provide robust statistical and physical evidence that actions taken under the Montreal Protocol to reduce ODSs are indeed resulting in the beginning of Antarctic ozone recovery, defined as increases in ozone consistent with expected month–height patterns.",

Prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3) represents a key enzymatic mechanism in peptide processing, as exemplified with the therapeutic target glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1,2. However, the full spectrum of peptides generated by PCSK1 and their functional roles remain largely unknown. Here we use computational drug discovery to systematically map more than 2,600 previously uncharacterized human proteolytic peptide fragments cleaved by prohormone convertases, enabling the identification of novel bioactive peptides. Using this approach, we identified a 12-mer peptide, BRINP2-related peptide (BRP). When administered pharmacologically, BRP reduces food intake and exhibits anti-obesity effects in mice and pigs without inducing nausea or aversion. Mechanistically, BRP administration triggers central FOS activation and acts independently of leptin, GLP-1 receptor and melanocortin 4 receptor. Together, these data introduce a method to identify new bioactive peptides and establish pharmacologically that BRP may be useful for therapeutic modulation of body weight.",

Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 (refs. 1,2 ) led to scientific discoveries across cosmology 3 , nuclear physics 4–6 and gravity 7 . Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from the GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated electromagnetic transient, AT 2017gfo (ref. 8 ), 11 h after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive electromagnetic observations. However, owing to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here we present a machine-learning framework that performs complete binary neutron star inference in just 1 s without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing: (1) accurate localization even before the merger; (2) improved localization precision by around 30% compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (3) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.",

          "abstract": "Visitors to an interactive AI exhibition at the German Museum of Technology in Berlin use virtual-reality glasses to view an image of the brain.Credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa/Alamy\n\nFollowing a surge of excitement after the launch of the artificial-intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022, governments worldwide have been striving to craft policies that will foster AI development while ensuring the technology remains safe and trustworthy. In February, several provisions of the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act — the world’s first comprehensive AI regulation — took effect, prohibiting the deployment of certain applications, such as automated systems that claim to predict crime or infer emotions from facial features.\n\nMost AI systems won’t face an outright ban, but will instead be regulated using a risk-based scale, from high to low. Fierce debates are expected over the act’s classification of ‘high-risk’ systems, which will have the strictest oversight. Clearer guidance from the EU will begin emerging in August, but many AI-driven clinical solutions are likely to attract scrutiny owing to the potential harm associated with biased or faulty predictions in a medical setting.\n\nHow to harness AI’s potential in research — responsibly and ethically\n\nClinical AI — if deployed with caution — could improve health-care access and outcomes by streamlining hospital management processes (such as patient scheduling and doctors’ note-taking), supporting diagnostics (such as identifying abnormalities in X-rays) and tailoring treatment plans to individual patients. But these benefits come with risks — for instance, the decisions of an AI-driven system cannot always be easily explained, limiting the scope for real-time human oversight.\n\nThis matters, because such oversight is explicitly mandated under the act. High-risk systems are required to be transparent and designed so that an overseer can understand their limitations and decide when they should be used (see go.nature.com/3dtgh4x).\n\nBy default, compliance will be evaluated using a set of harmonized AI standards, but these are still under development. (Meeting these standards will not be mandatory, but is expected to be the preferred way for most organizations to demonstrate compliance.) However, as yet, there are few established technological ways to fulfil these forthcoming legal requirements.\n\nHere, we propose that new approaches to AI development — based on the standard practices of multidisciplinary medical teams, which communicate across disciplinary boundaries using broad, shared concepts — could support oversight. This dynamic offers a useful blueprint for the next generation of health-focused AI systems that are trusted by health professionals and meet the EU’s regulatory expectations.\n\nCollaborating with AI\n\nClinical decisions, particularly those concerning the management of people with complex conditions, typically take various sources of information into account — from electronic health records and lifestyle factors to blood tests, radiology scans and pathology results. Clinical training, by contrast, is highly specialized, and few individuals can accurately interpret multiple types of specialist medical data (such as both radiology and pathology). Treatment of individuals with complex conditions, such as cancer, is therefore typically managed through multidisciplinary team meetings (known as tumour boards in the United States) at which all of the relevant clinical fields are represented.\n\nCan AI shake-up translational research?\n\nBecause they involve clinicians from different specialities, multidisciplinary team meetings do not focus on the raw characteristics of each data type, because this knowledge is not shared by the full team. Instead, team members communicate with reference to intermediate ‘concepts’, which are widely understood. For example, when justifying a proposed treatment course for a tumour, team members are likely to refer to aspects of the disease, such as the tumour site, the cancer stage or grade and the presence of specific patterns of molecular markers. They will also discuss patient-associated features, including age, the presence of other diseases or conditions, body mass index and frailty.\n\nThese concepts, which represent interpretable, high-level summaries of the raw data, are the building blocks of human reasoning — the language of clinical debate. They also typically feature in national clinical guidelines for selecting treatments for patients.\n\nNotably, this process of debate using the language of shared concepts is designed to facilitate transparency and collective oversight in a way that parallels the intentions of the EU AI Act. For clinical AI to comply with the act and gain the trust of clinicians, we think that it should mirror these established clinical decision-making processes. Clinical AI — much like clinicians in multidisciplinary teams — should make use of well-defined concepts to justify predictions, instead of just indicating their likelihood.\n\nExplainability crisis\n\nThere are two typical approaches to explainable AI1 — a system that explains its decision-making process. One involves designing the model so it has built-in rules, ensuring transparency from the start. For example, a tool for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays could assess lung opacity, assign a severity score and classify the case on the basis of predefined thresholds, making its reasoning clear to physicians. The second approach involves analysing the model’s decision after it has been made (‘post hoc’). This can be done through techniques such as saliency mapping, which highlights the regions of the X-ray that influenced the model’s prediction.\n\nHowever, both approaches have serious limitations2. To see why, consider an AI tool that has been trained to help dermatologists to decide whether a mole on the skin is benign or malignant. For each new patient, a post-hoc explainability approach might highlight pixels in the image of the mole that were most important for the model’s prediction. This can identify reasoning that is obviously incorrect — for instance, by highlighting pixels in the image that are not related to the mole (such as pen marks or other annotations by clinicians)3.\n\nThe European Parliament in Brussels adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act last March.Credit: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nWhen the mole is highlighted, however, it might be difficult2,4 for an overseeing clinician — even a highly experienced one — to know whether the set of highlighted pixels is clinically meaningful, or simply spuriously associated with diagnosis. In this case, use of the AI tool might place an extra cognitive burden on the clinician.\n\nA rules-based design, however, constrains an AI model’s learning to conform rigidly to known principles or causal mechanisms. Yet the tasks for which AI is most likely to be clinically useful do not always conform to simple decision-making processes, or might involve causal mechanisms that combine in inherently complex or counter-intuitive ways. Such rules-based models will not perform well in precisely the cases in which a physician might need the most assistance.\n\nIn contrast to these approaches, when a dermatologist explains their diagnosis to a colleague or patient, they tend not to speak about pixels or causal structures. Instead, they make use of easily understood high-level concepts, such as mole asymmetry, border irregularity and colour, to support their diagnosis. Clinicians using AI tools that present such high-level concepts have reported increased trust in the tools’ recommendations5.\n\nIn recent years, approaches to explainable AI have been developed that could encode such conceptual reasoning and help to support group decisions. Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are a promising example6. These are trained not only to learn outcomes of interest (such as prognosis or treatment course), but also to include important intermediate concepts (such as tumour stage or grade) that are meaningful to human overseers. These models can thereby provide both an overall prediction and a set of understandable concepts, learnt from the data, that justify model recommendations and support debate among decision makers.\n\nAI assistance for planning cancer treatment\n\nThis kind of explainable AI could be particularly useful when addressing complex problems that require harmonization of distinct data types. Moreover, they are well suited to regulatory compliance under the EU AI Act, because they provide transparency in a way that is specifically designed to facilitate human oversight. For example, if a CBM incorrectly assigns an important clinical concept to a given patient (such as predicting an incorrect tumour stage), then the overseeing clinical team immediately knows not to rely on the AI prediction.\n\nMoreover, because of how CBMs are trained, such concept-level mistakes can also immediately be corrected by the clinical team, allowing the model to ‘receive help’7 and revise its overall prediction and justification with the aid of clinician input. Indeed, CBMs can be trained to expect such human interventions and use them to improve model performance over time.",

The discovery joins other finds — such as a 1.4-million-year-old bone axe from Ethiopia — that suggest the human ancestor Homo erectus often used bones as tools.\n\nBone-tool culture is showing up in the archaeological record “much earlier than anyone thought possible”, says Michael Pante, a palaeontologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who was not involved with the research. “It just speaks to this species having the ability to do things that no other species was able to do.” The findings were published1 on 5 March in Nature.\n\nTrench excavation\n\nTool use is a storied tradition among hominins. Members of the genus Australopithecus — which includes the famed fossil Lucy — were making stone tools at least 2.6 million years ago. Bone tools appear only much later in the human story, typically at sites in Europe and Asia around 400,000 years ago.\n\nThe Olduvai Gorge in the Great Rift Valley, Tanzania, has been the site of many fossil discoveries.Credit: Dietmar Rauscher/Alamy\n\nThe finds at Olduvai Gorge are among discoveries challenging that narrative. The region has a long history of fossil finds: specimens for the early hominin Homo habilis were discovered there in the 1960s, and researchers have found signs of bone tools in the area for years. Famed palaeoanthropologist Mary Leakey wrote about some of these findings but only partially published her results. This is, in part, because most bone tools were found outside their original context and so couldn’t be accurately dated.\n\nObjects found in carefully excavated trenches are easier to place in time and space. The latest findings are based on digs at Olduvai conducted between 2015 and 2022. Researchers spent several field seasons excavating trenches to study how technology changed when H. erectus — a small-brained predecessor to species including modern humans and Neanderthals — replaced H. habilis in the region, somewhere between 1.8 and 1.5 million years ago.\n\nTo shape bone tools, Homo erectus used a tactic similar to flinting stone.Credit: CSIC",

          "abstract": "A crowd turned out in New York City on 19 February to protest against the Trump administration′s cuts to research funding.Credit: Erik McGregor/LightRocket/Getty\n\nAnnika Barber felt like an impostor as she boarded a bus just before sunrise on 24 February, and settled in for the long ride from New Jersey to Washington DC.\n\nBarber had studied neuroscience for years before she launched her own laboratory at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. She had not trained to be an activist, yet now she was on her way to deliver a speech at a rally about proposed cuts to US research funding. When she arrived in Washington, she picked up a blank poster provided by rally organizers. “I would rather be in lab!” she wrote on it in big block letters.\n\nAcross the United States, researchers are navigating uncomfortable territory. Repeated threats to research funding and the mass firings of federal workers have pushed some scientists to take on unfamiliar roles as activists, speaking at rallies, calling legislators and forming new pressure groups. “Historically, scientists have done a really bad job of advocating for their own activities,” says David Meyer, a sociologist at the University of California, Irvine. “So this is a new challenge.”\n\nUnaccustomed role\n\nThe events of the past six weeks have compelled many scientists to embrace that challenge. Soon after the second inauguration of US President Donald Trump on 20 January, the new administration attempted to freeze payments on federal grants; announced that it would review and potentially cancel any grant that mentioned terms it deemed indicative of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes; and issued dramatic cuts to the overhead, or ‘indirect costs’, paid on projects funded by the US National Institutes of Health.\n\nUS universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts\n\n“All of the bad news and the chaos made it hard to know what the best action to take was,” says Melissa Varga, science network senior manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. “Folks just shut down.” Fear of retribution for speaking out also played a part, she adds.\n\nThe courts temporarily halted some of the Trump administration’s orders, but a coherent message has broken through: federal support for science is in danger. Gradually, scientists began to stir, Varga says: “They’re realizing now that doing any one thing is better than doing nothing.”\n\nThat activism is taking many forms. On 3 March, the Union of Concerned Scientists and 48 scientific societies released a joint letter to Congress calling for legislators to protect taxpayer-funded research. “The actions of this administration have already caused significant harm to American science and are risking the health and safety of our communities”, they said.\n\nUS researchers in planetary science are talking about creating a new professional society to strengthen their voice in policy matters. Paul Byrne, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, says he has been thinking about such a society for several years. “But the recent attacks, because that’s what they are, on science in the US have catalysed the need for it,” he says. “The more organized the planetary-science community, the more effectively we can stand up and push back against these actions.” Byrne and others will lead a discussion at an upcoming planetary-science conference about whether to launch such a society.\n\nIndividual researchers also have a bounty of petitions to sign, including statements against censorship of science, indirect-cost reductions, and cuts to space science and biomedical research. And professional societies have circulated tip sheets to guide researchers who want to call their elected representatives.\n\nTaking action\n\nFor many scientists, the big event is coming up on 7 March, at ‘Stand Up for Science’ rallies slated to take place in 32 cities around the country. The main event, in Washington DC, is spearheaded by a group of five researchers, most of them graduate students, who came together to combat their own initial feelings of powerlessness. “It’s been inspiring, as this has grown, to see how many people were feeling the same way and to take action,” says Emma Courtney, a graduate student in biology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.\n\nAre the Trump team’s actions affecting your research? How to contact Nature\n\nAnother goal is for each rally to spark local news outlets into covering the impact of science on that community, says Sam Goldstein, who studies women’s health at the University of Florida in Gainesville and is also co-organizing the Washington rally. Goldstein says that when she was interviewed by a Maryland newspaper, she researched the leading cause of death for the region, then came prepared with examples of how biomedical research could improve quality of life there.",

It even goes by its original name: Little Shop of Dreams.\n\nI stumbled across it last month while visiting Maggie Sooth, a distinguished professor of real-life studies at the university. We catch up every few years, if we can, and take a spell in reality.\n\nDespite the winter drizzle, we had ventured outdoors, along the grey and empty streets, engrossed in conversation and neglectful of our surroundings. But as we strolled down Kleitman Avenue, its wet cobblestones slippery and difficult to walk on, the rain quickened, and we sheltered under an awning.\n\n“What’s that?” I asked, waving at a stone building across the road, indistinct through the hazy veil of the rain.\n\nMaggie flicked me a grin. “Oh, that’s Ground Zero,” she said. “Where the Theta Corporation tested the first dream incubation protocol. It’s the place that gave us dreaming-on-demand. Shall we go in? It’s a museum now.”\n\nNormally, I’m not one for real life; reality is only three-dimensional after all. Like most people, I prefer to see things properly curated in my dreams. But the rain was falling heavily, and I’ve never been entirely comfortable with nature’s raw elements.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“OK,” I said. So, we went inside, and marvellously back in time — for the place is crammed with antique curiosities of the human imagination.\n\nThere’s a little panelled-off section where you can try on those cloddish and nauseating headsets our great-great-grandparents so sweetly referred to as ‘Virtual Reality’. I did not like them, but Maggie said they reminded her of her childhood because she was a slow dreamer.\n\nThere’s also a large, dimmed room where you can sit and watch what they used to call a ‘movie’. We spent a few minutes in there, watching a flickering, two-dimensional projection about the sinking of a primitive passenger ship. I found it dreary and flat; but Maggie felt that the music had stood the test of time.\n\nElsewhere, to my surprise, we got to hold a book — a real book! — and each of us had a turn at folding over the genuine paper pages with our own hands. “Wow!” Maggie gasped. “Yes,” I said, “you can see why they stopped using these.”\n\nI am cynical about the past, I confess it. Undergoing first-hand the tedium of life as experienced by our forebears is, at best, a marvellous tutorial in the virtue of progress. There was one exhibit, however, that left me uneasy.\n\nOn the second floor of the Little Shop of Dreams they have recreated the original room in which Sophie Kanenas (“patient zero” as Maggie put it) lay when Spagnolo and Kleitman proved they could manufacture dreams.\n\nIn there, one can see the same kind of bed, the same old-style gelatinous electrodes, and an exact replica of the original brain modulation unit used to program the very first instantiation of a purposeful, pre-engineered, wakeful dream.\n\nFurthermore, because people so rarely visit, for a small fee you can lie down in that room, have the electrodes fastened to your own scalp, listen to the rhythmic hum of the brain modulator, and experience Sophie’s first dream exactly as she did.\n\nNaturally, I tried it out. It took only a few minutes. Stretched out upon the billet, my mind lulled into a theta state, I saw what Sophie saw:\n\nI was the emperor of China, sitting on a cushion behind a screen; a platter of delicacies on a lacquered table beside me …\n\nThere were silk screens on all sides, each intricately decorated with paintings of cranes and peacocks …\n\nBehind them, I could hear people moving and speaking …",

It has been highly studied because its breakdown creates amyloid-β peptides, which are often present in plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nWhat accelerates brain ageing? This AI ‘brain clock’ points to answers\n\nNow, Dario Valenzano, an evolutionary biologist at the Leibniz Institute on Aging in Jena, Germany, and his colleagues have found that knocking out the appa gene, which makes APP, in turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) reduces signs of ageing.\n\n“We found that there is probably an overlooked role of amyloid precursor protein in normal brain ageing,” says Valenzano. The work has not yet been peer reviewed and is posted on the bioRxiv preprint server1.\n\nRapid decline\n\nTurquoise killifish tend to live no more than about 9 months and exhibit rapid age-related brain decline. Valenzano’s team looked inside neurons of aged fish — those about 6 months old — and discovered an accumulation of APP derivatives, including a damaging type of amyloid-β, that aren’t present in 6-week-old fish.\n\nThis is different from what happens in Alzheimer’s disease, in which amyloid plaques form outside cells.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how\n\nThe researchers then looked at brain samples from people over 80 with and without Alzheimer’s disease. They found a similar accumulation of APP and amyloid-β inside cells in the cortex and the hippocampus in both healthy and diseased brains.\n\nNext, the team used CRISPR gene editing to breed killifish that don’t have the appa gene. Brain tissue studies showed that this slowed cell death and decreased brain inflammation in ageing fish. It also improved the age-related decline in neuronal activity and capacity for learning. “We see quite remarkable rescue of learning in elderly fish,” says Valenzano. “They learn in a way that’s more like younger fish.”\n\nThe team demonstrated this by training killifish to associate a burst of air bubbles with a light: when the light comes on, the fish must move away to avoid a bubble burst. The gene-edited fish learnt this faster than normal fish of the same age.",

In posts on Facebook and LinkedIn in January, I asked how much time academic colleagues spend reviewing papers. Close to 900 academics responded, with more than 40% saying they typically spend two to four hours on a single review, over 25% indicating that they spend more than four hours on the task, and a remarkable 14% admitting that they put in significantly more than four hours — sometimes a full eight-hour day or even more (see ‘Lengthy reviews’). Some respondents were stunned by those numbers, especially considering how fragmented or shallow reviewer feedback can seem to authors trying to make sense of it.\n\nWhat if there were a more efficient way to review a paper — without jeopardizing the quality and integrity of the process? Over the years, I’ve fine-tuned a method that has helped me to drastically cut the amount of time I spend on each review, while still providing thorough, constructive critiques. Here’s how it works.\n\nScan, dictate, refine\n\nI break the review process down into three simple steps:\n\nScan. Quickly browse the abstract, introduction, methods and results, focusing on the big picture. If the analysis looks solid, read the rest of the paper. If you detect glaring flaws, however, you’ll know it’s probably one to reject — no need to line-edit the entire manuscript.\n\nDictate. Use dictation in the text-editing tool of your choice (for example, Voice Access in Windows or Voice Control on the Mac) to capture real-time thoughts as you read. This way, you avoid having to scribble notes or needing to recall and type up your feedback later — a major time-saver.\n\nRefine. Feed your dictated notes into an offline large language model (LLM) to clarify and organize your feedback. A simple prompt such as “Write a critical reviewer letter based on the following notes. Maintain a professional tone throughout” will do. Don’t know how to code? No problem. Tools such as GPT4ALL (see ‘How to set up and run a local LLM’) allow you to load and run LLMs locally and offline, so there’s no need to upload sensitive manuscripts to the cloud. Confidentiality is non-negotiable when it comes to unpublished research, and uploading content externally can invite ethical or even legal trouble.\n\nHow to set up and run a local LLM\n\nWhen confidentiality is key, using an offline and ‘no-coding’ set-up such as GPT4ALL is a no-brainer for safeguarding sensitive or unpublished work. Here’s how to get started.\n\n1. Install GPT4ALL (available for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu Linux).\n\n2. Choose your large language model (LLM). Open GPT4ALL, click ‘Models’ in the left-hand panel and download a suitable LLM. Aim for a balance between output quality and hardware demands — bigger isn’t always better if it leaves your system gasping for air. Check each model’s computational requirements and licence before downloading, especially if you’re in a commercial or specialized setting. If your system’s random-access memory (RAM) is limited, try a smaller model with fewer computational requirements. And be wary of commercial models that route data to the cloud, breaking confidentiality — if a model’s indicated system requirements are suspiciously minimal, it is probably using external resources. Remember, the core advantage of GPT4ALL is local use, ensuring your confidential work stays where it belongs — on your device.\n\n3. Chat. Start a conversation by clicking ‘Chats’. After a brief pause to load the model, you should see a chat-like interface into which you can type or paste your text and notes. Request suggestions for clarification, rephrasing or structural improvements. Always review the model’s output carefully before incorporating it into your final review.\n\nBut let’s be clear: LLMs aren’t there to crank out a full review on your behalf. Although survey data published on the arXiv preprint server in January suggest that automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) can help to speed up evaluations and sharpen structure, ASPR tools still struggle with domain-specific expertise, bias and data-security issues1. Instead, use the LLM to spot redundancy, refine phrasing and organize suggestions (for prompts, see my previous column). You — the reviewer — must make the final judgement on the paper’s methodology, findings and overall contribution to the field.\n\nBy the end of this process, you should have a set of structured, section-by-section comments that can be quickly refined into a coherent reviewer report. But be sure to check the publisher’s policy on generative artificial intelligence (AI) before you get started. Some are fine with reviewers using generative AI tools to tidy up written feedback. But uploading a manuscript or review text to the cloud is usually a hard ‘no’ — confidentiality is on the line. Running an LLM offline locally keeps you within policy restrictions and safeguards the authors’ anonymity. Plus, it prevents their work from being scooped up for training future LLMs.\n\nOutcomes and lessons\n\nThis workflow has helped me to reclaim countless hours in my schedule: I used to spend half a day on one manuscript; now 30–40 minutes suffice if the paper’s methods are sound. If there are serious flaws, it’s even faster — there’s no need to polish an unpublishable paper.\n\nThe comments I do make are generally more thorough than before: dictating comments in real time forces me to ‘talk through’ the paper rather than scribble notes, and to articulate critiques on the spot, often exposing logical gaps I would otherwise have missed. It also deepens my engagement with the paper, resulting in clearer, more focused feedback.",

          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "Resilience at work isn’t about wearing a suit of armour, but instead about learning when to persist and when to pivot.Credit: Getty\n\nMore than a decade ago, palaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius received some bad news: her mother had brain cancer. Praetorius was deep in her graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, but she somehow managed to juggle her mother’s care with her demanding workload. But in just a few short months, Praetorius’s mother died.\n\nIn the aftermath, Praetorius seemed like a picture of resilience to her colleagues as she continued to work and go to lectures. But beneath the surface she was torn between her grief and her desire to keep going with her graduate studies. The only way she felt she could stay on top of the demands of her studies was to shelve her emotions. “I often wanted to quit because I felt so run down and threadbare,” says Praetorius, who is now at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. “But there wasn’t really the option.”\n\nHow a lupus diagnosis taught me that resilience in science is a double-edged sword\n\nPraetorius’s experience captures academia’s often misguided view of resilience — the ability to adapt and overcome challenges or adversity. Academia isn’t the only environment that encourages people to put on a brave face when the going gets tough — other workplaces show a similar cultural tendency. There’s no doubt that resilience is a necessary skill for dealing with the inevitable failure, rejection and fierce competition that comes with building a research career. Some institutions, including the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Imperial College London, are running courses that aim to help researchers to develop the resilience needed to navigate tough career challenges and maintain their well-being.\n\nBut some researchers say that the culture of academia is perpetuating harmful misconceptions about resilience, such as implying that researchers should ‘tough it out’ in a toxic environment. Others think that institutions need to do more to address systemic problems — such as low pay and a lack of inclusivity — before they place the onus on researchers to always weather the storm. “Instead of teaching people to dodge stones that we have thrown at them, it would be better not to throw stones from the very beginning,” says Roman Zviagintsev, an educational-equality researcher at the University of Vienna.\n\nWhat resilience is — and isn’t\n\nA simple definition of resilience is that “when something bad happens, it doesn’t derail you”, says David Yeager, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But this view has its limitations and underlies a lot of myths about resilience, such as equating it with suppressing negative emotions, adds Yeager. That approach, he says, often makes matters worse in the long run. “It’s a very poor emotion-regulation strategy,” says Yeager. Another harmful myth is that resilience is about continuing to work in environments in which inequity, disparity and bullying are rife, says Paul Seldon, a pharmacologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute (ECRI).\n\nThe expectation to live up to this version of resilience is familiar to Emily Wharton, a biomechanics researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, UK. On International Women’s Day in 2023, Wharton gave a presentation to her department about the issues students were facing regarding inclusivity, along with her own experiences. But a senior male colleague dismissed her concerns and struggled to understand where she was coming from. Although some other senior colleagues were supportive afterwards, most of them advised her not to share too much about her personal experiences. “I got told that I need to toughen up if I want to be in this world,” says Wharton. “Basically — I need to change,” rather than there being a shift in other people’s behaviour or the wider system, she says.\n\nPalaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius advises researchers to prioritize themselves during tough times.Credit: USGS\n\nBut true resilience isn’t about wearing a suit of armour to work or persisting with goals at the expense of mental health. Instead, it’s about making “calm, intentioned decisions in the face of setback and disappointment”, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the NIH’s Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) in Bethesda, Maryland. This often means setting boundaries and learning to say no to unreasonable demands or requests that don’t match a researcher’s values, she says. “It is the ability to know when to persist and when to pivot,” says Milgram.\n\nCommunication barriers for a Deaf PhD student meant risking burnout\n\nFor instance, an early-career researcher might continue working with a bully who is an influential principal investigator because they see them as a necessary stepping stone in their career. But in this case, finding a way out of this toxic situation is healthier than sticking it out and putting up with abuse, say interviewees.\n\nResilience also isn’t a fixed trait that people are born with, but a skill that is developed and practised over time (see ‘How to become resilient, the healthy way’), says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. A big part of building resilience involves reflecting on challenges rather than reacting to them, as well as considering failures as opportunities to learn. “These are habits that need to be developed all the time, so they are there when adversity strikes,” she says.\n\nHow to become resilient, the healthy way\n\nShift your mindset. It’s easy to fall prey to negative ‘self-talk’ after a big grant rejection or failed experiment. But reframing thoughts to focus on what can be learnt from the experience can help you to bounce back sooner, says Diane Safer, who heads graduate career and professional development at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “Instead of saying, ‘I’m really not good at that,’ it’s changing your mindset and saying, ‘I’m not good at that yet,’” says Safer.\n\nBe assertive. Contrary to popular belief, resilience isn’t about powering through challenges with superhuman strength and accommodating every demand, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Intramural Training and Education in Bethesda, Maryland. It’s about developing the assertiveness to set boundaries, say ‘no’ and ask for help. “It isn’t suffering because we’re supposed to work hard,” says Milgram. “It’s making sure we are doing something that brings us joy and value.”\n\nRemember your ‘why’. Although academia prizes prestige, publications and metrics, having a strong sense of purpose often has a more positive effect on mental health, says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. “If you think about the purpose of science, it is about supporting the greater good and contributing knowledge,” says Dorjee. “That’s the primary drive, rather than awards.”\n\nBuild your connections. Developing resilience doesn’t just depend on individual effort. It also comes down to having strong social connections and support, which can help researchers to maintain their self-confidence and adaptability, says Paul Seldon, a cell biologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute. “It’s recognizing the need to be emotionally connected, beyond social media, having a work–life balance and accepting help,” says Seldon.",

          "abstract": "Jay Bhattacharya, whom President Trump nominated as director of the National Institutes of Health, speaks with senators on 5 March during his confirmation hearing.Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty\n\nAmid confusion about cuts affecting the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Jay Bhattacharya, US President Donald Trump’s nominee for NIH director, said on Wednesday that he is committed to ensuring that scientists at the NIH and those who receive NIH grants have the funding to do their work ― but he was vague on how he would accomplish that.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the US Senate, Bhattacharya, who is a health economist at Stanford University in California, also seemed to distance himself from the recent turmoil at the agency. Grant processing has largely ground to a halt, and roughly 1,200 of the NIH’s 20,000 staff members were fired in mid-February. “I wasn’t involved in the personnel decisions to date,” he said, when asked about the firings. But he did not commit to rehiring those who have lost their jobs.\n\n“I thought that he came across as very reasonable,” said Carole LaBonne, a stem-cell biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The exception, she said, was Bhattacharya’s discussion of COVID-19 ― a topic that has divided him from many scientists because of his views on lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“What I was most disturbed by during the hearing was that the topic of basic science didn’t come up,” LaBonne added. That omission led her to worry that Bhattacharya does not understand its importance, she said.\n\nTumultuous times\n\nIf confirmed, Bhattacharya will helm an agency with a budget of roughly US$47 billion, making it the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nBut since Trump, a Republican, took office for the second timein January, there has been a sharp decline in new research grants awarded, leaving many scientists in limbo. Trump officials have also used procedural manoeuvres to prevent grant-review meetings from taking place, and the agency announced on 7 February that research ‘indirect cost’ funding, which is key to the functioning of universities across the country, would be capped, effective immediately. Courts have put many of these measures on hold.\n\nBhattacharya gained public prominence after co-authoring an open letter called the Great Barrington Declaration. Published in October 2020, it argued against COVID-19 lockdowns and in favour of normality to allow ‘herd immunity’ to take hold ― a proposal that was knocked down by numerous scientists and NIH officials. Francis Collins, the head of the NIH at the time, told television broadcaster Fox News in 2021 that “hundreds of thousands of people would have died if we had followed that strategy”. Bhattacharya also opposed vaccine and mask mandates.\n\nFresh priorities\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Bhattacharya laid out his five priorities for the NIH: chronic disease research, research reproducibility, encouraging a culture of “scientific dissent”, funding cutting-edge research and regulating “risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic”.\n\nBhattacharya said that he would make sure that all scientists at the NIH and all those supported by the NIH “have the resources they need to do their research”. Asked whether he would immediately restart grant-review meetings, he responded, “Absolutely. My job would be to ensure that those fundamental scientific meetings and other activities happen.” He also affirmed the need for NIH funding to address the health needs of “minority populations” and for long COVID research.\n\nBut he didn’t commit explicitly to allowing new grants to start flowing again, or to rehiring NIH employees who were fired. Both Democratic and Republican senators brought up the 15% indirect-cost cap that the NIH attempted to impose on universities. Bhattacharya agreed that these funds pay for important things. But he also said that “there’s a lot of distrust” about how that money is spent, and he endorsed audits of indirect-cost spending.\n\nVaccine messaging\n\nBhattacharya spoke carefully when discussing infectious disease: if he is confirmed, his future boss will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who has a long history of anti-vaccine activism. When asked about Kennedy’s statement at an anti-vaccine conference in 2023 that the NIH should give infectious-disease science “a break for about eight years,” Bhattacharya responded that Kennedy is “fully committed” to addressing the nation’s health needs, “including infectious disease”.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?",

          "title": "How much energy will AI really consume? The good, the bad and the unknown",
          "authors": "Sophia Chen",
          "abstract": "The aroma of hay and manure hangs over Culpeper County, Virginia, where there’s a cow for every three humans. “We’ve got big farms, most still family-owned, and a lot of forests,” says Sarah Parmelee, one of the county’s 55,000 residents. “It’s very charming small-town USA,” she adds.\n\nBut this pastoral idyll is in the middle of a twenty-first-century shift. Over the past few years, the county has approved the construction of seven large data-centre projects, which will support technology firms in their expansive plans for generative artificial intelligence (AI). Inside these giant structures, rows of computer servers will help to train the AI models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT, and deliver their answers to what might be billions of daily queries from around the world.\n\nIn Virginia, the construction will have profound effects. Each facility is likely to consume the same amount of electrical power as tens of thousands of residential homes, potentially driving up costs for residents and straining the area’s power infrastructure beyond its capacity. Parmelee and others in the community are wary of the data centres’ appetite for electricity — particularly because Virginia is already known as the data-centre capital of the world. A state-commissioned review, published in December 2024, noted that although data centres bring economic benefits, their growth could double electricity demand in Virginia within ten years1.\n\nLight bulbs have energy ratings — so why can’t AI chatbots?\n\n“Where is power going to come from?” asks Parmelee, who is mapping the rise of data centres in the state and works for the Piedmont Environmental Council, a non-profit organization headquartered in Warrenton, Virginia. “They’re all saying, ‘We’ll buy power from the next district over.’ But that district is planning to buy power from you.”\n\nSimilar conflicts about AI and energy are brewing in many places around the globe where data centres are sprouting up at a record pace. Big tech firms are betting hard on generative AI, which requires much more energy to operate compared with older AI models that extract patterns from data but don’t generate fresh text and images. That is driving companies to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on new data centres and servers to expand their capacity.\n\nFrom a global perspective, AI’s impact on future electricity demand is actually projected to be relatively small. But data centres are concentrated in dense clusters, where they can have profound local impacts. They are much more spatially concentrated than are other energy-intensive facilities, such as steel mills and coal mines. Companies tend to build data-centre buildings close together so that they can share power grids and cooling systems and transfer information efficiently, both among themselves and to users. Virginia, in particular, has attracted data-centre firms by providing tax breaks, leading to even more clustering.\n\n“If you have one, you’re likely to have more,” says Parmelee. Virginia already has 340 such facilities, and Parmelee has mapped 159 proposed data centres or expansions of existing ones in Virginia, where they account for more than one-quarter of the state’s electricity use, according to a report by EPRI, a research institute in Palo Alto, California2. In Ireland, data centres account for more than 20% of the country’s electricity consumption — with most of them situated on the edge of Dublin. And the facilities’ electricity consumption has surpassed 10% in at least 5 US states.\n\nComplicating matters further is a lack of transparency from firms about their AI systems’ electricity demands. “The real problem is that we’re operating with very little detailed data and knowledge of what’s happening,” says Jonathan Koomey, an independent researcher who has studied the energy use of computing for more than 30 years and who runs an analytics firm in Burlingame, California.\n\n“I think every researcher on this topic is going crazy because we’re not getting the stuff we need,” says Alex de Vries, a researcher at the Free University of Amsterdam and the founder of Digiconomist, a Dutch company that explores the unintended consequences of digital trends. “We’re just doing our best, trying all kinds of tricks to come up with some kind of numbers.”\n\nWorking out AI’s energy demands\n\nLacking detailed figures from firms, researchers have explored AI’s energy demand in two ways. In 2023, de Vries used a supply-chain (or market-based) method3. He examined the power draw of one of the NVIDIA servers that dominates the generative AI market and extrapolated that to the energy required over a year. He then multiplied that figure by estimates of the total number of such servers that are being shipped, or that might be required for a particular task.\n\nGenerative AI’s environmental costs are soaring — and mostly secret\n\nDe Vries used this method to estimate the energy needed if Google searches used generative AI. Two energy-analyst firms had estimated that implementing ChatGPT-like AI into every Google search would require between 400,000 and 500,000 NVIDIA A100 servers, which, based on the power demand of those servers, would amount to 23–29 terawatt hours (TWh) annually. Then, estimating that Google was processing up to 9 billion searches daily (a ballpark figure from various analysts), de Vries calculated that each request through an AI server requires 7–9 watt hours (Wh) of energy. That is 23–30 times the energy of a normal search, going by figures Google reported in a 2009 blogpost (see go.nature.com/3d8sd4t). When asked to comment on de Vries’ estimate, Google did not respond.\n\nThis energy calculation felt like “grasping at straws”, de Vries says, because he had to rely on third-party estimates that he could not replicate. And his numbers quickly became obsolete. The number of servers required for an AI-integrated Google search is likely to be lower now, because today’s AI models can match the accuracy of 2023 models at a fraction of the computational cost, as US energy-analyst firm SemiAnalysis (whose estimates de Vries had relied on) wrote in an e-mail to Nature.\n\nEven so, the firm says that the best way of assessing generative AI’s energy footprint is still to monitor server shipments and their power requirements, which is broadly the method used by many analysts. However, it is difficult for analysts to isolate the energy used solely by generative AI, because data centres generally perform non-AI tasks as well.\n\nBottom-up estimates\n\nThe other way to examine AI’s energy demand is ‘bottom-up’: researchers measure the energy demand of one AI-related request in a specific data centre. However, independent researchers can perform the measurements using only open-source AI models that are expected to resemble proprietary ones.\n\nThe concept behind these tests is that a user submits a prompt — such as a request to generate an image, or a text-based chat — and a Python software package called CodeCarbon then allows the user’s computer to access technical specifications of the chips that execute the model in the data centre. “At the end of the run, it’ll give you an estimate of how much energy was consumed by the hardware that you were using,” says Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher who helped to develop CodeCarbon, and who works at Hugging Face, a firm based in New York City that hosts an open-source platform for AI models and data sets.\n\nLuccioni and others found that different tasks require varying amounts of energy. On average, according to their latest results, generating an image from a text prompt consumes about 0.5 Wh of energy, while generating text uses a little less. For comparison, a modern smartphone might need 22 Wh for a full charge. But there is wide variation: larger models require more energy (see ‘How much energy does AI use?’). De Vries says that the numbers are lower than those in his paper, but that might be because the models used by Luccioni and others are at least an order of magnitude smaller than the model underlying ChatGPT — and because AI is becoming more efficient.\n\nSource: HuggingFace AI Energy Score Leaderboard\n\nThe numbers are a lower bound, according to Emma Strubell, a computer scientist and collaborator of Luccioni’s at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Otherwise, “companies would be coming out and correcting us”, they say. “They’re not doing that.”\n\nWhat’s more, firms generally withhold the information the software needs to estimate the energy used for data-centre cooling. CodeCarbon also cannot access the energy consumption of some types of chip. This includes Google’s proprietary TPU chips, says Benoît Courty, a data scientist in France who maintains CodeCarbon.\n\nWill AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?\n\nLuccioni has also studied how much energy it takes to train generative AI models — when a model extracts statistical patterns from massive amounts of data. But if models are receiving billions of queries daily, as de Vries assumed for his Google estimates, then the energy used to answer those queries — amounting to terawatt hours of electricity — will dominate AI’s annual energy demands. Training something the size of GPT-3, the model behind the first version of ChatGPT, requires energy in the order of a gigawatt hour.\n\nLast month, Luccioni and other researchers launched the AI Energy Score project, a public initiative to compare the energy efficiency of AI models on different tasks, which gives each model a star rating. Developers of proprietary, closed models are also able to upload test results, although only the US software firm Salesforce has participated so far, Luccioni says.\n\nCompanies are becoming increasingly close-mouthed about the energy requirements of their up-to-date industry models, Strubell says. As competition has heated up, “there has been a closing down of information shared outside of the company”, they say. But firms such as Google and Microsoft have reported that their carbon emissions are increasing, which they have ascribed to data-centre construction in support of AI. (Companies including Google, Microsoft and Amazon didn’t address criticisms about a lack of transparency when asked by Nature; instead they emphasized that they were working with local authorities to ensure that new data centres don’t affect local utility supplies.)\n\nSome governments now require more transparency from companies. In 2023, the European Union adopted an Energy Efficiency Directive, which requires operators of data centres that are rated for at least 500 kilowatts of power to report their energy consumption each year.\n\nGlobal projections\n\nOn the basis of supply-chain estimation methods, analysts say that data centres currently use just a small proportion of the world’s electricity demand. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates4 that the electricity used by such facilities in 2022 was 240–340 TWh, or 1–1.3% of world demand (if cryptocurrency mining and data-transmission infrastructure are included, this raises the proportion to 2%).\n\nThe AI boom will increase this, but with world electricity consumption expected to grow by more than 80% by 2050 owing to the electrification of many industries, the rise of electric cars and greater demand for air conditioning, data centres “account for a relatively small share of overall electricity demand growth”, the IEA reports4 (see ‘World electricity growth’).\n\nSource: Ref. 4\n\nEven with approximations of AI’s current energy demands, it’s difficult to project future trends, warns Koomey. “Nobody has any idea what data centres, either AI or conventional, will use even a few years from now,” he says.\n\nThe main problem is disagreements about the number of servers and data centres that will be needed, and it’s an area where utilities and tech companies have financial incentives to inflate numbers, he says. Many of their predictions are based on “simple-minded assumptions” he adds. “They extrapolate recent trends out 10 or 15 years into the future.”\n\nLate last year, Koomey co-authored a report funded by the US Department of Energy5, which estimated that US data centres currently use 176 TWh (4.4%) of the country’s electricity, and that this might double or triple by 2028 to between 7% and 12%.",

          "abstract": "China has introduced security-focused laws that affect researchers who want to send data overseas.Credit: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty\n\nDonald Trump’s second term as US president has brought fresh fears that the administration could resurrect the China Initiative, which launched legal cases against scientists from the country in a bid to counter scientific espionage.\n\nIn China, too, foreign researchers are navigating an increasingly authoritarian, security-focused environment. They have not faced a targeted campaign such as the China Initiative, and many still feel welcomed in the country. But tough regulations following the COVID-19 pandemic, new data laws and other restrictions pose challenges.\n\nUS and China sign new science pact — but with severe restrictions\n\n“There used to be a lot more foreigners, including foreign scientists, in China before COVID,” says an overseas researcher in Beijing, who did not want to be named because of uncertainty about how authorities might react. “So many friends left in the last five years.” But the researcher has a great job, which has kept them from leaving. “I love it here,” they say.\n\nStatistics on foreign researchers in China are hard to come by, but the number is thought to be relatively small. Halldór Berg Harðarson, who lived in Beijing and until last year ran Euraxess, a platform supporting European researchers in China, has analysed author names on scholarly publications and estimates that there are 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers in the country who have a PhD. By contrast, there are estimated to be at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nLockdown worries\n\nThe Chinese government’s strict management of the pandemic is one reason this number is low and has fallen over the past few years. China prevented foreigners who left from returning during parts of 2020, and imposed ultra-strict lockdown measures in 2022. “The way that they dealt with it from the beginning was not very conducive to keeping foreign talent,” says Harðarson, who now lives in Brussels. He returned to Europe for family and career reasons.\n\nA Euraxess survey found that by autumn 2022, 40–50% of foreign academics had left China, compared with 2019 figures. “It became very restrictive, really quickly,” says Harðarson. “That was a big factor.”\n\nThe anonymous researcher in Beijing recalls health officials calling in the middle of the night demanding that they take a new COVID-19 test after their previous test results were inconclusive.\n\nThe pandemic was “quite tough”, says another foreign academic in southern China, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely without needing approval from his research institution. The researcher says that foreigners experienced hostility because they were thought to be more likely to be infected with COVID-19 — for instance, some residents avoided sitting next to them on public transport. (China’s Ministry of Science and Technology did not respond to Nature’s request for comment about concerns about the impact of pandemic lockdowns.)\n\nChina’s strict restrictions during the COVID pandemic prompted an exodus of foreign researchers from China.Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nThe COVID-19 response gave foreign researchers a “dramatic realization” of how much control the Chinese state could exert, says Kārlis Rokpelnis, a Beijing-based social scientist with 15 years’ experience in China, who runs Euraxess and spoke to Nature in a personal capacity.\n\nData laws\n\nWhat’s more, over the past decade, China has implemented security-focused laws that have increased “vigilance” over whether academics in China can send potentially sensitive research overseas, says Annina Lattu, an open-science researcher at Peking University in Beijing. Many countries have data regulations. “But China’s laws, I would say, sit on the strictest and most ambiguous end of the spectrum.”\n\nUncertainty over these laws has scuppered some joint research projects. “I’ve heard about collaboration projects that didn’t pan out, because they were not able to reach a clear understanding with their Chinese counterparts,” says Harðarson.\n\nFor example, China’s Data Security Law, which covers all data types, including research data, can require official clearance to send certain information outside China. There is an exemption for academic data, unless they contain personal information or are deemed “important”; these require official checks before being exported. But what counts as “important” hasn’t yet been clarified, says Rogier Creemers, a specialist on Chinese data laws at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nSo far, the laws have mostly affected researchers working with medical data, says Rokpelnis. “I haven’t met anyone who said, ‘Oh, I wasn’t able to do my experiment,’” he says.\n\nVPN troubles\n\nAs in some other countries, posters warning of foreign spies have appeared in some Chinese research organizations, with a tip-off phone number. “The bad guy in the poster looked a lot like me,” says the researcher in southern China, recalling signage in his workplace. But, he says, “I haven’t felt anything about people accusing me of espionage.” In his experience, the Chinese companies he works with are less guarded about intellectual property than some UK firms he’s collaborated with.",

          "title": "ChatGPT for students: learners find creative new uses for chatbots",
          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "By the time her comprehensive exams rolled around in August 2024, Adriana Ivich had done nearly everything she could to prepare herself. To officially become a PhD student in biomedical informatics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Ivich needed to present her proposed research project and then meet with her committee for a closed-door grilling.\n\n“It’s definitely one of the hardest times to be a PhD student,” Ivich says. “I spent months — years really — preparing, but you still don’t know what they’re going to ask you.”\n\n‘Arms race with automation’: professors fret about AI-generated coursework\n\nShe could make an informed guess, however. Months before, she’d poured the biographies and publications of her five committee members into ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, and used it to create digital simulacrums of each person. She then fed the mimics her research proposal and asked the program to respond as her committee might, asking detailed questions and identifying gaps in her knowledge. The actual meeting “went pretty much like ChatGPT said it would,” says Ivich, who passed with flying colours.\n\nHer experience highlights just one of the many imaginative ways in which students are using generative AI. Unlike the ‘early days’ of two years ago, when using AI meant summarizing a paper or outlining an essay, students are now leaning into the tools’ ability to emulate human connection, turning chatbots into podcast hosts, language tutors, professors and even personal trainers.\n\n“I want professors to work with students assuming they’ll be using these models,” says Lily Lee, who is studying manufacturing and design engineering and music at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and is co-creator of the newsletter AI × Education. Although some educators worry about the erosion of critical-thinking skills, she says, “another way to look at it is that AI can help students learn more creatively, which helps them build their critical thinking as well.”\n\nA back-and-forth conversation\n\nWhen ChatGPT first appeared in November 2022, many educators and academic institutions responded with blanket bans, unsure whether these tools were more likely to spark innovation or cheating. The jury is still out on that, but administrators have started to relax some policies and give teachers greater freedom to direct when they can be used. How these tools are used, however, is often driven by students.\n\n“I’m pleasantly surprised at some of their creative uses,” says Victor Lee, a learning-sciences researcher at Stanford University in California who focuses on the intersections between AI and education.\n\nSix tips for better coding with ChatGPT\n\nLike Ivich, many students seem drawn to applications that showcase the ‘human’ side of programs such as ChatGPT and NotebookLM, an AI-powered interface from Google in Mountain View, California, for interpreting documents. Although early iterations of these tools required users to key in queries, newer versions allow people to speak into a microphone, enabling more-natural, organic conversations.\n\nSami Melhem, who is studying computer science at Texas A&M University in College Station, created his own chatbot, Class Primer, to tutor him. Built atop ChatGPT-4, the program begins by asking for details about a class, including a course description, learning outcomes, required textbooks and a syllabus. Then, it breaks down the course into ‘priming sessions’ spread out over the semester.\n\nMelhem now spends his Sunday afternoons familiarizing himself with a few weeks’ worth of material before the concepts are introduced in class. The bot lets Melhem engage with his lectures in different ways, such as by creating playful analogies or visual maps that link concepts and show how they connect over the semester. As a visual learner, Melhem says that the diagrams especially “help with understanding the subject as a whole”.\n\nOther students, such as Jan Bartkowiak, who is studying economics at Minerva University in San Francisco, California, have made chatbots that emulate famous historical figures to interrogate their thinking. In 2024, Bartkowiak wrote an essay on the Vietnam War and used this exercise to probe how historians or contemporary political figures, such as Henry Kissinger, who served as the United States national security adviser and secretary of state during the conflict, might have framed certain events.\n\n“You might want to quickly identify which book or philosopher supports your point, so instead of starting your research by digging deeply into those books, you can start with ChatGPT,” he says. “You can have back-and-forth conversations and ask clarifying questions, and that’s been very useful.”\n\nThree ways ChatGPT helps me in my academic writing\n\nThis ability to speak to chatbots has proven particularly helpful for students taking courses outside their main specialism — for instance, to attain skills that they need or want.\n\nElda Bengu is a psychology student at Arizona State University in Tempe, an institution that has embraced AI tools through an AI Innovation Challenge in partnership with OpenAI. As part of that effort, Bengu’s lecturer Christiane Reves created a chatbot called Language Buddy that Bengu has used to practise speaking German. Research shows that engaging in conversation is among the quickest ways to improve language skills, but students aren’t always able to say things in the clearest way or ramp up the complexity of their speaking. Language Buddy can.\n\nInitially sceptical, Bengu says that after testing how the app handled her first language, Turkish, she was pleasantly surprised with its performance. “I was able to have a conversation and even ask it to speak in a certain dialect or accent, which would be especially useful if you’re learning to live somewhere new.”\n\nMastering the calendar\n\nAnother space in which students have successfully channelled the usefulness of generative AI is in streamlining their workflows. By using AI as a type of personal assistant, tools can quickly pull together information, prepare schedules and free up precious time.",

          "authors": "Georgina Ferry",
          "abstract": "Against the Odds: Women Pioneers of Science John Gribbin and Mary Gribbin Icon Books (2025)\n\nWhat is it with toilets? In domestic households, men and women use the same ones without a fuss, but at some point in history it became etiquette for toilets in workplaces to be segregated. And in supposedly male environments, it meant that there simply weren’t any for women. It then became absurdly easy to use the lack of appropriate toilets as an excuse to deny women a role in those environments or, if they did take a job there, to make their lives difficult.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nToilets come up in several of the 12 stories selected for John and Mary Gribbin’s gallery of female pioneers in science, Against the Odds. In the opening years of the twentieth century, physicist Lise Meitner, banished to a basement because she wasn’t allowed to work in the chemistry laboratories of what was then the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin, had to use the toilets in a neighbouring restaurant. During the 1950s, computer pioneer Lucy Slater, while developing the operating system for an early computer at the University of Cambridge, UK, smashed the sanitary equivalent of a glass ceiling by simply using the men’s toilet (singing loudly to signal her presence). And in 1964, Vera Rubin became the first female astronomer who was officially allowed to use the big telescopes at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories in California, overturning a ban that had been partly, but explicitly, based on the lack of a women’s toilet.\n\nScience trailblazers\n\nCompared with unequal pay for the same work, the reality of men with fewer qualifications being promoted ahead of them and the frank refusal to recognize that a married woman with children might be capable of a career, the toilet issue was probably a trivial annoyance to these women. But it symbolizes how, for centuries, women have been considered unsuitable as scientists for reasons that have nothing to do with their ability or commitment.\n\nThe Gribbins’ aim is to “highlight the achievements of women who overcame the odds and achieved scientific success ... as society changed over about 150 years”. They don’t justify their selection, other than to note that the women featured (ordered by year of birth) collectively cover the period. But it is startling that physicist Chien-Shiung Wu is the only scientist who is not white or born in a Western country (and she spent most of her career in the United States). The ‘hidden figures’ — African American women who calculated trajectories for early NASA space missions — remain hidden. Many girls won’t find a role model who looks like them in the book.\n\nPhysicist Chien-Shiung Wu made instrumental contributions to the field of nuclear physics.Credit: IanDagnall Computing/Alamy\n\nWith that caveat, the Gribbins tell the stories with an adroit mix of anecdote and exposition. There is a bias towards physical sciences, perhaps reflecting John Gribbin’s background in astrophysics. Some of those featured (such as crystallographer Rosalind Franklin) are close to being household names, others (geophysicists Eunice Newton Foote and Inge Lehmann) are much less familiar. Three of the women (chemists Irène Joliot-Curie and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin and geneticist Barbara McClintock) won Nobel prizes; two (Meitner and Wu) should have done.\n\nSome of the women were less celebrated during their lifetimes. It took 100 years for historians to uncover the work done by Foote, as a wealthy ‘lady amateur’ working in her home lab in New York state. She demonstrated that water vapour and carbon dioxide absorbed energy from sunlight and so could increase global temperatures. Her 1856 paper included the statement that if “the air had mixed with it a larger proportion [of CO2] than at present, an increased temperature ... would have necessarily resulted”. Three years later, John Tyndall, unaware of Foote’s work, performed the experiments that are generally credited with establishing the nature of the ‘greenhouse effect’.\n\nEqual partners?",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring his PhD in the United States, computer scientist Vukosi Marivate discovered both the power of inclusive spaces and the sense of isolation created by non-diverse gatherings. Since then, Marivate, now a data scientist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, has been building a critical mass of African data scientists — so that their voices can be part of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\n\nIn 2016, Marivate and his fellow researchers established the Deep Learning Indaba conference (in Bantu languages, indaba means a consultation or an important discussion) to help to build a local community around machine learning and AI. The 2023 conference, held in Accra, Ghana, attracted 800 researchers from more than 62 countries, half of which were in Africa.\n\nTrekking across Nepal to bridge its gender gap in the sciences\nMarivate also co-founded Masakhane, a grass-roots community of more than 1,000 researchers, software developers and language specialists from 30 African countries, which aims to galvanize research in natural language processing in African languages, for and by Africans. Natural language processing uses machine-learning techniques to process text and speech, for purposes such as translation and transcription. Historically, Africa’s 2,000 languages have been neglected in digital products. One of Masakhane’s projects createdbespoke scientific terms for African languages, and the community continues to generate African-led AI research groups and companies on the continent.\n\nWhen did you realize that you wanted to tackle the lack of diversity in science?\n\nDuring my PhD at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, I remember going to the International Conference on Machine Learning, one of the world’s top meetings on the subject. I walked into a room filled with people and on the other side of the giant hall was the only other Black person there. It messes with your mind and you start asking, “What's happening here? Why are there only two of us?” You feel as if you do not belong.\n\nThat’s why I need to ensure that I open doors to others. It’s about access. How do we make sure that the people who are applying for international funding or fellowships better represent the African continent, and help them to realize that they can be excellent, like anybody else?\n\nI also learnt that it doesn’t necessarily need to be me who helps them: it’s about using the network, asking who else is working in these subject areas — in the same country or on the continent — and then asking how I can connect students who are in those spaces. The Deep Learning Indaba and Masakhane are networks that are much, much bigger than any individual.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work important?\n\n'Anyone engaging in scientific practice shouldn’t be excluded’: the United Kingdom’s only Black chemistry professor, on diversity\nOnce you start engaging with science in a societal way, you see that the people who are really pushing for innovation to come into their communities tend to be very different from those who are chasing the highest levels of prestige of science.\n\nI think the best of us are still to come. Young people on the African continent are going to do so much more than us, older scientists. They have better networks; they have more global recognition of the work that they do. We’re going to have amazing work come from these young people and others who are not typically represented in these spaces.\n\nWhat obstacles do Africans face in global AI and computing spaces?\n\nThe AI researcher archetype tends to be male, white and from the global north. We’re trying to say that your race, disability, gender and even your geographical area shouldn’t matter. We want people to feel comfortable, so that they can be themselves and bring their full selves into AI and computing spaces, without changing themselves to fit into the system.\n\nThe other barriers include funding and the pressures on students. For example, many South African students are likely to be breadwinners at home and are often pushed towards non-research industry jobs. How do we make sure that the ones that have that spark find places in the discipline and have options?\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor?\n\nOne is Tshilidzi Marwala, a South African AI engineer and rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Back in 2006, I was studying engineering at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) in Johannesburg, and wanted to work for a big engineering company and make money. Marwala said, “There are more interesting things out there in the world that you might want to look at.” His laboratory was at Wits at the time, and there I saw people who looked like me, who had backgrounds similar to mine. That experience changes you. He was also so generous with everyone, asking, “How do we open opportunities for you?” That was a major turning point in my scientific life.",

Although the disruption does not seem to have been deliberate, and the service has since been restored, the episode highlights scientists’ reliance on the website and left many anguished about its future.\n\nPubMed “is one of the primary platforms that health-care providers, researchers and students rely on to access peer-reviewed medical literature”, says Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious-diseases physician who studies global health in Dallas, Texas. The database, which indexes more than 37 million articles, is maintained by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThe NIH told Nature in an e-mail that, on 1 March “some of NIH public-web services experienced service disruptions”, but all services were restored on 2 March. “NIH is committed to resilient and open access to PubMed and other NIH web services,” the team wrote.\n\nBut Kuppalli says that any disruption — even if temporary — raises concerns about how researchers access essential scientific information. “It also serves as a reminder of the need for contingency plans, such as alternative repositories or offline access to critical research, to ensure that health-care providers and researchers are not left without crucial information when they need it most,” she says.\n\nAlthough alternative databases exist, “PubMed stands out because it is a freely accessible, comprehensive and government-supported database that aggregates a vast amount of biomedical literature”, says Kuppalli.\n\nGone dark\n\nOn 1 March, some researchers noticed the site had stopped working. “Omg, did Pubmed go dark???” wrote Thanh Neville, a physician and pulmonology researcher at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, California, on the social-media platform Bluesky. “I hope and pray it comes back soon!” wrote Madhukar Pai, a public-health researcher at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.\n\nSome researchers worried that the site had been taken down by US President Donald Trump’s administration. Over the past few weeks, content on several federal government websites has been withdrawn or modified in response to executive orders issued by the Trump administration.\n\nBut people in some locations could still access the site, says Bert Hubert, a software developer based in The Hague, the Netherlands, and co-founder of the software firm Power DNS, leading him to conclude that the site had not been intentionally shut down. “Then it would be really gone for everyone,” he says, as had happened with the US Agency for International Development website.\n\nIt’s still not clear what caused the problem, says Hubert. “There should be a very serious investigation into how this could have happened and why it took two days because this is worldwide critical infrastructure.”\n\nAlternative databases",

          "abstract": "Two new AI tools check for errors in research papers including in the calculations, methodology and references.Credit: Jose A. Bernat Bacete/Getty\n\nLate last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped – a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.\n\nThe incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”\n\nThe other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale.\n\nBoth projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.\n\nThe projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.\n\nOthers add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.\n\nAI sleuths\n\nMany researchers have dedicated their careers to spotting integrity concerns in papers – and tools to check certain facets of papers already exist. But advocates hope that AI could carry out a wider range of checks in a single shot and handle a larger volume of papers.\n\nBoth the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.\n\nThe systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.\n\nThe rate of false positives, instances when the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.\n\nSo far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review.

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Microsoft unveiled its 'Majorana 1' quantum chip in February.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nA physicist has cast doubt on a test that underlies a high-profile claim by Microsoft to have created the first ‘topological qubits’, a long-sought goal of the company’s quantum computing effort. The critique comes amid mounting speculation about the validity of Microsoft’s claim.\n\nMicrosoft announced the breakthrough, which could lead to a quantum computer more resistant to information loss than with other approaches, on 19 February. Without a peer-reviewed paper backing up the claim, some researchers were sceptical. An accompanying paper in Nature described a method to measure the read-out from future topological qubits, but did not offer proof of their existence1.\n\n“While the Nature paper outlined our approach, it does not speak to our progress,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. The paper was submitted almost a year before it was published and since then “tremendous progress has occurred”, they said. (Nature’s news team is independent of its journals team.)\n\nIn the latest critique, posted as a preprint2, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, UK, raises concerns about a test that Microsoft uses to look for Majoranas, so-far undiscovered quasiparticles arising from the collective behaviour of electrons that are needed for the topological qubits to work.\n\nKnown as the topological gap protocol (TGP), the test is not mentioned in the 19 February Microsoft announcement. But the company has subsequently indicated to Nature’s news team, and in a comment online, that it created the topological qubits using the TGP. “Since the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit are not there,” says Legg.\n\nChetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft’s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, stands by the qubit claim. “The criticism can be summarized as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that,” he says.\n\nA Majorana test\n\nMajoranas have previously proved elusive. Several claimed sightings later proved to be Majorana mimics, in some cases leading to retractions.\n\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers posted a preprint reporting that the TGP could indirectly identify Majoranas with ‘high probability’; the preprint was later published in Physical Review B (PRB)3. The test relies on electronic measurements of microscopic sandwiches of ultracold metal. If the measurement exhibits a specific feature characteristic of Majoranas, the device ‘passes’ and is said to host the elusive particles.\n\nLegg and his colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland went on to report that the test could be fooled by false positives, doppelgangers with the electronic features of Majoranas that lacked their useful properties4.\n\nIn his latest critique, Legg reports further flaws with the protocol. Examining data in the PRB paper, he saw large variations in the external conditions, such as the range of magnetic field strengths, when electronic measurements were taken. The test was designed to measure the intrinsic properties of the device — and thus whether it contained Majoranas. Instead, Legg found that varying conditions made the test an inconsistent weathervane.\n\nNayak does not accept this criticism. “The ranges come from an initial scan we describe, and we always analyze the full data,” he says.\n\nAnother problem, says Legg, is that a key parameter in the code that implements the protocol, which Microsoft shared publicly, differs from the description in the PRB paper. When asked by Nature’s news team about the issue, Nayak said: “Legg claims there’s a difference between our described protocol and the implemented code. This is incorrect, so this is a non-issue.” Legg says that Nayak previously acknowledged this difference in an e-mail to him and planned to issue a correction, but changed his mind.\n\nLegg’s critique is “certainly valid”, says Carlo Beenakker, a theoretical physicist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, although he remains “enthusiastic” about Microsoft’s goal of creating topological qubits. “I have a deep respect for people who basically go out and somehow are not distracted by others who say, ‘I don't believe it,’” he says.\n\nAnton Akhmerov, a theoretical physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that “Legg's critique requires a public response from the Microsoft researchers”. A Microsoft spokesperson said that they would officially respond to Legg's critique when contacted by editors of PRB.",

          "title": "Use your research to beat health inequities: four strategies from experts",
          "authors": "Lynn Hendricks, Raeka Aiyar, Uma Palanisamy, Nyasha Phanisa Sithole",
          "abstract": "In the past few weeks, global health research programmes have been shaken by events in the United States. These include the country’s intention to withdraw from the World Health Organization, a freeze on foreign aid from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. HIV programmes are closing down, trials of malaria drugs have ceased and academic societies and universities have scrubbed their websites of mentions of DEI.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, continued efforts to reduce health inequities remain crucial. In the United States, for example, Black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than are white women1. Globally, most clinical trials and biomedical studies focus on men of European ancestry, hindering efforts to improve the health of other communities. Under-represented groups struggle to access health care that meets their needs.\n\nHere, four experts share insights into how to win the trust of under-represented communities to conduct research that can help to achieve health equity.\n\nLYNN HENDRICKS: Embrace unconventional methods\nHealth researcher Lynn Hendricks uses creative arts to engage with communities that might not otherwise wish to be involved in research.Credit: Stefan Els, Stellenbosch University\n\nInclusivity in health research means embracing research styles that best meet a population’s needs and priorities. Sometimes that might mean adopting approaches that don’t look much like typical scientific experiments.\n\nAs a public-health researcher, I’ve found that the creative arts are a great way to connect with communities that might otherwise be disenfranchised from science. Art can cross language and cultural boundaries and can be harnessed to discuss emotions, experiences and challenges. For instance, I’ve used craft and digital storytelling to explore the lives of people who grew up on the streets in South Africa, who do not usually trust anyone easily.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nArt can enable participants to be co-researchers. Part of one study I conducted set out to fill in evidence gaps about the barriers that prevent young women living with perinatal HIV from taking daily antiretrovirals, with the participants driving the project2. Together, we used photographs and videos to study their lives; drawing and collage to identify the key challenges they face; and dance and documentary-making to decide what we wanted to share with others (see go.nature.com/4t6zh5j).\n\nSome might say that these approaches cannot provide the same concrete findings as conventional methods. A more-typical study might have explored the barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. By contrast, our work revealed a complex net of intersecting environmental factors that had not previously been considered — such as sounds and objects in the women’s surroundings, the tolls taken by hazardous trips to the clinic and the unpleasant sensation of taking the medicine.\n\nEthics boards should be more receptive to participant-led research. The HIV project was questioned by the ethics committee, which wanted specific objectives and methodologies — the typical route for getting ethical clearance. But truly inclusive research requires a fundamental shift in power dynamics, recognizing the importance of participant comfort and agency to dictate the course of the research.\n\nResearchers and institutions should embrace the fact that unconventional research can lead to unconventional research outputs. As well as academic publications, our project produced videos, art exhibitions and photo essays. These outputs should be accepted as valuable products of research. Indeed, they can be more useful than papers when it comes to engaging stakeholders outside science — such as policymakers and local governments — because they are easily understandable by all.\n\nRAEKA AIYAR: Rebuild trust with empathy\nRaeka Aiyar (left) hears from a patient advocate at a panel discussion on health equity.Credit: The New York Stem Cell Foundation\n\nMany minoritized communities share a justifiable distrust of science, because of the long history of exploitation and harm by researchers and physicians. The onus is on scientists to rebuild the trust in these relationships, so that we can engage these communities as partners — not subjects.\n\nI learnt the hard way how even well-intentioned science can amplify mistrust. In 2013, I co-authored the first reported genome sequence of a HeLa cell line3, one of the most widely used cell lines in biomedical science. The scientific community initially shared our excitement about the value of these data for genetic research. But we failed to anticipate the views of the family of Henrietta Lacks, the Black woman whose tumour sample was used to create HeLa cells in the 1950s without her knowledge.\n\nWhat Gives You Hope for Health Equity?\n\nThe Lacks family responded with frustration and concern about how the genome data could affect their privacy, so we pulled the data down from the public domain. Ultimately, the US National Institutes of Health — which had funded a separate study of the HeLa genome — engaged with the family over several months, and we reached an agreement to restore the data under controlled access.\n\nThere are many lessons to be learnt from our oversight. Before beginning a study, scientists should always ask: how will the communities that are affected by the research perceive it? Could the way in which the data are presented amplify a fear or harmful narrative? Can the research design be improved to bring more benefits to the communities?\n\nFinding the answers starts with empathy. Scientists and science communicators should listen to the stories of the people behind the data. Understanding our own privileges and biases in the light of diverse perspectives makes us better, more objective scientists.\n\nCommunities that might be affected by research should be asked for input respectfully, early and often. We as researchers should share our hopes for what our research will achieve; listen and respond to concerns; continue the dialogue if communities are willing; and desist if they are not — even if that means stopping a project.\n\nFor some communities, letting scientists continue to benefit more from their data than the communities do will be a non-starter. An Indigenous community whose land was stolen, for example, might be understandably reticent to openly share their genome data. Given the current upheaval in US funding, it is urgent that funders and institutions train and incentivize scientists to learn from these communities and build more effective research programmes, together.\n\nBelieving that everyone deserves to benefit from research is not sufficient to rebuild trust with communities that have been abused in the name of science. Open-hearted engagement with diverse communities and responsible communication of science — including honest reckoning with systemic discrimination — are crucial, now more than ever.\n\nUMA PALANISAMY: Centre communities throughout projects\nUma Palanisamy helped to develop an app that uses real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians.\n\nAs researchers, it can be easy to fall into the trap of thinking that because we are trained in scientific processes and well acquainted with the literature in our field, we are ideally placed to design experiments and interventions. But what we think will work best is not as important as the stakeholders we want to help. Scientists must be willing to listen, adapt and alter research plans, to suit a community’s needs.\n\nThe Deaf community in Malaysia has a unique language and cultural identity. This causes problems for Deaf people when it comes to accessing health-care services — with sign-language interpreters in short supply, Deaf people can find themselves trying to explain a complex medical condition to a physician who can’t understand them, and whom they cannot hear. I’ve been involved in developing an app, called Deaf In Touch Everywhere (DITE), to improve health-care access for Deaf Malaysians by providing real-time sign language interpretation services through video conferencing, among other support services.\n\nHealth of people who are displaced in their own countries is a neglected global crisis",

And although women still account for only about 35% of the STEMM workforce, research has shown that they are more likely to excel when given access to mentoring, support and guidance from other women with similar lived experiences (see go.nature.com/416cjkb).\n\nTo mark International Women’s Day, held each year on 8 March, six previous winners of Nature’s annual Inspiring Women in Science Award nominated someone from their own lives who deserves recognition for their contributions to research and support for other women in the sciences.

I first met Sharon at the University of Cambridge, UK, when I was an undergraduate student aiming to pursue a PhD and then return to Thailand. She offered me invaluable advice, including how to navigate the complexities of conducting research in Thailand and learning to take a helicopter view rather than focusing on individual challenges. She has been my mentor ever since, truly believing in my ability to succeed.\n\nWomen in science\n\nA true pioneer in public-health genomics, Sharon foresaw the transformative potential of sequencing technologies to combat infectious diseases. When genomic sequencing was still emerging, she led the way, setting a standard for its application in global health. Her leadership of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (a group of UK academic institutions and public-health agencies in operation from April 2020 until March 2023) was extraordinary, enabling the United Kingdom to track SARS-CoV-2 lineages with precision, which provided crucial insights into the emergence and spread of variants, and aided vaccine development.\n\nSharon is a dedicated mentor, inspiring people from all backgrounds, including those from low- and middle-income countries, to push boundaries and give back to their communities. Her journey serves as a powerful reminder that talent exists everywhere, but opportunities do not. It inspires me to make the most of every opportunity that I get.\n\nSIERIN LIM\nSierin Lim advocates for women in STEMM alongside her bioengineering research — nominated by Hortense Le Ferrand (inset).Credit: 52 Photography\n\nJob: bioengineer at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.\n\nResearch focus: design and engineering of biomaterials for health and the environment.\n\nNominated by: 2023 winner Hortense Le Ferrand, a materials scientist at NTU, Singapore.\n\nH.L.F: Sierin Lim has been an active advocate for women in STEMM for more than a decade, starting and overseeing many programmes at our university on top of her full-time role as an associate professor. It’s only in the past couple of years, as I’ve started getting involved in planning events and courses myself, that I realized the amount of work, courage and energy that Sierin puts in to make these things happen.\n\nSeeing how hard she works inspired me to establish a joint workshop between NTU and Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Indiana. For the past four years, US students have come to our university in Singapore to explore my research focus, biomimicry. This is a great opportunity for students to practise intercultural skills and learn about a research topic outside their curriculum.\n\nOn top of all this, Sierin is also a charming person. She’s learning French, which demands a lot of time and motivation, and she takes great care of her mother, often going home to Jakarta. Everyone at the university knows Sierin, but she deserves a pedestal.\n\nYOON-KYOUNG CHO\nBiomedical engineer Yoon-Kyoung Cho developed lab-on-a-disc technology for academia and industry — nominated by Kiana Aran (inset).Credit: Yoon-Kyoung Cho; Kiana Aran\n\nJob: biomedical engineer at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), South Korea.\n\nResearch focus: lab-on-a-chip-based diagnostics, microfluidics and nanomedicine.\n\nNominated by: 2021 winner Kiana Aran, a biomedical entrepreneur and bioengineer at University of California, San Diego. (In February Aran also won the inaugural Sony Women in Technology award, in partnership with Nature.)\n\nK.A.: Yoon-Kyoung Cho embodies a unique blend of scientific brilliance, entrepreneurial spirit and calm leadership. I first met her at a conference in China in 2019 when I was a new professor. Initially, I felt out of place among the leading international faculty members invited to this small, exclusive gathering. She immediately stood out for her warm, encouraging demeanour, taking the time to engage with me about her groundbreaking research on centrifugal microfluidics, but also making me feel included in discussions in a group of highly accomplished scientists. Our conversation left a lasting impression. Since then, she has excelled in academia and translated her lab-on-a-disc technology into the real world, founding successful companies.\n\nIt is rare for scientists to successfully bridge the gap between academia and industry, because the mindsets required for each are distinct. Cho’s success in founding companies shows her determination to ensure that her laboratory’s research isn’t just in journals, but provides a tangible benefit to society. But what truly draws me to her is her leadership style and her genuine care for her trainees’ well-being. One practice I’ve consciously adopted from her is an emphasis on creating an inclusive and encouraging environment. I strive to approach mentoring with the same care and attentiveness, to ensure that my students feel supported in both their academic and personal growth.\n\nADA YONATH\nAda Yonath, who won a share of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry — nominated by Samira Asgari (inset).Credit: Miguel Lorenzo, Nathan Maddigan\n\nJob: crystallographer and structural biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.\n\nResearch focus: chemical and structural biology of ribosomes.\n\nNominated by: 2020 winner Samira Asgari, a computational biologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.\n\nS.A.: I had the privilege of meeting Ada during the 2014 Global Young Scientists Summit, held in Singapore. I still remember how she spoke openly about the personal challenges she faced, her funding struggles, and the scepticism from peers while pursuing her groundbreaking work on the structure of the ribosome—a discovery that earned her a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009, with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz. She didn’t sugar-coat the realities of conducting ambitious science, nor did she shy away from discussing the obstacles she overcame. These include being dismissed and even ridiculed by some of her colleagues, the struggle to fund her early research determining the 3D structure, and therefore the mechanics, of the ribosome; and the strain that her career placed on her personal relationships. Ada’s story is a powerful reminder that resilience and a clear sense of purpose are essential to walking new paths as a scientist.\n\nResearchers don’t talk enough about how the measurement of scientific output has shifted to the amount of funding a researcher can secure early in their career, and the impact factor of the journals we publish in. As a result, most scientists in their early career now focus on writing low-risk grants with predictable results, instead of aiming for innovative, collaborative research that can lead to breakthroughs. Ada’s research inspired an entirely new field of science that continues to produce meaningful discoveries today.\n\nRACHEL KARCHIN\nComputational biologist Rachel Karchin’s mentorship has inspired others to have lifelong science careers — nominated by Jean Fan (inset).Credit: Rachel Karchin; Will Kirk\n\nJob: computational biologist at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.",

          "abstract": "Students in a biology laboratory around 1899 at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, a historically Black university in Greensboro. Credit: Buyenlarge/Getty\n\nThroughout the twentieth century and beyond, the record of colleges and universities set up to provide higher-education opportunities for Black students in the United States could be viewed as one of failure. Their mission was to produce scholars to create economic, social and political freedom for African Americans. But, in the nearly 200 years since the first historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) opened their doors, Black people in the country still have not achieved economic parity with white people.\n\nSpringboard to science: the institutions that shaped Black researchers’ careers\n\nYet this failure cannot be laid at the feet of the Black universities’ leadership. No strategy that they could have deployed would have made a difference. The suppression of African American achievement was intentional and systematic. It occurred because many of those who controlled white society (particularly in the former Confederate states) never wanted African Americans or their institutions to achieve social equality1 — and I argue that this is not a priority for the second administration of US President Donald Trump either. This does not mean that all white people are racists: indeed, many have taken an active role in the fight against structural racism. However, the majority have either bought into or been unwilling to take action against a social and political system that has and continues to deny opportunity to African Americans2.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the majority of this group accepted the inferiority of people of African descent as socially agreed ‘fact’. This allowed powerful institutions to discriminate against African Americans. For example, redlining, which occurred between 1934 and 1968, became a widespread practice in the United States to deny loans and housing to African Americans, and it led to different capacities for accumulating wealth. Today, owing in large part to such policies, the median wealth of white families is about 6.5 times greater than that of African American families3.\n\nHistoric inequality in Black education\n\nI have reviewed the history of African American higher education in the context of evolutionary science4, but the essential details of the story are the same across scientific disciplines. The second Morrill Land-Grant Act, enacted in 1890, established 19 HBCUs in the US South to provide opportunities for Black students. But these institutions and the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Act institutions, which educated white students, were never funded equitably (see ‘HBCUs: a history of underfunding’).\n\nJoseph L. Graves Jr shows students in his evolutionary-medicine class how to construct spreadsheets to analyse models of natural selection.\n\nCompared with their historically white institution (HWI) counterparts, HBCUs admit a disproportionate share of students from struggling school districts, a result of historical inequalities in primary and secondary education in the country. Yet, state appropriations to HWIs are larger than those to HBCUs in the US South. For example, in 2021–22 the state budget appropriation per undergraduate student at the North Carolina State University (NCSU), an HWI in Raleigh, was $35,513 per student, but at my institution, the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCATSU) in Greensboro, an HBCU, it was $19,083. This means that for every dollar spent on a student at the NCATSU, $1.86 is spent on a student at the NCSU.\n\nThis situation is common across the US Southeast, as documented in a 2023 report on the status of HBCUs5 from the Century Foundation, a think tank in New York City. Between 1987 and 2020, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas underfunded their HBCUs by $8.5 billion compared with their HWIs, according to letters to the governors of these states, sent in September 2023 by Miguel Cardona, secretary of education and Thomas Vilsack, secretary of agriculture. The NCSU and the NCATSU have a $2-billion funding disparity, one letter said. The federal government has never forced states to fund white and Black higher education equitably, and it has never denied funds to states that continue discriminatory funding practices.\n\nBiden must keep funding pledge to historically Black colleges and universities\n\nThis historical underfunding has produced an environment in which HCBU faculty members have to shoulder disproportionately heavy teaching loads, advise more students — many of whom are underprepared — and operate in facilities that are ill-suited for twenty-first century instruction and research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). HBCUs operate on shoestring budgets, so they have fewer resources for research, teaching and student and community programmes. Owing to budgetary shortfalls, administrators at HBCUs often have to delay purchasing or repairing much-needed technology and infrastructure. For example, in January 2024, the central heating plant at the NCATSU failed, so the institution had to house students in hotels or send them home.",

          "authors": "Laurie Udesky",
          "abstract": "Almost 40% of biologists who identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming report experiencing offensive, intimidating and hostile behaviour at work, a survey finds. So, too, do nearly one in five biologist respondents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or queer, according to the study of more than 1,400 researchers, which its authors describe as the largest survey so far of professional life experiences among LGBTQ+ biologists1.\n\n“One person experiencing that is one person too many,” says lead author Katelyn Cooper, a biology education researcher at Arizona State University in Tempe, who has been recognized for her research into making science more inclusive for LGBTQ+ people.\n\nThose who identified as transgender or gender-nonconforming (TGNC) were much more likely to have lower morale and less of a sense of belonging and comfort in professional settings and workplaces than were both their straight peers and lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer (LGBQ) biologists who identify as cisgender — their sex assigned at birth, the survey found.\n\nThe study was published on the bioRxiv preprint server in late January; it has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nThe survey was distributed by e-mail and social media in June and July 2023, through five professional societies, namely the American Society for Cell Biology, the Biophysical Society, the Genetics Society of America, the International Society for Stem Cell Research and the Society for the Advancement of Biology Education Research. The study team obtained responses from 1,419 biologists, 486 (34%) of whom identified as LGBTQ+, including 153 as TGNC.\n\nRespondents were mostly white (64%), were university faculty members (49%), and based in the United States (68%). Twenty per cent of respondents were university staff, lecturers or postdoctoral researchers, 15% were graduate or undergraduate students, and 11% held positions outside of academia. Eleven per cent of respondents identified as Asian, followed by 8% who identified as Hispanic, Latin or of Spanish origin. Outside the United States, respondents were mostly based in the United Kingdom (4.6%), Canada (4.2%) or Japan (1.8%). In all, the survey drew responses from 44 countries.\n\nGrowing hostility\n\nThe survey was conducted before the current Trump administration in the United States issued a flurry of executive orders cancelling diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and seeking to ban the use of gender-related language by federal agencies. But it came amid a background of increasing political attacks against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn 2023, when Cooper and her co-authors distributed the survey, 88 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation were enacted in the United States, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The LGBTQ+ community is afforded greater legal protections and acceptance in many parts of Europe, but an anti-LGBTQ+ disinformation backlash, reportedly orchestrated and financed mainly by Russia, seems to be growing there, as well.\n\nJess McLaughlin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who identifies as trans and non-binary, says that although they didn’t take the survey, they aren’t surprised by the number of trans biologists who reported hostile, intimidating or offensive behavior. “It’s something we’ve known anecdotally,” McLaughlin says — and, for them, through personal experience.\n\nWhile teaching during their PhD at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, despite wearing men’s suits to class, McLaughlin was criticized in student evaluations as unprofessional. “The problem to them was that I was the one wearing the suit,” they say.\n\nBut an incident near campus pushed McLaughlin to the brink and contributed to their decision to wrap up their PhD as quickly as possible and leave Oklahoma: “I was running and somebody was chasing me and yelling slurs,” they say.\n\nMcLaughlin’s experience aligns with the survey, in which 50% of TGNC respondents reported experiencing “exclusionary, intimidating, offensive or hostile conduct” outside of work.\n\nAt the same time, the survey documented a sharp increase, relative to a 2019 survey (also led by Cooper, who then was at the University of Central Florida in Orlando), in the proportion of LGBTQ biologists who were out to their undergraduate students (76% versus 20%).\n\nMaeve McLaughlin, a molecular microbiologist at the University of Michigan in Flint, who identifies as transgender, says that she goes out of her way to make her students feel comfortable, including highlighting the work of researchers affiliated with the group 500 Queer Scientists.\n\nDoing so, she says, makes it easier for students to come forward to seek guidance. “I have a lot of trans and gender-nonconforming students who are more comfortable asking questions,” she says.\n\nA constant push",

          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Gibson Green/Alamy\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has begun a mass termination of research grants that fund active scientific projects because they no longer meet “agency priorities”.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nNIH staff members have been instructed to identify and potentially cancel grants for projects studying transgender populations, gender identity, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the scientific workforce, environmental justice and any other research that might be perceived to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity, according to documents and an audio recording that Nature has obtained. Grants that allot funding to universities in China and those relating to climate change are also under scrutiny.\n\nAt least 16 termination letters have already been sent out, says Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who has been tracking them. And hundreds more are coming, say two NIH officials, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n“It’s extremely alarming that grants that have been vetted by the scientific community and deemed important and impactful to understand the world are now being cancelled because of political ideology,” says Lisa Fazio, a cognitive psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who studies misinformation. “For all this talk about free speech, this is direct censorship of scientific research.”\n\nThe actions come in the second month of US President Donald Trump’s presidency; on his first day in office, Trump issued executive orders “restoring freedom of speech” to “the American people” and “defending women from gender ideology extremism” by banning the allocation of federal funding to projects that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the grant terminations, their legality or how many the agency anticipated sending out.\n\nCategories for cutting\n\nAlthough many NIH research grants run for longer, scientists generally receive their funding one year at a time and are required to submit a progress report to the agency annually. NIH staff members then review this report and can issue a continuation of funding.\n\nThe agency, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has now asked its employees to review new and ongoing projects for any DEI-related activities and to place them in one of four categories: projects that solely support DEI-related activities (category one), projects that partially support these activities (category two), projects that do not support these activities but include some DEI-related language (category three) and projects that do not support any DEI-related activities (category four).\n\nGuidance document obtained by Nature that describes the four categories all active NIH grants should now be grouped into (see below for PDF).\n\nThe NIH’s 27 institutes and centres should not issue awards for research in category one, according to a guidance document obtained by Nature and sent to some employees this week. Category-two research must be renegotiated with the lead researcher or institution on the grant to remove any DEI-related activities. If the work cannot be renegotiated, the institute must seek to terminate the project, the document says.\n\nCategory-three research can continue unimpeded as long as any DEI-related language is stripped from the application or progress report. Category-four research can proceed as usual.\n\nAlthough the guidance document focuses on DEI-related activities, it also includes an appendix with examples of other types of research that the NIH no longer supports. For example, projects funding research in China and those that touch on “transgender issues” will be terminated.\n\nThis guidance was drafted by the deputy director of the NIH’s Office of Extramural Research (OER), Liza Bundesen, and approved by acting NIH director Matthew Memoli, according to an e-mail that Nature has obtained. Bundesen, who took the helm of the OER less than three weeks ago, is leaving the agency on 7 March, according to an NIH official who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThe guidance does not specify how to determine whether a project is discriminatory, which has caused confusion and anxiety among agency staff, another NIH official says. Many fear losing their jobs, a factor that might lead to over-interpretation of the guidance, which would hold back more science than “needs to be” affected, they say. “For example, is a grant providing culturally appropriate care specifically to Hispanic and Latino populations ‘discrimination’?”\n\nAppendices obtained by Nature describing research that NIH no longer supports (see below for PDF).\nLost data\n\nTara McKay, who studies the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) at Vanderbilt University, received an e-mail from the NIH late on 28 February. It said that the agency was pulling funding for her project tracking the health of more than 1,200 LGBT+ adults in the United States.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nMcKay’s study aims to understand sources of stress and resilience for LGBT+ people, and to conduct cognitive screening and collect blood samples to understand how they are ageing over the span of a decade. “Longitudinal research gets its value from time points,” she says. Cancelling a grant part way through means that follow-up data will be lost, she says, and “it devalues the earlier money spent”.\n\nThe e-mail that McKay received said that her grant did not satisfy certain criteria and pointed to its inclusion of “transgender issues”, saying that such research programmes are “often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans”. This is the same wording given in the internal NIH guidance document.\n\nMcKay says that her project does not centre on the experience of transgender people, but merely includes people who identify as such. “That is not a population we’re willing to leave behind in our work,” she adds.",

          "abstract": "Washington DC. Boston, Massachusetts. Denver, Colorado. Seattle, Washington. Trenton, New Jersey\n\nThousands of researchers and supporters of science protested in more than 30 cities across the United States and Europe today against actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump to cut the US scientific workforce and slash spending on research worldwide.\n\nUS science is under threat ― now scientists are fighting back\n\nThe mood was defiant at many of the rallies, where chants of “Scientists will not be silenced”, “Facts over fear” and “What do we want? Peer review! When do we want it? Now!” were heard.\n\nQuoting musician Bob Marley, Rush Holt Jr, former chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, told the crowd in Trenton, New Jersey, “get up, stand up”.\n\nIn the crowd at Boston’s rally, Ana-Maria Vranceanu, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School whose work helps people with dementia, chronic pain and other conditions, said: “This is the time to actually stop this, before things get really bad.”\n\nOver the past month, “I’ve been waiting for someone to do something,” said Abraham Flaxman, a global-health metrics researcher at the University of Washington who attended the Seattle rally. But “it’s dawned on me: nobody is coming to save us. We’re going to have to save ourselves.”\n\nMarie Walde, a biophysicist at the Roscoff Biological Station in France, posted about a rally she attended to the social-media platform BlueSky, saying: “In solidarity with our colleagues in the US, researchers and citizens all over France are protesting today for science and knowledge as a public good.”\n\n‘A five-alarm fire’\n\nThe Stand Up for Science rallies are a response to the Trump administration’s siege of the US research enterprise. Since taking office in January, Trump and his team have laid off, and in some cases then tried to rehire, thousands from US science agencies, whose jobs involved nuclear safety, bird flu surveillance, extreme-weather forecasting and more. The administration has also attempted to freeze research grants at science-funding agencies including the US National Science Foundation. And it has tried to slash ‘overhead costs’ awarded to biomedical research institutions by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — although federal judges have since blocked this action. This week, Nature revealed that, under Trump, the NIH — the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research — has begun mass termination of active research grants for projects studying topics, including transgender health, that do not align with the administration’s political ideology.\n\nProtesters took to the streets in Paris, to stand in solidarity with US scientists.Credit: Mohamad Salaheldin Abdelg Alsayed/Anadolu via Getty\n\nBewildered by these moves and wondering why people weren’t visibly ‘standing up for science’, five US scientists decided to organize today’s rallies. “This is a five-alarm fire,” says co-organizer Colette Delawalla, a psychologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “If we don’t set down our work and turn attention to these matters”, and try to make policy changes, “there will not be science for us to come back to,” she says.\n\nBut the organizers know from past protests, such as the international March for Science in 2017 — which was organized by researchers critical of policies from Trump’s first presidency — that rallies alone will not effect change. “It’s not a one-and-done thing,” says Samantha Goldstein, who studies women’s health at the University of Florida in Gainesville and is one of the Stand Up for Science organizers. She adds: the organizers will continue to “be around, making sure our policy goals and demands are fulfilled — that’s what’s important”.\n\nA generation lost\n\nAt a number of the rallies today, speakers and attendees worried about the chilling effect the Trump administration’s actions will have on future science and scientists.\n\nIn Boston, Nancy Kanwisher, a cognitive neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, told the crowd: “You can’t just fire everyone and then rehire them when you need them. A generation of scientists will have been lost.”\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign at the rally in Washington Square Park, New York City.Credit: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty\n\nAtul Gawande, a public-health researcher and former assistant administrator at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), told the crowd in Washington DC that he has watched scientists holding their careers in boxes as they leave the dream jobs they have been fired from. (The Trump administration has fired thousands of workers from the USAID, which funds health programmes and disaster relief overseas, saying that it had been run by “radical left lunatics” and is party to “tremendous fraud”.) Scientists are being targeted, because “science doesn’t always give the answers that power wants,” Gawande said.\n\nOthers expressed anger at the way scientists are being treated. “I’m a scientist and I’m pissed off,” says Carolee Caffrey, a behavioural ecologist at Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, who was welcoming people to the Trenton rally. “I’m all the ‘D’ words: Dismayed, depressed, disgusted.”\n\nSome viewed the rallies as offering a safe outlet for scientists to voice their feelings. Valerie H., who declined to give her full name for fear of reprisal, is a software engineer who works in crop science. Recent mass firings at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies have had a huge impact on Valerie’s research. “I know hundreds of people on LinkedIn who are looking for work,” she said at the Denver rally. “People are glad to have a place to come say something.”",

Now researchers have devised a machine-learning technique that could trigger such an observing campaign even before the collision occurs — and enable telescopes to watch how stars collide in real time.\n\nFive new ways to catch gravitational waves — and the secrets they’ll reveal\n\nThe algorithm was trained on simulations of the data that a gravitational-wave observatory collects in the minutes before two neutron stars merge, which creates a rarely observed event called a kilonova. These events are thought to produce some of the Universe’s heavier elements including gold, platinum and uranium. It would enable such observatories to alert other astronomers that a collision is about to happen at a given time and location in the sky, with 30% more accuracy than existing rapid-response techniques.\n\n“The combination of speed and accuracy in the localization presented in this paper is actually fantastic,” says Mansi Kasliwal, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The results are described in Nature1 on 5 March.\n\nSpiralling stars\n\nNeutron stars are the remnants of massive stars that collapsed at the end of their lifetimes, compressing more than a Sun’s worth of mass into a dense ball of neutrons just 20 kilometres or so across. Occasionally, neutron stars orbit each other in pairs, or binaries. If their orbit is tight enough, the effects of Einstein’s general theory of relativity kick in, and the binary starts to produce gravitational waves — ripples in the shape of space-time. By doing so, the stars lose energy and spiral into each other until they merge.\n\nResearchers have observed only a handful of neutron-star mergers, and only on one occasion — the 2017 event — has the merger also been seen by non-gravitational-wave observatories such as telescopes and γ-ray-burst detectors.\n\nLocation accuracy",

          "abstract": "We’ve seen the headlines: on 14 February, the US Department of Education ruled that race-based scholarships and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes violate civil-rights law. Universities that don’t dismantle these programmes risk losing federal funding.\n\nThis is not an abstract threat. It is an orchestrated effort to erase decades of progress — the very infrastructure that has helped under-represented students to access, navigate and succeed in spaces that were never built for them. And it’s not just in the United States. Rollbacks are also taking place in parts of Europe, for example.\n\nThe question is not whether institutions will comply, but which ones will fight back — and how.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nIf universities, faculty members and students allow this ruling to take root, the consequences will extend beyond campus walls. Anti-inclusion policies risk severing international collaborations and global-talent pipelines, stifling innovation and weakening research partnerships.\n\nSilence is complicity. The administration of US President Donald Trump is betting on universities weighing up the cost of speaking out and deciding that federal funding is worth more than their commitment to equity. But the cost of inaction is greater. Compliance won’t just dismantle crucial programmes, it will signal that universities are prepared to abandon their values the moment they are tested.\n\nHigher education must not back down. But to win this fight, universities need a plan. For starters, they must reject the anti-DEI directive — clearly and unequivocally. No vague corporate messaging. No strategic hedging. Their statements must affirm that DEI programmes expand opportunities, rather than take them away.\n\nUniversities have taken a stand on this topic before. On 29 June 2023, just an hour after the US Supreme Court struck down race-conscious admissions, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reaffirmed its commitment to such initiatives. In January 2024, Princeton University in New Jersey voiced its steadfast support for DEI initiatives amid nationwide attacks. Similar pressure must be applied now.\n\nTrump 2.0: an assault on science anywhere is an assault on science everywhere\n\nFaculty members hold more power than many realize. Without their labour, research and expertise, universities cannot function. The US administration might hope that academics will remain siloed, too consumed with their own work — or too afraid — to resist. However, if faculty members unite across institutions, they can become a force that the federal government cannot ignore.\n\nBut words won’t be enough. Faculty senates must formally call on universities to refuse compliance. Such resolutions aren’t just symbolic — they create a record that can be cited in lawsuits, the media and advocacy.\n\nIf faculty members are to take a stand, universities must back them up — protecting academic freedom, defending academics against retaliation and refusing to cave in to intimidation. Many faculty members are their family’s sole breadwinner. Others have been personally targeted or smeared in public campaigns. For some, organizing against this directive would not be just an act of resistance, it would be an act of professional and personal risk.\n\nFaculty members must also educate the public. This isn’t only about fairness — it’s about the global workforce. A diverse, well-educated talent pool fuels innovation and economic growth. The effects of access to higher education being narrowed down will ripple through industry and global research collaborations.\n\n‘Despair is not an option’ — how scientists can help protect federal research",

          "abstract": "A region in the brainstem, called the median raphe nucleus, contains neurons that control perseverance and exploration.Credit: K H Fung/Science Photo Library\n\nWhether mice persist with a task, explore new options or give up comes down to the activity of three types of neuron in the brain.\n\nIn experiments, researchers at University College London (UCL) were able to control the three behaviours by switching the neurons on and off in a part of the animals’ brainstem called the median raphe nucleus. The findings are reported in Nature today1.\n\n“It’s quite remarkable that manipulation of specific neural subtypes in the median raphe nucleus mediates certain strategic behaviours,” says neuroscientist Roger Marek at the Queensland Brain Institute in Brisbane, Australia, who was not involved in the work.\n\nWhether these behaviours are controlled in the same way in humans needs to be confirmed, but if they are, this could be relevant to certain neuropsychiatric conditions that are associated with imbalances in the three behavioural strategies, says Sonja Hofer, a co-author of the paper and a systems neuroscientist at UCL.\n\nFor instance, an overly high drive to persist with familiar actions and repetitive behaviours can be observed in people with obsessive–compulsive disorder and autism, she says. Conversely, pathological disengagement and lack of motivation are symptoms of major depressive disorder, and an excessive drive to explore and inability to persevere with a task is seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. “It could be that changes in the firing rate of specific median raphe cell types could contribute to certain aspects of these conditions,” says Hofer.\n\nLight ‘switch’\n\nThe researchers genetically engineered the three types of neuron — which release the neurotransmitters GABA, glutamate and serotonin — in the median raphe nucleus of mice to express a light-responsive protein, which meant the neurons could be switched on and off using light. Mice were then placed in a box with 20 objects they had never seen before.\n\nA group of control mice spent roughly equal amounts of time pursuing each of the three strategies: persisting in their interaction with one object by grabbing, carrying or biting it; exploring their options by interacting with many objects over a short period of time; or ignoring the objects and disengaging.\n\nWhen the researchers suppressed GABA-releasing, or GABAergic, neurons, mice persisted with individual objects for longer and switched between objects less frequently than control mice did. By comparison, activating the glutamatergic neurons — even for just two seconds — caused mice to spend more time leaping from one object to another in quick succession, indicating increased exploration.\n\nEven brief suppression of serotonergic neurons triggered the mice to spend more time in a disengaged state. The study also found that a midbrain region called the lateral habenula was involved in suppressing serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus, causing the mice to disengage from tasks.\n\n“This is a really elegant and intriguing study,” says behavioural neuroscientist Mark Walton at the University of Oxford, UK.",

In her day job, she works as a purchasing agent for a scientific firm, which requires placing large orders for everything from chemical reagents to US$8-million worth of glass vials. But in her personal time, Sadie goes on buying sprees for herself. She has ordered cameras, camera accessories, scrapbooking supplies, metal-detecting equipment, lasers, board games, planners, fountain pens, tech gadgets, nail polish, computer keyboard parts and yarn. She bought everything online.\n\nBefore she knew it, she was $20,000 in debt. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. “I never told my husband how bad it was.” She has been paying the debt off, but she can’t say exactly where the total stands today. “I’m so ashamed I won’t even check the balance,” she says. Sadie asked to remain anonymous so her family would not find out that she’s a compulsive shopper.\n\nSadie’s struggle is not a new phenomenon. German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin described krankhafte Kauflust — the pathological desire to buy — as early as 1899. But many specialists worry that the problem is getting much worse now — in part because of the rise of e-commerce companies such as Amazon, Chinese fast-fashion firm Shein and online marketplace Temu, some of which use game-like strategies to sell items. Last year, the European Commission announced it was investigating several aspects of Temu’s business, including “the risks linked to the addictive design of the service”.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nAs more and more shopping has moved online, retailers are increasingly using powerful psychological techniques to keep shoppers spending money. The Internet has, in effect, turned “mundane behaviours” such as shopping into “something that resembles a drug”, in the view of Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist at Stanford University in California, and the author of popular books about addiction. As a result, she says, “it suddenly becomes a problem for the masses”.\n\nAnd that problem extends across the globe. Researchers have studied compulsive shopping in many countries, including the United States, Turkey, Poland, Germany, India, Brazil, South Korea and Pakistan — where almost one-third of university students were classified as compulsive buyers in both physical stores and online1.\n\nThere is particular concern about the problem in China, which might have the highest prevalence of the condition ever recorded. Heping He, a marketing researcher at Shenzhen University in China, conducted a survey that found around 29.1% of the general population of China shopped compulsively2.\n\nHe is one of many researchers around the globe who are investigating the prevalence of the problem as well as the brain pathways involved and how compulsive shopping relates to similar types of condition. But researchers studying these issues face a problem: there is no official diagnosis of shopping addiction or compulsive shopping, which could help to stimulate further research and aid with demands for regulation.\n\nConsumer culture\n\nAlthough compulsive shopping has probably existed for as long as money and markets have, the Internet has made it much easier for people to make purchases. “Before the rise of online shopping in China, few people paid attention to compulsive-buying behaviour,” says He. Today, China is “one of the most developed regions globally in terms of Internet commerce”, he says. Add that to what he describes as “a materialistic consumer culture” and you’ve got an epidemic of shopping addiction.\n\nCompulsive shopping was once seen as problem that affected mostly women. But not all studies have found differences between genders, especially among younger shoppers3. In China, He says “the gender gap in compulsive buying appears to be narrowing, as men increasingly embrace online shopping amid the boom in Internet retailing”.\n\nBrain scans indicate that shopping can activate the dopamine reward system.Credit: Mike Kemp/In Pictures/Getty\n\nAlthough data suggest that the problem is surging, there’s no official entry for shopping addiction or compulsive shopping in the two main references that are used to help make diagnoses: the International Classification of Diseases — which is maintained by the World Health Organization — and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Many clinicians and researchers say that the time has come to make the condition official. This is necessary, they say, to help people who are facing the problem to gain access to care.\n\nOne reason compulsive shopping is not yet a recognized disorder is a lack of consensus on its cause. Researchers debate whether it is brought about by a pathological level of impulsivity, a compulsion resembling obsessive–compulsive disorder or a behavioural addiction, activating reward pathways similar to those linked to drugs and alcohol. Although many researchers who have looked into the issue would like to see more studies completed, the addiction model for compulsive shopping seems to be ascendant among specialists, as the broader category of behavioural addictions is increasingly accepted. Gambling disorder, which is in many ways similar to compulsive shopping, was added to the fifth edition of the DSM in 2013 and was grouped with addictions to substances.\n\nAccording to Lembke, the phenomenology of shopping addiction also follows the classic addiction pattern: “People do it at the beginning either to have fun or to solve a problem, from managing anxiety or depression to loneliness to boredom.” If the behaviour works for them, they keep repeating it until “it changes their brains” and they can’t stop, even as they descend into debt and, in some cases, destroy relationships with close family, she says.\n\nIs the Internet bad for you? Huge study reveals surprise effect on well-being\n\nThere are some brain-imaging studies that support the addiction theory for shopping. Patrick Trotzke, a psychologist at Charlotte Fresenius University in Cologne, Germany, scanned the brains of 18 people who were seeking treatment for buying–shopping disorder and 18 control participants while showing them pictures of shopping centres and shopping bags, as well as desirable objects, such as handbags and consumer electronics. In individuals with a shopping problem, these images activated the dopamine reward system in the striatum — the same system implicated in drug addiction4. “They get thrilled when you show them these pictures,” Trotzke says. “The dopaminergic reward system is on fire.” This tends to weaken the control system in the prefrontal cortex, Trotzke adds, until affected individuals “no longer have control” over their purchasing behaviour.\n\nFurther evidence that compulsive shopping is connected to this dopamine reward system comes from people who are taking excessive amounts of medicine that alters this system — and who then develop uncontrolled shopping behaviours5. In one case report of a person with Parkinson’s disease who took more dopaminergic medication than prescribed6, the individual “presented dressed in colourful clothes and was wearing three gold necklaces”. It emerged that they had purchased “over 5,000 pocket watches and 42 old and unusable cars”.\n\nIn 2021, 138 specialists from 35 countries were asked to weigh in on diagnostic criteria for buying–shopping disorder. The group used the Delphi method, which is an iterative and anonymous way of collecting opinions from a group that prevents leading researchers from exerting undue influence7. The group agreed that the condition was a distinct entity that was “due to addictive behaviours” and settled on the name “compulsive buying disorder”. The study’s authors derived a proposed list of criteria for the disorder, which includes intrusive urges to buy; lack of control over buying; buying items without using them; chasing the high of buying and using buying to feel better about bad feelings; and experiencing negative consequences because of buying.\n\nOnline marketplaces, such as Temu, often use game-like strategies on their platforms.Credit: Timon Schneider/Alamy\n\nHowever, the idea that people either have or do not have compulsive buying disorder might be simplistic. “It’s a spectrum disorder, just like drugs and alcohol,” Lembke says. “Some people have a bit of a shopping problem and other people end up with very severe addictions where they go into huge financial debt and they lose their primary relationship.”\n\nA 2020 study of more than 1,000 people in Switzerland grouped participants into categories of shoppers, including ‘risky’ and ‘addicted’. The researchers estimated that around 3% of the people in their sample were truly addicted to online shopping, with a further 11% at risk, because they agreed with the statements “I think about shopping/buying things all the time” and “I shop/buy things in order to change my mood”8.\n\nBrain-imaging studies such as Trotzke’s can’t be used to neatly diagnose compulsive buying disorder, because shopping is at least somewhat rewarding for most people. “I like shopping, and when you show me shopping-related things, my brain reward system is also turning on,” he explains.",

          "abstract": "Researchers who get their start in small groups are more likely to stick with academia than those trained in large groups, analysis shows. Credit: Daniel Munoz/AFP/Getty\n\nPostdoctoral students, graduate students and other junior scientists in large research groups are more likely to drop out of academia than are their peers in smaller groups, according to a new study of more than one million early-career researchers.\n\nBut the analysis also found that researchers trained in large groups who stay in academia have more career success. The work was published Monday in Nature Human Behaviour, amid a mass exodus of scientists from academia and a mental-health crisis among PhD students.\n\nThe findings are consistent with past anecdotal studies and survey results, but this is the first attempt to quantify the effects of different types of scientific mentorship, says co-author Roberta Sinatra, a social-data scientist at the University of Copenhagen.\n\n“I hope that this helps guide the choices of PhD students,” she says.\n\nBurnout and dropout\n\nSinatra and her team analysed academic mentorship networks using two data sets: the crowd-sourced website Academic Family Tree, which includes global records of scientists, their advisers and their students in more than 50 academic fields, and the online research catalog OpenAlex, which features records of authors and their papers, institutions and citations. Their final data set included about 1.5 million scientists and 1.8 million mentorships in chemistry, physics and neuroscience. These fields had enough long-term data for the authors’ analysis and are heavily represented in the family-tree website.\n\nThe results showed that the percentage of researchers who remain in science for at least ten years is lower for those who were trained in big groups than for those who were trained in small groups (see ‘Survival advantage’). Between the 1980s and 1995, for example, the “survival rate” of big-group protégés was 38–48% lower than that of their small-group counterparts.\n\nHowever, the big-group scientists publish papers that score higher on an index measuring average citations per year, and are more likely to be ranked among the most-cited scientists.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo understand why some big-group protégés succeed, the study’s authors examined papers on which a protégé was the first author and their mentor was the last author ― which suggests that the trainee had received substantial attention from their mentor. Big-group scientists who survived in academia had published “notably” more of these first-author papers than had the dropouts, the paper says.\n\n“Now we also have quantitative evidence that attention is important,” says Sinatra. “It’s not simply speculation.”\n\nHow a lab is like a city",

          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "A company that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to ‘de-extinct’ woolly mammoths and other animals has claimed a breakthrough in its quest: the creation of hairier mice.\n\nThe gene-edited ‘woolly mice’ harbour a mix of mutations modelled on those of woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius), as well as changes known to alter hair growth in mice, Colossal Biosciences announced in a 4 March press release and accompanying preprint1.\n\nColossal, which is based in Dallas, Texas, and is worth more than US$10 billion according to its latest valuation, says the woolly mouse represents an important step towards its goal of engineering Asian elephants — the mammoth’s closest living relative — with genetic changes for key mammoth traits. “The Colossal Woolly Mouse marks a watershed moment in our de-extinction mission,” said Ben Lamm, Colossal’s co-founder and chief executive, in the press release.\n\nBut some experts in mammoth genetics and genome editing question whether the mice represent a significant advance in either area, let alone a milestone on the way to bringing back woolly mammoths, which last roamed Earth some 4,000 years ago.\n\n“It’s far away from making a mammoth or a ‘mammoth mouse’,” says Stephan Riesenberg, a genome engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. “It’s just a mouse that has some special genes.”\n\nShaggy-hair gene\n\nAs part of its effort to engineer mammoth-like elephants, Colossal and its collaborators are working to find gene variants that contributed to key mammoth traits, such as shaggy hair, cold tolerance and extra fat stores. To do this, they compare genomes extracted from the remains of dozens of mammoths and from other living and extinct relatives of the creatures, in search of protein-altering changes that evolved on the mammoth lineage.\n\nThe woolly mice tended to have tawny-toned shaggy hair.Credit: Colossal Biosciences\n\nTo test the accuracy of these comparisons, a team led by Beth Shapiro, Colossal’s chief scientist, used gene editing to create mice with mutations similar — but in most cases not identical — to those found in mammoths. Shapiro says the group also tested several gene mutations known to affect the hair of mice but not found in mammoths.\n\nThe researchers used different gene-editing tools to create mice with up to eight genetic alterations spread across seven genes. These mice tended to have long, shaggy hair that, owing to a mutation known to affect hair colour in mice, humans and mammoths, was tawny-toned instead of the usual dark grey. “Adorability was one of the unintended consequences that we did not expect,” Lamm says. Mice with a mammoth-inspired change to a gene involved in fat metabolism were no heavier than were mice with unedited genes.\n\nThe mice are only a few months old, and the researchers have not had much time to investigate how the mutations might affect their long-term health, including their fertility and propensity to develop cancers. The researchers plan to test whether the mice are any better at handling the cold than other mice, and to study their hair development.\n\nLamm says the company has no plans to breed or sell the mice commercially. But for about $3,500, scientists can purchase a shaggy-haired mouse strain known as ‘wooly’ from the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, which first bred the mice more than two decades ago. Researchers later showed that the strain carries a mutation in a gene called Fam83g — one of the genes inactivated in Colossal’s woolly mice.\n\nWoolly mammoths share many genes with Asian elephants.Credit: Darryl Brooks/Alamy\n\nShowing that changes found in mammoth genomes can affect mouse biology is a useful proof of principle, says Alfred Roca, a population geneticist at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, who sees the experiments as a step towards engineering elephants with mammoth traits. “It’s a very nice visualization of where you want to end up in the mammoth.”\n\nMammoth genomics",

          "authors": "Kara Hanson",
          "abstract": "Selecting the venue for a global academic conference brings both opportunities and challenges. There are competing pressures: minimizing costs and travel distances for attendees while ensuring access to high-quality facilities and a reputable local university partner. However, one issue has become increasingly important: ease of access to travel visas.\n\nBecause immigration policies have tightened in some countries, particularly in North America and Europe, waiting times for visas have increased. For example, it can take Canadian visa authorities up to 18 months to process an application from someone in South Africa, according to the government’s immigration services website.\n\nTear down visa barriers that block scholarship\n\nSuch visa-related difficulties impede global scientific dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. I’ve become keenly aware of these issues as the president of the International Health Economics Association (IHEA) and tasked with planning a congress for July.\n\nOrganizing a global gathering of academics involves many months of planning. In 2023, we had selected Calgary, Canada, as the venue for the 2025 congress, after assessing submissions from several potential hosts. However, in April 2024, an IHEA committee member alerted us to the difficulties that researchers were encountering in obtaining visitor visas.\n\nWe explored workarounds, such as expediting the abstract submission and selection process and registering with the Canadian immigration department’s Special Events Liaison Unit. But these steps were insufficient. In May 2024, the IHEA board took the difficult decision to shift the conference to Bali, Indonesia. While looking for a new location, our main concern was finding a country with a more permissive visa regime than Canada’s. However, we also needed support from a strong local organizing committee and a venue big enough to accommodate our group.\n\nWe have been thinking more carefully about geographical equity and the convenience of our members, who are distributed around the globe. In the past, the meeting mainly alternated between Europe and North America, although we have held it once in China and once in Australia, and the last congress was held in South Africa — attracting participants from 106 countries.\n\n‘Exhausted and insulted’: how harsh visa-application policies are hobbling global research\n\nWe’ve now learnt that we need to consider visa equity, too. Meaningful academic discourse is not possible if important conferences are a venue only for those who can travel with relative ease. An informed global dialogue on crucial issues, such as health economics and policy, requires contributions from a diverse group of participants.\n\nTo our relief, there was no backlash from our membership when the decision to shift the venue was announced. On the contrary, we received e-mails from colleagues all over the world thanking the IHEA for its action, and for recognizing the challenges faced by researchers from low- and middle-income countries, who tend to have the greatest problems obtaining a visa.\n\nBut this is not just a problem of rich nations versus poorer ones — although visa constraints in Europe, Canada and the United States are widely recognized as onerous, some low- and middle-income countries also impose restrictions. For instance, visa denials affecting many participants at the Health Systems Research symposium in Bogotá in 2022 led some researchers to boycott the event.\n\nVisa discrimination — unfair or differential treatment of individuals based on nationality or other characteristics — is clearly at the root of the problem. But conference organizers are not always sensitive to such discrimination.",

Such chips have powered the rise of generative AI systems.Credit: Sergio Flores/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) systems with human-level reasoning are unlikely to be achieved through the approach and technology that have dominated the current boom in AI, according to a survey of hundreds of people working in the field.\n\nMore than three-quarters of respondents said that enlarging current AI systems ― an approach that has been hugely successful in enhancing their performance over the past few years ― is unlikely to lead to what is known as artificial general intelligence (AGI). An even higher proportion said that neural networks, the fundamental technology behind generative AI, alone probably cannot match or surpass human intelligence. And the very pursuit of these capabilities also provokes scepticism: less than one-quarter of respondents said that achieving AGI should be the core mission of the AI research community.\n\n\"I don’t know if reaching human-level intelligence is the right goal,” says Francesca Rossi, an AI researcher at IBM in Yorktown Heights, New York, who spearheaded the survey in her role as president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) in Washington DC. “AI should support human growth, learning and improvement, not replace us.”\n\nThe survey results were unveiled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Saturday at the annual meeting of the AAAI. They include responses from more than 475 AAAI members, 67% of them academics.\n\nGenerally smart\n\nGenerative-AI systems, which underlie tools including chatbots and image generators, are based on neural networks, computer systems that learn from vast amounts of data in a way inspired by the human brain. Over the past decade, developers seeking to improve these systems’ performance have made huge gains by scaling up their size ― for example, by increasing the amount of training data and a model’s number of ‘parameters’, the settings that an AI learns to adjust during training.\n\nHowever, 84% of respondents said that neural networks alone are insufficient to achieve AGI. The survey, which is part of an AAAI report on the future of AI research, defines AGI as a system that is “capable of matching or exceeding human performance across the full range of cognitive tasks”, but researchers haven’t yet settled on a benchmark for determining when AGI has been achieved.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nThe AAAI report emphasizes that there are many kinds of AI beyond neural networks that deserve to be researched, and calls for more active support of these techniques. These approaches include symbolic AI, sometimes called ‘good old-fashioned AI’, which codes logical rules into an AI system rather than emphasizing statistical analysis of reams of training data. More than 60% of respondents felt that human-level reasoning will be reached only by incorporating a large dose of symbolic AI into neural-network-based systems. The neural approach is here to stay, Rossi says, but “to evolve in the right way, it needs to be combined with other techniques”.\n\nThe survey reveals concerns about unfettered AGI development. More than 75% of respondents said that pursuing AI systems with “an acceptable risk–benefit profile” should be a higher priority than achieving AGI; only 23% said that AGI should be the top priority. And about 30% of respondents agreed that research and development targeting AGI should be halted until we have a way to fully control these systems, ensuring that they operate safely and for the benefit of humanity.\n\nBut most community members oppose such a halt, and some point out that it would be difficult to enforce if implemented. “I don’t think it’s practical to do this ― companies will do this even if research agencies stopped funding it,” says Anthony Cohn, an AI researcher at the University of Leeds, UK, and an AAAI member. Besides, he adds, “I don’t think AGI is as imminent as many think,” giving researchers time to work on safety measures.",

          "abstract": "Women usually have two X chromosomes (shown here in an artist’s rendering), and one of them is inactivated early in development.Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/Alamy\n\nWomen tend to live longer than men and are often more resilient to cognitive decline as they age. Now researchers might have uncovered a source for this resilience: the second X chromosome in female cells that was previously considered ‘silent’.\n\nWhy the sexes don’t feel pain the same way\n\nIn work published today in the journal Science Advances1, a team reports that, at least in female mice, ageing activates expression of genes on what is usually the ‘silent’, or inactivated, X chromosome in cells in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial to learning and memory. And when the researchers gave mature mice of both sexes a type of gene therapy to boost expression of one of those genes, it improved their cognition, as measured by how well they explored a maze. Assuming these results can be confirmed in humans, the team suggests it could mean that women’s brains are being protected by their second X chromosome as they age — and that the finding could translate into future therapies boosting cognition for everyone.\n\n“The X chromosome is powerful,” says Rachel Buckley, a neurologist who studies sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown, and who was not involved in the research. This kind of work, she says, is helping researchers to understand “where female resilience lies and how to harness it”.\n\n(This article uses ‘women’ and ‘female’ to describe people with two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, reflecting the language of the study. Nature recognizes that not all people who identify as women have this chromosomal make-up.)\n\nDouble dose\n\nFemale cells typically have two X chromosomes, one from each parent; male cells usually have one X and one Y. Early in development, one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is inactivated — coated in various proteins and RNA molecules that prevent its genes from being expressed. Which one is ‘silenced’ — meaning which parent it comes from — is random, and the tissues in the body are a mosaic of both types.\n\nWhy autoimmune disease is more common in women: X chromosome holds clues\n\nIn theory, female and male cells both have an X chromosome that is active, so female cells have “the same dose of X chromosome as a male cell”, says Dena Dubal, a neuroscientist and neurologist at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, who led the study. But scientists are learning that it’s not so simple. Dubal says that about 30% of the genes on the so-called silent X chromosome in people are active — although that percentage varies among women. Still, scientists know little about how expression of genes on the less-active X chromosome changes from tissue to tissue in the body, or how it shifts with age.\n\nTo study this in the mouse brain, Dubal’s team bred two types of laboratory mice to produce offspring with one X chromosome from each. The chromosomes were engineered such that one would always be the active X and the other would always be inactivated, and small genetic differences in the chromosomes would allow them to be identified in lab tests. Then the researchers tracked the activity of both X chromosomes in nine major cell types, including neurons, found in the hippocampus of both young and old mice.",

          "authors": "Dyani Lewis",
          "abstract": "Credit: Adam Gault/OJO Images via Getty\n\nResearchers who are accused of sexual misconduct start to receive fewer citations after the media covers the allegations. But the same cannot be said about scientists publicly accused of scientific fraud, whose citations remain unchanged, according to an analysis published this week in PLoS ONE1.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement that uncovered perpetrators of sexual harassment in Hollywood and other industries, including science, Giulia Maimone, a behavioural scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wanted to know whether researchers in STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — and the social sciences were avoiding the work of those accused of sexual harassment.\n\nShe and her colleagues compared citations for 15 researchers in the three years after they were publicly accused of sexual misconduct, with those of 15 researchers accused of data fabrication and other scientific misconduct and of 142 researchers who had not received any of such allegation. Their prediction: that scholars accused of scientific fraud would incur a greater penalty because the misconduct calls into question the merit of that person’s scientific work. “That’s not at all what we found,” says Maimone. “We were very surprised.”\n\nCitations of alleged sexual harassers fell in the aftermath of an allegation going public. But those of scientists accused of scientific misconduct held steady, even though publication rates fell for both categories.\n\n“It’s really valuable to have a study like this that looks at citational practices,” says Anna Bull, a sociologist at the University of York, UK, who studies sexual harassment in higher education. She says that the results could be a sign that attitudes towards sexual misconduct in science are changing.\n\nBut she says that the cases analysed — selected because the allegations had appeared in media reports and the accused had accrued at least 200 citations over the study period — probably represent only the severest forms of sexual misconduct. “In order for things to come out [in the media], they must be pretty egregious,” she says, noting that in many places, including the United Kingdom and European Union, few sexual-misconduct allegations reach the media owing to defamation laws.\n\nElisabeth Bik, a research-integrity consultant based in California, says that although it is good that peoples’ aversion to sexual misconduct is being reflected in the scientific community, it is concerning that there was no drop in citations for research misconduct. But she says that in cases of scientific misconduct, “it is often not clear who is responsible”, and papers might also be cited as examples of misconduct.\n\nBehavioural blind-spot\n\nThe reasons why researchers are choosing not to cite colleagues accused of sexual misconduct are unclear. They could be deliberately punishing sexual harassers by withholding citations, or they might want to preserve their own reputation, says Bull, or “maybe even both”.\n\nMaimone also says that researchers might not realize that they are punishing alleged sexual harassers more than they are scientific fraudsters.\n\nAs part of their study, she and her colleagues also surveyed 240 STEM and social-science researchers, and 231 non-academics about their attitudes towards sexual harassment and scientific misconduct.\n\nAt least 90% of non-academics said that sexual misconduct was more disgusting than scientific fraud, and three-quarters said it was more deserving of punishment. But 85% of academics surveyed said that if forced to choose, they would rather cite the article published by the sexual harasser than the fraudster. But given that the study shows that citations of scientists accused of harassment drop more than those of researchers accused of fraud, Maimone says that scientists might be overestimating their ability to judge the merit of scientific findings without considering who produced those findings.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Credit: photos777/Getty\n\nChina’s highest court has called for a crack down on the activities of paper mills, businesses that churn out fraudulent or poor-quality manuscripts and sell authorships. Some researchers are cautiously optimistic that the court’s guidance will help curb the use of these services, while others think the impact will be minimal.\n\n“This is the first time the supreme court has issued guidance on paper mills and on scientific fraud,” says Wang Fei, who studies research-integrity policy at Dalian University of Technology in China.\n\nPaper mills sell suspect research and authorships to researchers who want journal articles to burnish their CVs. They are a significant contributor to overall research misconduct, particularly in China.\n\nLast month, the the Supreme People’s Court published a set of guiding opinions on technology innovation. Among the list of 25 articles, one called for lower courts to crack down on ‘paper industry chains’, and for research fraud to be severely punished.\n\nOver the past decade, the Chinese government has issued regulations and policies to deter researchers from committing misconduct, including the use of paper mills, and has directed research institutions to investigate and punish researchers involved. But paper mills have largely continued, says Yin Bo, a lawyer and criminal-justice researcher at China University of Political Science and Law in Beijing.\n\n“Paper mills are very popular in China and there is a very huge business” involving them, says Gengyan Tang, who studies research integrity in China at the University of Calgary, Canada.\n\nThe guidelines issued by the supreme court are very important and signal that the courts will contribute to creating a fairer research ecosystem, says Yin, who also runs an online course on research integrity at Beijing Normal University.\n\nGrowing caseload\n\nThere have been an increasing number of cases involving paper mills in lower courts. In a search of a public database of court judgments, Tang identified 41 cases involving ghostwriting services between 2013 and 2024. The reports, shared with Nature, include some civil cases involving contract disputes, such as researchers who paid for writing and other academic publishing services from paper mills or individuals who didn’t fulfil their contracts.\n\nIn response to the government’s goal of reducing research misconduct, the way in which the lower courts adjudicate cases involving paper mills has changed over the past decade, says Yin. Some six or seven years ago, the courts would have considered contracts signed with paper mills as valid and warranting protection, he says. But courts now deem them invalid, recognizing that these contracts violate standards of research integrity and a fair system of evaluation and promotion, as described in several government policies.\n\nIn one case from 2023, a salesperson for a media company contacted an academic on the Chinese social-media platform, WeChat to offer academic ghostwriting services. The salesperson wrote that the cost of getting an article published in an established Chinese journal within two months was 16,200 yuan (US$2,200), paid in three instalments. The salesperson guaranteed a ’plagiarism score’ of less than 10%, and a full refund if the article couldn’t be published.\n\nBut after receipt of the first instalment, the salesperson went silent. More than a year later, the academic took the company to court, where a judge deemed that since writing and distributing papers on behalf of someone else “violates the principles of academic integrity and public order and good morals”, the contract between the two parties was invalid. Therefore, the media company had to return the 6,000 yuan instalment it had received.\n\n“In most instances, paper mills were simply required to refund the fees paid by researchers,” says Tang.\n\nBut in cases that were considered criminal because they involved fraud, public prosecutors took individuals offering academic writing and publishing services, with no intention of delivering, to court for scamming or deceiving researchers. In cases where fraud was involved, penalties were more severe and included fines or even prison sentences.\n\nMore severe punishments\n\nSome of the harshest language in the supreme court’s guidance was reserved for paper mills, says Wang. As a result, she expects that “paper mills in China will be punished more severely”.",

We focus on certain species of gull with migration paths that overlap here.\n\nLesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus) breed in Iceland during the summertime, and in the winter they migrate to Europe or West Africa. By contrast, the Iceland gull (Larus glaucoides) breeds farther north, in Greenland or Canada, but returns to Iceland for winter. Then there are the local ones, such as the great black-backed gull (Larus marinus) and the glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), that are here all year round.\n\nAll of that mixing means that Iceland is a key location for avian influenza viruses from Europe to move into North America, and vice versa.",

          "abstract": "After earning degrees in mathematics and physics, Ewan Kirk pivoted into entrepreneurship.Credit: Isaac Raymond\n\nIn 2023, technology entrepreneur and early-stage investor Ewan Kirk joined the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, UK, as its first Royal Society entrepreneur in residence.\n\nKirk helps staff and students to better understand business and entrepreneurship, offering them practical advice and support in launching companies, attracting funding and investment and collaborating with industry partners.\n\nHe talks about the role, the history of his entrepreneurial career and why the United Kingdom needs to do more to retain talent in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) if it is to remain a science superpower.\n\nTell us about your entrepreneur-in-residence role.\n\nOne of the first things I did after being appointed was to plan and deliver a lecture series that included practical advice on how to turn an idea into a business, give a presentation pitch and fund and grow a new enterprise.\n\nI also ran a series of drop-in sessions, during which people could discuss their ideas, ask for career or interview advice or talk about their next steps after earning their PhD.\n\nSometimes, faculty members will connect me with a postdoc who wants to talk about a piece of technology they have developed, and whether there is a commercial angle. They might be an international specialist in an incredibly complex area of mathematics or physics. These conversations are always intellectually demanding for me — but the real challenge is in working out how to turn an interesting technology into a commercial enterprise.\n\nWhat types of question do you get asked by budding maths entrepreneurs?\n\nSome things are relatively simple, such as, “How do you start a company?” Some aspects of entrepreneurship are domain-specific, but there’s also a lot of commonality — forecasting your cash flows, hiring employees, understanding your customers, forward planning, raising money and selling your product to a customer or to an investor.\n\nI advise people to refine their message. The fundamental question for every potential investor is, “How and when do you expect to make money?”\n\nA big challenge for early-stage entrepreneurs is raising money. I see an enormous number of company pitch decks — slide-format presentations made to pitch ideas to investors — both in my entrepreneur-in-residence role and through DeepTech Labs, which I started in 2020 in conjunction with Cambridge Innovation Capital, a venture-capital company, and the university.\n\nWhy postdocs need entrepreneurship training\n\nDeepTech Labs invests in early-stage technology companies and runs a 10-week programme to help them bridge the gap between early-stage pre-seed funding (which gets the company off the ground) and a larger series A funding round. We select five or six at a time, and the programme includes sessions on developing a strategic roadmap, value proposition and fundraising strategies, and building high-performing teams.\n\nPeople generally don’t think about how to pitch their business. They’re often excited about their own technology, but an investor has to see some kind of exit, or an opportunity to realize a return on their investment.\n\nWhat specific skills do mathematicians have that can help to nurture entrepreneurial instincts?\n\nMathematics is fundamental to absolutely everything, from particle physics to economics. The current interest in artificial intelligence (AI) — which is fundamentally just a branch of statistics — ensures that maths is at the cutting edge of the economy. Not only is maths a fundamental part of science, but mathematical training produces smart thinkers who have a lot to offer academia, businesses and society in general.\n\nI explain to mathematicians, statisticians and theoretical physicists that being able to control, program and understand computer networks is an incredibly valuable skill. ‘Data are the new oil’ is a cliché, but it’s true. And in most commercial jobs, you have to weigh up uncertainty or find ways to prove things, which is precisely what mathematicians and statisticians are trained to do.\n\nPresenting your ideas and convincing the audience of your conclusions are crucial skills. One of the most common mistakes made by people transitioning from academia to the commercial world is to present their work as if they are presenting an academic paper.\n\nIn fact, most people, including investors and customers, just want to hear the conclusion. Presenting is an essential skill that start-up candidates need.\n\nTell us about your own entrepreneurial career journey.\n\nI grew up in Cumbernauld, a town in west Scotland. I couldn’t play football, so my only option was to go down the academic route.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor’s degree in natural philosophy and astronomy at the University of Glasgow, UK, I was admitted to the University of Cambridge to do Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, a one-year master’s-level taught course, followed by a PhD in general relativity at the University of Southampton, UK.\n\nThe business of science\n\nI was always very interested in learning to program, and while earning my PhD, a friend and I created a software package, called MicroDraft, for Amstrad, which was a UK consumer-electronics company. To commercialize it, we formed a company called DaLEK Software.\n\nBack then, there was little to no support for entrepreneurs, so we pretty much had to work out everything ourselves, such as company formation, accounting and marketing.\n\nIt was a good but frustrating experience. We finally sold the rights to the software, and I think that experience really sparked my interest in entrepreneurship.\n\nI’d realized after earning my PhD that academic research wasn’t for me: I was good, but definitely not good enough to make a career as a researcher in the general theory of relativity.\n\nIn 1989, I went to work for a consultancy called Scientific Generics in Cambridge, as its director of innovation. The company, now called Sagentia Innovation, provided a great introduction to entrepreneurship and technology in a commercial environment.\n\nThree years later, I got a call from the investment bank Goldman Sachs, inviting me to interview for a position. During my interview, I was asked about programming for quantitative analysis, which involves using complex mathematical and statistical modelling to analyse financial markets. They offered me a job as a strategist on the commodities desk, based in London, despite my lack of knowledge about the industry.\n\nAfter a discussion with a colleague in the London currencies department, I started building software and creating models to price commodity derivatives, financial tools that allow an investor to profit from a commodity without owning it.\n\nAfter a few years there was a group of nearly 30 mathematicians and programmers who were writing the software and the models for the commodity-trading group, and eventually we gained a dominant position in that market. I was promoted to partner at Goldman in 2000; in 2005, I retired from the firm and I travelled around the world with my family.\n\nI then started a systematic hedge fund, which uses algorithms to trade financial instruments on the basis of quantitative data, called Cantab Capital Partners.\n\nThe company initially employed just a few people in a small office in Cambridge. We wanted to be the geekiest, most technologically advanced trading firm we could be — and five years later, we were managing US$5 billion.",

If that work develops into commercial applications, the United States might soon find it impossible to use export controls to retain its competitive advantage in high-performance microchip design and production, the authors say.\n\nAlthough the study’s findings do not mean that China is currently leading this field, “arguably, it’s showing us where things are headed”, says Zachary Arnold, a lead analyst at the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) at Georgetown University in Washington DC, which performed the analysis.\n\nThe study, published on 3 March, finds that between 2018 and 2023, research papers on chip design and fabrication included authors affiliated with Chinese institutions more than twice as often as they did US ones. And it wasn’t just a matter of quantity: China also excelled when it came to highly cited papers. Chinese-affiliated authors co-authored 50% of papers that were in the top 10% most cited for their publication year. That compared with 22% for US-affiliated authors and 17% for those associated with European institutions.\n\nSuch research spans a wide range of academic disciplines, and encompasses everything from conventional computer chips and fast graphics-processing units optimized for artificial intelligence (AI) to completely new architectures. To find and collate relevant papers for their study, analysts at the ETO had to train a machine-learning algorithm. Their analysis captures mainly emerging chip technology, rather than commercial advances, which are often incremental and proprietary, says Arnold.\n\nThe study included only papers with English-language abstracts; for Chinese-authored papers, these are more likely to be those with international reach. China has been boosting its research output in many fields, Arnold says. “But I don’t know if we’ve seen a field where there is quite this difference,” he adds. “When you see so much activity, it’s hard to imagine that [won’t] have an effect on China’s technological capability and ultimately manufacturing capability in the coming years.”\n\nAcademic impact\n\nThe findings chime with what Yunji Chen sees on the ground in China. Chen, who heads up the State Key Laboratory of Processors in Beijing and is a co-founder of Cambricon, a company that designs chips optimized for AI, says that the country’s manufacturing ability lags behind its chip design, partly as a result of US export controls.\n\nStarting in October 2022, the US Department of Commerce began to prohibit the sale to China of certain advanced chips and manufacturing equipment. The US government said it was acting, in part, because China was using AI capabilities to “monitor, track, and surveil their own citizens, and fuel its military modernization”.",

          "abstract": "The Athena lander touched down in the region around the lunar south pole (pictured) on 6 March as planned, but its health is uncertain. Credit: Dave Tyler/Galaxy/Alamy\n\nUpdate: Intuitive Machines announced on 7 March that the Athena spacecraft had landed on its side in a lunar crater and has run out of power. The mission is over, because it has no way to recharge its batteries. “Teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,” the company said, including on the NASA ice drill that was the main reason for going to the lunar south pole.\n\nThe latest attempt to land on the Moon went at least partially awry on 6 March, when an ice-seeking spacecraft named Athena apparently landed off-kilter near the lunar south pole.\n\nThe precise status of Athena, which was built by Intuitive Machines in Houston, Texas, remained unclear in the hours after touchdown, but “we don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude”, Stephen Altemus, chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said at a post-landing press conference. Last year, the first spacecraft that the company tried to land on the Moon also set down askew, although it did accomplish some science.\n\nThis was the second lunar disappointment this week. NASA reported on 4 March that communication problems would keep its Lunar Trailblazer probe from entering its planned science orbit around the Moon. But not all the news is bad: a third lunar craft, built by Firefly Aerospace in Cedar Park, Texas, made a safe arrival on 2 March.\n\nMoon mystery\n\nAltemus said the company is working to acquire images from Athena’s several cameras and determine which parts are damaged and which are functional, and that more information will be available in the coming hours and days. At least for now, the spacecraft is getting power, and mission controllers have been able to communicate with the science payloads on board, he said.\n\nPrivate companies are flocking to the Moon — what does that mean for science?\n\nDepending on its position on the lunar surface, Athena might still be able to perform some of its activities. To have enough power to keep operating, it needs to have at least one solar panel oriented to catch sunlight. The Sun stays close to the lunar horizon at the craft’s landing site, and Athena is meant to operate until sunset at its landing site, roughly ten days after touchdown.\n\nBut the mission’s main purpose — hunting for ice — might not be accomplished. A drill aboard Athena that was meant to bore into the lunar soil to find ice cannot operate unless it is close to upright. “We’re looking forward to hearing what we have to work with,” said Nicola Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, at the press conference. The success of other components, such as three rovers and an ice-sniffing robotic ‘hopper’ meant to hop into shadowy craters, also depends on Athena’s position.\n\nSpotty record\n\nThe outlook is also grim for Lunar Trailblazer’s mission to create high-resolution maps of water on the lunar surface. Trailblazer launched successfully alongside Athena on 26 February, but the NASA team “believes the spacecraft is spinning slowly in a low-power state”, the agency reported on 4 March. If mission controllers can restore communications in the coming days, they might be able to put Trailblazer into a less-than-optimal lunar orbit and eke out at least a little of its planned science.",

          "abstract": "Mentoring is a key component of scientific achievements, contributing to overall measures of career success for mentees and mentors. Within the scientific community, possessing a large research group is often perceived as an indicator of exceptional mentorship and high-quality research. However, such large, competitive groups may also escalate dropout rates, particularly among early-career researchers. Overly high dropout rates of young researchers may lead to severe postdoc shortage and loss of top-tier academics in contemporary academia. In this context, we collect longitudinal genealogical data on mentor–mentee relations and their publications, and analyse the influence of a mentor’s group size on the future academic longevity and performance of their mentees. Our findings indicate that mentees trained in larger groups tend to exhibit superior academic performance compared with those from smaller groups, provided they remain in academia post graduation. However, we also observe two surprising patterns: academic survival rate is significantly lower for (1) mentees from larger groups and for (2) mentees with more productive mentors. The trend is verified in institutions of different prestige levels. These findings highlight a negative correlation between a mentor’s success and the academic survival rate of their mentees, prompting a rethinking of effective mentorship and offering actionable insights for career advancement.",

          "abstract": "Death anxiety (DA), apprehension when thinking about death, has long been associated with distress. Studies have suggested that DA may transdiagnostically contribute to mental disorders. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to estimate the relationship between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders. The included studies reported the correlation between DA and distress or symptoms of mental disorders, across general population and clinical samples, using previously validated measures for all outcomes. PsychInfo and the Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection (via EBSCO), Embase, and Medline (via PubMed) were systematically searched up to 30 October 2023. Study quality was evaluated with the Study Quality Assessment Tools (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). A total of 129 studies were included, reporting on 158 independent samples, for a total of 34,147 participants. Most studies were rated as poor quality. The findings indicated consistently positive associations between DA and distress outcomes (general anxiety: r = 0.42, P < 0.001; depression: r = 0.41, P < 0.001; distress: r = 0.36, P < 0.001). Heterogeneity was substantial, and prediction intervals crossed zero for all outcomes, except for anxiety and distress. We found no moderation by DA measure, sample type or the proportion of women in the sample. However, the association was stronger (t(35.37) = −2.055, P = 0.047) when medical conditions were present (r = 0.48, P < 0.001) than when they were absent (r = 0.37, P < 0.001). There was evidence of small-study effects, indicating possible publication bias. DA should be investigated in longitudinal studies across diverse samples of patients to clarify its contribution to psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a unified computational framework connecting acoustic, speech and word-level linguistic structures to study the neural basis of everyday conversations in the human brain. We used electrocorticography to record neural signals across 100 h of speech production and comprehension as participants engaged in open-ended real-life conversations. We extracted low-level acoustic, mid-level speech and contextual word embeddings from a multimodal speech-to-text model (Whisper). We developed encoding models that linearly map these embeddings onto brain activity during speech production and comprehension. Remarkably, this model accurately predicts neural activity at each level of the language processing hierarchy across hours of new conversations not used in training the model. The internal processing hierarchy in the model is aligned with the cortical hierarchy for speech and language processing, where sensory and motor regions better align with the model’s speech embeddings, and higher-level language areas better align with the model’s language embeddings. The Whisper model captures the temporal sequence of language-to-speech encoding before word articulation (speech production) and speech-to-language encoding post articulation (speech comprehension). The embeddings learned by this model outperform symbolic models in capturing neural activity supporting natural speech and language. These findings support a paradigm shift towards unified computational models that capture the entire processing hierarchy for speech comprehension and production in real-world conversations.",

          "abstract": "Voluntary, flexible stopping of speech output is an essential aspect of speech motor control, especially during natural conversations. The cognitive and neural mechanisms of speech inhibition are not well understood. Here we have recorded direct high-density cortical activity while participants engaged in continuous speech production and were visually cued to stop speaking. Neural recordings revealed distinct activity in the premotor frontal cortex correlated with stopping speech. This activity was found in largely separate cortical sites from regions encoding vocal tract articulatory movements. Moreover, this activity primarily occurred with abrupt stopping in the middle of an utterance, rather than naturally completing a phrase. Electrocortical stimulation at many premotor sites with inhibitory stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, which contradicts previous clinical interpretations of this effect as evidence for critical centres of speech production. Together, these results suggest a previously unknown premotor cortical network that supports the inhibitory control of speech, providing implications for understanding both natural and altered speech production.",

          "abstract": "Urban highways are common, especially in the United States, making cities more car-centric. They promise the annihilation of distance but obstruct pedestrian mobility, thus playing a key role in limiting social interactions locally. Although this limiting role is widely acknowledged in urban studies, the quantitative relationship between urban highways and social ties is barely tested. Here, we define a Barrier Score that relates massive, geolocated online social network data to highways in the 50 largest US cities. At the granularity of individual social ties, we show that urban highways are associated with decreased social connectivity. This barrier effect is especially strong for short distances and consistent with historical cases of highways that were built to purposefully disrupt or isolate Black neighborhoods. By combining spatial infrastructure with social tie data, our method adds a dimension to demographic studies of social segregation. Our study can inform reparative planning for an evidence-based reduction of spatial inequality, and more generally, support a better integration of the social fabric in urban planning.",

          "abstract": "Large language models can now generate political messages as persuasive as those written by humans, raising concerns about how far this persuasiveness may continue to increase with model size. Here, we generate 720 persuasive messages on 10 US political issues from 24 language models spanning several orders of magnitude in size. We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment ( N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.",

          "authors": "Sandra Aguilar-Gomez, Juan Camilo Cardenas, Ricardo Salas Diaz",
          "abstract": "Recent research, focused mostly on the United States and Western Europe, shows that marginalized communities often face greater environmental degradation. However, the ethnoracial categories used in these studies may not fully capture environmental inequality in the Global South. Moving beyond conventional ethnoracial variables, this study presents findings exploring the link between skin tone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) exposure in Colombia. By matching household geolocations from a large-scale longitudinal survey with satellite-based PM 2.5 estimates, we find that skin tone predicts both initial pollution exposure levels and their changes over time. Although average exposure levels remained stable during our study period, the environmental justice (EJ) landscape in Colombia contemporaneously underwent a complete transformation. In 2010, lighter-skinned individuals faced higher PM 2.5 exposure, but darker-skinned individuals experienced steeper increases in the following years. By 2016, the EJ gap had reversed, with people with the darkest skin tones exposed to PM 2.5 levels nearly one SD higher than those faced by people with the lightest skin tones. These patterns remain robust when controlling for a comprehensive set of theoretically relevant covariates, including ethnoracial self-identification and income. Disproportionate exposure to pollution from fires partially explains the observed disparities. Decomposition analysis shows that this variable, local collective action, and economic marginalization account for a sizeable share of the EJ gap. However, one-third of the gap remains unexplained by observable characteristics. With climate change intensifying fire incidence, the disproportionate disease burdens that vulnerable groups face might deepen unless policy measures are taken to reverse this trend.",

          "abstract": "U.S. Census Bureau officials recently reaffirmed the Bureau’s ongoing efforts to replace the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata sample with “fully synthetic” data to protect respondent confidentiality. With the growth of computing power and expansion of private sector data about the population, the Census Bureau has valid concerns about confidentiality threats to public data. The current plan for fully synthetic data, however, threatens a cornerstone of the nation’s scientific infrastructure. Census microdata samples are among the most frequently used sources in social science research, and they are an essential tool for policy formation and planning from the local to the national level. Synthetic census microdata are not suitable for most research and policy applications. There have been no recent attempts to quantify disclosure risk in the ACS microdata, and the sole existing study failed to establish a credible threat for positive identification of ACS respondents by external intruders. I argue that we need new empirical research to pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that could allow an intruder to determine a particular individual’s confidential census responses. If significant vulnerabilities are uncovered, the Census Bureau in partnership with the research community should develop targeted methods for disclosure risk reduction that minimize damage to data usability.",

Both tests, however, have well-known statistical limitations, sometimes suggesting discrimination even when there is none. Despite the fallibility of the benchmark and outcome tests individually, here we prove a surprisingly strong statistical guarantee: Under a common nonparametric assumption, at least one of the two tests must be correct; consequently, when both tests agree, they are guaranteed to yield correct conclusions. We present empirical evidence that the underlying assumption holds approximately in several important domains, including lending, education, and criminal justice—and that our hybrid test is robust to the moderate violations of the assumption that we observe in practice. Applying this approach to 2.8 million police stops across California, we find evidence of widespread racial discrimination.",

In this paper, we report that vimentin forms liquid condensates which appear to enable rapid filament growth. Given the transient nature of these droplets, we focus on properties of vimentin-Y117L, which has a point mutation that leads to formation of condensates but not IFs, enabling us to study these droplets in detail. The droplets dissolve under 1,6-Hexanediol treatment and under decreasing concentration, confirming that they are liquid, and phase separated. These condensates extensively wet actin stress fibers, rendering them resistant to actin-binding drugs and protecting them from depolymerization. We show similar behavior occurs in wild-type vimentin during its assembly into filaments.",

          "abstract": "NASA’s Kepler mission identified over 4,000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes—a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution—remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1,646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e = 0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e = 1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.05 ± 0.01 for small planets to ⟨ e ⟩ = 0.20 ± 0.03 for planets larger than ∼3.5 Earth-radii R ⊕ . The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below ∼3.5 R ⊕ . We also find size-dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the “radius valley,” a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky “super-Earths” (1.0 to 1.5 R ⊕ ) from gas-rich “sub-Neptunes” (2.0 to 3.0 R ⊕ ). We detect this feature at 2.1σ significance. Planets in single- and multitransiting systems exhibit the same size–eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.",

          "abstract": "In the polar regions, which are vulnerable receptors of mercury pollution, atmospheric mercury depletion events (AMDEs) efficiently convert elemental mercury (Hg(0)) into oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) via bromine oxidation. Hg(II) subsequently deposits onto snow and sea ice. While field observations have shown that a large percentage of deposited mercury is re-emitted from the ice to the atmosphere by a photoinduced process, the fundamental photochemistry that drives the re-emission process remains unknown. Here, using multiconfigurational quantum chemistry, we find that the photoreduction of HgBr 2 , HgBr 3 − , and HgBr 4 2− in ice is more efficient than in the gas phase. This results from the influence of water molecules on the molecular geometry and electronic structure of mercuric bromides in ice, which enhances the absorption intensities at wavelengths relevant in the troposphere (λ &gt; 290 nm), as compared to gas phase. Kinetic modeling shows that ~30 to 60% of deposited mercury in AMDEs can be reemitted due to the photoreduction of mercuric bromides in ice, in agreement with field observations. Our results reveal a photoreduction mechanism of sunlight-induced excited state chemistry of mercuric bromides on ice. These findings strongly suggest that this chemistry should be incorporated into atmospheric models to account for ice-atmosphere mercury cycling in the polar environments, currently not considered.",

Herein, inspired by the robust nuclear import mechanism, we show that NLSs originating from the plant infection–associated Agrobacterium proteins VirD2 and VirE2 can be incorporated into the Cas9 system as efficient nuclear delivery enhancers, thereby improving the low gene-editing frequency in a model microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , caused by poor nuclear localization of the bulky nuclease. Prior to evaluation of the NLSs, IPA1 (Cre04.g215850) was first defined in the alga as the nuclear import-related importin alpha (Impα) that serves as a counterpart adaptor protein of the NLSs, based on extensive in silico analyses considering the protein’s sequence, tertiary folding behavior, and structural basis when interacting with a well-studied SV40TAg NLS. Through precursive affinity explorations, we reproducibly found that the NLSs mediated the binding between the Cas9 and Impα with nM affinities and visually confirmed that the fusion of the NLSs strictly localized the peptide-bearing cargoes in the microalgal nucleus without compensating for their cleavage ability. When employed in a real-world application, the VirD2 NLS increases the mutation frequency (~1.12 × 10 −5 ) over 2.4-fold compared to an archetypal SV40TAg NLS (~0.46 × 10 −5 ) when fused with Cas9. We demonstrate the cross-species versatility of the Impα-dependent strategy by successfully applying it to an industrial alga, Chlorella Sp. HS2. This work, focused on affinity augmentation, provides insights into increasing the frequency of gene editing, which can be advantageously used in programmable mutagenesis with broad applicability.",

Wang et al ., Nat. Mat. 23, 492–498 (2024)]. This spontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic nematicity, breaks C 4 symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb interaction (denoted by V pp ) between oxygen p x and p y electrons. In this work, we study the spontaneous emergence of electronic nematicity within the three-band Hubbard [aka the Emery-VSA (Varma-Schmitt-Rink-Abrahams) model], using cluster dynamical mean-field theory. This method incorporates short-range electronic correlations and gives us access to the density of states, a quantity that is directly probed in experiments. We argue that there is a delicate competition between V pp and V pd (the latter being the Coulomb interaction between copper d x 2 − y 2 and oxygen p x , y electrons) that must be taken into account in order to find a Zhang-Rice singlet band well-resolved from the upper Hubbard band, and a splitting of the charge-transfer band (one of the signatures of charge nematicity) by roughly 50 meV, as observed recently.",

TEX38 interacts and colocalizes with ZDHHC19, a testis-enriched acyltransferase catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation, at the plasma membrane of spermatids. ZDHHC19 and TEX38 are each downregulated in mouse testes lacking the other protein. TEX38 stabilizes and localizes ZDHHC19 to the plasma membrane of cultured cells and vice versa, consolidating their interdependence. Mice deficient in ZDHHC19 or harboring a C142S mutation that disables the palmitoyltransferase activity of ZDHHC19 display phenotypes resembling those of Tex38 KO mice. Strikingly, ZDHHC19 palmitoylates ARRDC5, an arrestin family protein regulating sperm differentiation. Overall, our findings indicate that TEX38 forms a stable complex with ZDHHC19 at the plasma membrane of spermatids, which governs downstream S-palmitoylation of proteins essential for morphological transformation of spermatids.",

Here, we analyze two 30-y datasets on kelp forest communities during the reintroduction of sea otters along the west coast of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, and around San Nicolas Island, CA. We developed a community model to estimate species interactions as dynamic rates, varying with community state. We find evidence of a classic trophic cascade off Vancouver Island; the arrival of otters quickly led to depletion of urchins and recovery of kelp. However, this cascade was muted around San Nicolas Island, with otters, urchins, and kelp all coexisting at intermediate densities for multiple years. Our models show that this difference came from a pulse of strong otter impacts on urchins following recolonization off Vancouver Island, but not off San Nicolas Island. The mean effects of otters on urchins and urchins on kelp were not stronger in the north, indicating that interaction dynamics and not average interaction strength are key to explaining differences in community trajectories. We also find stronger multistep interaction chains in the south, arising from competitive interactions that indirectly buffered otter effects. These findings shed light on long-standing hypotheses about how interspecific interactions can alter the function of keystone species across community contexts. More broadly, we show how community change can be more accurately predicted by considering dynamic interaction strengths.",

          "abstract": "The tuberculosis-causing agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) establishes its niche inside macrophages by secretion of several virulence factors and engaging many host factors. Mycobacterial infection of macrophages results in a proinflammatory trigger–mediated secretion of TNFα. Protein kinase G (PknG), a Serine/Threonine kinase, is essential for mycobacterial survival within the macrophage. Pathogenic mycobacteria, upon infection, can trigger the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine TNFα, but whether secreted PknG plays any role in TNFα secretion at early stages of infection remains undeciphered. Moreover, at early infection stages, prevention of macrophage apoptosis is vital to successful mycobacterial pathogenesis. Our studies show that mycobacteria-secreted PknG can dampen the expression and concomitant secretion of proinflammatory TNFα. During early infection, M.tb infection–induced generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) leads to S-nitrosylation of PknG on Cys109, thereby enabling its secretion into macrophages. Upon M.tb infection, secreted S-nitrosylated PknG phosphorylates macrophage Silencer of Death Domains (SODD) at Thr405, as identified through our phosphoproteomic studies. Thereafter, phosphorylated SODD, through an irreversible binding with the TNFR1 death domain, prevents Caspase8 activation and concomitant extrinsic apoptotic trigger. Moreover, alveolar macrophages from mice infected with PknG-knockout M.tb also exhibited SODD phosphorylation and hindered Caspase8 activation to prevent extrinsic macrophage apoptosis. Therefore, this work exhibits S-nitrosylation-mediated secretion of PknG to induce phosphorylation of macrophage SODD, which, through irreversible interaction with TNFR1, prevented extrinsic macrophage apoptosis at the early stages of infection.",

          "abstract": "Visually guided grasping is a fundamental building block of animal behavior, the specific neural mechanisms of which remain poorly documented in the human brain. We have mapped the causal contribution of different brain parts to grasping behavior by studying the kinematic parameters of 33 patients with brain tumors, engaged in actions directed toward objects of different sizes. Using motion capture techniques, we analyzed the dynamics of grip aperture and wrist transport. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping analysis was applied to correlate lesion volumes with specific behavioral deficits. Results showed that lesions in the anterior and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus produced impaired finger scaling related to object size. Conversely, impaired velocity of finger aperture was associated with lesions in the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Grip aperture deficits following dominant hemisphere lesions were bilateral and were unilateral when following nondominant hemisphere lesions. Impaired wrist transport during reaching was associated with lesions in the first segment of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Our work highlights an architecture of the grasping network in humans, with unique species-specific features. We hypothesize a model of human neural architecture in which object geometry for hand preshaping is first coded in the left anterior intraparietal cortex and then shared with the right hemisphere. Execution of the motor program of hand preshaping is then performed by the PMd on the corresponding side.",

Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce “infomorphic” neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised, and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthesis converts solar energy to chemical energy by splitting water molecules and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates with an efficiency that engineers working on solar energy device can only dream of. Photosystem II (PSII) is the enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water that occurs during photosynthesis. This oxygen-producing reaction occurs in the Mn 4 Ca cluster found inside the enzyme’s oxygen-evolving center (OEC). Even though the structure and mechanism of action of the OEC have been intensively investigated for many decades, questions still remain about both. The Mn 4 Ca cluster stores the high-energy oxidizing equivalents required for water oxidation so that its own oxidation state depends on its chemical composition, i.e., the number of its oxygen ligands. The issue addressed here is the number of oxygen ligands associated with the Mn 4 Ca cluster after PSII has been exposed to two of the four flashes of light necessary for it to produce an oxygen molecule, PSII 2F. Comparisons of recently published cryo-EM maps and crystallographic OEC-omit maps described here reveal the OEC structure of PSII 2F contains only five internal oxygen ligands, and that the sixth O ligand identified earlier in PSII 2F crystal structures is an artifact caused by model bias. This finding should have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation that is catalyzed by PSII because it is incompatible with prevailing high valence paradigm (HVP) models for this process.",

          "abstract": "Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception of motion at each location in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original. This intuition is also reflected in classical theoretical and practical models of motion estimation, in which velocity flow fields invert when inputs are reversed in time. However, here we report that this symmetry of motion perception upon time reversal is broken in real visual systems. We designed a set of visual stimuli to investigate time reversal symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila ’s well-studied optomotor rotation behavior. We identified a suite of stimuli with a wide variety of properties that can uncover broken time reversal symmetry in fly behavioral responses. We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast distributions yielded models that broke time reversal symmetry, even when the training data themselves were time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks may be more prone to time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise from constrained optimization in natural environments.",

We used LiLac, a lactate biosensor with a quantitative fluorescence-lifetime readout, as a model system to address these questions. X-ray crystal structures and engineered high-affinity metal bridges demonstrate that LiLac exhibits a large interdomain twist motion that pulls the fluorescent protein away from a “sealed,” high-lifetime state in the absence of lactate to a “cracked,” low-lifetime state in its presence.

MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome, and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection.

          "abstract": "The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that, when transmitted to the brain, create the sensation of vision. The mammalian retina is epigenetically unique since the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into retinal cells is accompanied by a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoters of many genes important for retinal development and function. However, the pathway responsible for DNA demethylation and its role in retinal development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this pathway. To this end, we knocked out the TET family in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram tests, TUNEL, RNA-seq, WGBS, and 5hmC-Seal. We found that while the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway contributes to the development of many retinal cell types, it is the most significant contributor to rod and cone photoreceptor development and function. We found that genetic ablation of TET enzymes in RPCs prevents demethylation and the activity of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation. Reduced activity of genes responsible for rod specification results in the TET-deficient retina being depleted of these neurons. Meanwhile, reduced activity of genes responsible for rod and cone maturation leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the TET-deficient photoreceptors, which results in loss of their function and leads to blindness. These function-deprived, underdeveloped photoreceptors die over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.",

Isolated from a female mouse immunized with syngeneic sperm, the antisperm antibody OBF13 recognizes IZUMO1 and inhibits murine fertilization. How OBF13 interferes with sperm–egg interactions was unknown. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of IZUMO1 in complex with OBF13. OBF13 binds to the apex of the four-helix domain of IZUMO1, distant from the JUNO-binding site. Our crystal structure of OBF13-bound IZUMO1 resembles apo-IZUMO1 and differs from the structure of IZUMO1 in complex with JUNO. We identify that OBF13 carries a low level of somatic hypermutation, and through deep mutational scanning, we engineer an affinity-enhanced OBF13 variant. This OBF13 variant single-chain fragment variable decreases the apparent affinity of IZUMO1 for membrane-bound murine JUNO and blocks the binding of acrosome-reacted sperm to eggs, thereby preventing fertilization. We propose allostery between the OBF13 epitope and the JUNO-binding site. OBF13 inhibits a conformational change in IZUMO1, preventing fusion-competent sperm from adhering to murine eggs during fertilization. Surprisingly, murine IZUMO1 binds to hamster JUNO with an affinity ~20-fold higher than to murine JUNO. The decreased affinity caused by OBF13 of murine IZUMO1 for hamster JUNO is sufficient for murine sperm to bind to and fuse with hamster eggs. Our studies provide a structural and mechanistic framework for species-specific, allosteric inhibition of IZUMO1 by a naturally occurring antisperm antibody and offer insights into the development of immunocontraceptives.",

Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A nonlinear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two nondimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical “ice worms,” well known to glaciologists.",

Archaeological sites with well-preserved and directly radiocarbon-dated botanical assemblages are rare, however, so we know very little about the complexities of the domestication process. Here, we define an early locus of avocado domestication using well-dated desiccated and carbonized avocado remains from El Gigante rockshelter in western Honduras spanning the last 11,000 y. Measurements of avocado seeds and rinds show evidence for long-term management resulting in selection for larger, more robust fruits through time that culminated by 2,250 to 2,080 calendar B.P. (cal. B.P.). However, human-directed selection for larger fruits with thicker rinds is evident as early as 7,565 to 7,265 cal. B.P. Seed morphology is similar to P. americana var. guatemalensis and is congruent with genetic data for the development of this variety in both the highlands of Guatemala and Honduras. Increases in seed size and rind thickness through time are consistent with genetic evidence for the enrichment of putative candidate genes for fruit development and ripening in this variety.",

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess associations between long-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 outcomes (infection, hospitalization, and death) in a COVID-19-naive cohort (n = 458,396). Additionally, associations between air pollutants and the risk of COVID-19 severity (hospitalization and death) were evaluated in a COVID-19 infection cohort (n = 110,216). Furthermore, this study investigated the role of host genetic susceptibility in the relationships between exposure to air pollutants and the development of COVID-19-related outcomes. Long-term exposure to air pollutants was significantly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes in the COVID-19 naive cohort.

Currently, there are no generally accepted treatments aside from supportive care using mechanical ventilation. However, this can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which contributes to a 30 to 40% mortality rate. In this study, we develop and demonstrate a technique to quantify forms of energy transport and dissipation during mechanical ventilation to directly evaluate their relationship to VILI. A porcine ARDS model was used, with ventilation parameters independently controlling lung overdistension and alveolar/airway recruitment/derecruitment (RD). Hourly measurements of airflow, tracheal and esophageal pressures, respiratory system impedance, and oxygen transport were taken for six hours following lung injury to track energy transfer and lung function. The final degree of injury was assessed histologically. Total and dissipated energies were quantified from lung pressure–volume relationships and subdivided into contributions from airflow, tissue viscoelasticity, and RD. Only RD correlated with physiologic recovery. Despite accounting for a very small fraction (2 to 5%) of the total energy dissipation, RD is damaging because it occurs quickly over a very small area. We estimate power intensity of RD energy dissipation to be 100 W/m 2 , equivalent to 10% of the Sun’s luminance at the Earth’s surface. Minimizing repetitive RD events may thus be crucial for mitigating VILI.",

The rate of divide migration is governed by differences in erosion rates across the divide and is thus sensitive to spatiotemporal variations in tectonics and climate. However, established approaches for quantifying divide migration rates offer only indirect evidence for the motion of the divide and provide only migration rate averages. Consequently, transience in divide migration cannot be resolved, hindering the ability to explore environmental changes that drive the dynamics of such potential transience. Here, we study a set of datable terraces identified as markers of paleo-divide locations, which provide direct evidence for the paleo motion of the divide. The location and age of the terraces reveal intermittent divide migration at timescales of 10 4 to 10 5 y, with phases of rapid migration—at rates more than twice the average—which coincide with documented regional paleoclimate fluctuations. These findings highlight the intermittent nature of divide migration dynamics over geomorphic timescales and its potential sensitivity to climate changes, underscoring the impact of such changes on the planform evolution of drainage basins.",

Operationalizing these commitments requires choosing a planting strategy: How many trees should be planted, of which species, and where? Given those choices must be made now but have long-term consequences, such decisions are plagued by uncertainty. For example, species that are well suited to present conditions may perform poorly under future climates, yet those future climates are themselves highly uncertain. Using the exemplar of the United Kingdom, a nation committed to achieving net zero emissions by midcentury, we quantify key uncertainties pertaining to coevolving climate and economic conditions and examine how modern methods of decision-making under uncertainty can advise on planting choices. Our analysis reveals that the best planting strategy assuming a “high-emissions” future is radically different to that for a future that remains on a “near-historic” path. Planting for the former while experiencing the latter results in substantial net costs to UK society. Assimilating uncertainty into decision-making identifies planting strategies that diversify risk and significantly reduce the probability of high-cost outcomes. Importantly, our research reveals that the scope for mitigating risk through choice of planting strategy is relatively limited.

The triscatechol siderophores trivanchrobactin and ruckerbactin, produced by Vibrio campbellii DS40M4 and Yersinia ruckeri YRB, respectively, are naturally occurring diastereomers that form chiral ferric complexes in opposing enantiomeric configurations. Chiral recognition is a hallmark of specificity in biological systems, yet the biological consequences of chiral coordination compounds are relatively unexplored. We demonstrate stereoselective discrimination of microbial growth and iron uptake by chiral Fe(III)–siderophores. The siderophore utilization pathway in V. campbellii DS40M4 is stereoselective for Λ-Fe(III)–trivanchrobactin, but not the mismatched Δ-Fe(III)–ruckerbactin diastereomer. Chiral recognition is likely conferred by the stereospecificity of both the outer membrane receptor (OMR) protein FvtA and the periplasmic binding protein (PBP) FvtB, both of which must interact preferentially with the Λ-configured Fe(III)-coordination complexes.",

          "abstract": "Graphene-based nanostructures hold immense potential as strong and lightweight materials, however, their mechanical properties such as modulus and strength are difficult to fully exploit due to challenges in atomic-scale engineering. This study presents a database of over 2,000 pristine and defective nanoscale CNT bundles and other graphitic assemblies, inspired by microscopy, with associated stress–strain curves from reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the reactive INTERFACE force field (IFF-R). These 3D structures, containing up to 80,000 atoms, enable detailed analyses of structure-stiffness-failure relationships. By leveraging the database and physics- and chemistry-informed machine learning (ML), accurate predictions of elastic moduli and tensile strength are demonstrated at speeds 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than efficient MD simulations. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks with Spatial Information (HS-GNNs) are introduced, which integrate chemistry knowledge. HS-GNNs as well as extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) achieve forecasts of mechanical properties of arbitrary carbon nanostructures with only 3 to 6% mean relative error. The reliability equals experimental accuracy and is up to 20 times higher than other ML methods. Predictions maintain 8 to 18% accuracy for large CNT bundles, CNT junctions, and carbon fiber cross-sections outside the training distribution. The physics- and chemistry-informed HS-GNN works remarkably well for data outside the training range while XGBoost works well with limited training data inside the training range. The carbon nanostructure database is designed for integration with multimodal experimental and simulation data, scalable beyond 100 nm size, and extendable to chemically similar compounds and broader property ranges. The ML approaches have potential for applications in structural materials, nanoelectronics, and carbon-based catalysts.",

Here, we report that OsWRKY36 suppresses the resistance to insects and pathogens via transcriptional repression of Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyases ( PALs ), a key enzyme in phenylpropanoid pathway in rice. Knocking out OsWRKY36 causes elevated lignin biosynthesis and increased sclerenchyma thickness of leaf sheath, leading to enhanced resistance to multiple pests and pathogens.

This is particularly related to translocation of actin into nucleus and highlighted in our interpretation of an “abnormal” phenomenon that large RGD nanospacing (&gt;70 nm) disassembles integrin clusters, inhibits cell adhesion, but promotes osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Our studies reveal that the unstable adhesion at the 150 nm RGD distance increases actin dynamics, resulting in the nuclear translocation of globular (G) actin.

Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here, we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.",

To elucidate the functional relevance of these interactions, we developed a mass spectrometry–based screening method for higher throughput in vitro enzyme assays. By systematically quantifying the effects of 79 metabolites on the activity of 20 central Escherichia coli enzymes, we not only assess functional relevance but also gauge the depth of the current understanding of regulatory interactions within one of the best-characterized networks. Our identification of 50 inhibitors and 14 activators not only expands the range of known input signals but also uncovers novel regulatory logic. For instance, we observed that AMP inhibits malic enzyme to safeguard the cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and erythrose-4-phosphate inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to redirect flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Discrepancies between our standardized assays and existing database entries suggest that many previously reported interactions might occur only under specific, often nonphysiological conditions. Our dataset represents a systematically determined functional protein–metabolite interaction network, establishing a baseline for allosteric regulation in central metabolism. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic governing metabolic processes and underscore its significance in cellular adaptation and growth.",

However, it is often nearly impossible to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which a biological isotope effect manifests due to the complexity of these systems. As such, one proposed in vitro system of study for a quantum isotope effect is calcium phosphate aggregation, where symmetric calcium phosphate molecular species, known as Posner molecules, have been theorized to have phosphorus nuclear spin–dependent self-binding rates, which could be differently modulated by doping with stable lithium isotopes. Here, we present in vitro evidence for such a differential lithium isotope effect on the formation and aggregation of amorphous calcium phosphate from solution under certain conditions. Experiments confirm that lithium incorporates into amorphous calcium phosphate, with 7 Li found to promote a greater abundance of observable calcium phosphate particles than 6 Li under identical solution preparations. These in vitro results offer a potential explanation for in vivo biological studies that have shown differential lithium isotope effects. Given the importance of calcium phosphate in biological systems—ranging from mitochondrial signaling pathways to key biomineralization processes, as well as the proposed role of Posner molecules as a “neural qutrit”—these results present an important step in understanding calcium phosphate nucleation as well as the potential role of calcium phosphate for quantum biology and processing.",

Here, we investigated coronavirus nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15), which encodes a highly conserved endoribonuclease (EndoU). EndoU functions as an immune antagonist by limiting the accumulation of viral replication intermediates that would otherwise be sensed by the host. Despite being a promising antiviral target, it has been difficult to develop small-molecule inhibitors that target the EndoU active site. We generated nsp15 mutants of the coronaviruses severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 and identified conserved residues within the amino-terminal domain that are required for EndoU activity. Loss of EndoU activity caused the activation of host sensors, which limited viral replication in interferon-responsive cells and attenuated disease in MHV-infected mice. Using transcriptional profiling, we found that MHV EndoU mutant viruses upregulate multiple host sensors, including Z-form nucleic acid-binding protein 1 (ZBP1). We found that nsp15 mutants induced early, robust ZBP1-mediated necroptosis. EndoU mutant viruses also induced ZBP1-independent apoptosis and pyroptosis pathways, causing early, robust cell death that limits virus replication and pathogenesis. Overall, we document the importance of the amino-terminal domain for EndoU function. We also highlight the importance of nsp15/EndoU activity for evading host sensors, delaying cell death, and promoting pathogenesis.",

Defining the factors that regulate viral messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is thus critical to understand how viruses replicate and cause disease. To identify factors that might regulate viral mRNA translation, we developed a technique for identifying proteins associated with a native RNA expressed from its endogenous promoter and genomic locus. This approach uses a guide RNA to target dCas13b fused to a biotin ligase domain to a specific RNA, where it covalently labels proteins in close proximity. Using this approach, we identified multiple proteins associated with transcripts encoding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins and found that several associated proteins positively or negatively regulate HCMV replication. We confirmed that one such protein, the cellular Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), binds to HCMV immediate early mRNAs and is required for efficient viral protein expression and virus replication. Ablating YBX1 expression reduced the association of HCMV immediate early mRNAs with polysomes, demonstrating a role for YBX1 as a positive regulator of viral RNA translation. These results provide a powerful tool for unraveling RNA–protein interactions that can be used in a wide range of biological processes and reveal a role for YBX1 as a critical regulator of HCMV immediate early gene expression.",

We show that mosaics can be projected onto a Symbolic Ternary Diagram, where the relative proportions of “T,” “X,” and “Y” junctions are uniquely related to contributions from distinct modes of fracture. Most planetary mosaics cluster in a region associated with hierarchical fracture networks, where sequential cracking favors formation of T junctions. Exceptions to this rule may betray the presence of water. Europa’s fracture networks stand apart due to the predominance of X junctions; this is a special feature of ice, where healing of cracks by refreezing of water allows new fractures to overprint older ones. Several fracture networks on Mars appear as outliers due to the high proportion of Y junctions. These patterns—previously interpreted as ancient mudcracks and frozen polar terrain, based on geological evidence—are consistent with the twisting of crack junctions by cyclic volume change.

          "abstract": "Bdelloid rotifers are well known for their abilities to survive long periods of freezing as well as acquire foreign genes. Recently sequenced genomes of some bdelloid rotifers in England were found to encode several proteins similar to ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that are usually associated with freeze–thaw tolerance. Here, I describe bdelloid rotifers inhabiting an algal patch in Antarctica that have multiple homologs of these genes. Structures of the proteins predicted by AlphaFold show that they are well designed for ice-binding and a recombinant protein made for one of them showed strong ice-binding activity. The existence of multiple copies of these proteins is another characteristic of IBPs. Furthermore, multiple bdelloid rotifers in the algal patch were revived in less than an hour after storage at −25 °C for 24 y, an apparent record for laboratory-controlled studies. Several characteristics of these genes point to bacteria as their source: sequence homology, absence of introns, and a structural peculiarity so far found only in bacteria. The remarkable freezing tolerance of bdelloid rotifers can thus be at least partially attributed to horizontally acquired bacterial genes encoding IBPs.",

          "abstract": "Oscillations of conductance observed in strong magnetic fields are a striking manifestation of the quantum dynamics of charge carriers in solids. The large charge carrier density in typical metals sets the scale of oscillations in both electrical and thermal conductivity, which characterize the Fermi surface. In semimetals, thermal transport at low-charge carrier density is expected to be phonon dominated, yet several experiments observe giant quantum oscillations in thermal transport. This raises the question of whether there is an overarching mechanism leading to sizable oscillations that survives in phonon-dominated semimetals. In this work, we show that such a mechanism exists. It relies on the peculiar phase-space allowed for phonon scattering by electrons when only a few Landau levels are filled. Our measurements on the Dirac semimetal ZrTe 5 support this counterintuitive mechanism through observation of pronounced thermal quantum oscillations, since they occur in similar magnitude and phase in directions parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Our phase-space argument applies to all low-density semimetals, topological or not, including graphene and bismuth.

Here, we used a large-scale data-driven approach to uncover core latent dimensions of material representations from behavior. First, we created an image dataset of 200 systematically sampled materials and 600 photographs (STUFF dataset, https://osf.io/myutc/ ). Using these images, we next collected 1.87 million triplet similarity judgments and used a computational model to derive a set of sparse, positive dimensions underlying these judgments. The resulting multidimensional embedding space predicted independent material similarity judgments and the similarity matrix of all images close to the human intersubject consistency. We found that representations of individual images were captured by a combination of 36 material dimensions that were highly reproducible and interpretable, comprising perceptual (e.g., grainy, blue) as well as conceptual (e.g., mineral, viscous) dimensions. These results provide the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of how humans make sense of materials.",

          "abstract": "Removing glutamate from the synaptic cleft is vital for proper function of the brain. Excitatory amino acid transporters mediate this process by uptaking the neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft back to the cell after its release. The archaeal homolog, Glt Ph , an aspartate transporter from Pyrococcus horikoshii , presents the best structurally characterized model for this family of transporters. In order to transport, Glt Ph undergoes elevator-like conformational changes between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states. Here, we characterize, at an atomic level, the OF⇌IF transition of Glt Ph in different apo /bound states using a combination of ensemble-based enhanced sampling techniques, employing more than two thousand of coupled simulation replicas of membrane-embedded Glt Ph . The resulting free-energy profiles portray the transition of apo /bound states as a complex four-stage process, while sodium binding alone locks the structure in one of its states. Along the transition, the transport domain (TD) disengages from the scaffold domain (SD), allowing it to move as a piston sliding vertically with respect to the membrane during the elevator-like motion of TD. Lipid interactions with residues comprising the SD–TD interface directly influence the large-scale conformational changes and, consequently, the energetics of transport. Structural intermediates formed during the transition leak water molecules and may correlate to the uncoupled Cl − ion conductance observed experimentally in both prokaryotic and mammalian glutamate transporters. Mechanistic insights obtained from our study provide a structural framework for better development of therapeutic for neurological disorders.",

UvrD family monomers translocate along single-stranded (ss) DNA but need to be activated by dimerization to unwind DNA in the absence of force or accessory factors. However, prior structural studies have only revealed monomeric complexes. Here, we report the first structures of a dimeric UvrD-family helicase, Mycobacterium tuberculosis UvrD1, both free and bound to a DNA junction. In each structure, the dimer interface occurs between the 2B subdomains of each subunit. The apo UvrD1 dimer is observed in symmetric compact and extended forms indicating substantial flexibility. This symmetry is broken in the DNA-bound dimer complex with leading and trailing subunits adopting distinct conformations. Biochemical experiments reveal that the Escherichia coli UvrD dimer shares the same 2B–2B interface. In contrast to the dimeric structures, an inactive, autoinhibited UvrD1 DNA-bound monomer structure reveals 2B subdomain–DNA contacts that are likely inhibitory. The major reorientation of the 2B subdomains that occurs upon UvrD1 dimerization prevents these duplex DNA interactions, thus relieving the autoinhibition. These structures reveal that the 2B subdomain serves a major regulatory role rather than participating directly in DNA unwinding.",

          "abstract": "Transmissibility of respiratory viruses is a complex viral trait that is intricately linked to tropism. Several highly transmissible viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Influenza viruses, specifically target multiciliated cells in the upper respiratory tract to facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission. In contrast, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) generally transmits poorly between humans, which is largely attributed to the absence of its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the upper respiratory tract. At the same time, MERS-CoV epidemiology is characterized by occasional superspreading events, suggesting that some individuals can disseminate this virus effectively. Here, we utilized well-differentiated human pulmonary and nasal airway organoid-derived cultures to further delineate the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV. We find that MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in both pulmonary and nasal airway cultures. Using single-cell messenger-RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, we show that MERS-CoV preferentially targeted multiciliated cells, leading to loss of ciliary coverage. MERS-CoV cellular tropism was dependent on the differentiation of the organoid-derived cultures, and replication efficiency varied considerably between donors. Similarly, variable and focal expression of DPP4 was revealed in human nose tissues. This study indicates that the upper respiratory tract tropism of MERS-CoV may vary between individuals due to differences in DPP4 expression, providing an explanation for the unpredictable transmission pattern of MERS-CoV.",

The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity—roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis of this disordered system offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.",

Here, we use a variety of in situ techniques to examine cholesterol monohydrate crystallization over multiple length scales. In this study, we first identified a biomimetic solvent to generate triclinic monohydrate crystals, while avoiding the formation of nonphysiological solvates and enabling crystallization at rates where the dynamics of surface growth could be captured in real time. Using a binary mixture of water and isopropanol, with the latter serving as a surrogate for lipids in physiological environments, we show that cholesterol monohydrate crystals grow classically by the nucleation and spreading of crystal layers. Time-resolved imaging confirms that layers are generated by dislocations and monomers incorporate into advancing steps after diffusion along the crystal surface and not directly from the solution. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidics measurements concertedly reveal abundant macrosteps, which engender a self-inhibition mechanism that reduces the rate of crystal growth. This finding stands in contrast to numerous other systems, in which classical mechanisms lead to unhindered growth by spreading of single layers.",

We recently demonstrated that human B cell responses to membrane-associated but not to soluble antigens in vitro depended on the expression and activity of the plasma membrane mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1. Here, we provide evidence that the efficacy of the current human papillomavirus virus-like particle (HPV VLP) vaccines may be due in part to their inherent ability to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane presentation of antigens to B cells. We compared HPV-specific human B cell responses to HPV VLPs versus soluble HPV pentameric capsomeres and showed that although both induced calcium responses, only HPV VLP-induced responses were blocked by Piezo1 inhibitors. The kinetics of internalization of HPV-VLP and capsomeres into HPV-specific B cells were similar and neither required Piezo1 function as shown by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Piezo. However, trafficking of HPV-VLPs into intracellular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) + antigen-processing compartments was Piezo1-dependent, whereas trafficking of capsomeres was not. In addition, a time course of intracellular trafficking suggested that colocalization of HPV-VLP with MHC classII was more stable over time as compared to capsomeres. Taken together these findings suggest that the ability of HPV-VLP vaccines to mimic Piezo1-dependent membrane antigen presentation may be exploited in the design of highly effective human vaccines.",

Administration of MS-driving Blautia species ( Blautia wexlerae; BW ) to mice resulted in increased levels of gut inflammatory markers and altered microbiota with increased capacity to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Utilizing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we identified a lower gut Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio as a hallmark of the disease. BW -administered mice also showed a lower Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio pre-EAE induction which correlated with increased disease severity post-EAE induction. The importance of the Bifidobacterium to Akkermansia ratio at the species level, lower Bifidobacterium adolescentis to Akkermansia muciniphila ( BA:AM ), was validated in our MS cohort and a large International Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Study.

Using the canopy height metrics products from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a space-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument specifically designed to characterize forest structure, we analyze the environmental correlates of spatial variation of global tropical forest canopy height. Our study demonstrates that climate, topography, and soil properties account for 75% of the variation in tropical forest canopy height. Elevation, dry season length, and solar radiation are the most important drivers in determining canopy height both locally and regionally.

Structural studies of secreted mucins are complicated by the enormous sizes, flexibility, and complex supramolecular assembly modes of these glycoproteins. The two major respiratory mucins are MUC5AC and MUC5B. Here, we present structures of a large amino-terminal segment of MUC5AC in the form of helical filaments. These filaments differ from filamentous and tubular structures observed previously for the intestinal mucin MUC2 and the partial mucin homolog VWF. Nevertheless, the MUC5AC helical filaments support the proposed mechanism, based on MUC2 and VWF, for how noncovalent interactions between mucin monomers guide disulfide crosslinking to form polymers. The high-resolution MUC5AC structures show how local and limited changes in amino acid sequence can profoundly affect higher-order assembly while preserving the overall folds and polymerization activity of mucin glycoproteins. Differences in supramolecular assembly are likely to be functionally significant considering the divergence of mechanical properties and physiological requirements between respiratory and intestinal mucins. Determining the high-resolution structures of respiratory mucins provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which they clean and protect the lungs. Moreover, the MUC5AC structure enables visualization of the sites of human amino acid sequence variation and disease-associated mutations.",

Different dominant mutations in DNM2 also cause centronuclear myopathy (CNM), and increasing BIN1 (amphiphysin 2), an endogenous modulator of DNM2, rescued CNM in mice. Here, we found that increasing BIN1 level exacerbated the phenotypes of the Dnm2 K562E/+ mouse carrying the most common DNM2 -CMT mutation. Conversely, whole-body reduction of Bin1 expression level, through the generation of Dnm2 K562E/+ mice with heterozygous loss of BIN1, restored motor performance and ameliorated muscle organization and structural defects of peripheral nerves. The rescue of motor defects was maintained at least up to 1 y of age. BIN1 inhibited the GTPase activity of DNM2, and the rescue was driven by an increased activity of the K562E DNM2 -CMT mutant, and a normalization of integrin localization in muscle. Overall, this study highlights BIN1 as a modifier of DNM2 -CMT, and its reduction as a potential therapeutic strategy.

Yet, despite extensive study of the global level of nonequilibrium in the brain, quantifying the irreversibility of interactions among brain regions at multiple levels remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analyzing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multilayer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of nonequilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions while for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most nonequilibrium interactions are between cognitive–sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organization of neural dynamics from the perspective of brain network dynamics.",

We observed a sequential occurrence of structural changes in the inactive-to-active transition of M2R induced by a superagonist iperoxo, which includes the orthosteric binding site contraction, the TM6 opening into an intermediate conformation, and a further structural change toward full activation upon binding to G protein or a G protein mimetic nanobody. Two activation intermediates were identified, which show structural features different from those reported for apo-GPCRs.

          "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, which connects these neuropathologies by a common phenotype. Various proteins and peptides form aggregates that are poorly degraded, and their ensuing pathological accumulation underlies these neurodegenerative diseases. Similarities may exist in the mechanisms responsible for the buildup of these aggregates. Therefore, therapeutics designed to treat one neurodegenerative disease may be beneficial to others. In ALS models, the compound NU-9 was previously shown to block neurodegeneration produced by aggregation-inducing mutations of SOD-1 and TDP-43 [B. Genç et al., Clin. Transl. Med. 11 , e336 (2021)]. Here, we report that NU-9 also prevents the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs), small peptide aggregates that are instigators of Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration [M. Tolar et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci. 22 , 6355 (2021)]. AβO buildup was measured by immunofluorescence imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to exogenous monomeric Aβ. In this model, AβO buildup occurs via cathepsin L- and dynamin-dependent trafficking. This is prevented by NU-9 through a cellular mechanism that is cathepsin B- and lysosome-dependent, suggesting that NU-9 enhances the ability of endolysosomal trafficking to protect against AβO buildup. This possibility is strongly supported by a quantitative assay for autophagosomes that shows robust stimulation by NU-9. These results contribute additional understanding to the mechanisms of protein aggregation and suggest that multiple neurodegenerative diseases might be treatable by targeting common pathogenic mechanisms responsible for protein aggregation.",

          "abstract": "Adaptation is a critical determinant of the diversification, persistence, and geographic range limits of species. Yet the genetic basis of adaptation is often unknown and potentially underpinned by a wide range of mutational types—from single nucleotide changes to large-scale alterations of chromosome structure. Copy number variation (CNV) is thought to be an important source of adaptive genetic variation, as indicated by decades of candidate gene studies that point to CNVs underlying rapid adaptation to strong selective pressures. Nevertheless, population-genomic studies of CNVs face unique logistical challenges not encountered by other forms of genetic variation. Consequently, few studies have systematically investigated the contributions of CNVs to adaptation at a genome-wide scale. We present a genome-wide analysis of CNV contributing to the adaptation of an invasive weed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia . CNVs show clear signatures of parallel local adaptation between North American (native) and European (invaded) ranges, implying widespread reuse of CNVs during adaptation to shared heterogeneous patterns of selection. We used a local principal component analysis (PCA) to genotype CNV regions in whole-genome sequences of samples collected over the last two centuries. We identified 16 large CNV regions of up to 11.85 megabases in length, eight of which show signals of rapid evolutionary change, with pronounced frequency shifts between historic and modern populations. Our results provide compelling genome-wide evidence that CNV underlies rapid adaptation over contemporary timescales of natural populations.",

          "abstract": "The outer membrane (OM) of gram-negative bacteria is a robust, impermeable barrier that excludes many classes of antibiotics. Contrary to the classical model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer, recent evidence suggests the OM is predominantly an asymmetric proteolipid membrane (APLM). Outer leaflet lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that surround integral β-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are shared with other OMPs to form a supramolecular network in which the levels of OMPs approach those of LPS. Some of the most abundant OMPs in the Escherichia coli OM are trimeric porins. How porins and LPS are incorporated into the OM of growing bacteria is poorly understood. Here, we use live-cell imaging and microfluidics to investigate how LPS, labeled using click chemistry, and the porin OmpF, labeled using the bacteriocin colicin N, are incorporated into the E. coli OM. Diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy shows OmpF and LPS to be uniformly distributed and immobile. However, clustering of both macromolecules becomes evident by superresolution microscopy, which is also the case for their biogenesis proteins, BamA and LptD, respectively. Notwithstanding these common organizational features, OmpF insertion into the OM is cell-cycle-dependent leading to binary partitioning and strong polar accumulation of old OmpF. Old LPS on the other hand is diluted ~50% at each division cycle by new LPS, resulting in only mild polar accumulation of preexisting LPS. We conclude that although LPS and OMPs are destined to form the APLM their insertion dynamics are fundamentally different, which has major implications for understanding how the OM is assembled.",

          "abstract": "Molecular-level understanding of the early stage of crystallization remains a significant challenge. For a wide range of fundamental research and applications, it is of great importance to understand the mechanism of crystal polymorph selections in different solvents or in the presence of additives. We studied glycine crystallization in aqueous solution with or without the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl), one crystal nucleation at a time, using the recently developed single-crystal nucleation spectroscopy (SCNS). It has been reported that glycine forms γ-glycine when salt is added to aqueous solution, and the mechanism has been considered as a classical nucleation where γ-glycine forms directly as a crystal nucleus. Our study shows that metastable polymorph β-glycine forms first in aqueous solution both with or without NaCl through a nonclassical nucleation pathway. NaCl can stabilize the metastable β-glycine over several hours and also prevent it from converting to α-glycine. Eventually γ-glycine nucleates on the surface of β-glycine and then grows while dissolving the mother β-glycine. The crystal habit of β-glycine suggests that the stabilization by NaCl occurs at its polar face. SCNS provides crucial information to accelerate the investigation of the early stage of crystallization toward the rational control of polymorphisms.",

          "abstract": "The continued emergence of antimalarial drug resistance highlights the need to develop new antimalarial therapies. Unfortunately, new drug development is often hampered by undesirable drug-like properties of lead compounds. Prodrug approaches temporarily mask undesirable compound features, improving bioavailability and target penetration. We have found that lipophilic diester prodrugs of phosphonic acid antibiotics, such as fosmidomycin (Fsm), exhibit significantly higher antimalarial potency than their parent compounds [R.L. Edwards et al. , Sci. Rep. 7 , 8400 (2017)]. However, the activating enzymes for these prodrugs were unknown. Here, we show that an erythrocyte enzyme, acylpeptide hydrolase (APEH), is the major activating enzyme of multiple lipophilic ester prodrugs. Surprisingly, this enzyme is taken up by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum , where it localizes to the parasite cytoplasm and retains enzymatic activity. Using a fluorogenic ester library, we characterize the structure–activity relationship of APEH and compare it to that of P. falciparum esterases. We show that parasite-internalized APEH plays an important role in the activation of substrates with branching at the alpha carbon, in keeping with its exopeptidase activity. Our findings highlight a mechanism for antimicrobial prodrug activation, relying on a host-derived enzyme to yield activation at a microbial target. Mutations in prodrug-activating enzymes are a common mechanism for antimicrobial drug resistance [E. S. Istvan et al. , Nat. Commun. 8 , 14240 (2017); K. M. V.

Despite the development of various distinct probes that enable super-resolved stimulated emission depletion (STED) imaging of mitochondria in live cells, most of these membrane-potential-dependent fluorophores cannot be retained well in mitochondria after chemical fixation. This lack of suitable mitochondrial probes has limited STED imaging of mitochondria to live cell samples. In this study, we introduce a mitochondria-specific probe, PK Mito Orange FX (PKMO FX), which features a fixation-driven cross-linking motif and accumulates in the mitochondrial inner membrane. It exhibits high fluorescence retention after chemical fixation and efficient depletion at 775 nm, enabling nanoscopic imaging both before and after aldehyde fixation. We demonstrate the compatibility of this probe with conventional immunolabeling and other strategies commonly used for fluorescence labeling of fixed samples. Moreover, we show that PKMO FX facilitates correlative super-resolution light and electron microscopy, enabling the correlation of multicolor fluorescence images and transmission EM images via the characteristic mitochondrial pattern.

The spatial component of the density of states for these special polarons is determined by the length scale of spatial modulation of electronegativity caused by a separate set of standalone topological defects. The latter length scale is fixed by the cooperativity size for structural relaxation; the size is largely independent of temperature in the glass but above melting, it decreases with temperature. Thus we predict that the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity should exhibit a jump in the slope near the glass transition; the size of the jump is predicted to increase with the fragility of the melt. The predicted values of the jump and of the conductivity itself are consistent with experiment.",

We show that serotypes AAV8, AAV9, and AAVPHP.eB are suitable viral vectors to infect both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of the axolotl brain.

Pinched hysteresis I-V loop curve, scan rate dependency, and distinctive impedance spectra confirmed the memristive characteristics of the as-prepared device. Moreover, the memory mechanism was discussed theoretically and validated by finite-element modeling. The ISM features multiple neuromorphic functions, such as paired-pulse facilitation, paired-pulse depression, and learning–experience behavior. More importantly, the ion selectivity of the ISM was observed, which allowed further emulation of ion-selective neural functions like resting membrane potential. Benefiting from the structural similarity to membrane-embedded ion channels, the ISM opens the door for ion-based neuromorphic computing and sophisticated chemical regulation by manipulating multifarious ions with neuromorphic functions.",

          "abstract": "The binding of photoswitchable molecules to partners forms the basis of many naturally occurring light-dependent signaling pathways and various photopharmacological and optogenetic tools. A critical parameter affecting the function of these molecules is the thermal half-life of the light state. Reports in the literature indicate that, in some cases, a binding partner can significantly influence the thermal half-life, while in other cases it has no effect. Here, we present a unifying framework for quantitatively analyzing the effects of binding partners on thermal reversion rates. We focus on photoswitchable protein/binder interactions involving LOV domains, photoactive yellow protein, and CBCR GAF domains with partners that bind either the light or the dark state of the photoswitchable domain. We show that the effect of a binding partner depends on the extent to which the transition state for reversion resembles the dark state or the light state. We quantify this resemblance with a ϕ switching value, where ϕ switching = 1 if the conformation of the part of the photoswitchable molecule that interacts with the binding partner closely resembles its dark state conformation and ϕ switching = 0 if it resembles its light state. In addition to providing information on the transition state for switching, this analysis can guide the design of photoswitchable systems that retain useful thermal half-lives in practice. The analysis also provides a basis for the use of simple kinetic measurements to determine effective changes in affinity even in complex milieu.",

High-throughput and AI-driven screens have the potential to identify drugs and downstream pathways that modulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

We applied LogiRx to discover how drugs discovered in a previous compound screen attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We experimentally validated LogiRx predictions in neonatal cardiomyocytes, adult mice, and two patient databases. Using LogiRx, we predicted antihypertrophic pathways for seven drugs currently used to treat noncardiac disease. We experimentally validated that escitalopram (Lexapro) and mifepristone inhibit hypertrophy of cultured cardiomyocytes in two contexts. The LogiRx model predicted that escitalopram prevents hypertrophy through an “off-target” serotonin receptor/PI3Kγ pathway, mechanistically validated using additional investigational drugs. Further, escitalopram reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a mouse model of hypertrophy and fibrosis. Finally, mining of both FDA and University of Virginia databases showed that patients with depression on escitalopram have a lower incidence of cardiac hypertrophy than those prescribed other serotonin reuptake inhibitors that do not target the serotonin receptor. Mechanistic machine learning by LogiRx discovers drug pathways that perturb cell states, which may enable repurposing of escitalopram and other drugs to limit cardiac remodeling through off-target pathways.",

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding the CA motif of the nucleation-promoting factor Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASp) to inactive, splayed Arp2/3 complex shifts it toward the short-pitch active conformation and opens a binding site for an actin monomer on Arp3.

The O 2 -dependent aromatase that converts androgen to estrogen (estrogenesis) has never been identified in any prokaryotes. Here, we report the finding of anaerobic estrogenesis in a Peptococcaceae bacterium ( Phosphitispora sp. strain TUW77) isolated from the gut of the great blue-spotted mudskipper ( Boleophthalmus pectinirostris ). This strain exhibits testosterone fermentation pathways, transforming testosterone into estrogens and androstanediol under anaerobic conditions. Physiological experiments revealed that strain TUW77 grows exclusively on testosterone, utilizing the androgenic C-19 methyl group as both the carbon source and electron donor. The genomic analysis identified three copies of a polycistronic gene cluster, abeABC (anaerobic bacterial estrogenesis), encoding components of a classic cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase system. These genes, highly expressed under testosterone-fed conditions, show up to 57% protein identity to the characterized EmtAB from denitrifying Denitratisoma spp., known for methylating estrogen into androgen (the reverse reaction). Tiered transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the removed C-19 methyl group is completely oxidized to CO 2 via the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), while the reducing equivalents (NADH) fully reduce remaining testosterone to androstanediol. Consistently, the addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, an extracellular electron acceptor, to testosterone-fed TUW77 cultures enabled complete testosterone conversion into estrogen without androstanediol accumulation (anaerobic testosterone oxidation). This finding of aromatase-independent estrogenesis in anaerobic bacteria suggests that the ancient WLP may have contributed to the emergence of estrogens in the early biosphere.",

Rare damaging RGs were estimated to contribute to at least 2.2% of CHD, with greater enrichment among laterality phenotypes (5.4%) versus other subsets (1.4%). Among 108 curated human recessive CHD genes, there were 66 RGs, with 54 in 11 genes with &gt;1 RG, 12 genes with 1 RG, and 85 genes with zero. RGs were more prevalent among offspring of consanguineous union (4.7%, 32/675) than among nonconsanguineous probands (0.7%, 34/4749). Founder variants in GDF1 and PLD1 accounted for 74% of the contribution of RGs among 410 Ashkenazi Jewish probands.

Comparison of metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers implicate dysregulated glucose homeostasis as the driver mechanism for these transitions. Correlation between the brain’s regionally heterogeneous patterns of aging and gene expression further supports these findings, selectively implicating GLUT4 (insulin-dependent glucose transporter) and APOE (lipid transport protein). Notably, MCT2 (a neuronal, but not glial, ketone transporter) emerges as a potential counteracting factor by facilitating neurons’ energy uptake independently of insulin. Consistent with these results, an interventional study of 101 participants shows that ketones exhibit robust effects in restabilizing brain networks, maximized from ages 40 to 60, suggesting a midlife “critical window” for early metabolic intervention.",

Although the chemical group added upon lysine lactylation was originally proposed to be the L-enantiomer of lactate (K L-la ), two isomeric modifications, lysine D-lactylation (K D-la ) and N-ε-(carboxyethyl) lysine (K ce ), also exist in cells, with their precursors being metabolites of glycolysis. The dynamic regulation and differences among these three modifications in response to hypoxia remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that intracellular K L-la , but not K D-la or K ce , is up-regulated in response to hypoxia. Depletion of glyoxalase enzymes, GLO1 and GLO2, had minimal impact on K D-la , K ce , or hypoxia-induced K L-la . Conversely, blocking glycolytic flux to L-lactate under hypoxic conditions by knocking out lactate dehydrogenase A/B completely abolished the induction of K L-la but increased K D-la and K ce . We further observed a correlation between the level of K L-la and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) expression under hypoxic conditions and when small molecules were used to stabilize HIF-1α in the normoxia condition. Our result demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between HIF-1α and K L-la in lung cancer tissues and that patient samples with higher grade tend to have higher K L-la levels. Using a proteomics approach, we quantified 66 K L-la sites that were up-regulated by hypoxia and demonstrated that p300/CBP contributes to hypoxia-induced K L-la . Collectively, our study demonstrates that K L-la , rather than K D-la or K ce , is the prevailing lysine lactylation in response to hypoxia. Our results therefore demonstrate a link between K L-la and the hypoxia-induced adaptation of tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "Optimal activation of CD8+ T cells is crucial for immunity-mediated destruction of cancer, requiring a substantial amount of proteins involved in metabolism, proliferation, and effector function. Despite extensive studies emphasizing the role of transcriptional regulation in this process, paired transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that the RNA profile is poorly correlated with protein levels. This discrepancy underscores the importance of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in controlling protein abundance during activation. However, the impact of PTMs on the CD8+ T cell protein dynamic remains underexplored. We identify that neddylation, a recently discovered PTM, is activated in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and enriched in effector CD8+ T cells from colon cancer patients. Mechanistically, we found the rate-limiting enzyme of neddylation, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8 activating enzyme E1 (NAE1), is induced by the NFATc1, a critical transcription factor downstream of TCR signaling. Our observation revealed that genetic ablation of NAE1 significantly disturbed the proteomic landscape related to activation and mitochondrial function. As a result, CD8+ T cells lacking NAE1 exhibited severely compromised activation, proliferation, and survival, which was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial function. Consistently, deletion of NAE1 in CD8+ T cells abolished their antitumor function and promoted tumor progression. By contrast, the overexpression of NAE1 significantly improved the function of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Overall, we uncovered neddylation, a previously underappreciated PTM, as a proteomic checkpoint for CD8+ T cell activation. Enforced expression of NAE1 offers promising therapeutic potential for boosting the antitumor CD8+ T cell responses.",

          "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are the most abundant cell type in the artery’s media layer and regulate vascular tone and lesion remodeling during atherogenesis. Like monocyte-derived macrophages, VSMCs accumulate excess lipids and contribute to the total intimal foam cell population in human coronary plaques and mouse aortic atheroma. While there are extensive studies characterizing the contribution of lipid metabolism in macrophage immunometabolic responses in atherosclerotic plaques, the role of VSMC lipid metabolism in regulating vascular function and lesion remodeling in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the liver X receptor (LXR) signaling pathway in VSMC is continuously activated during atherogenesis. Notably, we found that LXR deficiency in SMCs under hypercholesterolemic conditions influenced lesion remodeling by altering the fate of dedifferentiated SMCs and promoting the accumulation of VSMC-derived transitional cells. This phenotypic switching was accompanied by reduced indices of plaque stability, characterized by a larger necrotic core area and reduced fibrous cap thickness. Moreover, SMC-specific LXR deficiency impaired vascular function and caused visceral myopathy characterized by maladaptive bladder remodeling and gut lipid malabsorption. Mechanistically, we found that the expression of several genes involved in cholesterol efflux and FA synthesis including Abca1 , Srebf1 , Scd1 , Scd2 , Acsl3, and Mid1ip1 was downregulated in mice lacking LXRαβ in SMCs, likely contributing to the phenotypic switching of VSMC in the atherosclerotic lesions.",

But how is the rolling affected if these shapes are irregular or random? Treating the terminal rolling speed as an order parameter, we show that there are qualitative transitions in the speed as a function of the dimension of the state space and inertia. We calculate the scaling exponents and the macroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first- and second-order transitions and describe the regimes of coexistence of stable states and the accompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our theoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres reveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial limits, respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem and the doubly connected nature of S O ( 3 ) , the space of 3D rotations. Going beyond simple curiosity, our study might shed light on a number of natural and artificial systems that involve the rolling of irregular objects, ranging from nanoscale cellular transport to robotics.",

In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this nonmotility activity affects the structure, dynamic, and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in Madin-Darby canine kidney monolayers.",

          "abstract": "Positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)RNA] viruses constitute more than one-third of all virus genera, including numerous pathogens of clinical significance. All (+)RNA viruses reorganize cellular membranes from organelles to establish replication compartments (RCs). These RCs are thought to form a platform for membrane-associated replicases, in addition to protecting the viral RNAs from cytosolic innate immune signaling and RNA-degradation machinery. Previous work demonstrated that three families of (+)RNA viruses, namely Bromoviridae , Picornaviridae , and Flaviviridae , commonly induce the accumulation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) at their RCs. This phenomenon suggests a potential avenue for a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy targeting PC metabolism. Our study elucidates three key observations: i) hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prompts the relocalization of CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, to the RCs; ii) the enhancement of PC synthesis is contingent upon the protease activity of the NS3/4A protein; and iii) utilizing click chemistry, we demonstrate that HCV infection stimulates de novo PC synthesis at the viral replication site through the Kennedy pathway. These findings provide significant insights into the manipulation of lipid metabolism by HCV during RC formation, a mechanism likely conserved across various (+)RNA virus families.",

          "abstract": "Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) confers to the mouse two-cell (2C) embryo a unique transcriptional profile characterized by transient up-regulation of many totipotency-related genes and MERVL retrotransposons. Intriguingly, those genes are duplicated and clustered in the genome during evolution, including Dux cluster, Obox, and Zscan4 family members in mice. However, the contribution and biological significance of the totipotency-related gene duplication events in early embryo development remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on Dux cluster, the master regulator of ZGA that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of 2C-like cells and activation of totipotency-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). By reducing Dux gene copies from 31 to 0 or 1 through CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generate Dux -KO and Dux (n = 1) mESC lines, respectively. We uncover that the totipotency-related gene transcriptional profile is awakened to a much lesser extent in Dux (n = 1) mESCs compared to wild type mESCs following global DNA demethylation reprogramming or induction of DNA damage, mimicking the intrinsic events in preimplantation development. Together, Dux cluster duplication is critically required for full activation of ZGA transcripts.",

          "abstract": "Bifacial cambium, which produces xylem and phloem, and monopodial architecture, characterized by apical dominance and lateral branching from axillary buds, are key developmental features of seed plants, consisting of angiosperms and gymnosperms. These allow seed plants to adapt to diverse environments by optimizing resource allocation and structural integrity. In seed plants, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE ( SMXL ) family members function in phloem development and strigolactone-induced inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Although strigolactone signaling regulates most SMXL family members, the only known regulator of SMXL4 and SMXL5 is the RNA-binding protein JULGI. We demonstrate that in angiosperms, by directly regulating SMXL4/5 expression, JULGI uncouples SMXL4/5 activity from strigolactone signaling. JULGI and ancestral SMXL s from seedless vascular plants or SMXL4/5 from seed plants are coexpressed in the phloem tissues of vascular plants, from lycophytes to angiosperms. Core angiosperm SMXL4/5 mRNAs contain a G-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a target sequence for JULGI to negatively regulate SMXL4/5 expression. Heterologous expression of JULGI s from various angiosperms rescued the Arabidopsis jul1 jul2 mutant. Expressing SMXL4/5 s from seed plants and ancestral SMXL s rescued Arabidopsis smxl4 smxl5 . Angiosperm SMXL4/5s lack an RGKT motif for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog rac -GR24 induced proteasomal degradation of SMXL from ferns and SMXL5a from gymnosperms, but not SMXL4/5 from angiosperms. These findings suggest that in ancestral angiosperms, the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5 gained G-rich elements, creating a regulatory module with JULGI that allows the phloem development pathway to act independently of strigolactone signaling.",

          "abstract": "To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as E ( 3 d n − 1 4 s 1 ) − E ( 3 d n − 2 4 s 2 ) . Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the 4s 2 configuration. Here, we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the regularized and restored Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (r 2 SCAN) meta-GGA for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (∼2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew–Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an “energy penalty” associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.",

Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, so understanding the dynamical principles underlying self-reconfiguration may prove of import to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple example of dynamical reconfiguration: a family of networks whose signal pathways can be switched on the fly, only through use of their inputs, with no changes to their synaptic weights. These are single-layer convolutional recurrent network with local unitary synaptic weights and a smooth sigmoidal activation function. We generate traveling waves using the high spatiotemporal frequencies of the input, and we use the low spatiotemporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, channeling said traveling waves through an input-specified spatial pattern. This mechanism uses inherent properties of marginally stable, dynamically critical systems, which are a direct consequence of their unitary convolution kernels: every network in the family can do this. We show these networks solve the classical connectedness detection problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness, and forbidding it elsewhere.",

          "abstract": "DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non–B-form DNA secondary structures that threaten genome stability by impeding DNA replication. To elucidate how G4s induce replication fork arrest, we characterized fork collisions with preformed G4s in the parental DNA using reconstituted yeast and human replisomes. We demonstrate that a single G4 in the leading strand template is sufficient to stall replisomes by arresting the CMG helicase. Cryo–electron microscopy structures of stalled yeast and human CMG complexes reveal that the folded G4 is lodged inside the central CMG channel, arresting translocation. The G4 stabilizes the CMG at distinct translocation intermediates, suggesting an unprecedented helical inchworm mechanism for DNA translocation. These findings illuminate the eukaryotic replication fork mechanism under normal and perturbed conditions.",

          "abstract": "Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons are the only active autonomous transposable elements in humans. They propagate by reverse transcribing their mRNA into new genomic locations by a process called target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Here, we present four cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human LINE-1 TPRT complex, revealing the conformational dynamics of ORF2p and its extensive remodeling of the target DNA for TPRT initiation. We observe nicking of the DNA second strand during reverse transcription of the first strand. Structure prediction identifies high-confidence binding sites for LINE-1-associated factors, namely PCNA and PABPC1, on ORF2p. Together with our structural data, this suggests a mechanism by which these factors regulate retrotransposition and proposes a model for TPRT that accounts for retrotransposition outcomes observed in cells.",

We generated a super-resolution ribosomal map, revealing subcellular translational hotspots and enrichment of 60 S subunits near polysomes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We found that Lsg1 tethers 60 S to the ER and regulates translation of select proteins. Additionally, we discovered ribosome heterogeneity at mitochondria guiding translation of metabolism-related transcripts.

The microbiota also plays an important role in seeding islet-resident macrophages, and macrophage depletion during development reduces β cells. Candida dubliniensis increases β cells in a macrophage-dependent manner through distinctive cell wall composition and reduces murine diabetes incidence.

To address this, we derived a new phylogenetic model and applied it to multispecies mammalian data. Our analyses reveal (i) strong stabilizing selection on protein abundances over macroevolutionary time, (ii) mutations affecting mRNA abundances minimally impact protein abundances, (iii) mRNA abundances evolve under selection to align with protein abundances, and (iv) mRNA abundances adapt faster than protein abundances owing to greater mutational opportunity. These conclusions are supported by comparisons of model parameters with independent functional genomic data. By decomposing mutational and selective influences on mRNA-protein dynamics, our approach provides a framework for discovering the evolutionary rules that drive divergence in gene expression.",

This knowledge gap is particularly acute in high-biodiversity tropical forests. Here, we examined how tropical forests of the Americas have shifted community trait composition in recent decades as a response to changes in climate. Based on historical trait-climate relationships, we found that, overall, the studied functional traits show shifts of less than 8% of what would be expected given the observed changes in climate. However, the recruit assemblage shows shifts of 21% relative to climate change expectation. The most diverse forests on Earth are changing in functional trait composition but at a rate that is fundamentally insufficient to track climate change.",

In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide.

The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction.

Here we identify several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance.

If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.",

First, although women today report higher levels of life satisfaction and overall happiness than men, they experience worse outcomes in mental health and negative affect. Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined. We explore the evidence supporting these paradoxes, considering potential explanations related to differential expectations, biology, and scale use. Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable. However, there is clear global evidence of a relative decline in women’s well-being, particularly in terms of negative affect.",

          "abstract": "Menopause is a major biological transition that may influence women’s late-life brain health. Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD. Interventions addressing both hormonal factors and synaptic health could enhance resilience to dementia in women.",

As a steroid hormone, progesterone is thought to modify uterine and placental morphology by altering gene expression, but another direct mode of action has long been suspected. Here, we reveal the nongenomic molecular mechanism of progesterone as the activation of human and murine inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which is expressed in myometrium and placental pericytes during late gestation. Kir7.1 is also activated by selective steroids, including those used to prevent premature labor, such as 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone, revealing their unexpected mode of action. Our results reveal that Kir7.1 is the molecular target of both endogenous and synthetic steroids that control uterine excitability and placental function. Kir7.1, therefore, is a promising therapeutic target to support healthy pregnancy during mid and late gestation.",

The hybrid robotic hand with multilayered tactile sensing achieved 98.38% average classification accuracy in a texture discrimination task, surpassing soft robotic and rigid prosthetic fingers.

Compound XT17 presented a multifaceted mode of actions, involving the disruption of cell wall by interacting with lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharides and the suppression of DNA synthesis. A further docking study confirmed the capability of compound XT17 to form a stable complex with the bacterial gyrase enzyme.

In vitro validation revealed a 94.4% success rate, with two candidates demonstrating exceptional antibacterial efficacy, minimal hemotoxicity, stability in human plasma, and low potential to induce resistance, as evidenced by significant bacterial load reduction in murine lung infection experiments. The entire process, from design to validation, concluded in 48 days. AMP-Designer excels in creating AMPs targeting specific strains despite limited data availability, with a top candidate displaying a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2.0 micrograms per milliliter against Propionibacterium acnes .

Here, we investigated the impact of HLA diversity on the control of posttransplant BKPyV replication. High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses.",

Accurate age models are key to unravel the sequence of events related to DT volcanism onset and effects on the global climate system. We establish a direct geochemical link between DT volcanism as recorded in marine osmium isotopic data and global climate change documented in benthic foraminifera carbon and oxygen isotope records. Based on our state-of-the-art astronomically calibrated age model, two major shifts in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os at 66.49 and 66.28 million years ago are contemporaneous with major eruption phases of the DT and disruptions of the global carbon cycle. Geochemical records and modeling suggest larger erupted volumes with high volatile emissions for the early phase of DT volcanism and point to differing emissions of SO 2 and CO 2 during the observed marine osmium shifts with diverse effects on the global climate system.",

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient.

Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.",

On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing. This work highlights the coordination of BAX and BAK apoptotic activity through interaction with VDAC2 that may be targeted therapeutically.",

Here, we show that the pathway leading to cell death depends on the nature of the activating signal. Previous models suggest that in steady state, TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die slowly and spontaneously predominantly by uncontrolled tumor necrosis factor–RIPK1–driven death. However, upon infection of cells that express the NLRP3 inflammasome, (e.g., macrophages), with pathogens that activate this pathway (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes ), TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die rapidly, prematurely, and exclusively by enhanced NLRP3-driven pyroptosis. Even infection with the RIPK1-activating pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , results in enhanced RIPK1–caspase-8 activation and enhanced secondary NLRP3 activation. Mechanistically, TBK1/IKKε control endosomal traffic, and their loss disrupts endosomal homeostasis, thereby signaling cell stress. This results in premature NLRP3 activation even upon sensing “signal 2” alone, without the obligatory “signal 1.” Collectively, TBK1/IKKε emerge as a central brake in limiting death-induced inflammation by both RIPK1 and NLRP3 death-inducing pathways.",

However, the role of isocyanic acid in inflammatory response remains elusive. Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis by LACC1 / Lacc1 knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, Lacc1 −/− mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo.

In a mouse model of chronic hyperammonemia without preexisting liver disease, we observed development of liver fibrogenesis and necroptotic cell death. Hyperammonemia also induced dysregulation of its main metabolic pathway, the urea cycle, as reflected by down-regulation of urea cycle enzyme protein expression and accumulation of its metabolites. Inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its upstream inducer Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protected against liver injury and further hyperammonemia. In clinically relevant rodent models of hyperammonemia (genetic ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and bile duct ligation–induced cirrhosis), TLR4 inhibition reduced circulating ammonia. In conclusion, hyperammonemia induces liver fibrogenesis and RIPK1-mediated cell death, which is associated with urea cycle dysfunction. Inhibition of RIPK1 and TLR4 protects against hyperammonemia-induced liver injury and are potential therapeutic targets for hyperammonemia and chronic liver disease progression.",

Screening of KU01 to KU13 revealed that KU13 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against wild-type and macrolide-resistant MAC compared to AZM. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis indicated that the inserted tercyclic moiety of KU13 formed a robust anchor on the bacterial ribosome, creating a binding pocket with base flipping of U2847, potentially bypassing the standard mechanism of macrolide resistance.

We show that gestational delays were triggered during nursing or optogenetic stimulation of oxytocin neurons simulating nursing patterns. Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos. Last, oxytocin receptor–knockout embryos transferred into wild-type surrogates had low survival rates during diapause.

Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory. Expression of the Xi escapee Plp1 , a myelin component, was increased in the aging hippocampus of female mice and parahippocampus of women. AAV-mediated Plp1 elevation in the dentate gyrus of aging male and female mice improved cognition.

Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity. Mechanically, GPR132 regulates NK cell function through the CSK/ZAP70/NF-κB signaling axis. Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer.

Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement.

However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream.

          "abstract": "While energetic plasmonic hot carriers in nonthermal equilibrium states have pushed the limits of energy conversion efficiency in plasmon-driven photocatalysts and optoelectronics, the acceleration of plasmonic hot-hole flux remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an approach to control the generation and injection nature of plasmonic hot holes released from Au nanomesh/p-type GaN (p-GaN) Schottky architecture by modulating polarity of p-GaN. This polarity modulation enhances the flux of hot holes into the plasmonic platform, thereby accelerating Landau damping stemming from increased effective heat capacity of hot electrons in the metallic nanomaterial. We observed that this strategy drives the intensified hot-hole flux even in non–hot spot areas, hinting at the prospect of leveraging the complete potential of the plasmonic device beyond usual hot spots. The polarity modulation in plasmonic Schottky device gives rise to opportunities for manipulating the nature of plasmonic hot carriers for future energy conversion devices.",

However, their molecular architecture remains elusive due to their polygenic nature and complex brain cell interactions. We integrated clinical data with genetic susceptibility to investigate gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the orbitofrontal cortex of 92 postmortem human brain samples at the single-nucleus (sn) level. Using snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, we analyzed ~800,000 and 400,000 nuclei, respectively. We observed cell-type–specific dysregulation related to clinical diagnosis and genetic risk. Dysregulation in gene expression and chromatin accessibility associated with diagnosis was pronounced in excitatory neurons. Conversely, genetic risk predominantly affected glial and endothelial cells. Notably, INO80E and HCN2 genes exhibited dysregulation in excitatory neurons’ superficial layers 2/3 influenced by schizophrenia polygenic risk. This study unveils the complex genetic and epigenetic landscape of psychiatric disorders, emphasizing the importance of cell-type–specific analyses in understanding their pathogenesis and contrasting genetic predisposition with clinical diagnosis.",

An increased burden of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in ALS-FTLD brains implicates mitochondrial mechanisms; however, it remains unclear how and when these mutations arise. To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived from C9ORF72 -mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to the C9ORF72 repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels. Thus, the functional consequences of the regional accumulation of mtSNVs in C9ORF72 ALS-FTLD brains are likely to manifest through astroglial mitochondrial dysfunction.",

However, the mechanisms governing cardiomyocyte fate decisions remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetically encoded biosensors, and in toto live imaging, we observe intrinsic variations in erbb2 expression and its association with trabecular fate. Specifically, erbb2 promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppress erbb2 expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer. Overall, this genetic and cellular interplay governs compact and trabecular cell fate determination to orchestrate myocardial pattern formation.",

In this study, using biochemical, computational, and cell-based assays, we report that the caspase-11 CARD functions as a bipartite lipid-binding module. Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs. The symmetry in self- and nonself-lipid detection mechanisms enabled us to engineer an LPS-binding domain de novo, using an ancestral CARD-like domain present in the fish Amphilophus citrinellus .

This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), as enhancing cytosolic NAD + regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration.",

Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters.

A-MNs effectively maintained light transmittance of the cornea with a light transmittance of 96.33 to 100%, which was higher than that of S-MNs.

However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wide Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen in Scn2a +/− mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediated Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits in Scn2a +/− mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments in Fmr1 and Cdkl5 knockout mice. Thus, in several genetic models of ASD, PRC abnormalities may disrupt hippocampal function to impair learning and memory.",

To address this, we analyzed live cells using correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy. We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly. This suggests that P. aeruginosa has evolved a danger-sensing mechanism that enables rapid and precise deployment of its antibacterial H1-T6SS in response to breaches in the outer membrane.",

In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume.

          "abstract": "Latent infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for the development of multiple sclerosis (MS), although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate this association, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunodeficient mice reconstituted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or relapsing MS (RRMS). HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes T cell–mediated xenogeneic CNS disease in a humanized mouse model of MS.",

          "abstract": "A reduced dimensionality of multiferroic materials is highly desired for device miniaturization, but the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism at the two-dimensional limit is yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Here, we used a NbSe 2 substrate to break both the C 3 rotational and inversion symmetries in monolayer VCl 3 and, thus, introduced exceptional in-plane ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl 3 , where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and, thus, in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl 3 /graphene sample. Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.",

          "abstract": "Inbred mice used for biomedical research display an underdeveloped immune system compared with adult humans, which is attributed in part to the artificial laboratory environment. Despite representing a central component of adaptive immunity, the impact of the laboratory environment on the B cell compartment has not been investigated in detail. Here, we performed an in-depth examination of B cells following rewilding, the controlled release of inbred laboratory mice into an outdoor enclosure. In rewilded mice, we observed B cells in circulation with increased signs of maturation, alongside heightened germinal center responses within secondary lymphoid organs. Rewilding also expanded B cells in the gut, which was accompanied by elevated systemic levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies reactive to the microbiota. Our findings indicate that exposing laboratory mice to a more natural environment enhances B cell development to better reflect the immune system of free-living mammals.",

          "abstract": "Phase transition in parity-time (PT) symmetry is one of the most intriguing discoveries in non-Hermitian physics, giving rise to plenty of physical phenomena and strategies to develop advanced devices and systems, such as unconventional lasers, nonreciprocal transmission, and enhanced sensitivity. Floquet PT-symmetric systems are characterized by time-periodic Hamiltonians, in which the gain or loss is modulated to steer the PT phase, providing an additional dimension for realizing phase transitions. In this study, we introduce frequency-varying modulation, specifically spatially chirped modulation, into on-chip Floquet PT-symmetric photonic waveguides to explore their unique properties. The waveguides exhibit distinct forward and backward transmissions when the system dynamically evolves around phase transition points, i.e., exceptional points. Furthermore, reconfigurable asymmetric transmission systems are developed by integrating tunable mode switches. Combining non-Hermitian physics with the advanced technologies of photonic integrated circuits holds great potential to create devices and systems with improved functionalities and enhanced performance.",

          "abstract": "A major challenge in synthesizing strong and tough protein fibers based on spider silk motifs is understanding the coupling between protein sequence and the postspin drawing process. We clarify how drawing-induced elongational force affects ordering, chain extension, interchain contacts, and molecular mobility through mesoscale simulations of silk-based fibers. We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory. These findings elucidate how drawing enhances properties of protein-based fibers and shed light on how to incorporate this effect into predictive models.",

          "abstract": "Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.",

          "abstract": "The pathogenic basis for increased thrombotic risk in individuals with inflammatory diseases is poorly understood. Myeloid cell “trained immunity” describes persistent innate immune cell memory arising from prior exposure to an inflammatory stimulus, leading to an enhanced immune response to subsequent unrelated stimuli. We identify enhanced myeloid cell prothrombotic activity as a maladaptive consequence of trained immunity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of macrophages trained previously with β-glucan or heme exhibited significantly enhanced procoagulant activity compared to macrophages stimulated with LPS alone, which was mediated by enhanced acid sphingomyelinase–mediated tissue factor decryption. Furthermore, splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan–trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Moreover, hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid from β-glucan–trained mice had enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent an opportunity for targeted intervention in immunothrombotic disease development.",

          "abstract": "Platinum (Pt) has been documented as the top-tier fuel cell catalyst, yet it faces a notable challenge regarding its poor CO tolerance and sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), particularly when using CO-contaminated blue and gray H 2 . Here, we present an interfacial metal coordination strategy to design a bifunctional platinum-cobalt (PtCo) intermetallic catalyst integrated with a tin-nitrogen-carbon (Sn–N–C) support, which forms Pt–Sn–N bonds that substantially boost both ORR activity and CO tolerance. The PtCo/Sn–N–C-made fuel cell achieves a topmost peak power density of 2.11 watts per square centimeter in 100 parts per million (ppm) of CO-containing H 2 , surpassing all previously reported PEMFCs. In addition, it operates stably at a rated voltage for over 710 hours in 100 ppm of CO/H 2 -air. This work demonstrates the feasibility of fuel cells directly using CO-contaminated gray &amp; blue H 2 , paving the way for PEMFC-driven energy vehicles.",
