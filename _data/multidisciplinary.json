          "abstract": "Observations have demonstrated the ubiquity of short-lived halogens (SLHs)—defined as organic and inorganic chlorine, bromine and iodine compounds with an overall atmospheric lifetime of less than 6 months—in the global atmosphere. They are primarily emitted naturally from the ocean, cryosphere, volcanoes, salt lakes and the biosphere. However, unregulated anthropogenic sources are increasingly contributing to their atmospheric loading. Some of their natural emissions have increased over time due to anthropogenic pollution, for example, the increased oceanic emissions of iodine compounds due to the deposition of ozone on the sea surface. SLHs affect chemical processes, such as ozone and methane chemistry, and therefore influence air quality and climate. Nevertheless, some of their sources and chemistry are not included in air-quality and climate models used in international assessment reports. Here we describe in detail the various impacts of SLHs on air quality and climate, and make a case for the inclusion of more comprehensive SLH chemistry in future atmospheric, air-quality and climate assessments. In doing so, we also identify gaps in our knowledge of SLH emissions, chemistry, and environmental and climate impacts.",

          "abstract": "All genomes have mobile genetic segments called transposable elements (TEs)1. Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects Caenorhabditis elegans and human genes against DNA-transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which seems to operate independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern-recognition system triggered by the base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells: AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A to allow RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a previously undescribed conserved and RNA-structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing, and that an identified function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of DNA-transposon-mediated gene perturbation.",

          "abstract": "Fire-making is a uniquely human innovation that stands apart from other complex behaviours such as tool production, symbolic culture and social communication. Controlled fire use provided adaptive opportunities that had profound effects on human evolution. Benefits included warmth, protection from predators, cooking and creation of illuminated spaces that became focal points for social interaction1,2,3. Fire use developed over a million years, progressing from harvesting natural fire to maintaining and ultimately making fire4. However, determining when and how fire use evolved is challenging because natural and anthropogenic burning are hard to distinguish5,6,7. Although geochemical methods have improved interpretations of heated deposits, unequivocal evidence of deliberate fire-making has remained elusive. Here we present evidence of fire-making on a 400,000-year-old buried landsurface at Barnham (UK), where heated sediments and fire-cracked flint handaxes were found alongside two fragments of iron pyrite—a mineral used in later periods to strike sparks with flint. Geological studies show that pyrite is locally rare, suggesting it was brought deliberately to the site for fire-making. The emergence of this technological capability provided important social and adaptive benefits, including the ability to cook food on demand—particularly meat—thereby enhancing digestibility and energy availability, which may have been crucial for hominin brain evolution3.",

          "abstract": "Iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters are essential metallocofactors that perform a multitude of biological functions1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Their synthesis is tightly regulated and defects in this process lead to severe diseases8,9,10, such as Friedreich’s ataxia, which is caused by defective expression of frataxin (FXN)11. However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. Here we show that efficient Fe–S cluster assembly requires a fine-tuned balance in the ratio of FXN and ferredoxin-2 (FDX2). Fe–S clusters are assembled on the scaffold protein ISCU2; sulfur is provided as a persulfide by NFS1, and the persulfide is cleaved into sulfide by FDX2 (refs. 12,13). FXN stimulates the whole process by accelerating the transfer of persulfide to ISCU2 (refs. 12,14,15). Using an in-vitro-reconstituted human system, we show that any deviation from a close-to-equal amount of FXN and FDX2 downregulates Fe–S cluster synthesis. Structure–function investigation reveals that this is due to competition between FXN and FDX2 and their similar affinities for the same binding site on the NFS1–ISCU2 complex, with higher levels of FXN impairing the persulfide reductase activity of FDX2 and higher levels of FDX2 slowing the FXN-accelerated transfer of persulfide to ISCU2. We also find that FDX2 directly hinders persulfide generation and transfer to ISCU2 by interacting with the persulfide-carrying mobile loop of NFS1. We further show that knocking down the expression of FDX2 increases fly lifespan in a Drosophila model of Friedreich’s ataxia. Together, this work highlights a direct regulation of Fe–S cluster biosynthesis through antagonistic binding of FXN and FDX2, and suggests that decreasing FDX2 in the context of FXN deficiency in Friedreich’s ataxia might constitute a novel therapeutic axis.",

          "abstract": "Tropical forests represent the warmest and wettest of Earth’s biomes, but with continued anthropogenic warming, they will be pushed to climate states with no current analogue1,2. Droughts in the tropics are already becoming more intense as they occur at successively higher temperatures3,4,5. Here we synthesize multiple datasets to assess the effects of hot droughts on a central Amazon forest. First, a more than 30-year record of annually resolved forest demographic data from a selective logging experiment showed higher tree mortality during intense droughts, particularly among fast-growing pioneer species with low wood density. Second, analysis of ecophysiological field measurements from the 2015 and 2023 El Niño droughts identified a soil moisture threshold beyond which transpiration rates rapidly declined. As rainless days beyond this threshold continued, drought conditions intensified, increasing the potential for tree mortality from hydraulic failure and carbon starvation. Third, analyses from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 demonstrated that under high-emission scenarios, a large area of tropical forest will shift to a hotter ‘hypertropical’ climate by 2100. Last, under a hypertropical climate, temperature and moisture conditions during typical dry season months will more frequently exceed identified drought mortality thresholds, elevating the risk of forest dieback. Present-day hot droughts are harbingers of this emerging climate, offering a window for studying tropical forests under expected extreme future conditions6,7,8.",

          "abstract": "The exceptionally low-energy 229 Th nuclear isomeric state is expected to provide several new and powerful applications 1,2 , including the construction of a robust and portable solid-state nuclear clock 3 , perhaps contributing to a redefinition of the second 4 , exploration of nuclear superradiance 5,6 and tests of fundamental physics 7–10 . Further, analogous to the capabilities of traditional Mössbauer spectroscopy, the sensitivity of the nucleus to its environment can be used to realize laser Mössbauer spectroscopy and, with it, new types of strain and temperature sensors 3,11 and a new probe of the solid-state environment 12,13 , all with excellent sensitivity. However, current models for examining the nuclear transition in a solid require the use of a high-bandgap, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) transmissive host, severely limiting the applicability of these techniques. Here we report the first, to the authors’ knowledge, demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) of the 229 Th isomer in a thin ThO 2 sample whose bandgap (approximately 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy of the 229 Th isomeric transition, this technique is compatible with materials whose bandgap is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study and the potential of a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock.",

          "abstract": "Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth1,2. Here, in a landscape analysis of 1,024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUADs with a diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G>A:T driver mutations3 in KRAS and short subclonal diversification. LUAD in people who have never smoked (hereafter, never-smokers) showed early occurrence of copy-number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumours containing EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in female individuals of European-ancestry. Tumours from Asian never-smokers showed a short clonal evolution. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID24 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumours with ID2 showed short latency and high long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, hereafter L1) retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumours exhibited an aggressive phenotype with genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low neoantigen burden, metastasis propensity and poor overall survival. Reactivated L1-retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis probably contributes to the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family5. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans.",

          "abstract": "The extent to which exogenous sources, including cancer treatment, contribute to somatic evolution in normal tissue remains unclear. Here we used high-depth duplex sequencing 1 (more than 30,000× coverage) to analyse 168 cancer-free samples representing 16 organs from 22 patients with metastatic cancer enroled in the PEACE research autopsy study. In every sample, we identified somatic mutations (range 305–2,854 mutations) at low variant allele frequencies (median 0.0000323). We extracted 16 distinct single-base substitution mutational signatures, reflecting processes that have moulded the genomes of normal cells. We identified alcohol-induced mutation acquisition in liver, smoking-induced mutagenesis in lung and cardiac tissue, and multiple treatment-induced processes, which correlated with therapy type and duration. Exogenous sources, including treatment, underpinned, on average, more than 40% of mutations in liver but less than 10% of mutations in brain samples. Finally, we observed tissue-specific selection, with positive selection in tissues such as lung ( PTEN and PIK3CA ), liver ( NF2L2 ) and spleen ( BRAF and NOTCH2 ), and limited selection in others, such as brain and cardiac tissue. More than 25% of driver mutations in normal tissue exposed to systemic anti-cancer therapy, including in TP53 , could be attributed to treatment. Immunotherapy, although not associated with increased mutagenesis, was linked to driver mutations in PPM1D and TP53 , illustrating how non-mutagenic treatment can sculpt somatic evolution. Our study reveals the rich tapestry of mutational processes and driver mutations in normal tissue, and the profound effect of lifetime exposures, including cancer treatment, on somatic evolution.",

However, the field lacks large-scale, comprehensive studies exploring these links in diverse populations 2 . Here, in over 34,000 US and UK participants with metagenomic, diet, anthropometric and host health data, we identified known and yet-to-be-cultured gut microbiome species associated significantly with different diets and risk factors. We developed a ranking of species most favourably and unfavourably associated with human health markers, called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025’. This system showed strong and reproducible associations between the ranking of microbial species and both body mass index and host disease conditions on more than 7,800 additional public samples. In an additional 746 people from two dietary interventional clinical trials, favourably ranked species increased in abundance and prevalence, and unfavourably ranked species reduced over time. In conclusion, these analyses provide strong support for the association of both diet and microbiome with health markers, and the summary system can be used to inform the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies. It should be emphasized, however, that causal inference is not possible without prospective cohort studies and interventional clinical trials.",

Here we establish an intestinal organoid model to study human M cells and reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of M cells through transcriptome profiling. The results indicate that as well as facilitating luminal antigen transport, human M cells also directly present antigens via the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II). Notably, the related enterocytes only express MHC-II in chronic inflammatory states and do not express typical dendritic cell markers. Human M cells physiologically express a gene profile that resembles that of dendritic cells. Similar to dendritic cells, M cell development is induced by RANKL and CSF2 and requires the transcription factors SPIB and RUNX2.

          "abstract": "Frataxin is a key component of an ancient, mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic machinery, serving as an allosteric activator of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 (refs. 1–5 ). Loss of frataxin levels underlies Friedreich’s ataxia 6 , the most common inherited ataxia. Yeast, C aenorhabditis elegans and human cells can tolerate loss of frataxin when grown in ‘permissive’ low oxygen tensions 7 . Here we conducted an unbiased, genome-scale forward genetic screen in C. elegans leveraging permissive and non-permissive oxygen tensions to discover suppressor mutations that bypass the need for frataxin. All mutations act dominantly and are in the ferredoxin FDX2 / fdx-2 or in the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 / nfs-1 genes, resulting in amino-acid substitutions at the FDX2–NFS1 binding interface. Our genetic and biochemical analyses show that the suppressor mutations boost iron–sulfur cluster levels in the absence of frataxin. We also demonstrate that an excess of FDX2 inhibits frataxin-stimulated NFS1 activity in vitro and blocks the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters in mammalian cell culture. These findings are consistent with structural and biochemical evidence that frataxin and FDX2 compete for occupancy at the same site on NFS1 (refs. 8,9 ). We show that lowering levels of wild-type FDX2 through loss of one gene copy can ameliorate the growth of frataxin mutant C. elegans or the ataxia phenotype of a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia under normoxic conditions. These genetic and biochemical studies indicate that restoring the stoichiometric balance of frataxin and FDX2 through partial knockdown of FDX2 may be a potential therapy for Friedreich’s ataxia.",

          "abstract": "Dislocations are the crystalline defects responsible for the mechanical properties of conventional metals and alloys. When they become scarce or constrained, such as in nanocrystals1, grain-boundary-based mechanisms may compensate and lead to permanent deformation2,3. Shear-migration coupling is thought to be the most efficient of these processes4,5, but despite intense research activity, no consensus has emerged to quantify the possible shear produced by a migrating grain boundary6. Here we show experimentally that, in small-grained polycrystals, this shear does not depend on the grain boundary misorientation and that its efficiency remains low. These findings support a new concept of grain boundaries that may not be considered as crystalline defects carrying an intrinsic ‘coupling factor’7 (similarly to the Burgers vector of a dislocation) but rather as specific lattices containing peculiar defects, known as disconnections, that will, in turn, govern the properties, at least mechanical, of grain boundaries. They also confirm that polycrystals can plastically deform without dislocations but less effectively, providing a potential path to explain the poor ductility of nanocrystalline metals at low and room temperature.",

          "abstract": "Targeting innate immunity holds promise in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in improving checkpoint inhibitors. However, the use of agonists of the promising innate receptors TLRs and STING1,2,3,4 is facing challenges. Here we examined the antitumour function of the α-kinase 1 (ALPK1) receptor for bacterial ADP-heptose (ADP-Hep)5,6,7. Treatment of mice with ADP-Hep induced multiple proinflammatory factors including CXCL10 and CCL2, and stimulated Alpk1-dependent antitumour immunity. Mice bearing a gain-of-function ALPK1(T237M) disease variant8 also rejected grafted tumours. Using medicinal chemistry, we identified a more potent analogue, UDSP-Hep. In contrast to ADP-Hep, UDSP-Hep distinguished Alpk1 polymorphism, which correlates with mouse susceptibility to bacteria-associated colitis9,10,11,12. UDSP-Hep exhibited a stronger Alpk1-mediated antitumour effect and synergized with checkpoint inhibitors. The effect required CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and was sensitive to antibodies that block CXCL10 or CCL2 function. ALPK1 agonists activated DCs for cross-presentation, promoting tumour-specific T cell expansion in the tumour-draining lymph nodes. ALPK1 has wider expression than STING in non-immune cells with a distinct inflammatory signature. UDSP-Hep is differentiated from STING agonists in stimulating tumour-cell antigen presentation, macrophage–DC cross-priming and protective memory T cell differentiation, and it does not induce T cell apoptosis. Our study elucidates the antitumour effect of ALPK1 agonism and suggests the potential of ALPK1 agonists in cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial protein import is required for maintaining organellar function1. Perturbations in this process are associated with various physiological and disease conditions2. Several stress responses, including the mitochondrial compromised protein import response (mitoCPR), combat damage caused by mitochondrial protein import defects2. However, how this defect is sensed remains largely unknown. Here we reveal that the conserved mitochondrial Hsp70 co-chaperone, Mge1, acts as a stress messenger in budding yeast. During mitochondrial stress, unimported Mge1 entered the nucleus and triggered the transcription of mitoCPR target genes. This was mediated by the interaction of Mge1 with the transcription factor Pdr3 on DNA regulatory elements. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of Mge1 was both sufficient and essential for mitoCPR induction, demonstrating that in addition to their roles in mitochondrial protein import, targeting sequences can also function as signalling molecules. As protein import defects are a common consequence of various types of mitochondrial damage3,4, these findings suggest a novel function for the targeting sequence of Mge1 as an indicator of mitochondrial health.",

          "abstract": "The majority of breast cancers are driven by oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) activation, and endocrine therapy represents the mainstay treatment for these patients1. However, resistance is common and tumours often progress after years of endocrine suppression2. Periodic fasting enhances the efficacy of standard endocrine therapy and delays acquired drug resistance, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear3. Here we show that fasting induces extensive epigenetic reprogramming in ERα-positive breast cancer xenografts when combined with endocrine therapy, with large-scale activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor signalling and concomitant reduction in the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) family members. GR-driven gene programmes are selectively activated in in vivo models of ERα-positive breast cancer during fasting, and GR knockout hinders the anti-tumour effects of fasting combined with tamoxifen. Exogenous administration of GR ligands recapitulates fasting-enhanced anti-oestrogen action, thus promoting tumour regression. Patients undergoing a cyclic fasting-mimicking diet exhibited increased blood progesterone and cortisol concentrations. Additionally, tumours collected after the fasting-mimicking diet showed an inverse correlation of GR activation with proliferation markers, providing clinical confirmation of our observations in animal models. Our results indicate that GR activation has a pivotal role in the ability of fasting to enhance endocrine therapy activity in breast cancer and suggest that corticosteroid administration should be evaluated as an adjuvant to endocrine therapy in this setting.",

          "abstract": "Gene drive technology presents a transformative approach to combatting malaria by introducing genetic modifications into wild mosquito populations to reduce their vectorial capacity. Although effective modifications have been developed, these efforts have been confined to laboratories in the global north. We previously demonstrated that modifying Anopheles gambiae to express two exogenous antimicrobial peptides inhibits the sporogonic development of laboratory-cultured Plasmodium falciparum , with models predicting substantial contributions to malaria elimination in Africa when integrated with gene drive 1–3 . However, the effectiveness of this modification against genetically diverse, naturally circulating parasite isolates remained unknown. To address this critical gap, we adapted our technology for an African context by establishing infrastructural and research capacity in Tanzania, enabling the engineering of local A. gambiae under containment. Here we report the generation of a transgenic strain equipped with non-autonomous gene drive capabilities that robustly inhibits genetically diverse P. falciparum isolates obtained from naturally infected children. These genetic modifications were efficiently inherited by progeny when supplemented with Cas9 endonuclease provided by another locally engineered strain. Our work brings gene drive technology a critical step closer to application, providing a locally tailored and powerful tool for malaria eradication through the targeted dissemination of beneficial genetic traits in wild mosquito populations.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders display high levels of comorbidity and genetic overlap1,2, challenging current diagnostic boundaries. For disorders for which diagnostic separation has been most debated, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder3, genomic methods have revealed that the majority of genetic signal is shared4. While over a hundred pleiotropic loci have been identified by recent cross-disorder analyses5, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic influences remains poorly defined. Here we addressed this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Using genetic association data from common variants, we identified and characterized five underlying genomic factors that explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders (around 66% on average) and were associated with 238 pleiotropic loci. The two factors defined by (1) Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (SB factor); and (2) major depression, PTSD and anxiety (Internalizing factor) showed high levels of polygenic overlap6 and local genetic correlation and very few disorder-specific loci. The genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (for example, transcriptional regulation), while more specific pathways were shared at the level of the individual factors. The shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the Internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate targets for therapeutic development designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations.",

Various sterilization and contraception methods inhibit reproduction, but predictions differ for how these influence survival, depending on sex5, how sex hormones are affected4 and species life history6. Here, using data from mammalian species housed in zoos and aquariums worldwide, we show that ongoing hormonal contraception and permanent surgical sterilization are associated with increased life expectancy. These effects occur in both males and females, although the sexes are differently protected from specific causes of death. Evidence of improved survival in males is also restricted to castration, with stronger effects occurring after pre-pubertal surgery. Complementary meta-analyses of published data reveal improved survival with sterilization across vertebrates and increased healthspan in gonadectomized rodents. Improved survival occurs in laboratory and wild environments, and with female sterilization approaches that either remove the ovaries or leave them intact. Reported increases in survival in castrated men7,8,9 resemble the effects in other species, whereas survival of women is slightly decreased after permanent surgical sterilization. Thus the hormonal drive to reproduce constrains adult survival across vertebrates, regardless of the environment in which an animal resides.",

          "abstract": "Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are unique in their efferocytosis1 and cross-presenting abilities2, resulting in antigen-specific T cell immunity3 or tolerance4,5,6,7,8. However, the mechanisms that underlie cDC1 tolerogenic function remain largely unknown. Here we show that the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) acts as a critical switch that determines the tolerogenic function of cDC1s and the threshold of antigen-specific T cell responses. In total lymphoid irradiation-induced allograft tolerance9,10, cDC1s upregulate EPOR expression, and conditional knockout of EPOR in cDC1s diminishes antigen-specific induction and expansion of FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, resulting in allograft rejection. Mechanistically, EPOR promotes efferocytosis-induced tolerogenic maturation7,11 of splenic cDC1s towards late-stage CCR7+ cDC1s characterized by increased expression of the integrin β8 gene12 (Itgb8), and conditional knockout of Itgb8 in cDC1s impairs tolerance induced by total lymphoid irradiation plus anti-thymocyte serum. Migratory cDC1s in peripheral lymph nodes preferentially express EPOR, and their FOXP3+ Treg cell-inducing capacity is enhanced by erythropoietin. Reciprocally, loss of EPOR enables immunogenic maturation of peripheral lymph node migratory and splenic CCR7+ cDC1s by upregulating genes involved in MHC class II- and class I-mediated antigen presentation, cross-presentation and costimulation. EPOR deficiency in cDC1s reduces tumour growth by enhancing anti-tumour T cell immunity, particularly increasing the generation of precursor exhausted tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells13 in tumour-draining lymph nodes and supporting their maintenance within tumours, while concurrently reducing intratumoural Treg cells. Targeting EPOR on cDC1s to induce or inhibit T cell immune tolerance could have potential for treating a variety of diseases.",

          "abstract": "Adipose tissue maintains energy homeostasis by storing lipids during nutrient surplus and releasing them through lipolysis in times of energy demand1,2. While lipolysis is essential for short-term metabolic adaptation, prolonged metabolic stress requires adaptive changes that preserve energy reserves2,3. Here we report that β3-adrenergic activation of adipocytes induces a transient and depot-specific infiltration of neutrophils into white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly in lipid-rich visceral WAT. Neutrophil recruitment requires the stimulation of both lipolysis and p38 MAPK in adipocytes, and is mediated by the secretion of leukotriene B4. Recruited neutrophils undergo activation in situ, and locally secrete IL-1β, which suppresses lipolysis and limits excessive energy loss. Neutrophil depletion or blockade of IL-1β production increases lipolysis, leading to reduced WAT mass after repeated β3-adrenergic stimulation. Together, these findings reveal a role of neutrophil-derived IL-1β in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress, highlighting a physiological function of innate immune cells in limiting lipid loss and maintaining energy homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "High-energy hadronic collisions generate environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV (refs. 1,2 ), about 100,000 times hotter than the centre of the Sun. At present, it is therefore unclear how light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units, such as the deuteron, 3 He or 4 He, each bound by only a few MeV, can emerge from these collisions 3,4 . Here, the ALICE Collaboration reports that deuteron–pion momentum correlations in proton–proton (pp) collisions provide model-independent evidence that about 90% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear reactions 5 following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the Δ(1232). These findings, obtained by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider, resolve a gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions. Apart from offering insights on how (anti)nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be used in the modelling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays 6 and dark-matter decays 7,8 .",

          "abstract": "The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for rapid global expansion of protected areas in response to ongoing biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation1. One of its strongest selling points is the benefits protected areas provide to adjacent human communities2,3. However, little attention has been paid to how policy and management can support such benefits. Here, to address this gap, I explored influences on the effect sizes of vegetation spillovers from a candidate 12,513 Australian protected areas, defining spillovers as the difference in vegetation outside a protected area that occurs as a consequence of the existence of the protected area4. In 2020, 71% (2,189) out of the 3,063 protected areas for which full analysis was possible had a positive spillover effect of 0.1 or greater on at least 1 of 10 vegetation cover classes. Many protected area types were significant predictors of spillover magnitude. The covariance explained by protected area type with local and contextual variables was 14%, suggesting that internal management moderates adjacent locations. These findings highlight the potential to include spillover effects explicitly in global policy frameworks and suggest a pathway to an empirical basis for monitoring and accounting schemes that support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision adjacent to protected areas.",

However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits.

By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait3. As a proof of concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene-regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits.

          "authors": "Maddi Langweil",
          "abstract": "PhD students can live on a modest stipend and still save for the future, financial planners say.Credit: Images By Tang Ming Tung/Getty\n\nAt a mellow surf spot near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, Paige Hoel smiled to herself; as an oceanographer, she understood why the waves were breaking just so. Between 2014 and 2024, she had earned her undergraduate degree, a master’s and a doctorate. But her passion for the field did not come without financial strain.\n\n“I spent my 20s pursuing this,” says Hoel, who adds that her father lived on a “shoestring budget” during his own time as a PhD student. “I knew I had to hustle to support myself.”\n\nPhD parents: the pros and cons of having a child during your doctorate\n\nPhD candidates do not just commit to long hours and intense research, but also to the financial uncertainty that comes with low stipends relative to high costs of living, especially in urban locations. As a PhD student at the University of California, Hoel earned US$30,000–36,000 per year, along with the benefits of waived tuition, health care and a gym membership. The financial strain can persist into early-career training and result in a limited capacity to save and invest in the future.\n\n“This is the time to plan and build a foundation for yourself, one that sticks,” says Brian Skinner, a financial planner at Skinner Wealth Strategies in Milford, Connecticut. Specialists such as Skinner say that completing a PhD and feeling financially stable are not mutually exclusive. Here are five personal financial strategies for before, during and after a PhD programme that students and financial advisers say could help individuals to feel more secure.\n\nCreate and stick to a budget\n\nFinancial management begins with identifying your goals, then creating a budget that reflects them. Generally, a well-planned budget is a blueprint for how to control costs and make informed decisions each month as income arrives and expenses flow out.\n\nFirst, identify all regular costs, such as rent, food, debt and savings. The rule of thumb, according to financial advisers, is to allocate up to 50% of your take-home pay to essential expenses, 15–20% to retirement funds and savings accounts, and 5% to an emergency fund. PhD students should focus on covering fixed expenses and building accessible savings, financial planners say.\n\n“You need to break down what your priorities are and then budget to live within your means,” Skinner says.\n\nWhen Rodrigo Dios completed his PhD in zoology in 2020 at the University of São Paulo, he was living in one of the most expensive cities in Brazil. (During his master’s studies, he lived in his family home to save money.) “I received one of the biggest grants in Brazil and things were really tight,” he says.\n\n27 things we wish we’d known when we started our PhDs\n\nDios received a monthly stipend of about 3,600 reais (the equivalent of around US$553 at that time) — for comparison, the average monthly income for 2024 in the state of São Paulo was 2,662 reais. Roughly 50% of his income went towards rent and utilities, including water, electricity and access to the Internet, 30% went towards food and 10% to other essential items, such as transport. Anything that was left, he tried to put into savings. Although Dios could have earned a higher salary after his master’s, he says that taking the lower pay as a PhD student is worth it in the long run because of the skills acquired. “You might feel undervalued, but you are investing in yourself,” Dios says.\n\nDuring his studies, Dios maintained an ‘essentials only’ lifestyle, which felt a little restrictive at the time — he didn’t go out to eat and avoided impulse buys— but it meant he had financial wiggle room. For Dios, every Brazilian real had a purpose, which follows the popular zero-based budgeting strategy. As part of this mindful method, individuals assign all their income to financial goals, such as paying off debt or saving for a house deposit. Every dollar, or real, is ‘spent’ but not wasted.\n\nWhen making a budget, ask the question: will it actually work? Before starting a PhD, financial advisers suggest that individuals try to live off their potential income for a month or two to see whether they can stick to it.\n\nSeveral online budgeting tools can help, including Monarch, EveryDollar, Rocket Money and, often, banking apps. Breaking down a budget using a pen and paper or on a spreadsheet also works. But remember to stay balanced — it is important to go out for dinner or to see a film with friends occasionally.\n\nCreate a savings safety net\n\nRules around saving for retirement vary between countries, but setting up an account early on means that researchers can put a small amount of money aside each month for when they retire. The European Union, for example, offers plans such as the Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP). Those under 30 can contribute up to 15% of their annual income to this voluntary scheme. In the United States, a Roth IRA — a personal after-tax account that grows investments tax free — is open to PhD students with an income. In 2025, those under the age of 50 can make maximum annual contributions of $7,000. However, depositing as little as $100 a month at age 22 until 65 years old would lead to a sum of more than $250,000, assuming a 7% rate of return. “If you’re a PhD student, especially full time, you’re probably at a very low tax bracket,” in countries with progressive tax systems, such as the United States, the Netherlands and Brazil, Skinner says. Saving modestly now means “you will be better off down the road”.\n\nSome types of savings account, such as a money market or high-yield, enable you to earn interest but with the convenience of being able to withdraw funds before retirement age.\n\n“You want to be building your foundation of strong financial habits like maintaining your credit and even automating your savings and retirement accounts to stash some money away,” Skinner says. Whether it’s $1,000 or $10, putting away a little each month can help with large purchases in the future, such as a car.\n\nManage debt\n\nEducation is an investment in the future, so taking out loans to pay for undergraduate, master’s and PhD courses or living expenses, is not necessarily a bad idea — but proceed with caution and borrow only what is needed, Skinner says.\n\nGraduate students should investigate whether they are eligible for subsidized government loans, for which interest might not accrue until after courses have finished. If they are not, they might need an unsubsidized government or private loan, which accrue interest right away. “You need to choose what you are comfortable with,” says Karim El Khaldi, who finished his master’s in global health at the University of Barcelona in Spain in July.\n\nKarim El Khaldi had to work while studying.Credit: Karim El Khaldi\n\nMany PhD programmes offer free tuition, including in Europe, South America and the United States. But not all of them pay a stipend. “I’m from Lebanon and I’ve been actively seeking PhD positions [in places] like Belgium that will pay me because I simply cannot pay for a programme myself,” says Khaldi.\n\nFor students who begin a PhD programme in considerable debt from their undergraduate or master’s studies, Skinner advises them to develop a plan based on expected income, field and type of employer. For example, if a student is not going to be working in the US public sector or in underserved areas in education and health care for which loan forgiveness is an option, then they might opt to pay back the interest-only portion of their loan while they are pursuing a PhD.\n\nOnline tools such as a student-loan planner can help individuals to navigate current or future debt. Students should also plan for extra costs, such as visa application fees, travel and relocation costs that could increase debt.\n\n“I hustled to manage my expenses and avoid coming out of school with debt,” Hoel says. “I graduated with some savings, but I am still living on a tight budget.”\n\nExplore other income streams",

Using perovskites to build ‘tandem’ solar cells, in which different photoactive materials are layered on top of each other, is a particularly promising approach. However, unwanted heat generated by crystal defects in the perovskite bulk and at the interfaces through which electric charge is extracted limits the power-conversion efficiency of these devices. Writing in Nature, Lin et al.1 report tandem perovskite solar cells that use dipolar molecules called surfactants on one of the perovskite surfaces to reduce interfacial energy loss.

          "abstract": "In April last year, more rain fell in Dubai in a single day than would normally be expected to fall in an entire year.Credit: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP via Getty\n\nArtificial-intelligence tools have transformed weather forecasting, thanks to their ability to learn past patterns from observations and predict how future patterns might unfold. But until now, models have sometimes struggled to forecast extreme weather events that they’ve never seen before, but that are happening more frequently as the planet warms.\n\nIt’s like trying to “forecast the future with yesterday’s climate”, as Jacob Landsberg, a data scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, puts it.\n\nOne new approach that’s showing success combines an AI model with a conventional climate model, plus mathematical tools that describe rare events, to forecast weather extremes more effectively. In early tests, this hybrid approach simulated the probabilities of extreme heatwaves as accurately as the older, non-AI method, which takes much longer to run1.\n\n“We think this is the way forward,” says Pedram Hassanzadeh, a climate physicist at the University of Chicago in Illinois who is involved in several of the early studies. Team members posted the results in a series of preprints on arXiv this year, and will discuss the work at upcoming conferences, including the American Geophysical Union meeting this month.\n\nLimited training data\n\nExtreme weather can be particularly dangerous when it goes beyond what people usually experience. Examples include the deep freeze in Texas in 2021 that killed hundreds of people, and the 2010 heatwave in Moscow that killed more than 10,000. But it’s hard to reproduce the statistics of such rare events and accurately predict how they might change in the future, Hassanzadeh says. AI models might be working with only 40 years of training data but need to forecast a weather extreme that happens just once every 1,000 years.\n\nConsider the unprecedented rains that hit Dubai in April 2024, when more than one year’s worth of rain fell in one day. Researchers led by Qiang Sun, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Chicago, and Hassanzadeh analysed the event with two AI models. They were surprised and impressed to find that one of them, the GraphCast model developed by Google DeepMind in London, would have accurately forecast the event eight days before it occurred2.\n\nBut things didn’t work as well when the scientists looked at tropical cyclones. A different AI weather model, FourCastNet, developed by NVIDIA in Santa Clara, California, struggled to forecast the strongest tropical cyclones when it had no extreme storms in its training set3.\n\nThat seemed like bad news, but the researchers did spot a glimmer of hope. The model seemed to be able to learn from storms that occurred in one ocean basin, such as the Atlantic, and apply that learning to other ocean basins, such as the Pacific. It could basically improve its regional forecasts by translating information to different parts of the globe. “The fact that they can do that gives them a lot of power,” Hassanzadeh says.\n\nHybrid approach\n\nIn their latest work, the researchers found a way forwards with yet another AI model, Pangu-Weather, developed by Chinese firm Huawei Cloud, in Shenzhen. The scientists combined it with a physics-based global climate model, plus a mathematical method for analysing the statistics of rare events, to see whether they could predict mid-latitude heatwaves.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "Inside a massive factory in the industrial district of Curitiba, Brazil, millions of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are breeding in a climate-controlled room filled with mesh cages. Every week, the facility produces more than 80 million mosquito eggs.\n\nAt the heart of this effort is Luciano Moreira, a soft-spoken agricultural engineer and entomologist, who opened the factory in July as part of an effort to fight mosquito-borne illnesses in the country.\n\nAt the Curitiba facility, mosquitoes are infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia, which curbs the transmission of harmful human pathogens. Their offspring are being released in Brazilian cities to help to control dengue, a deadly viral disease transmitted mainly by A. aegypti.\n\nUntil recently, Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were released only as part of small-scale research projects. The new factory marks a shift towards nationwide adoption of the method after Brazil’s federal government recognized it as an official public-health measure to combat dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases. People credit Moreira for making the case.\n\n“He has succeeded not only in carrying out the academic work, running experiments to demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, but also in convincing political decision-makers to implement the technology,” says Pedro Lagerblad de Oliveira, a molecular entomologist at Brazil’s Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “This is a skill that not all scientists have.”\n\nMoreira’s interest in mosquitoes started in the late 1990s, when he was a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of molecular entomologist Marcelo Jacobs-Lorena, then at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. There, Moreira contributed to the development of the first mosquito genetically engineered to block malaria transmission.\n\nSeveral years later, he joined the lab of entomologist Scott O’Neill at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, as a visiting scholar. O’Neill’s team had managed to infect A. aegypti with Wolbachia, a relatively harmless bacterium that infects reproductive cells in many arthropod species. Moreira set out to test whether Wolbachia affected the insects’ ability to transmit human pathogens.\n\nIt did. Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were less likely to pick up dengue from blood containing the virus than were uninfected ones (L. A. Moreira et al. Cell 139, 1268–1278; 2009). Scientists don’t yet understand the mechanism, but the bacterium might be competing with the virus for resources or it could be stimulating the production of antiviral proteins. The researchers found that it had the same protective effect against other viruses as well.\n\nO’Neill started field testing the mosquitoes in Australia, and Moreira returned to Brazil for a research position at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) in Belo Horizonte, a scientific institute affiliated with the country’s health ministry. He assembled a small team to start tests in Brazil.\n\n“Mosquitoes were first produced in a kind of artisanal way in a tiny, heated room, using pipettes and manual processes,” Moreira says. But convincing public-health authorities to release millions of mosquitoes into their cities was a tough sell.\n\n“This is never going to work,” Moreira recalls one health official in Niterói saying. But after he explained that the strategy had already curbed dengue in other locations, the official came around. And their decision paid off. Dengue incidence in Niterói has dropped by 89% since the mosquitoes were introduced.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Achal Agrawal had just finished giving a lecture when an enthusiastic undergraduate student approached him with an idea for a research project. Agrawal was delighted, until the student described how he had previously used software to paraphrase published work.\n\nAgrawal explained that doing so was considered plagiarism — a serious violation of research integrity — but the student insisted that it was not, because the work passed the university’s plagiarism checks. “I was shocked,” recalls Agrawal, now a freelance data scientist in Raipur, India.\n\nThe interaction, in late 2022, made Agrawal realize how ingrained such misconduct had become — and it cemented his resolve to do something about the issue. He left his university job a month later and has since dedicated his time to raising awareness about research-integrity breaches in India. This unpaid work has placed him at the centre of the nation’s conversation about academic incentives.\n\nThis year, Agrawal’s efforts, as well as those of others, contributed to a landmark policy change in how higher-education institutions in India are ranked. In August, the Indian government announced that the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), which assesses universities yearly and influences their eligibility for some grant schemes, will penalize institutions if a considerable number of papers published by their researchers has been retracted. The move — a first for such a ranking system — aims to combat unethical practices. Some institutions have already had marks deducted from their current scores, and penalties are expected to be more stringent next year. “I was really happy that day,” Agrawal says.\n\nPrevious rankings rewarded high publication counts no matter the quality. “He is on a mission to demonstrate that the wrong metrics are being targeted,” says Matt Spick, a biomedical scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.\n\nAgrawal earned his PhD in applied mathematics in 2016 at the University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay, France. In 2018, he returned to India, where he worked at various universities. There, he saw how publication targets affected research ethics and education. He recalls his colleagues abandoning their teaching responsibilities to chase publications.\n\nAfter resigning from his university post in 2022, he launched India Research Watch (IRW), an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues, including plagiarism and other types of publication misconduct. He also began posting analyses of retractions by researchers at Indian institutions on social-networking site LinkedIn, and wrote for the media about the alarming rise in research misconduct in the country.\n\nFor months, Agrawal felt like he was shouting into the void. But over time, his commentaries gained attention, and IRW’s LinkedIn account now has more than 77,000 followers. The platform also offers a portal for whistle-blowers to report research-integrity breaches anonymously. Agrawal now receives around ten tips a day.\n\nLast year, Agrawal and his colleagues added a dashboard to visualize countries’ retraction numbers using data from the Retraction Watch Database. India ranked third, after China and the United States. Most of the country’s retractions cited concerns related to research integrity.\n\nMoumita Koley, a research-policy analyst at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, says that the IRW has stirred up discussions on research integrity among the nation’s academics, and especially in early-career researchers. Koley first learnt about Agrawal’s work on LinkedIn and has since co-authored several publications with him. “It’s quite impressive,” she says, praising Agrawal’s data-driven approach.\n\nIn 2024, she and Agrawal showed that private institutions were climbing up India’s NIRF rankings by massively increasing their publication output and citation counts (A. Agrawal and M. Koley Preprint at Zenodo https://doi.org/qbr3; 2024). But these gains in output, they suggest, might be happening without adequate checks by universities of the papers’ quality and integrity.",

          "abstract": "A new study identified 238 genomic regions that are associated with one of five categories of mental-health conditions (artist’s illustration of DNA). Credit: Tumeggy/Science Photo Library\n\nPsychiatrists have long relied on diagnostic manuals that regard most mental-health conditions as distinct from one another — depression, for instance, is listed as a separate disorder from anxiety. But a genetic analysis of more than one million people suggests that a host of psychiatric conditions have common biological roots.\n\nThe results, published today in Nature1, reveal that people with seemingly disparate conditions often share many of the same disease-linked genetic variants. The analysis found that 14 major psychiatric disorders cluster into five categories, each characterized by a common set of genetic risk factors. The neurodevelopmental category, for example, includes both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, which psychiatric handbooks classify as separate conditions.\n\nMany supposedly individual conditions are “ultimately more overlapping than they are distinct, which should offer patients hope”, says study co-author Andrew Grotzinger, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “You can see the despair on someone’s face [when] you give them five different labels as opposed to one label.”\n\nFellow travellers\n\nGrotzinger says his team’s work was motivated by the finding that people diagnosed with one mental-health condition are highly likely to be diagnosed with another one. For example, previous research has shown that most people diagnosed with depression have also been diagnosed with a condition called generalized anxiety disorder, and vice versa2.\n\nFeatures of autism can affect age of diagnosis — and so can genes\n\nTo learn whether there is a biological explanation for these correlations, Grotzinger and his colleagues aggregated genomic data from more than one million people with psychiatric conditions and from millions of healthy controls.\n\nThe researchers found that the 14 mental-health conditions they studied generally fall into five distinct buckets, each with its own genetic profile. There’s a schizophrenia/bipolar disorder category; an ‘internalizing’ category that includes depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder; a neurodevelopmental category; and a compulsive category that includes obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.\n\nA final category includes substance-use disorders such as alcohol-use disorder and nicotine dependence. People whose genetic profile corresponds to a given bucket are at elevated risk of any of the conditions in that bucket. Other genetic and environmental triggers also affect risk.\n\nRisk sharing\n\nThe team then worked backwards from the categories that they had identified and found 238 specific genomic regions that are associated with at least one of these shared categories. For example, the researchers found that one region on chromosome 11 raised genetic risk for eight separate disorders, because the region codes for genes linked to dopamine signalling.\n\nBrain-cell growth keeps mood disorders at bay",

          "title": "How to get science back into policymaking",
          "authors": "Diane Coyle, Michael Kenny",
          "abstract": "The idea that science should shape public policy is under serious attack. The massive funding cuts requested this year by the administration of US President Donald Trump, affecting US universities and leading scientific and research institutions, is one drastic demonstration. But there have been straws in the wind for some time.\n\nHow did assaults on science become the norm — and what can we do?\n\nConspiracy theories spread by people opposed to vaccines and 5G mobile phone networks, and claims that the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are hoaxes, tell us that scientific evidence has lost its standing among parts of the public and some politicians. This trend threatens to derail the contributions science can make to improving people’s lives. Think, for example, of the announcement in August that US funding for mRNA vaccine research would be slashed.\n\nHow to meet this challenge must be a priority for researchers and the institutions of science in 2026. Rebuilding support for evidence-based policymaking among voters and political decision makers will require researchers and universities to change their outlook and ethos. Academics must recognize that the importance of science is not self-evident, and that part of the blame for the erosion of trust in science lies with scientists themselves.\n\nHere, we offer four recommendations for the scientific community and one for policymakers.\n\nMixed results\n\n‘Evidence-based policymaking’ is talked about and championed by many policymakers and scientists. Yet, the process it entails and its limitations remain widely misunderstood. In public policy, solutions to the problems society faces are rarely, if ever, purely technical. People’s values and interests often conflict, and scientific studies do not always provide direct answers to the questions that politicians and officials must grapple with, such as how to reduce crime rates or respond to a disease outbreak.\n\nThe idea of evidence-based policy was taken forward vigorously after the end of the Second World War, especially in the United States, following the wartime success of science and operations research1. An influential 1945 report called ‘Science, The Endless Frontier’, by engineer and science administrator Vannevar Bush, put science at the heart of shaping government priorities2. Since then, most policy professionals have been trained to accept that good public policy is the outcome of the rational analysis of a robust evidence base. But that’s not as straightforward as it sounds.\n\nGovernment decisions around the timing, design and implementation of policies are infused with political considerations. And those political choices can often override the science — a truth laid bare during the pandemic. For example, the UK COVID-19 inquiry summarized last month how scientific advice had little influence on the chaotic decisions being made by the then government. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to post on its website that “the claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim” is another (ironic) example of politics trumping science.\n\nAI tools as science policy advisers? The potential and the pitfalls\n\nIn reality, the ‘truth’ around a policy problem can be uncertain. It will be contested in good faith by experts and in bad faith by lobbyists, in high stakes contexts such as whether and when to introduce a lockdown during a pandemic or mandate a switch to electric vehicles.\n\nAnd it’s not always straightforward to know which kind of evidence matters most. For instance, policies that aim to address climate change by making fossil fuels more costly might disadvantage poorer people and add to inequality. How should the relevant social, economic and climate evidence be given their due weight? Science alone won’t answer this dilemma.\n\nMany policymakers also kid themselves that they are making objective decisions by using quantitative tools to evaluate options. Take cost-benefit analysis, for example. The UK Treasury ‘Green Book’ offers guidance for evaluating whether a government programme is good value for money by using modelling to predict costs and benefits over many years.\n\nThe resulting figure for the ‘net present value’ of a project is used to make policy choices. But it is based on a limited set of data and leaves much out. It doesn’t tell you about the value judgements that went in, such as whether and how to include the costs of environmental damage and impacts on health, or what assumptions were made around different population groups and future generations, for example.\n\nTarget-setting is another way to make policy choices seem more objective than they are. Since the 1990s, some governments, including those of the United Kingdom, United States, Australia and Sweden, have broadly followed ‘new public management’ theory in an attempt to make their operations more efficient. Efforts are focused by setting numerical outcomes for public services, such as the proportion of pupils attaining specified grades, or the length of waiting lists for treatments.\n\nUnfortunately, such targets often turn out to be counterproductive; they can be gamed and don’t necessarily reflect what’s actually important. For example, in 1999, the UK government set an 8-minute target for ambulance response times for the most serious calls; it was met, although through tactics such as changing the definition of calls received or altering the times that calls were recorded3.\n\nUS workers protest against cuts to federal health-research budgets and staffing levels.Credit: Bryan Dozier/NurPhoto/Reuters\n\nNow, the allure of big data and artificial intelligence as potential sources of public-sector efficiency is driving interest in the concept of ‘deliverology’4 — the latest variant of the illusion that better data ensure better policy. The cuts in federal-agency spending introduced by the US Department of Government Efficiency this year are a drastic example of the thinking that technology can optimize decisions. But many other governments, including the United Kingdom’s, are embracing similar ideas around data-driven policy.\n\nOn the face of it, it’s hard to argue with the claim that policy choices should follow the evidence. But the emphasis on defined metrics has clearly not delivered for the public, and this failure has helped to fuel public disenchantment with science. And, still, the underlying flaw of technocratic policymaking remains unaddressed: conflicts of values and interests do not have a numerical or technical answer.\n\nScientific evidence clearly does have a lot to offer well-informed policymaking, and the anti-science backlash needs to be addressed. The lesson from policy failures across countries since the 1990s is that the way in which scientists and suppliers of evidence and expertise engage with policy needs to change.\n\nA deeper look\n\nUntil a decade ago, most elected politicians did generally pay lip service to the idea of policy informed by rigorous evidence. But this idea is increasingly called into question, as exemplified by the Trump administration’s policies against vaccination and against measures to tackle climate change. Like Trump, Argentinian president Javier Milei has also asserted that climate change is a “hoax” and made large cuts in research funding.\n\nOne of the main explanations for this shift, which deserves greater recognition in our view, is the chasm that has opened up between people who have attended university, and thrived economically as a result, and those who have not. Put bluntly, evidence-based policy has not delivered for the latter, despite the massive resources that governments have poured into scientific research over many decades. And that fact affects public views about science.\n\nFor example, in the United States, people with at least a four-year university degree have experienced higher income growth since 1980, with a wage premium over those without a degree climbing from 40% to about 75% by 20005. Better-educated people experience better health outcomes for illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease6.\n\nInequality affects places, too. In rural parts of the United States, poverty is growing and social mobility declining among people who lack degrees7. Graduates have increasingly been moving to fast-growing cities such as San Francisco in California and Boston in Massachusetts, where plenty of professional jobs are located8.\n\nHow to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works\n\nAs a result of this deep polarization, which is apparent in many democracies, the very idea of ‘the public interest’ — a shared understanding of what will benefit the majority — is fragmenting. People’s values or beliefs about issues such energy or migration policy, as reflected in opinion polling, are diverging to such an extent that the very idea of policies designed to serve the public good prompts widespread scepticism.\n\nAcademics such as us, based in an elite higher-education institution, must ask ourselves whether the reasoned, evidence-based approach is more likely to serve the interests of some social groups and demographics over others.\n\nAlthough it is tempting to blame increased political polarization on social-media bubbles or biased mass media, beneath this trend sits the erosion of shared experiences and common values, observed by Robert Putnam in his 2000 book Bowling Alone, for example. So although trust in science remains moderately high — for example, a large multicountry survey in 2022–23 found that 57% of respondents agreed that most scientists are honest9 — trust in the institutions that make policy decisions is in decline, especially among those with less formal education. A 2023 survey across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that just 40% trusted their government to use the best evidence in decision-making10, and general trust in government has been declining since about 2000 (see go.nature.com/4ryvpdw).\n\nThere has been a good deal of soul-searching in the scientific community about such issues. But, rather than hoping that politicians and the public will see the error of their ways and rediscover the merits of evidence-based policymaking, we suggest that scientists and universities need to respond to these dynamics in proactive and creative ways.\n\nScientists and researchers must recognize that the evidence they produce can be only part of what policymakers must take into account, and we should all be more open about this. A better understanding of the societal and political context for policy decision-making would make for greater humility, improved communication and a more effective role for research and evidence.",

          "abstract": "Helis made it out of her hazmat gear, through the showers, back into civvies and almost to her office without talking to anyone, but of course Isla found her at the top of the last flight of stairs.\n\n“How’d it go?” Isla asked.\n\nHelis was, as ever, annoyed to have to look up so far to make eye contact. “Don’t worry, I got your frilly blue weed things, they’re in quarantine.”\n\n“I meant for you.” Isla was doing her best to look concerned rather than nosey, but the veneer was thin. “Your first time since Daoud, and all that.”\n\n“It was fine, and all that.” Helis managed to slide past Isla, who didn’t follow her. Small mercies.\n\nSafe in her office, she burst into tears.\n\n*****\n\nThe mission had started all right — this planet was as beautiful as always, all reds and purples. Daoud’s replacement seemed obedient enough — stepping where instructed, doing nothing stupid. But Helis had been unable to lose the shaking from her hands. The boy had had to collect most of the samples.\n\nHelis put three digestives on a plate and half-arsed her mission report. The boy had been obliging, the samples had been collected, nobody had had a sudden reaction to a mysterious pile of goo and died before Helis could get the epipen into his thigh, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nShe paused for a long time looking at the free-text field for any other comments.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Daoud’s ashes are only a 17th of the way between here and home,” she wrote. “Here I still am, clipping weeds for you lot to study because you’re scared to get your hands dirty, and given what happened to Daoud, I can’t even blame you for your fear.”\n\nIt wasn’t like anyone ever read the reports.\n\nIsla walked in without knocking. She was carrying a scent bottle.\n\n“I meant to say,” she said, “before you rushed off, although I certainly don’t know what the hurry was: I made you something. Oh, you have biscuits!”\n\n*****\n\nFifteen years passed. Helis’s hands shook continuously now. No more field work: instead, she trained the poor buggers who went out. This was worse, not because she missed the action but because there had been only five fatalities since Daoud and, as all the kids she was training knew that she had loved him, they did not take her caution seriously.\n\n“One death every two years,” Dile said. He was simultaneously one of her brightest students and one of the most annoying. “One every two years is odds I can look in the eye.”\n\n“I don’t want you to look them in the eye,” Helis said. “I want you to vanquish them before they see you coming.”\n\nDile tapped his stylus against his knee, drummer’s fidget. “Do you train us in ways you weren’t trained yourself?”\n\n“Some things have changed, yes.”\n\n“Would any of those things have stopped your partner dying?”\n\nHelis couldn’t make herself reply.\n\n“Well then,” Dile said.\n\nHelis’s face must have done something because Dile added, “I’m not being facetious here. I’ll use common sense — we all will. But this hyper-vigilance you’re demanding, I’m not doing it.”\n\n“Oh, do what you like,” Helis said, “and I’ll pray your ashes don’t have to be sent home.”\n\nNot her most professional moment. When she got back to her apartment she took out the bottle Isla had synthesized for her, years ago — the smell of Daoud’s sweat. Helis drenched her pillow in it, and then she screamed into the pillow. First time in years.\n\nIt wasn’t even mourning. She missed Daoud still, yes. But this was a different grief, a pre-grief, for Dile and whoever might need a bottle of the smell of him to get by if he wasn’t careful.\n\n*****\n\nDile died three years later. He hadn’t even been on a mission, which was the thing that made Helis so angry. He’d keeled over in the gym, and when they’d cut him open to find out why, they’d lifted out a tumour as big as two grapefruits. Not carelessness. Nothing Helis could have prevented by being a better teacher.\n\nThere was a station funeral before his ashes were sent home. Helis was planning to go, but she had a cold and didn’t want to infect anyone. She watched the stream from her bed. How much snot for Dile, and how much just from her body?",

          "title": "The Chinese finance whizz whose DeepSeek AI model stunned the world",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "In January this year, an announcement from China rocked the world of artificial intelligence. The firm DeepSeek released its powerful but cheap R1 model out of the blue — instantly demonstrating that the United States was not as far ahead in AI as many experts had thought.\n\nBehind the bombshell announcement is Liang Wenfeng, a 40-year-old former financial analyst who is thought to have made millions of dollars applying AI algorithms to the stock market before using the cash in 2023 to establish DeepSeek, based in Hangzhou. Liang avoids the limelight and has given only a handful of interviews to the Chinese press (he declined a request to speak to Nature).\n\nLiang’s models are as open as he is secretive. R1 is a ‘reasoning’ large language model (LLM) that excels at solving complex tasks — such as in mathematics and coding — by breaking them down into steps. It was the first of its kind to be released as open weight, meaning that the model can be downloaded and built on for free, so has been a boon for researchers who want to adapt algorithms to their own field. DeepSeek’s success seems to have prompted other companies in China and the United States to follow suit by releasing their own open models.\n\nDespite R1 having many capabilities that are on a par with the best US models, including those powering ChatGPT, its training costs were much less than those of rival companies, say AI experts. Training costs for Meta’s Llama 3 405B model, for example, were more than ten times greater. DeepSeek’s bid for transparency extended to publishing the details of how it built and trained R1 when, in September, the model became the first major LLM to undergo the scrutiny of peer review (D. Guo et al. Nature 645, 633–638; 2025). By releasing its recipe, DeepSeek taught other AI researchers how to train a reasoning model.\n\nIn many ways, “DeepSeek has been hugely influential”, says Adina Yakefu, a researcher at the community AI platform Hugging Face, which is based in New York City.\n\nThe heights of AI are a far cry from the village in Guangdong province where Liang was raised as the child of two primary-school teachers. Higher education took him to the prestigious Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, where he graduated with a master’s in engineering in 2010; his thesis involved crafting algorithms to track objects in videos. He soon applied his love of AI to financial markets and, in 2015, co-founded the hedge fund High-Flyer, spinning off DeepSeek in 2023.\n\nAt that time, China faced a hurdle in developing LLMs. US export controls prevented Chinese firms from buying certain powerful computer chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs) made by the US chip manufacturer NVIDIA, which are suitable for training LLMs. But Liang was already well provisioned. He had spent the previous decade purchasing 10,000 NVIDIA GPUs, fuelled by curiosity about what research could be done on them. In a 2023 interview with Chinese media company 36Kr, he likened their purchase to someone buying a piano for their home: “One can afford it, and there’s a group eager to play music on it.”\n\nLike many Western AI entrepreneurs, Liang has set his sights on achieving artificial general intelligence — AI systems as adept as humans in cognitive tasks — and he has shaped his company around this, says Benjamin Liu, a former researcher at DeepSeek. The company prioritizes a person’s potential over their level of experience when hiring (one author on the DeepSeek R1 paper is still in secondary school) and it operates with little hierarchy, with researchers deciding what to work on themselves. Liang is said to be closely involved in research, and “even interns like myself were treated as full-time employees with meaningful responsibilities”, says Liu.",

          "title": "Is your brain tired? Researchers are discovering the roots of mental fatigue",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "Near the end of his first series of chess matches against IBM’s Deep Blue computer in 1996, the Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov lamented what he saw as an unfair disadvantage: “I’m really tired. These games took a lot of energy. But if I play a normal human match, my opponent would also be exhausted.”\n\nWhy thinking hard makes us feel tired\n\nWhereas machine intelligence can keep running as long as it has a power supply, a human brain will become fatigued — and you don’t have to be a chess grandmaster to understand the feeling. Anyone can end up drained after a long day of work, at school or juggling the countless decisions of daily life. This mental exhaustion can sap motivation, dull focus and erode judgement. It can raise the odds of careless mistakes. Especially when combined with sleep loss or circadian disruption, cognitive fatigue can also contribute to deadly medical errors and road traffic accidents.\n\nIt was partly Kasparov’s weary comments that inspired Mathias Pessiglione, a cognitive neuroscientist and research director at the Paris Brain Institute, to study the tired brain. He wanted to know: “Why is this cognitive system prone to fatigue?”\n\nResearchers and clinicians have long struggled to define, measure and treat cognitive fatigue — relying mostly on self-reports of how tired someone says they feel. Now, however, scientists from across disciplines are enlisting innovative experimental approaches and biological markers to probe the metabolic roots and consequences of cognitive fatigue.\n\nThe efforts are getting a boost in attention and funding in large part because of long COVID, which afflicts roughly 6 in every 100 people after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, says Vikram Chib, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “The primary symptom of long COVID is fatigue,” says Chib. “I think that has opened a lot of people’s eyes.”\n\nChib and others hope that a fundamental understanding of cognitive fatigue will help the billions of people who face it from time to time, as well as the tens of millions who carry it as a more extreme and chronic companion. As well as being common in long COVID, debilitating fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple sclerosis, depression and Parkinson’s disease. Extreme mental exhaustion can also follow cancer treatment, head injury, stroke or exposure to certain toxins.\n\n“Fatigue is a really big problem,” says Chib. “We really need to figure this out — how to study it and how to intervene.”\n\nWhat is cognitive fatigue?\n\nAt the start of a chess match, a professional player might rely on well-rehearsed openings. “The first five, six or seven moves can be done without thinking,” says Pessiglione. But when there’s an unfamiliar position on the board, the player no longer has a ready routine. They are “required to think”, he says. The same is true for a driver who turns on to an unfamiliar street. On roads they’ve been down hundreds of times, mental autopilot can kick in. But if they take an unknown route, Pessiglione says, the demands on the brain intensify.\n\nCognitive control is the term that scientists give to this effortful directing and regulating of thought. Over time, as a leading theory goes, maintaining control becomes costly for the brain, and fatigue emerges. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some think it is related to how cells cope when their energy supply is strained; others point to a build-up of toxins from neural activity1. But researchers tend to agree that the sensation of fatigue is protective — a warning that the brain is nearing a physiological boundary and it’s time to rest.\n\nDuring chess matches in 1996 and 1997, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov grew tired, unlike his opponent, IBM’s Deep Blue computer.Credit: Stan Honda/AFP via Getty\n\nMolecular players across several brain regions might be involved, scientists say. Researchers have found potential links between cognitive fatigue and changing levels of metabolites such as glucose and lactate, neurochemical messengers such as glutamate and adenosine, and a protein involved in learning and memory called brain-derived neurotrophic factor2. Even amyloid-β, a protein fragment associated with Alzheimer’s disease, might contribute by disrupting synapses, interfering with the clearance of glutamate or increasing neuroinflammation3. But it is uncertain what is a marker and what is a cause.\n\nCognitive neuroscientist Clay Holroyd at Ghent University in Belgium is among the researchers who favour the toxic-build-up theory of cognitive fatigue. This idea has been gaining traction over the past five years or so, although it’s not yet clear what the waste metabolite is. He likens the sensation of fatigue to pain: both have a role in protecting the body from accumulating damage.\n\nBut even if a person ignores the sensation at first, he says, there’s little risk of real metabolic harm in most cases. “We have an automatic fail-safe,” he says. “You can work really, really, really hard for a time, but eventually you’re going to need to go to sleep.” Although taking a break from a task can offer temporary relief, sleep has a much more restorative role. Sleep, especially slow-wave deep sleep, acts as the brain’s nightly maintenance. It clears out metabolic debris and recalibrates circuits and cells so that they can best use energy reserves.\n\nSeeking better measures\n\nConventionally, cognitive fatigue has been quantified either by asking a person to report their own levels of fatigue or by detecting a change in their performance on working-memory tests or other tasks. These are not great measurements, scientists say. Drops in performance can be obscured by factors such as motivation, boredom and frustration. Performance can also be offset by training, such as when a chess player automates a sequence of moves.\n\nSelf-reports, meanwhile, are subjective and unreliable. “People are terrible judges of their own fatigue,” says Daniel Forger, a researcher in computational medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who is investigating new ways to assess cognitive fatigue.\n\nLong-COVID research just got a big funding boost: will it find new treatments?\n\nTo better understand fatigue, Pessiglione, Chib and other researchers are trying to bridge an understanding of its biochemical workings with how it affects motivation4. The current hypothesis: cognitive fatigue arises from metabolic changes in parts of the brain that are responsible for cognitive control. And those changes, whether resulting from depleted energy stores or amassed waste, alter how brain circuits weigh the costs and benefits of exerting mental effort — nudging decisions towards easier options that are more immediately rewarding1.\n\nIn a 2022 study5, Pessiglione and his team simulated a workday by asking otherwise healthy participants to spend several hours on either easy or hard versions of the same cognitive tasks. In one task, participants viewed letters appearing one after another on a screen and had to decide whether each new letter matched one a certain number of letters earlier. Recalling whether the letter on screen matched the third letter back, for example, would be much more difficult than recalling whether it matched the first letter back.\n\nAfter this simulated workday, participants made choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed ones. Those who had completed the harder tasks were more likely to opt for instant gratification. That preference was also consistent with greater accumulation of glutamate — one of the metabolites suspected to build up with cognitive exertion — in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain region is involved in executive functions, such as working memory and decision-making, and has been found to have lower activity after a hard day of simulated work6.\n\nMatthew Apps, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that the dynamics of dopamine — which interacts closely with adenosine, glutamate and other metabolic players in the brain — might help to explain the connection between neurometabolic strain and the experience of fatigue. Because dopamine enhances the perceived value of rewards, it typically boosts motivation to invest effort. He proposes that sustained effort might cause dopamine levels to drop, leaving people less willing to work for the same pay-off.\n\nTogether, these and similar lines of research are starting to reveal how levels of these molecules and measures of brain activity align with fatigue.\n\nThe bottom line, says Chib, is that there is “something happening with the chemistry of your brain” that changes your calculation on whether you should exert cognitive effort. He says that baseline chemistry will differ between people: “You and I might have different concentrations of neurotransmitters in our brain, and that inherent difference could make me feel very tired, whereas you’re able to persist.”\n\nFirst proposed blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome: what scientists think\n\nThese, or similar differences in chemistry, might help to explain chronic and other extreme fatigue. In people with long COVID or ME/CFS, a small mental task can feel as intimidating as performing brain surgery.\n\nFor Ana Lia Tamariz, an artist and health-and-wellness coach in Miami, Florida, who has ME/CFS, simply listening to music or reading a book often requires immense effort. “Sometimes, I cannot read one more word,” she says. “Imagine coming out of anaesthesia from a surgical procedure groggy. Imagine you never exit that state.”\n\nFor her, the cognitive and physical fatigue can be hard to separate. Any cognitively demanding task can make her physically drained, she says. And anything physically demanding can leave her mentally spent. Tamariz says she is constantly doing the calculation: “Is this worth my energy?”\n\nResearch supports the idea that some shared mechanisms might drive both physical and cognitive fatigue, and that the two interact7. “If you run a marathon, yes, there is physical fatigue in your body,” says Apps. “But by God, you’re going to feel all kinds of cognitive fatigue as well from the strain and the concentration that’s required to maintain your performance.”\n\nThe reverse also seems to be true. In a preprint from last year, Chib’s team found that otherwise healthy participants were less willing to exert physical effort after performing a mentally taxing task8.\n\nOther researchers are studying the roles of stress, sleep, circadian rhythms and inflammation in cognitive fatigue, as well as the consequences. When the brain doesn’t get restorative sleep, small clusters of neurons can go briefly offline. These local sleep-like episodes can cause momentary lapses in attention and other slips in performance.",

          "abstract": "Global estimates indicate that 6 in 100 people who get COVID-19 develop a post-COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty\n\nIn a major boost to research on long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), the German government has announced that it will provide €500 million (US$582 million) in research funding to support a National Decade Against Post-Infectious Diseases from 2026 to 2036.\n\nGermany is one of many countries facing an unprecedented health burden owing to long COVID and other post-infection syndromes since the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost one in five people in a German cohort had long COVID in 20221, and around one in seven people in the United States were affected by long COVID by late 20232. This translates to a considerable burden on health care and the economy — the syndrome is estimated to cost the world economy US$1 trillion every year3.\n\n“From many conversations, I know what a great burden these illnesses represent for those affected and their families,” said Dorothee Bär, the German federal minister for research, in a press release announcing the funding. “There are still no simple solutions or therapies for ME/CFS and post-viral autoimmune diseases, and previous scientific studies demonstrate the complexity of the disease mechanisms.”\n\n“This is really major funding,” says Rafael Mikolajczyk, an epidemiologist at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, agrees, saying it’s “a great step in the right direction”. Long COVID has become politicized and “less of a priority for governments around the world”, he adds.\n\nWhat research is the money expected to support?\n\nThe German government aims to fund research into a wide variety of post-infectious diseases, including long COVID and ME/CFS. It also aims to cover a range of topics, including the pathophysiology and immunology of the conditions, diagnostics and biomarkers, mental health and neurology, and long-term consequences on health.\n\nThe language is deliberately broad, says Al-Aly, who under the Biden administration co-chaired the committee that created the US National Research Action Plan for Long COVID. “You don’t want to shackle your scientists with a very narrow scope,” he says. He applauds the funding for including all post-infectious conditions, which share many commonalities, and for embracing a variety of disciplines.\n\nBecause the German funding is not yet allocated, the next step is for scientists and patients to be brought in, to shape exactly how the money will be spent, says Ulrike Protzer, a virologist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.\n\nLong COVID activists fought Trump team’s research cuts and won ― for now\n\nOne fundamental challenge for managing conditions like long COVID is to identify the mechanisms operating in each individual affected, says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut. Only then can they be recruited into clinical trials of medications that will treat these root causes. That means linking biomarker studies to clinical trials, says Al-Aly — like giving antivirals mainly to people with persistent viral infections.\n\nNisreen Alwan, a public-health specialist at the University of Southampton, UK, also wants to see more research characterizing the public-health burden of post-infection conditions. “How do we quantify the burden of acute infections in terms of chronic disease? What are the pathways to prevention? How can we address the risk factors?” She compares viral infections to outdoor air pollution, the impacts of which on cardiovascular health have now been quantified — spurring efforts to cut pollution levels. “That’s where we should be heading for acute viral infections,” she says.\n\nLong-COVID advocates and researchers in the United States managed to revive some of the research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump.

          "authors": "Tim Spector",
          "abstract": "Food Intelligence: The Science of How Food Both Nourishes and Harms Us Julia Belluz & Kevin Hall Avery (2025)\n\nIn 2019, Kevin Hall, a physicist turned nutrition researcher, published a landmark study1. In it, 20 adults ate one of two diets, which were identical in nutrients and differed only in their level of processing. Participants who ate ultra-processed foods (UPFs) consumed about 500 kilocalories more per day and gained weight, whereas those on a minimally processed diet lost weight. The results offered strong evidence that many industrially produced foods can override satiety signals and drive overeating. And it made Hall one of the most influential figures in nutritional science.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nUnderstandably, expectations were high for his book, Food Intelligence, co-written with Canadian journalist Julia Belluz. It digs deeper into the implications of the 2019 study — that the harms of processed foods can’t be reduced to their fat, sugar or salt content alone, and that the prevalent government strategy of politely asking companies to tweak their recipes by cutting salt or sugar content, say, is unlikely to address rising obesity rates. Unfortunately, the execution only partly lives up to the promise.\n\nIn this wide-ranging primer on food science, Hall and Belluz revisit many food-related misconceptions. They debunk the idea that cutting 500 kilocalories a day reliably leads to the loss of half a kilogram a week and that “broken metabolism” explains obesity — as Hall showed in his studies on contestants who participated in The Biggest Loser, a reality television programme built around extreme weight loss.\n\nAre you what you eat? How food shapes self-image\n\nThe authors challenge the current obsession with protein, noting that most people already consume enough through ordinary diets. They are equally dismissive of the booming supplements industry, arguing that many products lack clinical evidence or have been shown to offer no real benefit. Their scepticism extends to continuous glucose monitoring in people without diabetes, which they warn might provoke needless anxiety without providing clear advantages. The critique culminates in a forceful take down of the personalized-nutrition industry — diet plans based on genetics, which they argue have no solid scientific basis.\n\nLimited legislation\n\nBy tracing the origins of the limited control the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exerts over food additives and supplements, the authors provide valuable context for why the US food environment is particularly problematic. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 ensured that dietary supplements do not require premarket approval. The FDA also allows companies to introduce additive chemicals into food if these are merely ‘generally recognized as safe’.\n\nThis lax regulatory framework, shaped heavily by food-industry lobbying, stands in stark contrast to the stricter regimes in much of Europe and Latin America. Some countries now warn the public about highly processed foods, yet nutrition-guideline committees in the United States and United Kingdom still decline to mention them as potentially harmful, even as the FDA has been asked to consider the issue in its upcoming review. The status quo persists despite multiple observational studies, Hall’s influential 2019 clinical trial and studies that have replicated his findings.\n\nNutrition researcher Kevin Hall dispels widely held misconceptions about food.Credit: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nIn terms of solutions, the book argues that “personal responsibility” plays little part in nutrition — a point that, if pushed too rigidly, can feel disempowering. The authors insist that the real challenge lies in reshaping the “toxic food environment” that drives overconsumption. They call for tighter regulation and greater transparency on additives, reformulation of industrial products, and taxes on ultra-processed foods to shift diets towards whole foods, fruit and vegetables.\n\nIt’s a powerful message, and one that deserves wider attention, even if the book’s practical diet suggestions are underwhelming: eat less meat, eat more fruit and vegetables, and store junk food out of sight.",

          "abstract": "Food prices are increasing almost everywhere. Disruptions and declines in food production owing to climate extremes are part of the reason1,2. But our analysis of global spending on the innovations that underpin food production and the processes that get it to people’s tables shows major shifts in investment in agricultural science. These could help to explain why demand for food is getting out of balance with supply — and why things are likely to get worse.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\nFrom 1980 to 2021, the world’s population increased by almost 80% (by 3.5 billion people). Owing to agricultural science, food and other farm products have become more plentiful over this period for most people on the planet — by no means all.\n\nOur analysis of public and private spending on research and development in agriculture and food (agrifood R&D) for 150 countries from 1980 until 2021 shows an alarming trend, however. Between 2015 and 2021, the annual average rate of growth in total ‘real spending’ on agrifood R&D over 6 years was one-third less than it was during the 35 years between 1980 and 2015. (Real spending refers to spending adjusted for differences in the purchasing power of money among countries and over time; see also Supplementary information.) When comparing these two time periods, growth in absolute spending has slowed for more than half of the world’s countries. In one-third of them, spending has even declined. This has happened even though demand for food and other agricultural products continues to increase, thanks to growing populations and rising incomes3.\n\nThe countries and sectors that are investing most in agrifood R&D are changing, too. In 1980, the public sector, including government agencies and universities, was responsible for two-thirds of the world’s spending on this research area. By 2021, private-sector spending had caught up with that from the public sector. And whereas high-income countries were the top spenders in 1980, by 2021, middle-income countries had overtaken high-income ones. Today, the Asia-Pacific region is responsible for half of the world’s spending on agrifood R&D (see ‘Changing spending habits’).\n\nSource: Analysis by P. G. Pardey et al.\n\nEarly signs of these shifts were evident in 2016 when we conducted a similar analysis of R&D spending from 1980 to 2011 in 130 countries4. Still, we were surprised by the extent and speed of the changes since then — particularly the widespread slowdown in spending.\n\nIt generally takes years or decades until spending on agrifood R&D widely benefits farmers and consumers. So a slowdown in the growth of R&D funding, or an overall decline, will eventually mean higher food prices for decades to come and increased pressures on the natural resources that underpin food production. Likewise, the shifting balance in spending by the public and private sector and by high- and middle-income countries will affect what kind of research gets done, and which producers and consumers around the world benefit from the resulting innovations.\n\nSome of these trends must be reversed — fast — if the world’s farmers are to have any chance of sustainably meeting the expected growth in demand for food, animal feed, textile fibres and agriculturally sourced fuel by 2050 (the relevant timeline given the R&D lags that are at play5).\n\nThree seismic shifts\n\nAlthough the growth has come with important environmental and societal downsides as well as upsides, the real value of agricultural output increased by 137% — from $1.69 trillion to $4.15 trillion (in international dollars)6 between 1980 and 2021.\n\nThe rise in agricultural output over the past 40 years comes mainly from improved production systems, such as those for cotton in China (left) and milk in Austria.Credit: Tao Weiming/VCG via Getty; Simone Padovani/Getty\n\nAround 96% of this increase in production has come from increasing the amounts of crops, meat, milk and other agricultural outputs produced per unit of land. (The other 4% is from expanding how much land is used.) And these productivity gains are mostly the result of increasing the amounts of fertilizers, seeds, machinery and other inputs used per unit of land; improving the quality of such inputs; and increasing the size and specialization of farms. All of those changes have been enabled by public and private investment in agrifood R&D7.\n\nThree shifts in the global investment in agricultural science are changing the picture, however.\n\nSpending slowdown\n\nOur analysis of statistical reports, studies of R&D investments, company annual reports, government-agency databases and other sources show that between 2015 and 2021, the growth in real public and private sector spending on agrifood R&D combined was around 1.9% per year. From 1980 to 2015, it was 2.7% per year.\n\nComparing these two time periods, for the 38 high-income countries in our analysis (as a group), the growth rate in R&D spending has fallen from 2% to around 1% per year (see ‘Slowdown in global spending on agricultural science’). As with the worldwide pattern, rates of growth in spending have slowed in nearly half of these countries, and almost one-quarter of them have reduced their public spending on agrifood R&D.\n\nSource: Analysis by P. G. Pardey et al.\n\nIn the 67 middle-income countries, the rate of growth in spending was 3.8% per year in 1980–2015. In 2015–21, it was just 2.7% per year. Of these countries, 39 (58%) have slowed their rates of growth in spending and 19 (28%) have reduced their spending. Meanwhile, for the 21 low-income countries in our analysis, growth in spending on agrifood R&D dropped from 2.3% per year before 2015 to 1.7% per year afterwards. More than half (57%) of these countries have reduced their real spending since 2015.\n\nRise of middle-income countries\n\nIn 2021, middle-income countries produced about 73% of the world’s agricultural output (up from around 56% in 1980), with China, India and Brazil accounting for 41% of the 2021 total6. Today, these three nations are among the top five agrifood R&D spenders. The United States now lags well behind China on this metric8. For public-sector research, the United States is behind India, too.\n\nAlso, fewer countries are now responsible for a larger share of the total (public and private) spend on agrifood R&D. And the difference in spending between low-income countries and the rest of the world is increasing. In 2021, the top ten countries in R&D spending accounted for 69% of the global total — up from 66% in 1980. Meanwhile, the share of spending for the bottom 50 countries fell from around 1% in 1980 to 0.5% in 2021.\n\nRise of the private sector\n\nThe global slowdown in public agrifood R&D spending growth has coincided with a larger contribution from the private sector, including many small and all the large agrifood corporations. In 2021, private firms accounted for nearly 50% of the global spend on agrifood R&D, up from around 32% in 1980. And this trend is not confined to high-income countries. Private R&D spending now makes up 54% of the total R&D spend in upper-middle-income countries — up from 15% in 1980.\n\nAll of these changes are happening because of multiple political and socio-economic influences.\n\nA revolution is sweeping Europe’s farms: can it save agriculture?\n\nSpending on agrifood R&D has increased in upper-middle-income countries probably because food insecurity is a high policy priority for these economies, with their vast populations and relatively recent experiences of widespread hunger. Conversely, complacency and shifting priorities are probably what’s causing spending in many high-income nations, particularly by the public sector, to stagnate or shrink.\n\nThis complacency seems to be setting in even though, on average, each dollar invested in agrifood R&D yields a total social return of $10 (in present value terms and counting benefits to both producers and consumers), and often much more9,10. But agricultural R&D is slow to take effect and most people and their political representatives are impatient. Certainly, in the United States, agrifood R&D tends to receive less political support compared with farm subsidy or other programmes that have more immediate impacts on farmers and consumers11.\n\nAs economies develop, farms become more reliant on technology and less reliant on labour. Also, people’s diets change as their incomes increase, with processed food or restaurant food often being favoured over meals prepared at home. These changes incentivize private-sector investment in R&D across the entire food-supply chain, but especially for innovations related to transporting, processing or retailing food and new food products. In 2021, R&D related to food processing, storage and logistics made up 58% of all agrifood R&D in high- and upper-middle-income countries. In fact, in the United States today, 90 cents of every dollar spent on food pays for these post-farm activities6.\n\nTrouble ahead\n\nSo what do these trends mean for the future?\n\nIt generally takes decades for the benefits from investments in agrifood R&D to be fully realized5. After the 6–10 years it takes to breed new varieties of wheat or soya beans, for instance, several more years are needed to produce enough seed to sell them commercially. It can then take years or decades for the new varieties to be adopted at scale across farmers’ fields for a host of reasons. These include a lack of economic incentives or transportation infrastructure, and underdeveloped links between farms, suppliers of inputs (seeds and fertilizer) and downstream food transporters, processors and traders.\n\nAlso, because of biological and physical constraints, such as limits to how efficiently plants can convert sunlight, water and other crop inputs into biomass, humanity has generally managed to increase crop and livestock yields only linearly, not exponentially. This means that any absolute increase in crop or animal yields (such as milk or meat production per animal) as a proportion of current yield or current production shrinks over time.\n\nFor example, our analysis shows that in 1961, it took just 12 years to increase global average wheat yields by 50%. Looking back from 2022, increasing global average wheat yields by 50% took 31 years. For rice yields, it took 40 years (compared with 20 in the 1960s). For soya bean yields, it took 34 years (compared with 16 in the 1960s; see go.nature.com/3m7fp2t). And today, owing to climate change and depleted natural resources, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain yields, let alone achieve even a constant absolute annual increase in agricultural productivity.\n\nWorkers check harvested carrots on a sorting line in Laixi, China.Credit: Zhang JinGang/Feature China/Future Publishing via Getty\n\nCountries need to be increasing their rates of annual investment in agrifood R&D just to sustain the current rates of growth in farm productivity. It will take decades for the harmful consequences of current R&D spending slowdowns to be realized, including increased environmental damage, poverty, malnutrition and civil or military strife. And it will take many more years to undo the damage from the recent slowdowns in R&D spending.\n\nA slowdown in agrifood innovation —whether it entails developing better ways of managing water, soil health or pests, developing crop varieties, animal breeds or better systems for storing, processing and transporting food — is already driving up food prices. Further cutbacks in science and technology that result from governments ramping up their spending in other areas, such as defence, or looking to trim their overall budgets following heightened spending during the COVID-19 pandemic, will eventually result in a resurgence of hunger and malnutrition and further undermine the health of the environment.\n\nThe increased contribution by the private sector to total global spending on agricultural science is encouraging. But private companies cannot fill the gap in public spending. Corporations tend to focus on the patentable farming and food-manufacturing technologies that they can sell to farmers and those engaged in supply-chain activities and processes. Such technologies, developed on the back of fundamental discoveries made through publicly funded research, are more directly linked to the commercialization of farm products. Consequently, cutting publicly funded R&D slows overall progress and reduces the effectiveness of private innovation.\n\nThe shifts in where agrifood R&D is being done are concerning, too, because technologies developed in one country are not necessarily deployed in another as effectively or easily. Also, it is unclear whether past patterns of technology transfer between countries will be sustained going forward.\n\nIndigenous knowledge is key to sustainable food systems",

          "abstract": "Young people in Australia can no longer use popular social media platforms.Credit: David Gray/AFP via Getty\n\nThis week, Australia became the first country to ban children under the age of 16 from using most social-media platforms. Many teenagers in the country are furious, but for social scientists, the policy offers a natural experiment to study the effects of social-media restrictions on young people.\n\nTechnology companies have had a year to come up with ways to stop teenagers in the country using their platforms, including Facebook, X, Reddit, YouTube, Threads and Snapchat. From Wednesday, companies must take reasonable steps to prevent young people from creating or keeping accounts, or risk fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$33 million).\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nOther countries, including France, Denmark and Spain, have introduced social-media restrictions for young people, or announced plans to, but no policy is as far-reaching as Australia’s. Its government says that social media is harming young people’s mental health, causing teenagers to lose sleep because of addictive design features and exposing them to harmful content. But some researchers say the evidence that social media causes harm is mixed. Communicating with peers online is a crucial support system for some young people, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas.\n\nNature spoke to researchers who will study the effects of the ban.\n\nNew avenues of research\n\nFor Susan Sawyer, a physician-researcher specializing in adolescent health at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, the start of the social-media ban this week meant entering the next phase of her research. Over the past two months, Sawyer and her colleagues interviewed 177 teenagers aged 13–16 about their social-media use, screen time and mental health before the ban came into effect. She and her colleagues plan to survey the teenagers again in six months, to see whether the ban has affected their use of the platforms or their mental health. The researchers will also survey the participants’ parents about problematic Internet and social-media use by their children.\n\nAnother research collaboration between the Kids Research Institute Australia, the University of Western Australia and Edith Cowan University, all in Perth, will examine whether the ban is presenting new parenting challenges and what family conflicts have arisen as a result.\n\nAmanda Third, a researcher at Western Sydney University in Australia who studies how children use technology, says the ban is an opportunity to collect data about the effect of policies that restrict young people’s access to the Internet and social media. She is going to investigate how teenagers engage with technology and the Internet, and how their face-to-face interactions might change following the ban.\n\nBut, she says, it might be hard to tell whether any changes are a direct result of the ban or other policies designed to make the Internet safer: for example, later this month, new industry standards will come into effect for tech companies to prevent children being exposed to sexually explicit or violent content on the Internet. The social-media ban could undercut some well-thought-out efforts to keep children on social media and positively impact their experiences online, she says. “The ban is about booting them out.”\n\nZareh Ghazarian, a political scientist at Monash University in Melbourne who studies the role of social media in young people’s political development, says online platforms can be an important way for teenagers to engage with politics. Teachers can discuss contemporary issues, political debates and policy issues that come up on social media, he says. Now that the ban is in place, he plans to interview teachers to find out how it is affecting students’ political knowledge, and what alternative platforms they are turning to. “Part of education is to be able to engage with issues and ideas that may not be covered in the classroom — and that was the benefit social media was bringing,” he says.\n\nUnintended consequences",

          "title": "This scientist found a new trick of the immune system by digging through cellular rubbish",
          "authors": "Cassandra Willyard",
          "abstract": "Detectives often find important clues by digging through rubbish. That approach paid off tremendously for systems biologist Yifat Merbl. When she and her team investigated cellular recycling centres known as proteasomes, they uncovered an entirely new part of the immune system.\n\n“Up ’till now, we couldn’t detect it,” Merbl says, “because we didn’t look at the garbage cans of cells.”\n\nFrom her office at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, she holds up a blue plastic model of a proteasome, a barrel-shaped structure with a hollow core. The function seems simple: proteins enter the chamber, where they are shredded and then exit as smaller peptide fragments. But the machinery is surprisingly elaborate. The core comprises more than two dozen protein subunits and can associate with a variety of regulatory caps. If the goal is to slice and dice proteins, Merbl wondered, why the need for such complexity?\n\nMerbl and her team used mass spectrometry to identify the peptides created by proteasomes in a variety of cells. They then compared the sequences of these peptides to those with known functions, using public databases. Many, they found, matched ones known to obliterate bacteria, such as by piercing their membranes. The team identified other fragments — about 1,000 in total — with sequences that, according to an algorithm, make them likely to be antimicrobial.\n\nThere might be more. When Merbl and her colleagues used computer models to chop up all human proteins into all possible peptide fragments, they found that there are more than 270,000 possible antimicrobials. The team had uncovered what seemed to be a new immune defence mechanism.\n\n“This was literally where you have the goosebumps, because you realize that you may have found something fundamental,” Merbl says. Further experiments revealed that when cells are infected with bacteria, the proteasome swaps its regulatory cap for one that favours the production of bacteria-fighting peptides. It’s a first line of defence, Merbl says, one that operates independently of immune-cell activation.\n\nThe results were published in March (K. Goldberg et al. Nature 639, 1032–1041; 2025) and they have many people in the field excited, says Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “There’s something that we thought is so familiar and so well understood, and then boom — something totally unexpected and exciting comes out of it.” What’s most surprising, he says, is that the peptides come from “regular run-of-the-mill cellular proteins” rather than ones specifically involved in immune defence.\n\nThis means that processing by the proteasome vastly increases the number of jobs that a single protein can have, says Cesar de la Fuente, a bioengineer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “It’s a very smart way, evolutionarily, of encoding a lot of functionality in a single gene,” he says.\n\nSuch success was not something that Merbl had ever dreamt she would achieve. Her attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder had made school especially challenging. She loved computer science and biology as a child, but struggled to attend classes and didn’t graduate from high school with her peers. Over the years, however, she has come to accept that the way her brain works is an advantage, not a flaw. It gives her a different perspective.",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You, Benjamin Plackett",
          "abstract": "Among the leading young universities (aged 50 years or younger) in the Nature Index, these four institutions stand out. From subject specialists to technology hubs and regional training grounds, they are charting their own course to success.\n\nPohang University of Science and Technology\nPOSTECH students use an advanced imaging technique called tip-enhanced nano spectroscopy to study materials at the nanoscale.Credit: POSTECH\n\nAt less than 40 years old, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH) is already looking for ways to reinvent itself. In 2024, it launched its POSTECH 2.0 strategy — a ten-year plan to elevate its global status, supported by 1.2 trillion South Korean won (US$888.9 billion) in funding, half of which comes from the university itself, and the other half from local and federal governments, corporate backing and donations.\n\nPart of this initiative is to become South Korea’s first ‘AI-native’ university. The plan, announced in July, is to integrate artificial intelligence into all aspects of its system, from research to education. This includes deploying personalized ‘AI tutors’ to assess learning patterns in real time to help students study more efficiently, and equipping teaching staff with AI tools to monitor students’ progress. The initiative will help to prepare POSTECH for “a new leap forward” to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world, says Sung-Min Park, a biomedical engineer at POSTECH.\n\nNature Index 2025 Young universities\n\nBuilding a future-oriented campus will require close collaboration with industry —something that POSTECH has been set up to do since its inception. Based in Pohang, an industrial hub on South Korea’s east coast, POSTECH was established as a research-oriented university in 1986 by POSCO, one of the world’s largest steel manufacturers.\n\nAlthough POSTECH and POSCO operate as separate entities, they remain deeply connected through training and research programmes. In 2022, for example, POSTECH launched a postgraduate course in battery-materials research in collaboration with POSCO Future M, a subsidiary of POSCO. The master’s and doctoral programmes allow students to conduct field research and participate in projects at the company, and guarantee them a job there after graduating.\n\n“Industry collaboration is not just an activity, but part of POSTECH’s DNA,” says Park. Before joining POSTECH, Park spent more than a decade developing health-care technologies in the United States and South Korea. He now aims to merge that industry experience with POSTECH’s research strengths to develop new medical technologies.\n\nIn the Nature Index 2025 Young Universities rankings, POSTECH placed 15th overall and 8th in physical sciences. It’s also within the top 10 fastest-rising young universities in the biological and health sciences for the period 2023 to 2024.\n\nSince 2018, POSTECH has run an ‘open major’ system, allowing some undergraduates to choose courses in any fields in the first four semesters of their degree before deciding on their final core subject. In a country where high-school education is heavily focused on college entrance exams, the system helps students to discover what truly excites them, Park says. He adds that the broad understanding that students gain across disciplines is a valuable asset for their future study.\n\nFor Joo Yeon Yoo, a cell biologist at POSTECH, one of the university’s biggest strengths is its small size. Although several South Korean universities, such as Seoul National University and Yonsei University, both in Seoul, have tens of thousands of students, POSTECH has just over 4,000. Yoo says this makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues in other departments on interdisciplinary research — “a critical factor in producing impactful outcomes”. — Xiaoying You\n\nCity University of Hong Kong\nCity University of Hong Kong puts on its annual HK Tech 300 Expo to showcase new start-up projects.Credit: City University of Hong Kong\n\nCity University of Hong Kong (CityUHK) has climbed the ranks since it was established in 1994. In the Nature Index 2025 Young Universities rankings, it placed fourth overall, and fourth in the physical sciences. It also placed fifth in chemistry and was the third fastest-rising young university overall.\n\nA major focus of the university is fast-tracking the development and commercialization of new technologies. One of its flagship initiatives is HK Tech 300, a HK$600-million (US$77.22-million) programme that aims to kickstart new businesses based on CityUHK research and technology. Since its launch in 2021, more than 900 start-ups have completed the HK Tech 300 incubation programme, which includes access to resources such as training, workspaces and legal support, as well as eligibility for up to HK$100,000 in seed (early-stage) funding. Of those 900 start-ups, 200 have gone on to secure up to HK$1 million in angel investment (early-stage funding that grants the funder some equity).\n\nOne such start-up is Super Bamboo, which produces a sustainable bamboo material with a higher strength-to-weight ratio than steel and titanium, according to company co-founder and director Andy Ong. Ong is a former research assistant at CityUHK, whose supervisor Lu Yang, a materials scientist, carried out the research that inspired the bamboo material. Super Bamboo went on the market in early 2025, offering products for use in areas such as construction and interior design.\n\nOng says programmes such as HK Tech 300 are crucial for bringing ideas from the lab to the market. “Everywhere around the world, people care more and more about impact and application, not just theoretical research.”\n\nStrong cross-sector collaborations are an important part of CityUHK’s strategy, says the university’s senior vice-president of innovation and enterprise, Michael Yang Mengsu. CityUHK has established partnerships with 19 companies across Hong Kong and mainland China to provide financial support to start-ups via HK Tech 300, he says.\n\nThe university also has close ties with the health-care sector. In September, CityUHK signed an agreement with Huadong Hospital in Shanghai to establish a joint research institute that is focused on developing new medical technologies, such as surgical robotics.\n\nA key part of CityUHK’s draw is the diversity of its people. In 2024 and 2025, it was named the most international university in the world by UK publisher Times Higher Education, which ranks institutions on metrics such as proportion of international students and staff and strength of international collaborations. CityUHK has exchange programmes with roughly 400 institutions around the world, which 65% of its undergraduates take part in.\n\nAccording to Anderson Shum Ho-cheung, vice-president of research at CityUHK, forging relationships with developing nations is part of the university’s goal to ensure that its research responds to real-world needs. In May, the university opened its first central Asian branch, the CityUHK Institute for Research and Innovation at Satbayev University in Kazakhstan. The institute offers joint undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, which award students a degree from both CityUHK and Satbayev University in areas such as computer science, architecture and materials science. — Xiaoying You\n\nIIT Guwahati\n\nFounded on the banks of the Brahmaputra River in northeast India in 1994, the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) is one of the country’s 22 IITs — institutions that are autonomous of, but funded by, India’s Ministry of Education.\n\nThe first IITs were established in the 1960s as India’s leading research and engineering institutions. Through their foundational charter, the government tasked them with furthering India’s national development by serving their local areas as places of scientific excellence. IITG gave itself a broader regional mission: to serve not only its own state of Assam and its neighbouring Indian states, but also parts of Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal, whose borders are less than 500 kilometres away.\n\n“We’re the only IIT in this part of India,” says Gopal Das, IITG’s dean of academic research. “IIT Guwahati plays a key role in supporting the research activities of all the other smaller institutes in this region.”\n\nThis support involves hosting academics and students from nearby areas and making sure the partnership feels mutually beneficial, says Das. The visiting researchers bring samples and data to collaborate on and IITG offers training, such as how to use its scanning electron microscope, nuclear magnetic resonance machine and other specialized equipment.\n\n“We give a free hand to all the PhD students to use the equipment,” says Das, adding that other Indian research institutes tend to be more restrictive with their facilities. “We give all newcomers hands-on training for three to six months, depending on the importance of the instrument. Then we test them and allow them to operate independently.” This creates more autonomous and competent researchers, says Das, and because many students stay on as postdocs, IITG benefits from a higher quality of research output.",

          "abstract": "Image sleuths noticed irregularities in figures from scores of papers co-authored by Ali Khademhosseini.Credit: Natali Mis/Getty\n\nIn December 2024, Elisabeth Bik noticed irregularities in a few papers by a highly-cited bioengineer, Ali Khademhosseini. She started looking at more publications on which he was a co-author, and the issues soon piled up: some figures were stitched together strangely, and images of cells and tissues were duplicated, rotated, mirrored and sometimes reused and labelled differently.\n\nBik, a microbiologist and leading research-integrity specialist based in San Francisco, California, ended up flagging about 80 papers on PubPeer, a platform that allows researchers to review papers after publication. A handful of other volunteer science sleuths found more, bringing the total to 90.\n\nThe articles were published in 33 journals over 20 years and have been cited a combined total of 14,000 times. Although there are hundreds of co-authors on the papers, the sleuthing effort centred on Khademhosseini, who is a corresponding author on about 60% of them.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\nHe and his co-authors sprang into action. Responding to the concerns, some of which were reported in the blog For Better Science, became like a full-time job, says Khademhosseini, who until August was director and chief executive of the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation in Los Angeles, California. “I alerted journals, I alerted collaborators. We tried to do our best to make the literature correct.” In many cases, he and his co-authors provided original source data to journal editors, and the papers were corrected.\n\nKhademhosseini told Nature that investigations into his work have been carried out and have found no evidence of misconduct by him. The Terasaki Institute says that an “internal review has not found that Dr. Khademhosseini engaged in research misconduct”.\n\nThe case raises questions about oversight in large laboratories and about when a paper needs to be retracted and when a correction is sufficient. In some cases, journals have issued corrections for papers containing issues that research-integrity sleuths describe as “clearly data manipulation”, and the corrections were issued without source data. Bik and others argue that this approach sets a bad precedent. “I don’t think that any part of a study that bears these signs of data manipulation should be trusted,” says Reese Richardson, who studies data integrity at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He argues such papers should be retracted.\n\nKhademhosseini defends the corrections and says that the conclusions of the papers still hold. He says he has not seen any “conclusive evidence” of misconduct or “purposeful manipulation” in the papers, and nothing that would require a retraction.\n\nFinding flaws\n\nFor three decades, Khademhosseini has developed biomedical technologies such as organs on chips and hydrogel wound treatments. His work has been funded by the US National Institutes of Health, and by other public and private agencies. As a PhD student, he worked under Robert Langer, a renowned bioengineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge. Khademhosseini has published more than 1,000 papers, which have been cited more than 100,000 times in total. He has also received numerous awards and honours, most recently, the 2024 Biomaterials Global Impact Award, from the journal Biomaterials.\n\nThis science sleuth revealed a retraction crisis at Indian universities\nIn August, Khademhosseini left the Terasaki Institute. He says that he did so to work on a start-up “to accelerate scientific discovery using AI”, and that his departure was not related to the PubPeer comments. The institute also says that his departure “was unrelated to any research integrity inquiries”.\n\nTo get a sense of the severity of the image-related issues, Nature’s news team analysed the 90 papers flagged on PubPeer in consultation with four image-integrity specialists, including Bik and Richardson, and three bioengineers. The team relied on guidance from the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM). This ranks image irregularities on the basis of the type of aberration, perceived intent and impact on research conclusions. Six papers had issues unrelated to images, such as authorship disputes or complaints about reported conflicts of interest. Of the remaining 84, 41 were classed as ‘level I’: containing minor issues, such as an accidentally duplicated image that could easily be corrected with raw data. Another 20 papers had more substantial problems, falling into level II. And 23 papers considered level III had more serious issues, including multiple manipulations that directly affect the interpretation of the data. STM guidelines recommend that level-II and level-III issues are investigated to rule out misconduct.\n\nKhademhosseini disputes the Nature news team’s analysis, saying it contains “substantial inaccuracies”. He says, for example, that many of the figures classified as having severe problems were in fact peripheral to the conclusions of the papers, and that some errors that the analysis deemed intentional could in fact have been accidents.\n\nThousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction\nKhademhosseini adds that the high number of flagged papers results from the fact that he’s published so many papers during his career, each of which has about 80 images. He objects to being singled out, and estimates that the rate of errors in his flagged papers is below theaverage error rate in biomedical literature, which is sometimes given as 4%. “If you go after anybody who has been around a long time, you can dig up stuff,” he says. What’s more, he argues that the artificial-intelligence-powered tools that sleuths sometimes use to help them detect image irregularities raise the average error rate in the published literature, making his numbers look even more reasonable.\n\nBik estimates that she looked at about 530 papers to find the errors she did. She says that she used AI to analyse some of Khademhosseini’s papers, but that she also verifies each irregularity by eye.\n\nCorrection conundrum",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "On a video call in early September, Sarah Tabrizi first saw the data that she and other researchers studying Huntington’s disease had been chasing for decades: compelling evidence that a gene-targeting therapy could slow the relentless progression of the neurodegenerative brain disorder.\n\nBefore these results, “I was beginning to get a little bit worried that maybe, by the time people develop symptoms, that it was going to be too late to treat”, says Tabrizi, a neurologist who directs the Huntington’s Disease Centre at University College London. But here was powerful validation that the window for treating the rare, hereditary condition remains open — offering a chance for meaningful, disease-modifying interventions.\n\n“It’s a giant step forward,” says Tabrizi, who was the trial’s lead scientific adviser. “The dial has been shifted.”\n\nThe first-in-class gene therapy — called AMT-130 and developed by uniQure, a biotechnology company in Amsterdam — uses a harmless virus to deliver strands of genetic material into affected brain regions. Once there, the therapy switches off production of the faulty mutant huntingtin protein that slowly destroys brain cells.\n\nThe clinical data set was small, involving just 12 people who received a high dose of the therapy. And the treatment is invasive, requiring lengthy brain surgery. But the results were striking. On a standard rating scale used to assesses motor and cognitive functions and other measures of daily living, the scores of participants receiving the high dose dropped by just 0.38 points over three years. That’s compared with a reduction of 1.52 points for people in a control group, meaning that the treatment slowed the rate of decline by 75%. That clinical benefit was reinforced by molecular validation: spinal-fluid levels of a protein linked to dying brain cells had gone down in the treatment recipients, the opposite of what typically occurs as the disease progresses.\n\nAfter digesting the findings, Tabrizi and her close collaborator Ed Wild, a fellow neurologist at University College London, shared what Wild describes as a “massive hug”. But, after that, it was right back to the daily demands of patient care and research. “We’ll celebrate very unreservedly — but briefly,” Wild says. “We’re like an episode of The West Wing: it’s always, ‘What’s next?’”\n\nNext for Tabrizi and Wild are leading roles in evaluating five other huntingtin-lowering therapies in clinical development, along with several others poised to enter human trials soon. Tabrizi is also spearheading laboratory studies into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration — work that could yield many other drug candidates in the future.\n\n“Sarah is amazing,” says Hugh Rickards, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “She’s the spider in the middle of the web. You name a disease-modifying therapy in HD — she’s got her hand on it somewhere.”\n\nPlus, “she’s one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet”, says Samuel Frank, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who, like Rickards, has worked with Tabrizi on Huntington’s trials.\n\nPlaying a part in nearly every important clinical advance means that she also carries the scars of the field’s most agonizing disappointments. Only four years ago, another promising huntingtin-targeted therapy, tominersen, faltered in late-stage trials. Overall, the drug failed to improve people’s outcomes compared with those of the control group and it came with dangerous side effects at higher doses. As principal investigator of the nearly 800-person study, the unenviable task of explaining the results to participating families fell to Tabrizi. “It was heartbreaking,” she says.\n\nShe recalls her message to the distraught community: “Trials are scientific experiments,” she says. “Through failure, as painful as it is, is often how you learn.”",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "Earlier this year, Tony Tyson got a sneak preview of the first images taken by the brand-new Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile — a project he first dreamt up more than 30 years ago. After he and his team had spent months troubleshooting the telescope’s hardware and control software, thousands of galaxies came into perfect focus. “It’s one thing to know that everything is working, but it’s another thing to see it with your own eyes,” says Tyson. “When I saw that, I said ‘wow’.”\n\nFrom its perch on Cerro Pachón in the Andes, the Rubin observatory will soon use the largest digital camera in the world to begin making a continuous video of the southern sky. Despite weighing some 350 tonnes, the telescope has a compact design that allows it to move nimbly, capturing a different exposure every 40 seconds. It will map the Universe’s invisible dark matter in 3D, detect millions of pulsating or exploding stars and spot asteroids that could threaten Earth.\n\nIts unprecedented design and the US$810-million cost made the Rubin a huge bet. “It was high-risk, high-reward. We took the risk,” says Tyson, a physicist at the University of California, Davis.\n\nTyson not only conceived the project, but also pushed it forwards, despite early scepticism. “We wouldn’t have the Rubin Observatory today if he hadn’t had that vision, and also that dogged determination,” says Catherine Heymans, an astrophysicist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and the Astronomer Royal for Scotland.\n\nTyson’s interest in science, and building electronic devices, started early. When he was five, a bout of pulmonary disease and rheumatic fever forced him to spend many hours in a steam tent, where he listened to shortwave radio. This experience, he says, kick-started his lifelong interest in getting information out of noisy signals. He also had an early interest in the science of gravity.\n\nSoon after earning a PhD in physics, he joined AT&T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, in 1969. He worked on an early gravitational-wave detector, and then took an interest in charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors — which had just been invented “down the hall”. He realized that the devices’ ability to sense even tiny amounts of light could transform astronomy. He set out to use these sensors to reveal even the faintest, most distant galaxies.\n\nTyson’s ultimate goal was to image large swathes of the sky, measuring how galaxies’ shapes distorted as their light travelled across a Universe filled with immense lumps of dark matter. He started applying for telescope time to search for the effect in 1973. “I got turned down time after time,” he says.\n\n“A lot of people didn’t think it was possible”, particularly from the ground, says Heymans. But in 2000, Tyson was one of the first researchers to use the technique, called ‘weak gravitational lensing’, to reveal the presence of dark matter (D. M. Wittman et al. Nature 405, 143–148; 2000).\n\nMeanwhile, Tyson continued to use CCDs to build larger and larger digital cameras for telescopes. One that he built in the early 1990s with physicist Gary Bernstein, his postdoc at the time, was installed at a US telescope in Chile and was a key tool in the 1998 discovery of dark energy. While working on that telescope, Tyson got the idea for the Rubin telescope, which he led from the first proposal in 2000 until the main mirror was on its way to completion. He still holds the role of chief scientist, managing the tune-up of the complex apparatus.",

          "abstract": "In 2025, it often felt as if the world was tearing itself apart. Then, on 16 April at around 2 a.m. local time in Geneva, Switzerland, came a glimpse of unity. The 190-odd nations belonging to the World Health Organization (WHO) had reached a consensus on the draft text of the first global pandemic treaty. The fruit of more than three years of gruelling negotiations, the document lays out guiding principles for how the world should pull together to prevent, prepare for and respond to the next pandemic. “I’m overwhelmed, overjoyed,” said Precious Matsoso, who co-chaired the WHO group that steered the negotiation, that morning.\n\nA large source of friction during talks was how to make a plan that would be more equitable than the response to the COVID-19 pandemic had been. The open sharing of samples and data on the spread and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus enabled the development of life-saving treatments and vaccines. But those benefits were not shared equally between nations. Low-income countries were forced to wait for life-saving drugs, and high-income nations were accused of hoarding them.\n\nMatsoso, an experienced figure in global health, was well placed to navigate the sometimes fractious negotiations. At several points in her career, she had helped to expand access to HIV medications, including as director-general of South Africa’s health department from 2010 to 2019. Based in Pretoria, she is currently at the Wits Health Consortium of the University of the Witwatersrand and has held various leadership roles at the WHO over the past two decades.\n\nSteering the pandemic-treaty negotiation was punishing, says Roland Driece, a director at the Dutch health ministry in The Hague, who co-chaired the first 2.5 years of talks with Matsoso. “Everybody is unhappy with you because you never do what they want you to do,” he says. “You always try to find a middle ground.”\n\nMatsoso used a variety of tactics to encourage compromise. At times, she had to be firm in the face of acrimonious debate. “I don’t want to hear anybody’s red line here,” she recalls saying. “I think you need to tell me: how are we going to solve this problem?”\n\nBut she also brought a warmth and originality to the process that Driece admires. On at least one occasion she sang to delegates: ‘All you need is love’ by the Beatles carried the message of cooperation. “I had to use every trick in the book to get them to get the work done,” she says.\n\nLawrence Gostin, a legal scholar at Georgetown University in Washington DC who advised the WHO on the treaty, says that her efforts were instrumental. “If it were not for her, we might not have a pandemic agreement.”\n\nThe text was formally adopted by national governments in May, but several challenges remain before it can come into force. Details in the contentious section about pathogen access and benefit sharing are still being hashed out by a dedicated working group and are due to be finished in May 2026. Then, for it to be fully binding, 60 countries must ratify the treaty, which could take months or even years.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Looking out of the Fendouzhe submersible, more than nine kilometres below the ocean surface, Mengran Du knew she was seeing something totally new to science. The vessel’s lights illuminated a thriving ecosystem in which ghostly bristleworms swim among fields of blood-red tubeworms.\n\nDu and her colleagues were exploring the hadal zone — the lowermost layer of the ocean, found beyond depths of six kilometres. Here, at the bottom of the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench northeast of Japan, Du and her team discovered the deepest-known ecosystem with animals on the planet during dives in 2024, which they described this year (X. Peng et al. Nature 645, 679–685; 2025). “As a diving scientist, I always have the curiosity to know the unknowns about hadal trenches,” says Du, a geoscientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering in Sanya, China. “The best way to know the unknown is to go there and feel it with your heart and experience, and look at the bottom with your bare eyes.”\n\nThe ecosystem discovered by the Fendouzhe crew relies on an unusual source of energy. Unlike most life at the surface, which depends on sunlight, this hadal-zone ecosystem derives energy from methane, hydrogen sulfide and other compounds dissolved in fluids that seep up from the ocean floor. Chemosynthetic microbes use these energy-rich molecules to convert inorganic carbon into carbohydrates that then support the rest of the ecosystem. Du was the first to observe several species of gastropods, tubeworms, clams and other creatures in these ‘cold seeps’, several of which are likely to be new to science, she says.\n\n“Mengran has made a great contribution to these expeditions,” says Xiaotong Peng, deputy director of the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, who was also in the submersible. He says Du’s experience in coastal research allowed her to identify species found in chemosynthetic communities while they were still on the sea floor, an important skill for determining the significance of findings. “She has a great passion for deep-sea science, and that is one of the reasons why we can find such amazing phenomena at the sea floor,” he adds.\n\nThe discovery prompted the team to change its plans during the 2024 expedition, says Peng. The researchers took the Fendouzhe submersible to search for chemosynthetic ecosystems at more sites, including in the nearby Aleutian Trench.\n\nDu, who was the chief scientific officer for the expedition, and her colleagues completed 24 dives in the submersible, which last an average of around 6 hours. Built out of titanium to withstand crushing pressures of 98 megapascals — about 1,000 times the air pressure at sea level — the submersible has an area for the crew that is just 1.8 metres and holds three people.\n\nThis year, Du, Peng and their colleagues conducted expeditions to another trench in the southern Pacific Ocean, where they found ecosystems that are similar to those they found in the northern part of the ocean last year. This offers strong evidence that there is a global corridor of chemosynthetic ecosystems across Earth’s oceans, say the researchers.",

          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "An illustration of antibodies (pink) binding to a flu virus (brown).Credit: Juan Gaertner/Science Photo Library\n\nBiologists achieved a landmark in protein design last year: using artificial intelligence (AI) to draw up entirely new antibody molecules1. Yet the proof-of-principle designs lacked the potency and other key features of commercial antibody drugs that rack up tens of billions in annual sales.\n\nAfter a year of progress, scientists say they are on the cusp of turning AI-designed antibodies into potential therapies. In recent weeks, numerous teams have reported successfully using proprietary commercial AI tools and open-source models to make antibodies that have properties of antibody drugs.\n\n‘A landmark moment’: scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch\n\n“These latest efforts are remarkably powerful advances that enable a democratization of antibody engineering,” says Chang Liu, a synthetic biologist at University of California, Irvine.\n\nThe latest wave of success with de novo antibody design “will have a big impact on how quickly and how many de novo therapeutics we will see in clinical trials”, adds Timothy Jenkins, a protein engineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.\n\nPrecision nanobodies\n\nTherapeutic antibodies are usually made by screening vast numbers of diverse antibodies to find ones that can recognize a certain target. But sometimes, these screens turn up only antibodies that bind weakly to the target or recognize the wrong region on it.\n\n“There isn’t much precision,” says Surge Biswas, chief executive of antibody-design company Nabla Bio in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Instead, scientists hope to specify an antibody’s desired target — the active site of an enzyme implicated in disease, for instance — and have an AI model suggest designs. “The promise of AI-guided design is that you can be atomically precise,” Biswas adds.\n\nAlphaFold is five years old — these charts show how it revolutionized science\n\nAntibodies — immune proteins that recognize foreign molecules, such as those made by pathogens, with exquisite specificity — have been a challenge for AI to design. AI models such as AlphaFold have struggled to predict the shape of flexible loop regions of antibodies, which they use to recognize their targets.\n\nBut new tools developed in the past year — including an updated version of AlphaFold — have proved better at modelling these flexible regions, says Gabriele Corso, a machine-learning scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Progress in antibody design has followed.\n\nIn October, Corso and his colleagues described the BoltzGen model in a preprint2, showing that it can adroitly design ‘nanobodies’ — small, simple antibodies resembling molecules made by sharks and camels — against proteins implicated in cancer, viral and bacterial infections and other diseases. In most cases, the researchers identified antibodies with strong target binding after expressing just 15 of the most-promising designs in cells and testing them in laboratory experiments. However, the molecules were not tested in disease models.\n\nOther teams are making similar progress. For instance, a team at Stanford University in California and the Arc Institute in Palo Alto, California, has also released a model that can design nanobodies with high efficiencies3. And last month, the researchers behind the 2024 breakthrough — led by Nobel-prizewinning biophysicist David Baker at the University of Washington in Seattle — reported in Nature4 marked improvements in their nanobody design efforts, using another open-source tool.\n\nFull-length antibodies\n\nThe boldest claims in AI antibody design come from companies working on the challenge. Last month, scientists at Nabla and Chai Discovery in San Francisco, California, said they had made ‘drug-like’ antibodies using AI tools.\n\nBoth teams said that, in addition to nanobodies, which are composed of a single chain of amino acids, they had generated full-length antibodies. Baker’s team reported such designs in their report as well4. Lab experiments showed that some of the designer molecules recognized diverse disease targets — including molecules called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which have challenged conventional antibody design efforts — at potencies similar to those of commercial antibody drugs. They also boasted useful properties that can make or break drug candidates, such as the capacity to be produced at high levels and to recognize only their intended targets5.",

The map, called GlobalBuildingAtlas, combines satellite imagery and machine learning to generate 3D models for 97% of buildings on Earth.\n\nThe data set, published in the open-access journal Earth System Science Data on 1 December1, covers 2.75 billion buildings, each mapped with footprints and heights at a spatial resolution of 3 metres by 3 metres.\n\nThe 3D map opens new possibilities for disaster risk assessment, climate modelling and urban planning, according to study co-author Xiaoxiang Zhu, an Earth observation data scientist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. It could also help to improve how researchers monitor United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals for cities and communities, Zhu adds.\n\nBillions of buildings\n\nConventionally, creating detailed 3D maps at a global scale has been difficult, say Zhu, because it usually requires either laser scanning or high‑resolution stereo imagery. The team’s solution was to combine deep learning with laser-scanning techniques to predict building heights. The tool was trained on reference data obtained using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) from 168 cities, mostly in Europe, North America and Oceania.\n\nThe researchers created the 3D maps from approximately 800,000 satellite scenes captured in 2019, using the deep-learning tool to predict building heights, volumes and areas.\n\nThe study found that Asia accounts for nearly half of all mapped buildings in the world — approximately 1.22 billion structures. Asia also dominates the total building volume at 1.27 trillion cubic metres, reflecting rapid urbanization and dense metropolitan clusters in China, India and southeast Asia.\n\nAfrica has the second largest number of buildings, at 540 million, but their combined volume is only 117 billion cubic metres, underscoring the prevalence of small, low-rise structures.\n\nCity-scale analyses illustrate how building volume correlates with population density and economic development. In Europe, Finland has six times more building volume per capita than does Greece. The study also highlighted that Niger’s per-capita building volume is 27 times below the world average.\n\nThese patterns suggest that conventional 2D measures of urban growth, such as built-up areas, might obscure crucial differences between infrastructure and living conditions.\n\nAn aerial model of structures in the Chinese city of Changsha.Credit: Zhu et al./ESSD, (Basemap ©CARTO and ©OpenStreetMap contributors)\nDisaster risk assessment\n\nDorina Pojani, an urban planning researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, says that the data set would be extremely valuable for her research, because she has previously relied on static, 2D data.",

          "abstract": "Why Brains Need Friends\n\nBen Rein\n\nBridge Street (2024)\n\nHave you ever chosen between answering a friend’s phone call and finishing some work? This relatable scenario opens Why Brains Need Friends by neuroscientist Ben Rein. Social connection feels good and there is clear evidence that it lowers risks of dementia, cognitive decline, heart failure, diabetes, depression and stroke. Yet, few people prioritize it in the way they do exercise, sleep and nutrition.\n\nRein notes that various factors, including political polarization, remote work and online habits, are dividing people. And an accumulation of small decisions, such as choosing self-checkouts over small but real social contact in shops, could lead to increased risks of social isolation in older people.\n\nIt’s true that socializing can feel awkward. Some brains want more interaction than others; some encounters are more pleasant than others. Rein recommends recognizing, and meeting, your own social needs — like a ‘social diet’.\n\nThe good news is that other people like us more than we think they do, studies have shown. We can underestimate how interested others will be in us and how much a brief chat can lift our mood.\n\nRein encourages readers to not worry about people’s approval. And to think about what each declined invitation might cost both parties over time. So, when a friend calls, maybe answer? — Kelly-Ann Allen\n\nSlowing the Sun\n\nNadine Hura\n\nBridget Williams (2025)\n\nIn Slowing the Sun, writer and poet Nadine Hura (of Ngāti Hine, Ngāpuhi and Pākehā descent) brings us a refreshing perspective on climate change. Western knowledge tends to struggle to reach communities outside academia; she offers Indigenous storytelling as a solution. Through her collection of essays, interspersed with powerful poetry, we meet climate activists, politicians and Indigenous leaders — and learn about her experiences of grief.\n\nRecounting her father’s role in flattening mountains in Auckland, New Zealand, Hura highlights the juxtaposition of Indigenous people’s involvement in extractive industries, and reminds us how the poorest people bear the brunt of climate change in a system that they have no control over.\n\nHura reveals the gulf between how Western scientists discuss climate change, focusing on risks and vulnerabilities, and the determination of Indigenous communities to act — despite their lack of resources and power.\n\nIt’s easy to be overwhelmed by the climate crisis and disengage from it. But Hura reminds readers that “anything you do to benefit the land benefits you, often immediately. The environment is the healer, not the other way around”. I have never read a book like this before — deeply personal, yet relevant to everyone. Even the most seasoned climate scientist will learn a lot. — Tara McAllister\n\nThinking Like an Economist\n\nElizabeth Popp Berman\n\nPrinceton Univ. Press (2022)\n\nIt can seem hard to disagree with the maxim of efficiency. But observing the actions of the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) earlier this year — including the cuts it made to research — raised an important question. Is efficiency everything? A government is not a private company; organizing it around efficiency can detract from what it should be. Worryingly so.\n\nSociologist Elizabeth Popp Berman’s book, Thinking Like an Economist, helped me to make sense of what can be lost in favour of efficiency. Berman shows how, since the 1960s, US governments have strived for efficiency, sometimes over considerations of equity and democracy. The US Clean Air Act, for instance, was framed initially around asserting the public value of clean air by stigmatizing polluters and pushing industry to innovate. But over time, pollution became something to be priced, shifting efforts away from negotiating acceptable levels of pollution and towards markets.\n\nThis book is essential reading for those who want to understand how a focus on efficiency can help to centralize power and authority. Policies affect societal concerns that cannot be monetized. They are shaped through political bargains, by treading the line between redistribution and growth, environmental protection and business interests — and require messy democratic negotiation not algorithms. Such bargaining might not always deliver ‘value for money’ — but it remains essential for preserving freedoms. — Yamini Aiyar\n\nThese Letters End in Tears\n\nMusih Tedji Xaviere\n\nCatapult (2024)\n\nIn These Letters End in Tears, novelist Musih Tedji Xaviere tells a story about two young women in love in Cameroon — a love that provides refuge, self-acceptance and joy in a country where being gay is punishable by law. But the society fights back violently and devastatingly, through both individuals and institutions. The two women are incarcerated, for example. When my teary eyes left the last line of the final chapter, I became laser-focused on how to dismantle systems with beliefs, norms and laws that criminalize some experiences and existences.\n\nAs a medical sociologist, a central aspect of my work is to help people and institutions to understand how our societies can cause harm to some of us while allowing others to thrive. I identify how to eliminate oppression and promote well-being for all. For me, as a Cameroonian lesbian living in the United States, this book blurs the lines, in positive ways, between reality and fiction and between my professional responsibilities and my life’s purpose.\n\nReaders will question the very core of education, media, religion, gender, family life, class, language, politics and law — in Cameroon and beyond. Tragedy is an explicit focus of this poignant book, but Xaviere’s award-winning fiction also suggests actions of resistance that everyone can take against the erasure that is perpetuated in many societies, to varying extent: defiance, community-building, storytelling and being present. — Sirry Alang\n\nThe Reason I Jump\n\nNaoki Higashida\n\nSceptre (2013)\n\nAs a neuroscientist studying sensory input and behaviour, I seek to understand how brains construct perception and action. The Reason I Jump remains the most illuminating and hopeful book I have read. First published in 2007, its relevance has only increased as diagnoses of and research on autism spectrum disorder have expanded. Yet, the rich forms of communication, social connection and empathy that Naoki Higashida describes remain overlooked.\n\nHigashida, who mainly communicates non-verbally, wrote this candid book using a Japanese hiragana alphabet grid when he was just 13 years old. Unlike most autobiographies written by adults, the book offers an unfiltered account of how his mind perceives, feels and attempts to act, before such experiences can be ‘sorted’ cognitively.\n\nAutism is often portrayed as a condition of deficits: impaired communication, reduced empathy and inflexible behaviour. Higashida’s reflections challenge this idea with clarity and force. He describes his intense sensory world, the effort required to initiate even simple actions and the confusion that his own body can cause him.\n\nFor me, this book is galvanizing. In an era when discussions about autism often focus on pathology and clinical prediction rather than lived experience, it reminds me that communication extends far beyond speech — and that it can take forms that we have yet to fully understand. — Misa Shimuta\n\nIntertwined\n\nRebecca Kormos\n\nNew Press (2024)\n\nAs part of her work documenting the relationship between people and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), wildlife biologist and conservationist Rebecca Kormos interviewed women — and wondered why she hadn’t previously sought their voices. The honesty and sincerity of this question, which kicks off her book about women involved in conservation and environmental activism, made me keep reading.\n\nIntertwined showcases a vast sisterhood from which we can draw wisdom, courage and hope. For example, fisheries and wildlife biologist Midori Nicolson from Gwayi, Kingcome Inlet, a small village in Canada, reflects on the origin story of her people, the Dzawada’enuxw First Nation, whose history and cultural practices were altered by patriarchy and colonization. Reflecting on my own Yucatec Maya heritage, this prompted me to question which of our ancestral Indigenous stories have also been neglected. The resilience and strength of Zimbabwe’s Akashinga Rangers, all of whom are women, was so inspirational that I hope it will help to guide the transformation of the ranger team of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, which I lead.\n\nIntertwined examines the role of everyone — not just women — in solving the planetary polycrisis. The scientific data and collective wisdom of the stories in the book show that good outcomes for gender equality and women’s rights will benefit all of humanity and nature. — Elma Kay\n\nThe Coming Wave\n\nMustafa Suleyman & Michael Bhaskar\n\nCrown (2023)\n\nTechnologies such as artificial intelligence and synthetic biology are developing at a pace that outstrips that of the institutions designed to govern them. In The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman, chief executive of Microsoft AI, explores this “containment problem” with writer Michael Bhaskar: keeping control over systems that evolve faster than the associated political, social and ethical frameworks.\n\nRather than immersing readers in technical minutiae, the book captures the tension between technology’s extraordinary potential and the responsibility that comes with shaping its impacts. Suleyman’s analysis shows that the coming decades will be defined not just by the deployment of innovative technologies, but also by how they are used (governance and collective judgement).\n\nThe Coming Wave balances urgency and optimism well. Suleyman is clear about the risks of disruption by technologies that cannot be paused or reversed. Yet, he frames these challenges as an invitation to act.\n\nAs a researcher at the intersection of AI and spatial intelligence, I was struck by the book’s foresight. It offers younger generations the chance to become architects rather than victims of technological change and to shape systems that are resilient, equitable and aligned with human values. It is a call to ethical engagement with powerful technologies. — Mohamed Ibrahim\n\nNaturalistas\n\nLaura de Cabo et al.\n\nEl Ateneo (2024)\n\nInspiration can be close by — if you know where to look. Women in the research team of Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales “Bernardino Rivadavia” in Buenos Aires explored the work and lives of 16 of their predecessors: women who worked at the museum as illustrators and scientists, including botanists, arachnologists and marine biologists, over the past century. Despite contributing to their fields and the museum, these pioneers have long been overlooked.\n\nThis beautifully illustrated book, written in Spanish, conveys the thorough detective work its authors did. They combed through documents, newspapers and official records and contacted the researchers’ relatives. The stories were harder to piece together than they should have been.",

China is ranked number one for research on 66 of the technologies, including nuclear energy, synthetic biology, small satellites, while the United States topped the remaining 8, including quantum computing and geoengineering.\n\nThe results reflect a drastic reversal. At the beginning of this century, the United States led more than 90% of the assessed technologies, whereas China led less than 5% of them, according to the 2024 edition of the tracker.\n\n“China has made incredible progress on science and technology that is reflected in research and development, as well as in publications,” says Ilaria Mazzocco, who researches China’s industrial policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit research organization based in Washington DC.\n\nMazzocco says the general trend identified by the ASPI is not a surprise, but it is “remarkable” to see that China is so dominant and advanced in so many fields compared with the United States.\n\nThis might have something to do with the type of technologies that are tracked, says Wang Yanbo, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The country is more likely to be a research leader in new technologies, where it has focused its efforts, compared to traditional fields where other country's lead, such as semi conductor chips, he notes.\n\nTracking high-impact research\n\nThe ASPI team based its analysis on a database that contains more than nine million publications from all around the world. It ranked nations in each technology by identifying the top 10% of the most-cited papers produced by researchers in a country over a five-year period, between 2020 and 2024, and calculated that country's global share.\n\nOne noteworthy finding is that China is outpacing the United States in cloud and edge computing, according to David Lin, a national security and technology strategist at the Special Competitive Studies Project, a non-profit organization based in Arlington, Virginia. Cloud computing enables artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train models and process data without the need for physical infrastructure, whereas edge computing processes data locally. China’s research intensity in these fields “probably reflects the urgency with which Beijing is moving AI from the lab into deployment”, Lin says.\n\nThe analysis should not be interpreted as “a collapse of American power”, says Steven Hai, a political economist focusing on technology innovation at Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University in Suzhou, China. In general, the United States is still an important player globally in these technologies, Hai says.\n\nJenny Wong-Leung, a data scientist at ASPI who participated in the study, warns that the findings show democratic nations risk losing “hard-won, long-term advantages in cutting-edge science and research” in a range of essential sectors, which is the crucial for the development and advancement of the world’s most important technologies.",

Researchers typically look for blocks of rock left over from mining activity, because that’s where the fossils tend to be, but one day my team and I decided to investigate what we thought was the bedrock.

          "abstract": "Part of the IBM Quantum System Two computer.Credit: Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty\n\nClaims of leaps in quantum computing are made almost daily, but progress is hard to judge when each research group uses its own mixture of hardware, algorithms and evaluation metrics, making it near impossible to compare systems. Now, researchers are trying to make it easier to chart the performance of quantum machines.\n\nAs part of an ongoing effort, a consortium of UK researchers has created a suite of metrics that they say is a holistic way to measure the performance of quantum computers. They have published the work alongside a library of open-source software called QCMet1. Separately, a group including tech giant IBM and Helsinki-based quantum-software company Algorithmiq launched the Quantum Advantage Tracker last month as a way to compare experiments that purport to show ‘quantum advantage’ — that is, an efficiency or accuracy better than that of a classical machine.\n\n“People ask, ‘When is quantum computing going to be useful?’ I think it’s a little bit of a farcical question to answer without some data. And I think having data-driven answers is exactly what initiatives like this are pushing for,” says James Whitfield, a quantum physicist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nMany possible metrics\n\nClassical computers encode information in bits that can be either 1 or 0. Quantum computers are instead based on quantum bits, or ‘qubits’, using any system — such as light or tiny superconducting loops — that can be put into a state of being both 1 and 0 at once. Physicists make qubits interact in ways that they hope will allow them to perform certain kinds of calculation much faster than would otherwise be possible. Some groups have created quantum computers that contain more than 1,000 qubits. But maintaining ever-larger systems while operating the computer is challenging.\n\nQuantum computers: what are they good for?\n\nWhen publicizing their results, quantum-computing companies often highlight the number of qubits in their machine as an indication of how advanced it is. But this doesn’t tell the full story: other metrics are often more relevant, such as error rates and how many qubits can be connected or harnessed in each calculation. And it is not always clear how firms calculate the figures they report. The QCMet project — led by researchers at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, UK — has built a list of metrics and algorithms to capture the performance and capabilities of all kinds of quantum computer, as well as publishing software to help standardize how each measurement is performed.\n\n“You shouldn’t just use one [metric] to tell you which is ‘better’ — you need to have the larger picture,” says Abhishek Agarwal, a quantum physicist at the NPL, who is part of the project. One often-ignored factor is stability, he says. In some systems, “if you run something now, versus even two minutes later, you can get quite different results”.\n\nUsing a range of metrics could help to harmonize what types of result researchers report, improving comparisons between quantum computers, as well as interoperability, says Whitfield. Each type of qubit has its own strengths, and sometimes companies report only the metrics that suit them. “It’s almost like they don’t want you to compare across devices,” Whitfield says.\n\nScrutinizing quantum advantage\n\nThe Quantum Advantage Tracker aims to help compare quantum machines by gauging how well quantum computers perform at particular applications, compared with classical computers. Claims of quantum advantage — often for little-known and very specific applications — are usually quickly overturned once external researchers improve the performance of classical methods. The tracker could help to monitor these ever-moving goalposts, says Whitfield.",

          "abstract": "To the research team working to save him, KJ Muldoon was first known only as Patient Eta.\n\nBut within months, KJ’s name — and megawatt, chubby-cheeked smile — would be splashed across newspapers and broadcasts around the world as the first known person to receive a personalized CRISPR-based genome-editing therapy.\n\nSoon after KJ was born in August 2024, doctors noticed that he was sleeping too much and eating too little. After a bevy of tests, they found that KJ has an ultra-rare genetic condition, called carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, that impairs the body’s ability to process protein.\n\nWhen the body breaks down proteins, it produces ammonia — a toxic substance that is usually processed by enzymes in the liver and excreted in urine. CPS1 deficiency compromises one of these enzymes, causing ammonia to accumulate in the blood, which can eventually damage the brain. The condition can be treated with a liver transplant, but about half of all babies with CPS1 deficiency die in early infancy.\n\nOne of KJ’s doctors, paediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, wondered whether there might be another solution — correcting the faulty enzyme in his liver. She and Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, had a bold plan to treat children with rare genetic disorders using gene-editing therapies tailored to unique DNA sequences. KJ could be their first candidate.\n\nPrevious gene-editing therapies were designed to treat many people. The first approved CRISPR therapy, called Casgevy, could potentially treat tens of thousands of people with one of two blood disorders. By contrast, KJ’s therapy would work only for him.\n\nThe team used an offshoot of CRISPR genome editing, called base editing, to target the problematic mutation — one faulty DNA letter out of the three billion in the human genome — and correct it (K. Musunuru et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 392, 2235–2243; 2025). Such a hyper-personalized editing therapy had never been made so quickly; KJ might only have a few months before ammonia overwhelmed his small body.\n\nIn the end, it took a large team of researchers in academia and industry to make it happen. While KJ charmed everyone he met at the hospital, Musunuru and his lab members shielded themselves from learning any personal details about him, even his name. “There were certain go or no-go points where key decisions had to be made,” Musunuru says. “We had to be objective with respect to the data.”\n\nManufacturing companies worked around the clock to make the gene-editing components needed to treat KJ. “We estimated that it would take 18 months,” says Sandy Ottensmann, a vice-president at Integrated DNA Technologies in Coralville, Iowa. “We did it in six.”\n\nOn 25 February, KJ received the first of three infusions. His tolerance for protein in his diet has increased, but he still needs medication and regular monitoring to ensure that his ammonia levels stay in check.",

Credit: Tristan Bejawn/Guardian/eyevine\n\nFor science enthusiasts in the United Kingdom, the Christmas Lectures at the Royal Institution (RI) are as much a part of the season’s celebration as are Christmas trees and carol singing. These iconic talks for a young audience, celebrating their 200th anniversary this year, have introduced many people to the delights of science through captivating demonstrations. Space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock is the next speaker to take to the floor, delivering this historic lecture series this week.\n\nHeld in the RI’s famous lecture theatre on Albemarle Street in London, the lectures began in 1825 as one of London’s most fashionable educational spectacles. In theory, the lectures were open to anyone “who wanted to improve their minds”, says Charlotte New, the RI’s head of heritage and collections. But, although the ticket price wasn’t prohibitively high, it was enough to ensure a well-heeled and genteel audience. As the writer George Eliot observed in 1851, the lectures were “as fashionable an amusement as the Opera”.\n\nTikTok’s dancing chemist catalyses joy in students\n\nThe RI was founded in 1799 by scientist Benjamin Thompson and botanist Joseph Banks as an organization to introduce new technologies and teach science to the general public through lectures and demonstrations. It soon also became a research institution with its own laboratories, in which chemist Humphry Davy, who was appointed director of the chemical laboratory in 1801, made groundbreaking discoveries about new chemical elements. Davy also presented many of the public lectures, and his flamboyant style brought them wide renown.\n\nWhen Davy’s former assistant Michael Faraday took over as laboratory director in 1825, he faced the formidable task of living up to his mentor’s legacy. Once a bookbinder’s apprentice, Faraday had already come to rival Davy as a researcher, notably through his work on electromagnetic induction, which led to the invention of the electric motor. Soon enough, he proved himself to be his predecessor’s equal behind the lecture podium, too.\n\n“Very little information exists in the archives to describe why the lectures were developed,” says New. The first series was delivered in 1825 by John Millington, the RI’s professor of mechanics. Originally, the series were much more extensive than today’s, comprising a set of 22 lectures on natural philosophy that were, according to the institute’s management minutes, “suited to a juvenile auditory, during the Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide recesses”. (Here, ‘juvenile’ probably referred to people aged 15 to 20 — older than the current target audience of schoolchildren, typically aged 11 to 17.)\n\nScience in action\n\nInitially, Faraday tried to avoid getting roped in as a speaker, but in 1827 he relented, delivering his first series on the topic of chemistry. Before long, he became the default Christmas lecturer, presenting 19 series over the next four decades and shaping the format that persists today. He mastered the art of live demonstration. “He never told his listeners of an experiment, he always showed it,” wrote Lovell Reeve, a dealer of natural-history objects, in 1863. The Illustrated London News declared in 1861: “There can be no greater treat to any one fond of scientific pursuits than to attend a course of these lectures.”\n\n“If you look at his lecture notes, they are laid out almost like a theatre script,” says Katy Duncan, a postdoctoral research fellow at the RI. “Demonstrations like stage directions on the left leaf, and the script on the right.”\n\nHow to thank your lab mates: eight ways to show gratitude at the end of year\n\nFaraday’s most famous series, The Chemical History of a Candle (delivered between 1860 and 1861), turned an everyday object into a profound exploration of combustion, capillary action and electrolysis. His playful use of the party game snapdragon — in which players are dared to snatch flaming raisins from a bowl of brandy and eat them without getting burned — perfectly embodied his belief that science should inspire wonder.\n\nThe lectures were soon published in Chemical News by chemist William Crookes, and subsequently as a book with elegant illustrations, which was received as an exemplar of popular science. The Chemical History of a Candle, wrote the Glasgow Herald in 1861, “will be eagerly welcomed by many readers who turn in despair from the dry chronicles of scientific terms called popular works, but which, in many instances, are about as interesting as street directories”.\n\nOver the following decades, RI professors such as John Tyndall, James Dewar and William Henry Bragg continued the tradition, although wartime interruptions paused the series between 1939 and 1942 — for safety reasons and because evacuations meant there were few children in London to attend.\n\nAlthough the initial lectures reflected the RI’s focus on chemistry, by the early twentieth century topics had broadened — evolutionary biologist Edwin Ray Lankester gave lectures on ‘extinct animals’, physicist William Henry Bragg on ‘the world of sound’ and physiologist Archibald Hill on ‘nerves and muscles’.\n\nThe 1932 Christmas Lectures were given by physicist Alexander Rankine.Credit: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL/Getty\n\nIn 1949, one of the lectures was televised for the first time, delivered by psychologist Frederic Bartlett. Despite occasional tension with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) — especially after a financial scandal involving the laboratory director Edward Andrade in the early 1950s — the televised lectures (filmed live) soon became a national institution. “The RI’s attitude to working with the BBC on these broadcasts was generally cooperative so long as the BBC did not inconvenience the day-to-day running of the institution as a social club for its members,” says Rupert Cole, a former curator at the Science Museum in London.\n\nThe postwar years brought cultural tensions to the RI, because the atomic bomb and rising environmental fears made the public adopt a more sceptical view of science’s role in society. Such tensions came to the fore in the Christmas Lectures of 1974, given by electrical engineer Eric Laithwaite. Framed around an Alice-in-Wonderland theme and infused with a then-fashionable dose of Eastern philosophy, the series culminated in Laithwaite’s demonstration of an alleged ‘anti-gravity’ device based on gyroscopes. The response from other scientists was predictably hostile, and Laithwaite was subsequently ostracized from the scientific establishment.",

          "abstract": "Almost 14 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been delivered since the first jab was officially rolled out on 8 December 2020.Credit: Paula Bronstein/Getty\n\nOn 8 December 2020, a 90-year-old British woman became the first person in the world to receive a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Five years on, more than 13.64 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. Thanks to the rapid roll-out of these vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 was no longer a public-health emergency in May 2023.\n\nThe global response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a turning point for public health — but the downstream effects haven’t all been positive, argues Kristen Panthagani, a physician at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. In March 2020, Panthagani started a newsletter called You Can Know Things, which originally focused on addressing rumours and myths about COVID-19 vaccines and public-health measures. It now explores how the miscommunication of science and health measures has damaged public trust in vaccines and scientific research.\n\nNature spoke with Panthagani about what public-health institutions can learn from the pandemic, and how they can rebuild trust in science.\n\nLooking back at the past five years, what lessons have been learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nThe pandemic was a steep learning curve. Nobody in our generation had ever encountered anything like that before and we must remember what we were dealing with at the time. It’s easy to beat ourselves up looking back, but it’s important that we look at what we can learn from that time and how we can do better going forwards.\n\nPublic trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards\n\nUnfortunately, we’ve seen declining trust in childhood vaccines since the pandemic. The miscommunication and distrust over COVID-19 vaccines and mandates has influenced the uptake of other vaccines. The United States is now at risk of losing its elimination status for measles, and that is directly related to vaccine coverage. Once measles vaccination drops below 95%, we start to lose herd immunity. If that were to happen, I think it would be a clear sign of this declining trust in vaccines.\n\nWe also have to consider declining access to vaccines in many parts of the world, and the challenges people have getting health-care coverage.\n\nWhat happened during the pandemic that eroded people’s trust in vaccines?\n\nMisinformation about vaccines has been circulating for decades, but the difference now is that it’s spreading more loudly and is becoming more mainstream. Public-health specialists and governments didn’t communicate well during the pandemic.\n\nFor example, in colloquial language, the word ‘immunity’ has this connotation of perfect protection — for example, with legal immunity, the idea is that you’re protected against prosecution. So many people thought that the COVID-19 vaccine would give them 100% immunity, but then some of their family members were hospitalized owing to COVID-19, or died, and now the message is that you need a booster every year. After a while, people say: “You told me this and I got something completely different.”\n\nmRNA COVID vaccines saved lives and won a Nobel — what’s next for the technology?\n\nIt would have gone a long way to tell people clearly, and early on, that the vaccines can be highly effective but are not perfect, and to acknowledge uncertainty in the data. There were scientists who were trying to do that, but it wasn’t the loud, predominant voices.",

          "authors": "Jackson Ryan",
          "abstract": "Pan Hui has already been replaced by artificial intelligence — and he did the replacing himself. In 2023, one of his students mentioned that they were a little bored seeing the same professor every lesson and might enjoy being taught by some different faces. This gave Hui an idea: why not use generative AI and an avatar to teach the students instead.\n\n“I wanted to see whether the students would accept avatar teachers in the classroom and how they respond to this technology,” he says.\n\nLike many researchers and educators, Hui, a computer scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in China, views AI as a tool with potentially transformative power in education. So, over ten weeks in early 2024, postgraduate students were taught a course by various digital avatars. They could ask questions of the avatar and an underlying large language model (LLM) provided real-time responses, syncing facial animations to the answers. Hui and colleagues collected data on the students’ experience via surveys and interviews. Members of his class reported that certain human-like avatars, such as one that looked like Albert Einstein, felt more trustworthy than cartoonish avatars1.\n\nNature Index 2025 Young universities\n\nHui’s experiment provides clues to the approach that an ‘AI-first’ higher-education provider might take in the classroom. AI has already had a seismic impact on higher education as existing universities race to integrate a suite of tools and LLMs into administration, curriculum design, teaching and assessment — and at the same time grapple with students’ use of LLMs. The struggles faced by universities so far, both ethical and pedagogical, arise from the rapid deployment of AI tools into higher-education systems that were not equipped to handle them.\n\nBut what if new universities were built with AI as a core tool? From admissions that can be handled by AI agents directing prospective students towards particular courses, to personalized tutoring and lesson plans based on individual learning needs and progress, there is an opportunity to completely rethink how a university works as an educational institution.\n\nSuch ‘AI-first’ universities might find it easier to integrate technology, because they would include AI systems as the foundation of everything they do, suggests Helen Crompton, executive director of the Research Institute for Digital Innovation in Learning at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nFor some higher-education observers, however, there is both opportunity and concern. Anthony Kaziboni, a sociologist at the University of Johannesburg in South Africa, says he is worried that if the companies behind AI systems are too involved in reshaping education, it would cause problems because their motivations “are not rooted in pedagogy, but profit”.\n\nComputer scientist Pan Hui presents an AI teacher to his class at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) in China.Credit: Yawei Zhao\nAI’s personal touch\n\nEarly adopters of putting AI at the core of school education might provide a blueprint for how AI-first universities could take shape. Alpha School, headquartered in Austin, Texas, and with an expanding network of private campuses across the United States, has students working for just two hours a day with its personalized AI system that it says tailors to pupils’ “strengths, weaknesses and interests”. Students spend the rest of their day dedicated to “life skills, passion projects and co-curricular activities”, with some human oversight by “guides”, rather than teachers.\n\nTuition costs vary, but The New York Times reports US$40,000 per year in Austin and NBC Bay Area news website reports US$75,000 in San Francisco. The model provides a template that AI-first universities might implement: focus on personalizing the education experience — even starting before students decide which course to take — while humans mentor and support their learning.\n\nCrompton says that falling enrolments have seen university programmes in many developed countries contract or disappear entirely in the past decade. Between 2012 and 2022 in the United States, there was a fall in the proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds moving into higher education from 41% to 39%. AI might be a survival strategy for universities and colleges, helping to streamline the admissions process by giving them near-instant recommendations for courses that align with their interests. A prospective student could talk to an AI agent and within seconds receive direction to a degree. “They immediately feel like they’ve been heard, where in the older systems they weren’t,” says Crompton.\n\nThis kind of system is already being offered by some providers. Maestro, an accredited AI-first institution in Austin (formerly known as Peloton College), bills itself as “the #1 AI-native university offering free world-class education”. It offers qualifications in areas such as web development, cybersecurity and AI software engineering. If you land on Maestro’s homepage, you’ll be greeted by a chatbot that guides you to one of its programmes, which are entirely taught by an “AI tutor”. Maestro took in its first student cohort in September and currently offers only a small selection of skills-based Associate of Applied Science (AAS) courses, although its website suggests that BSc, BA and MBAs degrees will be available soon.\n\nThere is evidence that AI-driven personalization of the curriculum might enhance the learning process, too. For instance, one study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab in Cambridge, involving 272 participants, demonstrated that personalization positively affected motivation to learn (although it did not affect the performance of students)2. Another study3, not yet peer-reviewed, explored how real-time, AI-generated summaries of a writer’s work helped to initiate self-reviewing and editing, finding that authors who used the tool would often incorporate elements of the AI’s feedback. Such an AI could provide instant, individualized assistance that is impossible for a teacher or tutor to provide, strengthening students’ essays or academic manuscripts.\n\nSome initiatives have already seen teachers and students use generative AI tools for tasks such as role-playing scenarios they might encounter in business or enabling conversations with historic and literary figures to unpack concepts and ideas. Crompton says you could “have debates with AI”, such as discussing perceptions of women in society during the mid-1800s with an AI chatbot based on the novelist Emily Brontë.\n\nBeatriz Bordadágua, an astrophysics doctoral student at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies in Germany, sees some advantages of AI and personalization in universities. She thinks AI could speed up the pace of learning, noting that conventional universities have not necessarily evolved their methods of teaching as information technologies have developed. “Now, information is obtained quickly and tailored to your needs in short bursts, whereas traditional universities still have two-hour lectures with hundreds of students. These methods work, of course, but are they the most effective way of teaching?” she asks.\n\nHui says this kind of personalization might also be helpful from a teacher’s perspective. “We know that all students have different progress when learning,” he says. “As one person, it’s difficult for me to adopt the right pace for teaching.” Through his experiments with digital avatars, he found that students wanted authenticity and lecturers that would adapt to individual styles. That puts the human educators in a curatorial position, overseeing a suite of personalized tools, including AI agents and LLMs that help to create lesson plans, tutor students or help with assessments. “The human would still play a very important role,” he says.\n\nPersonalization cost\n\nThere could be costs to personalizing higher education with AI, however. Crompton points out that graduates who are trained in AI-first universities, and therefore reliant on AI tools to learn, might then take this approach if they progress on to academic research during doctoral studies or beyond. “What happens if those people are using AI to guide them into decisions on what we should look at?” she asks.\n\nCrompton calls this “cognitive steering” and points to a study4 published in July, by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Stanford University in California, that found politically partisan AI models could reshape people’s political views in about 10 minutes, even if the users’ beliefs were the opposite of those coded into the AI.\n\nStudents at a camp run by Alpha School in Austin, Texas, create arcade games using AI.Credit: Desiree Rios/The New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nSimilarly, she says there is a risk that students might incur a “pedagogical debt”, where their reliance on AI in higher education means they haven’t acquired the skills needed to solve problems or make decisions in the parts of society where AI has not been integrated.",

          "title": "The top US health director who stood up for science — and was fired",
          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "When Susan Monarez was sworn in to lead the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country’s premier public-health agency, many researchers across the country breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nTrained as a microbiologist and immunologist, Monarez had been a non-partisan government scientist for nearly 20 years. She was an unexpectedly uncontroversial choice by US President Donald Trump, who had previously put forward (but later withdrew the nomination for) Dave Weldon, a physician and vaccine sceptic who worked as a Republican member of Congress from 1995 to 2009.\n\nBut in August, less than a month after assuming the role of director, Monarez was out. “I was fired for holding the line on scientific integrity,” she testified at a tense congressional hearing in September. According to her account, she refused orders from US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr to fire leading scientists at the agency and to pre-approve vaccine recommendations without first considering the relevant scientific data.\n\nKennedy disputes this account, testifying that Monarez had told him that she wasn’t trustworthy, so he ousted her.\n\nKennedy has made no secret of his contempt for the CDC, calling it perhaps “the most corrupt agency” in the US government. A long-time anti-vaccine advocate, he has attempted to fire about one-quarter of the agency workforce and has replaced all the members of a key panel of scientists that advises the federal government on vaccine policy, introducing several members who have publicly criticized vaccines.\n\nMonarez is one of the highest-profile government scientists to raise concerns about policy changes by the Trump administration that threaten public health. These are part of a broader set of actions that have disrupted the US scientific enterprise. Over the course of the year, US officials have cancelled thousands of grants, fired hundreds of government researchers, blocked funding to universities and proposed unprecedented cuts to research. The administration has said its actions are meant to improve science and innovation and restore the country’s confidence in scientific and public-health bodies.\n\n“Susan has long established herself as someone who puts evidence in service of the country above all,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. “Susan did what any self-respecting scientist would do. No self-respecting scientist would agree to just rubber-stamp things without first scrutinizing the scientific evidence.”\n\nThe CDC’s top medical officer, Debra Houry, and three other senior CDC scientists resigned in protest of Monarez’s dismissal. The conflict spilled into public view when Monarez, Houry and Kennedy presented their versions of events to US senators at hearings in September on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Houry testified that Kennedy and his team had not consulted CDC’s scientists on key decisions, including one in May to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines to children and pregnant people.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC and which Kennedy leads, disputes Houry’s testimony.\n\nMonarez, whose previous government work spanned biosecurity, artificial intelligence and data analysis, had big plans for the agency that were focused largely on streamlining data to offer public-health recommendations tailored to each locality and state, she tells Nature. “I always challenge the status quo because that’s what you do in science,” Monarez says. “You challenge it to try to do better, but you don’t compromise your moral and scientific integrity for expediency.”",

          "abstract": "Climate-related disasters such as wildfires and floods pose escalating risks to communities worldwide, yet motivating individuals to adopt protective measures remains a persistent challenge. In a pre-registered field experiment with 12,985 Australian homeowners in wildfire-prone areas, we demonstrate that a simple behavioural intervention—integrating proximal cues, such as participants’ suburbs, into climate risk communications—significantly increases engagement. Participants who received localized messages were twice as likely to seek further information about wildfire preparedness compared with those who received generic communications (odds ratio of 2.03, 95% confidence interval of 1.33 to 3.16). This effect highlights the power of behavioural interventions in addressing barriers to climate adaptation, particularly by reducing psychological distance and fostering place attachment. By making abstract climate risks tangible and personally relevant, the intervention nudges individuals towards action. These findings suggest a scalable, low-cost approach for enhancing disaster preparedness, offering insights for leveraging behavioural science to mitigate the impact of climate-related disasters.",

          "abstract": "Scientists provide important information to the public. Whether that information influences decision-making depends on trust. In the USA, gaps in trust in scientists have been stable for 50 years: women, Black people, rural residents, religious people, less educated people and people with lower economic status express less trust than their counterparts (who are more represented among scientists). Here we probe the factors that influence trust. We find that members of the less trusting groups exhibit greater trust in scientists who share their characteristics (for example, women trust women scientists more than men scientists). They view such scientists as having more benevolence and, in most cases, more integrity. In contrast, those from high-trusting groups appear mostly indifferent about scientists’ characteristics. Our results highlight how increasing the presence of underrepresented groups among scientists can increase trust. This means expanding representation across several divides—not just gender and race/ethnicity but also rurality and economic status.",

Using data on New Hampshire births from 2010–2019, we show that mothers receiving water that had flowed beneath a PFAS-contaminated site, as opposed to comparable mothers receiving water that had flowed toward a PFAS-contaminated site, had 191% [95% CI: 83–298%] higher first-year infant mortality (611 [268–955] additional first-year deaths per 100k births); 168% [42–294%] more births before 28 wk of gestational age (466 [116–817] additional such births per 100k births); and 180% [57–302%] more births with weight below 1,000 g (607 [192–1022] additional such births per 100k births).

          "abstract": "Successful communication requires frequent inferences. Such inferences span a multitude of phenomena: from understanding metaphors, to detecting irony and getting jokes, to interpreting intonation patterns. Do all these inferences draw on a single underlying cognitive ability, or does our capacity for nonliteral language comprehension fractionate into dissociable components? Using an approach that has successfully uncovered structure in other domains of cognition, we examined covariation in behavioral performance on diverse nonliteral comprehension tasks across two large samples to search for shared and distinct components of pragmatic language use. In Experiment 1, n = 376 participants each completed an 8 h battery of 20 critical tasks. Controlling for general cognitive ability, an exploratory factor analysis revealed three clusters, which can be post hoc interpreted as corresponding to i) understanding social conventions (critical for phenomena such as indirect requests, conversational implicatures, and irony), ii) interpreting contrastive and emotional intonation patterns, and iii) making causal inferences based on world knowledge. This structure largely replicated in a new sample of n = 400 participants (Experiment 2, preregistered) and was robust to analytic choices. This research uncovers structure in the human communication toolkit and can inform our understanding of pragmatic difficulties in individuals with brain disorders. The hypotheses put forward here about the underlying cognitive abilities can now be evaluated in new behavioral studies, as well as using brain imaging and computational modeling, to continue deciphering the ontology of the component pieces of linguistic and nonverbal communication.",

To make roads safer without expanding police contact, many cities have turned to automated traffic enforcement, cameras that detect and fine speeding motorists. Does automated enforcement reduce vehicle collisions and injuries? Many previous studies are limited to correlational evidence. By contrast, this study estimates the causal effect of automated enforcement on road safety in a difference-in-differences design. We exploit the staggered rollout of 2,000 speed cameras across New York City between 2014 and 2023, combining data on 700,000 collisions and 200,000 injuries with data on 18 million tickets issued. We find that cameras reduce collisions and injuries by 5 and 2.5% per month on average, respectively. Cumulatively, over the seven months following their introduction, collisions declined by 30% and injuries by 16%.",

          "abstract": "Voting Advice Applications (VAAs) are interactive tools that communicate information about elections, yet their effectiveness in enhancing political knowledge and participation remains understudied. Moreover, traditional VAAs may disproportionately attract politically engaged users with already well-formed ideological views, limiting their potential to inform a broader and less engaged electorate. This paper introduces a “VAA Bot” that employs large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation to deliver balanced, personalized information drawn from official party platforms and public documents. We evaluate the VAA Bot’s impact across three experimental studies aimed at young politically unaffiliated adults. The findings provide evidence that the VAA Bot improves knowledge of party stances on issues of great importance to each user. However, the VAA Bot produces weak effects on downstream outcomes such as vote preferences and party evaluations among respondents whose primary issue position aligns closely with one of the parties. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about the role of political information in shaping behavior and clarify both the promise and the limitations of LLM-based tools for civic learning.",

          "abstract": "Cesarean section (CS) is the most common major surgery worldwide and, by enabling birth outside physiologic labor, is an evolutionary novelty. Labor-related mechanical and hormonal stimuli, shaped by natural selection, facilitate neonatal adaptation to extrauterine life. While prior work has emphasized the biological impacts of altered microbial exposure following CS, the developmental implications of missing labor are less explored. We evaluated whether birth without labor was associated with differences in child hair cortisol, an integrated measure of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity that influences growth, metabolism, immunity, and behavior. Using longitudinal data from singleton births in the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort in Brazil ( N = 6 , 136 observations from 3,537 participants), we found that 4 to 7 y old children born through planned CS before labor had 6.6% lower hair cortisol than children born vaginally ( P = 0.002 ) and 4.4% lower cortisol than children born from unplanned CS after labor ( P = 0.017 ). There were no significant differences in hair cortisol levels between children born vaginally and through CS after labor, suggesting that labor exposure, rather than CS delivery, is associated with the observed differences. A significant interaction between labor experience and gestational age indicated that differences were most pronounced among children born without labor at earlier gestational ages; adjusted differences between planned CS and vaginal delivery were significant before 39.5 wk gestation. These findings support the hypothesis that labor is an evolved developmental exposure and that bypassing it may have unintended biological consequences.",

We present results from a probabilistic joint inversion of multiple satellite and land-based datasets to determine the thermal structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle beneath Greenland and consider the implications for our understanding of the tectonic history, isostatic deformation, and Greenland ice sheet evolution. Passage of Greenland over the Iceland hotspot is well known but there remains considerable debate on the trajectory of this path. Our findings reveal strong lateral variability in thermal structure that is consistent with reconstructions of a west-to-east hotspot track across central Greenland. Applying our temperature model to infer mechanical properties of the solid Earth reveals viscosity variations reaching 3 orders of magnitude in the upper mantle. We generate an ensemble of plausible 3D viscosity models and produce quality fits to both paleo sea level and contemporary vertical land motion datasets. This result supports the veracity of our temperature model and questions the need for a large component of transient deformation to explain the observations. Our regional temperature and viscosity models can be used to develop improved reconstructions and understanding of past Greenland ice sheet changes and explore the influence of 3D Earth structure on simulating ice sheet and sea level evolution in the past and future.",

          "authors": "Weilong Pan, Dejia Guo, Daiyuan Liu, Xiaodong Wang",
          "abstract": "SARM1 is a neuronal Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) hydrolase that drives axonal degeneration and neuronal death by depleting NAD + , yet how NAD + loss triggers axon loss and cell death has remained unclear. Here, we define a nonapoptotic death program downstream of endogenous SARM1 activation and NAD + loss using a genetically tractable nonneuronal eHAP cell model. Upon NAD + depletion, BAX is activated but caspase activation is suppressed due to APAF1 degradation via the E3 ligase HERC4, effectively uncoupling mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization from apoptosome formation. Mechanistically, NAD + depletion inhibits mTOR/AKT signaling, destabilizing MCL1 and relieving BAX from repression. We further identified Neurofibromatosis type II, NF2, as a regulator that promotes SARM1 transcription through the Hippo–YAP/TAZ pathway. The SARM1-dependent BAX activation and the role of NF2 in axon degradation were validated in neuronal models of axon degeneration. Together, these findings reveal how SARM1-driven metabolic collapse rewires cell death execution, positioning BAX, MCL1, APAF1, NF2, and HERC4 as core effectors in a nonapoptotic degenerative pathway linking metabolic stress to neurodegeneration",

          "abstract": "Genotype–phenotype associations can be context-dependent and dynamic in nature leading to heterogeneity of genetic effects across different parts of the phenotype distribution. Quantile regression, an alternative to linear regression for continuous phenotypes, is particularly well suited for detecting and characterizing heterogeneous genotype–phenotype associations. Here, we propose a computationally efficient whole-genome quantile regression technique, Regenie.QRS, for biobank-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data with genetic structure. Our approach first estimates the polygenic effect, and then incorporates this effect as an offset in the nonmixed quantile regression model. Our simulations demonstrate robust control of type I error and higher power to detect heterogeneous associations relative to linear regression in GWAS and improved power over the marginal quantile regression tests. We present applications using data from the UK Biobank and the ProgeNIA/SardiNIA project, where we show the advantages of Regenie.QRS in identifying and characterizing heterogeneous genetic effects. To cite just one interesting example, using quantile regression, we are able to show that even though variants at the G6PC2 locus increase glucose levels, their effects are much stronger at lower quantiles of glucose level distribution than at higher quantiles, suggesting that G6PC2 may serve as a guardian against low glucose levels without driving dangerous hyperglycemia, which may explain the previously reported lack of association with diabetes risk. Beyond human genetics, our approach can be applied to plant and animal genetic studies to improve selective breeding and conservation efforts.",

          "abstract": "Climate-driven ocean warming is profoundly reshaping marine ecosystems, with cascading effects on biodiversity and trophic interactions. For migratory marine predators such as seabirds, demographic responses to warming depend on when and where populations are exposed across the annual cycle. Therefore, integrating demographic monitoring and tracking data, across broad geographic and temporal scales, is essential, given the spatial and seasonal variability in ocean warming. Here, we integrated long-term demographic data, seasonal distributions, and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for 26 populations of five seabird species breeding in the North–East Atlantic to assess the effects of SSTs on reproduction, survival, and population growth trajectories. Demographic responses varied widely among populations and seasons, but negative effects were most consistently associated with warming during the autumn period postbreeding, particularly in the Barents and East Greenland Seas. Winter warming also corresponded to reduced survival, while breeding-season SSTs showed fewer significant effects on reproductive rates. Populations with dual responses to warming in both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons had the lowest projected population growth rates under future SSTs given a high emissions scenario. These results demonstrate that population vulnerability reflects the interaction between seabirds’ year-round distributions and regional ocean warming. This underlines the need to integrate year-round tracking and long-term monitoring to inform conservation strategies and marine spatial planning to ensure climate-resilient marine ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in algorithm design, but their effectiveness in solving data science challenges in real-world settings remains poorly understood. We conducted a classroom experiment in which graduate students used LLMs to solve biomedical data science challenges on Kaggle, focusing on tabular data prediction. While their submissions did not top the leaderboards, their prediction scores were often close to those of leading human participants. LLMs frequently recommended gradient boosting methods, which were associated with better performance. Among prompting strategies, self-refinement, where the LLM improves its own initial solution, was the most effective, a result validated using additional LLMs. While LLMs are capable of handling more complex data science tasks beyond tabular data prediction, their performance is substantially worse. These findings demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to design competitive machine learning solutions, even when used by nonexperts.",

GBIF is the world’s largest data integrator for biodiversity information and plays a central role in research across the biodiversity and evolutionary science community. With the help of a comprehensive bibliographic dataset comprising 12,193 studies that used GBIF-mediated data, we demonstrate how the global scientific community utilizes the continuously fast-growing amount of open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable biodiversity data in their research. Overall, more researchers engage with GBIF data, a potential consequence of the rising demands of more global environmental assessments, where GBIF-mediated data are being used as a key resource for biodiversity research. Studies utilizing species distribution modeling were most prevalent and data used for topics related to challenges of the Anthropocene (conservation, climate change, invasive, and pest species). More studies used observational data records, a category that also includes a substantial amount of citizen science data. Our data show that a thematic diversification of GBIF-using literature is accompanied by a rapid diversification of both the additional datasets that GBIF data are analyzed with, as well as the new analytical approaches taken by researchers. This emphasizes the growing importance of GBIF’s data infrastructure and services which support global sciences and reflect major shifts in applied science which dictate the need for GBIF and similar data infrastructures to evolve rapidly in order to maintain relevance for research.",

          "abstract": "DNA methylation is a conserved epigenetic modification essential for maintaining genome stability. However, how methyltransferases maintain CG methylation within compact chromatin, including centromeres, remains unclear. In humans, CDCA7 is necessary for the inheritance of DNA methylation at juxta-centromeres. Mutations that impair its ability to bind chromatin result in Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability, and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome, characterized by centromeric instability. To investigate whether CDCA7 function is conserved, we identified two Arabidopsis thaliana orthologs, CDCA7α and CDCA7β . The loss of both copies results in CG hypomethylation at pericentromeric regions and centromeric satellite repeat arrays. Machine learning analysis suggested that heterochromatic nucleosomes, with enrichment of H1, H2A.W, and H3K9me2, depend heavily on CDCA7 proteins for CG methylation maintenance of the associated DNA. Loss of H1 restores heterochromatic DNA methylation in cdca7α cdca7β mutants, indicating that CDCA7α and CDCA7β mainly remodel H1-containing nucleosomes for methyltransferases to access DNA. Notably, in h1.1 h1.2 mutants, CG methylation shows a significant increase in centromeres, which reveals a new inhibitory role of H1 in DNA methylation maintenance within satellite repeat arrays. Centromeric DNA hypermethylation is lost in h1.1 h1.2 cdca7α cdca7β quadruple mutants, demonstrating that CDCA7α and CDCA7β can act independently of H1 to enhance MET1 activity at nucleosomes. Overall, these findings establish CDCA7α and CDCA7β as conserved regulators of DNA methylation within heterochromatin and centromeric satellite repeat arrays.",

          "abstract": "Biological systems can display diverse patterns of self-organization, even when built on conserved networks of interaction between molecular species. In these cases, reaction–diffusion equations provide a valuable tool to learn how new dynamics could emerge from quantitative tuning of parameters. Bringing these models into quantitative correspondence with biological data remains an outstanding challenge, especially when the data manifest heterogeneities that are difficult to account for mathematically. One particular example occurs in cell biology, where the membrane-bound regulatory protein RhoA interacts with the filamentous actin cortex in an activator–inhibitor loop. Though this core biochemical circuit is conserved across multiple cell types in different organisms, it produces different patterns of RhoA activity in different contexts, from traveling waves in starfish to transient pulses in Caenorhabditis elegans . To understand how this variation emerges, we develop an activator–inhibitor model that accounts explicitly for actin assembly and heterogeneity. By fitting the model to summary statistics of experimental data, subject to known parameter constraints, we show that F-actin assembly dynamics tune the spatiotemporal patterns of RhoA activity. A minimal representation of these dynamics reveals how directional transport (via polymerization) combines with stochasticity in F-actin number and orientation to produce the observed patterns. This work sheds light on how phenotypic diversity arises from heterogeneity and anisotropy, with important implications for the next generation of activator–inhibitor models.",

          "abstract": "Noninvasive electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) is a valuable tool for localizing and imaging brain activity, with significant potential to aid presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy (fDRE) patients. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, including interictal spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and seizures, each offer unique capabilities in estimating the epileptogenic zone (EZ). However, there is a limited quantitative understanding of how these biomarkers differ in source-imaging precision, requiring distinct processing pipelines. Here, we developed a spatial–temporal–spectral imaging (STSI) framework for precision source imaging, and quantitatively evaluated various epilepsy biomarkers for source imaging in 2,081 individual events (spikes, HFOs, and seizures) from a cohort of 42 fDRE patients, comparing results to clinical ground truth such as surgical resection outcomes and intracranial EEG-defined seizure onset zones. The STSI enabled quantitative comparisons across key EEG epilepsy-related biomarkers, with averaged localization errors of 6.67 mm for seizures, 8.73 mm for HFOs overlapping with spikes (pHFO), 10.28 mm for HFO-riding spikes (pSpike), 19.59 mm for general spikes (aSpike), and 36.53 mm for general HFOs (aHFO), respectively, for seizure-free patients. These findings indicate that HFOs overlapping with spikes is the most spatially accurate interictal biomarker for mapping the EZ. The proposed STSI framework not only establishes a unified analysis approach for epileptic biomarkers to enhance presurgical planning in focal drug-resistant epilepsy, but could also generalize as a versatile tool for mapping event-related potentials, neural oscillations, and dynamic brain states, within a single framework to advance cognitive neuroscience research and clinical management of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

          "abstract": "The Amazon is a key climate system component, hotspot of biodiversity and many other ecosystem functions. However, progressive rainforest degradation, driven by anthropogenic climate change and land-use change, is increasing the risk of a large-scale critical ecosystem transition. Previous studies highlight forest vulnerability to isolated or combined climate change and land-use pressures, but have not disentangled individual driver contributions. This crucial knowledge gap needs to be addressed for a holistic understanding of the risks that the rainforest is facing. Combining Earth System Model data with a robust detection and attribution framework, we assess forest decline under individual and combined pressures of climate change and land-use change. We assess abrupt shifts and nonlinearities in local and basin-wide forest decline to reveal signs of resilience loss and potentially imminent forest transitions. We identify land-use change as the dominant driver of past degradation, accounting for 80% of the historical (1950 to 2014) forest decline. Future projections reveal that up to 38% of the mid-20th century forest area could be lost by 2100, with 25% caused by continued deforestation and 13% caused by unmitigated global warming. Importantly, the risk of abrupt rather than gradual forest decline increases as global warming progresses, with a strong nonlinear trend beyond a threshold of 2.3°. These findings highlight a substantial risk of a large-scale transition, with potentially devastating consequences for the global climate system, regional water and carbon cycles, human livelihoods, and biodiversity. Limiting this risk requires rigorous forest protection and climate mitigation in line with the Paris Agreement.",

Here, we designed a task where participants mentally built sequences with nested, multidepth structures by recursively applying a fixed set of rules. Using magnetoencephalography, we find that the brain constructs nested hierarchies through rapid neural sequences that perform two recurring generative operations. The first operation identifies the hierarchy depth of a symbol and is associated with increased ripple-band power; while the second arranges the symbol into its correct order at that level, a process that scales with the number of depths, also positively correlated with planning time. These results reveal a fundamental neural computation for transforming sensory information into structured representations, which is essential for higher-order cognition.",

Here, we obtain fluctuation theorems within an autonomous framework in which S exchanges energy with a reversible work source, R . The two subsystems, R and S , interact with one another as they evolve under Hamiltonian or stochastic dynamics, without external intervention. In this setting, we must account for the backaction of S on R , which is absent in the nonautonomous setting.

          "abstract": "Store-operated Ca 2+ entry is a key signaling pathway controlled by the interaction of the ER Ca 2+ sensor STIM1 with the Orai1 Ca 2+ channel following ER Ca 2+ depletion. To avoid generating pathological effects, STIM1 must remain mostly inactive under resting, ER-replete conditions yet respond rapidly and reversibly to changes in ER Ca 2+ content. It is not well understood how these conflicting requirements are met. Here we combine single-molecule FRET measurements of full-length dimeric STIM1 in lipid membranes with an AlphaFold2 structural model to describe the structure and regulation of the resting state. We show that STIM1 activity is controlled by the combined operation of four relatively weak restraints, or brakes. The Ca 2+ -bound EF-SAM luminal domain acts as a steric restraint to inhibit spontaneous activity. In the cytosolic region, the domain-swapped hydrophobic interaction and alignment of CC1α1 with CC3 of the CRAC activation domain (CAD) positions the apex of CAD next to the ER membrane, where electrostatic lipid–protein interactions further stabilize the inactive conformation. A fourth brake is created by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the two CC1α2/3 domains attached to the base of CAD. Disruption of any one of these brakes triggers spontaneous STIM1 activation, showing that the concerted action of these relatively weak restraints serves to minimize spontaneous activity in resting cells with full ER Ca 2+ stores, while allowing rapid activation in response to changes in store content.",

          "abstract": "P2X receptors, a family of ATP-activated ion channels, encompass subtypes P2X1–7, which are expressed in both homo- and heterotrimeric forms across various tissues. These receptors play crucial roles in pathophysiological processes such as synaptic transmission, nociception, cough, and taste perception. Extracellular ATP exists as both MgATP 2− and ATP 4− , with P2X3 responding to both. The evolutionary rationale for two nearly identical ligands and their distinct signaling potential remains unclear. While previous structural studies suggest a uniform ATP recognition mechanism for two endogenous ATP forms, we propose that MgATP 2− and ATP 4− activate P2X3 through distinct mechanisms, leading to differential physiological and pathological outcomes. Using mutagenesis, voltage-clamp fluorometry, and small molecule interventions, we identify divergent interactions of ATP 4− and MgATP 2− with P2X3, despite binding to the same orthosteric pocket. In P2rx3 D158A/D158A transgenic mice, which selectively impair MgATP 2− activation, we find that MgATP 2− modulates ammonia-induced cough frequency without affecting complete Freund’s adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain or sweet taste preference. P2rx3 −/− mice show deficits in all three responses. The allosteric inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid selectively modulates ATP 4− and MgATP 2− effects, resulting in distinct antitussive and analgesic outcomes in vivo. These findings uncover a mechanism of P2X3 activation by its endogenous ligands, diverging from previous structural models and resembling the biased activation mechanisms observed in G-protein-coupled receptors, offering insights for P2X3-targeted therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Water microdroplets offer a chemical environment that can dramatically accelerate reaction rates compared to bulk-phase solutions and even drive chemical transformations not found in bulk solutions. While mass spectrometry has proven indispensable for studying microdroplet chemistry, current methods rely on ensemble-averaged data from polydisperse droplet populations, obscuring the molecular details and droplet-size dependencies of reactions in individual droplets. Here, we present a piezoelectric-driven droplet-on-demand platform that enables direct mass spectrometric analysis of single, size-controlled microdroplets. We demonstrate a broad range of reactions occurring within isolated droplets. These reactions yield products comparable to those generated in conventional spray-based microdroplet systems, confirming that enhanced reactivity is intrinsic to the microdroplet environment. Crucially, we reveal a pronounced droplet-size-dependent reactivity, with smaller droplets exhibiting markedly higher activity per unit surface area. This consistent trend across different reaction types underscores the pivotal role of curvature-modulated interfacial electric fields in governing microdroplet reaction dynamics. Higher electric field strengths cause more radicals to be formed, but these radicals recombine with one another, removing them for reactions with other substrates. Consequently, as our experimental data show, there is an optimum droplet size to yield the highest product reaction rate.",

While growing evidence highlights the central role of CD103 + T cells in shaping the immune landscape of regional tissues, mechanisms driving the cell differentiation in LN remain largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an increased frequency of CD4 + CD103 + T cells within the kidneys of SLE patients. Importantly, glomerular endothelial cells (ECs) from human LN tissues were found to promote the differentiation of CD4 + CD103 + T cells by upregulating B lymphocyte–induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1). Genetic knockdown of Blimp-1 in CD4 + T cells resulted in a reduced frequency of renal CD4 + CD103 + T cells and alleviated LN in humanized SLE chimeras. Mechanistically, LN-associated ECs, triggered by circulating DNA from SLE patients, exhibited elevated CD38 expression via the cGAS-STING signaling pathway. This facilitated the transfer of CD38 into CD4 + T cells through an exosome-dependent mechanism, leading to the depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) levels in CD4 + T cells. The resulting NAD + depletion impaired the PARP1-mediated ADP-ribosylation of early growth response protein 1 (EGR1), which, in turn, enhanced Blimp-1 transcription and promoted CD103 + T cell differentiation. Targeting the cGAS/STING-CD38-EGR1 axis effectively reduced renal CD103 + T cell accumulation and inhibited LN progression in humanized SLE chimeras. Thus, ECs facilitate NAD + depletion to drive CD103 + T cell differentiation, presenting a cellular mechanism underlying LN pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management of human LN.",

We begin by examining the legacy of Nikolai Vavilov, who pioneered the improvement of crops such as wheat and beans by hybridizing them with their wild relatives. This strategy used wild species biodiversity to introduce new genetic variation into crops, making them more resilient and productive. Its adoption around the world greatly increased food security and brought lasting benefits to humanity. However, since the 1990 s, well-intentioned laws shifted the governance of biodiversity from a shared global resource to the sovereign control of nation states, with serious unintended consequences. These changes have disrupted the collection, preservation, exchange, and use of biodiversity, all of which are central to Vavilov’s strategy for crop improvement and to biodiversity science more broadly. Efforts at reform have been frustrated as the issues became moralized, inhibiting the open dialogue needed for change. Using foundational concepts shared by science and good governance, we propose seven empirically grounded principles for reform, to help realign biodiversity governance with its intended aims. We then illustrate one possible framework—underpinned by global financing to protect biodiversity hotspots—that would align incentives and work in synergy with the principles to foster practical reform. The principles, together with frameworks that align incentives, would create the conditions for stronger biodiversity conservation and research, agricultural development, global food security, and all the associated benefits to humanity.",

However, whether these regions employ distinct coding strategies for different social stimuli remains unclear. Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings in freely interacting mice, we show that although both regions respond to social cues, they engage divergent neural coding mechanisms. During social interaction, the mPFC predominately recruits high gamma oscillations with amplitudes modulated by the phase of theta oscillations, whereas the vHPC primarily depends on low gamma activity phase-locked to theta rhythms. Information-theoretic and machine learning analyses demonstrate that neural populations in the mPFC encode social information more robustly than those in the vHPC. Moreover, integrating spiking activity with local field potential oscillations enhances decoding accuracy compared to spike-only models. Neural manifold analysis showed greater signal-noise angle in the mPFC compared to the vHPC, indicating more discriminative and stable social representations in the mPFC.

          "abstract": "Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant research attention in algorithm design and perception applications. However, their potential in the decision-making domain, particularly in model-based reinforcement learning, remains underexplored. In reinforcement learning, a world model refers to a predictive model that learns the environment’s dynamics and enables agents to simulate future trajectories in a latent space, thereby improving sample efficiency and long-horizon planning. The difficulty lies in the need for spiking neurons with long-term temporal memory capabilities, as well as network optimization that can integrate and learn information for accurate predictions. The dynamic dendritic information integration mechanism of biological neurons brings us valuable insights for addressing these challenges. In this study, we propose a multicompartment neuron model capable of nonlinearly integrating information from multiple dendritic sources to dynamically process long sequential inputs. Based on this model, we construct a spiking world model (Spiking-WM), which integrates a spiking state-space model, a spiking convolutional encoder, and a fully connected spiking network for policy learning, to enable model-based deep reinforcement learning with SNNs. We evaluated our model using the DeepMind Control Suite, demonstrating that Spiking-WM outperforms existing SNN-based models and achieves performance comparable to artificial neural network-based world models employing Gated Recurrent Units. Furthermore, we assess the long-term memory capabilities of the proposed model in speech datasets, including Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset, Texas Instruments/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus, and LibriSpeech 100h, showing that our multicompartment neuron model surpasses other SNN-based architectures in processing long sequences.",

          "abstract": "Innate immunity provides the critical first line of defense against infection and sterile triggers. Inflammatory cell death is a key component of the innate immune response to clear pathogens, but excessive or aberrant cell death can induce inflammation, cytokine storm, and pathology, making it a central molecular mechanism in inflammatory diseases. Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one such inflammatory disease, and the specific innate immune mechanisms driving pathology in this context remain unclear. Here, by leveraging RNA-seq and protein expression analyses in tissues from clinical samples, we identified increased expression of the innate immune sensor ZBP1 in patients with ALD. ZBP1 expression correlated with ALD progression in patients and that ethanol induced ZBP1-dependent lytic cell death, PANoptosis, in immune (macrophages, monocytes, and Kupffer cells) and nonimmune cells (hepatocytes). Mechanistically, the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF9 and IRF1 upregulated basal ZBP1 expression. Activation of ZBP1 led to PANoptosis via caspase-8 and cell membrane rupture through NINJ1, independent of gasdermin D, gasdermin E, and MLKL. In mouse models of ALD, ZBP1-deficient mice were significantly protected from disease pathology and liver damage. Furthermore, the expressions of ZBP1 and NINJ1 were upregulated in both liver and serum samples from patients with ALD, implicating these molecules as potential biomarkers. Overall, our findings establish the critical role of the IRF–ZBP1–caspase-8–NINJ1 axis in driving inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, suggesting that targeting these molecules will have therapeutic potential in ALD and other inflammatory conditions.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to exacerbate infectious diseases, yet the climate sensitivity of zoonotic diseases (driven by spillover from animal reservoirs) is understudied compared to vector-borne and water-borne infections. To address this gap, we conducted a scoping review and quantitative synthesis to identify relationships between climatic indicators (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and zoonotic disease risk metrics worldwide. We identified 218 studies from 65 countries describing 852 measures across 53 diseases, with most studies testing linear (n = 193) rather than nonlinear (n = 28) relationships. We found evidence of climate sensitivity across diverse zoonotic diseases (significant nonzero relationships in 69.1% of temperature effects, 63.5% of precipitation effects, and 53.6% of humidity effects), but with variation in direction and strength. Positive effects of temperature and rainfall on disease risk were more common than negative effects (46.5% vs. 22.6% and 37.8% vs. 25.7% of all records, respectively). These studies were predominantly located in areas expected to have substantial increases in annual mean temperature (&gt;1.5 °C in 97% of studies) and rainfall (&gt;25 mm in 53% of studies) by 2041 to 2070. Notably, the most consistent relationship was between temperature and vector-borne zoonoses (56% of positive effects, mean Hedges’ g = 0.36). Our analyses provide evidence that climate sensitivity is common across zoonoses, likely leading to substantial yet complex effects of climate change on zoonotic burden. We emphasize the need for future studies to utilize biologically relevant models, apply rigorous space-time controls, consider causal perspectives, and address taxonomic and geographic biases to allow robust consensus of climate–risk relationships to emerge.",

Although intensively studied, inactivating miRNAs in vivo is particularly challenging, especially in the brain.

Focusing on miR-124, a miRNA highly expressed in the mammalian brain and transcribed from three independent chromosomal loci, we designed and validated different guide RNAs. In vivo, our CRISPR-Cas9 designs strongly downregulate miR-124 levels without affecting the expression of other miRNAs. As a result, levels of endogenous miR-124 targets exhibit a significant increase supporting the release of its silencing activity. We provide evidence that specific deletion of miR-124 in neural stem cells of the subventricular zone altered migration of newly generated neurons into the olfactory bulb. We also showed that our vectors modified the Ca 2+ permeability of AMPA receptors, a robust functional output downstream of miR-124. We also extended our approach to other miRNAs, mammalian species, and Cas9 proteins, confirming the versatility of CRISPR-Cas9. These tool properties support their potential for elucidating miRNA functions in complex experimental in vivo settings such as brain networks.",

          "abstract": "The middle ear of mammals is a major functional innovation, distinctive in that it is detached from the mandible and has a tympanic membrane supported by a ring-like ectotympanic. These novelties of the middle ear have enabled modern mammals to develop more sensitive hearing than all other tetrapods, especially at higher frequencies. Fossils from recent decades have clarified the evolution of the detached middle ear from the jaw bones of Paleozoic therapsids and Mesozoic cynodonts, and the evolution of the tympanum. These discoveries make it possible to answer important questions about the functional significance of these features. Here, we evaluate the relative hearing efficacy of a well-known cynodont precursor to mammals, Thrinaxodon liorhinus . Using finite element analysis (FEA), we calculated the harmonic response of the Thrinaxodon ear to bone-conducted and airborne sound and estimated the sound pressure level (SPL) at the stapedial footplate across a broad range of frequencies. We provide evidence that airborne sound received at the tympanum was the most effective mode of sound reception in Thrinaxodon . In contrast, bone conducted sound through the mandibular bones barely met our estimated hearing threshold. Our findings suggest that, like modern mammals, cynodonts were already reliant on a soft tissue tympanum to receive airborne sound, albeit with limited sensitivity to high frequencies. This is a detailed biomechanical evaluation of tympanum function in the cynodont predecessors of mammals and yields insight into the sequence of functional innovations during the evolution of mammal hearing.",

While events behind IS formation in T cells are well understood, the organization of IS components at the DC membrane remains ill-defined. Galectins modulate immune responses via glycan-(in)dependent interactions but the molecular mechanisms underlying their function in DC–mediated T cell activation, are poorly described. Here, we demonstrate that intracellular galectin-9 (gal9) in DCs is required for CD4 + T cell activation through its interaction with the HLA-DR alpha- and beta- cytoplasmic domains, as supported by coimmunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and NMR analyses. Live-cell imaging revealed gal9-depleted DCs fail to establish stable ISs with T cells, reducing T cell activation and proliferation. Notably, HLA-DR membrane lateral mobility and recruitment to the IS was diminished in DCs lacking gal9. Conditional gal9 knockout in DCs led to enhanced tumor growth in vivo, underscoring a role for gal9 in T cell–dependent antitumor immunity. Collectively, this study reports gal9-mediated HLA-DR organization at the DC synapse, uncovering a mechanism through which intracellular galectins coordinate immune receptor positioning to enhance CD4 + T cell activation.",

Effective diagnosis requires a knowledge of the genetic architecture of HI, which is often lacking. We established a cohort of 450 unrelated patients with familial (at least two affected relatives) severe-to-profound bilateral prelingual HI in five countries with high consanguinity rates: Tunisia, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania (the TJAMM cohort). Recessive and dominant inheritance were observed in 92% and 8% of cases, respectively; 14% were syndromic. Genome analysis detected 211 different mutations (36% not reported before) in 49 deafness genes, and fully resolved 90% of cases of autosomal recessive isolated deafness (DFNB forms), 89% of the mutations being homozygous. The deafness genes involved were similar in different countries, but their mutations, except a few in GJB2 and LRTOMT , differed considerably, suggesting an overrepresentation of private mutations. Biallelic missense mutations in MYO7A , CDH23 , PCDH15 , USH1C cause either DFNB forms or Usher syndrome type 1 (USH1) ( USH1/DFNB genes). Such mutations were overrepresented (13% of patients), highlighting the importance of distinguishing between these two mutation classes. We hypothesized that current difficulties might stem from the misclassification of certain mutations. By studying the 65 USH1/DFNB missense mutations reported to cause DFNB in the homozygous state, we identified some that, when associated with a loss-of-function mutation, resulted in USH1, a characteristic pattern of some recessive hypomorphic mutations. This reappraised classification of USH1/DFNB mutations has the potential to improve molecular diagnosis and patient management significantly.",

The β-blocker carvedilol inhibits EGF-promoted JB6 transformation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Since carvedilol suppresses overactivated ryanodine receptors (RyRs) independently of its adrenergic blocking effects, we hypothesized that EGF-promoted transformation requires RyR-mediated calcium (Ca 2+ ) release and that carvedilol inhibits transformation via targeting RyRs. All RyR subtypes were present in epidermis and strongly upregulated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, as demonstrated in an RyR2-tdTomato reporter mouse model. In vitro, EGF induced ERK phosphorylation and RyR2 upregulation and increased RyR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CMC)-evoked Ca 2+ release, which is inhibitable by structurally divergent RyR stabilizers and inhibitors of MAPK and PLC, but not by most β-blockers. Expression of constitutively active K-RAS and MEK-1 or UV also potentiated 4-CMC-evoked Ca 2+ release. RyR agonists and the Ca 2+ ionophore ionomycin promoted JB6 transformation while RyR stabilizers, the intracellular Ca 2+ chelator BAPTA/AM, and inhibitors of MAPK and PLC blocked transformation. The RyR shRNAs abolished the transformation-inhibitory effect of carvedilol. The IC 50 values of five carvedilol derivatives for suppressing RyR-mediated Ca 2+ release positively correlated with the IC 50 values for transformation inhibition. In vivo, UV-induced DNA damage and skin inflammation were enhanced by topical 4-CMC treatment but attenuated in the RyR2-E4872Q knock-in mice in which RyR2 activity is reduced. Human skin tissue microarray analysis confirmed spatial colocalization of phospho-ERK and RyR2 in the same tumor areas. Thus, potentiation of RyR-mediated Ca 2+ release by MAPK is an important pathway leading to carcinogenesis.",

The role of centromere clustering in driving large-scale changes in structural and functional chromatin assembly remains unclear. Here, using Hi-C and superresolution microscopy, we show that cell cycle-dependent centromere declustering and clustering states in Cryptococcus neoformans drive global changes in the 3D genome architecture. Centromeres and telomeres are scattered around the nuclear periphery at interphase G1 , and this arrangement constrains the interarm interactions within a chromosome, providing a unique interphase G1 chromosome organization. Moreover, centromeres and telomeres are organized as separate compartments, segregating them from active euchromatic regions. Polymer modeling reveals that the transition from the unclustered to clustered centromere state during the cell cycle involves changes from a globular to an elongated chromosome architecture. Strikingly, while clustered centromeric regions replicate early in most yeasts, C. neoformans centromeres replicate late in S-phase, hinting at a possible link between centromere clustering dynamics and CEN DNA replication timing.

We found that while osteopontin/insulin-like growth factor 1 overexpression (to enhance axon regeneration) or neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation (to build a relay) alone failed to restore the interrupted spinal circuitry, the double treatment facilitated the integration of NSCs into the host spinal network, significantly promoting axonal regeneration and synapse formation. Behavioral assessments demonstrated that the addition of CLP290, a KCC2 agonist, to the combined treatment markedly improved hindlimb locomotion, as evidenced by higher Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scores and enhanced joint oscillation in fine locomotion analysis.

          "abstract": "UBB +1 , a ubiquitin variant protein resulting from a frameshift in the ubiquitin-B gene, is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). At the cellular level, UBB +1 disrupts the ubiquitin–proteasome system while inducing autophagy. Notably, UBB +1 itself is secreted via autophagosome-like vesicles. Here, we demonstrate that UBB +1 can be removed from the cell by degradative and secretory autophagy. Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)/p62 functions as a pivotal ubiquitin receptor for UBB +1 , recognizing its ubiquitin domain and facilitating loading into autophagosomes. Oligomerization of SQSTM1/p62 was critical to isolate UBB +1 in bodies preventing its aggregation. Intriguingly, both gain- and loss-of-function SQSTM1/p62 suppressed UBB +1 secretion, causing intracellular retention: SQSTM1/p62 knockout led to UBB +1 accumulation in insoluble aggregates, while its overexpression promoted the formation of p62-UBB +1 bodies. We further identified distinct roles for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in secretory autophagy of UBB +1 . Specifically, the R-SNARE SEC22B and the Q-SNAREs Syntaxin-4 and SNAP23 participated in UBB +1 exocytosis. Disruption of SEC22B impaired the fusion of UBB +1 -containing autophagosomes with the plasma membrane, reducing UBB +1 secretion without affecting its intracellular turnover. Inhibition of lysosomes partially stabilized UBB +1 indicating that degradation and secretion are complementary processes that determine the fate of UBB +1 . This study elucidates the dual roles of autophagy in managing neurotoxic proteins, highlighting SQSTM1/p62 as a key mediator of UBB +1 trafficking and secretion. Although ubiquitin typically acts as a degradation signal, our findings reveal a rare instance of a ubiquitin-related protein driving secretory autophagy.

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode “valleys” of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and original landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.",

          "abstract": "The ocean carbon cycle is directly impacted by storms in the atmosphere. Tropical cyclones (TCs), particularly, are known to drive intense air–sea CO 2 fluxes and to trigger phytoplankton blooms. However, the current generation of Earth system models (ESM) cannot realistically represent TCs due to their coarse spatial resolution (typically 100 to 200 km grid spacing). Here, we present a km-scale coupled, global, storm- and eddy-resolving (5 km ocean, 5 km atmosphere) ESM simulation including ocean biogeochemistry that is able to resolve TCs, and the cascade of physical-biogeochemical mechanisms that unfold in their response. Our simulated TCs enhance CO 2 fluxes by 20 to 40 times and cool the surface ocean by 2 to 3 ° C, thus contributing to inverting the CO 2 flux direction from ocean outgassing to uptake. Our TCs furthermore trigger a phytoplankton bloom in autumn in the western North Atlantic, which is missed by coarser ESMs. While TCs cool the ocean surface, they also warm the subsurface, thus causing counteracting impacts on temperature-dependent organic matter remineralization. In summary, our model configuration reproduces mechanisms underlying the ocean carbon cycle variability that remained so far unresolved in ESMs. By representing fine-scale atmosphere-ocean biogeochemistry interactions in our ESM, we pave the way for future work to constrain uncertainties in the role of km-scale events in the ocean carbon cycle at global and climatic scales.",

          "abstract": "Although considered primarily extracellular, Acinetobacter baumannii can survive and replicate within macrophages in vitro. Intracellular bacteria are often protected from the host immune system and antibiotic treatment, potentially leading to chronic or recurrent infections. To investigate the role of intracellular A. baumannii during infection, we transferred b roncho a lveolar l avage f luid (BALF) from infected mice, containing an intracellular bacterial population, into naïve immunocompromised mice, enabling us to assess the fate of bacteria following internalization. The BALF transfer resulted in A. baumannii lung infection, indicating that intracellular bacteria can egress from host immune cells and establish infection in the lungs, thereby acting as a transient reservoir during pulmonary infection. Using dual proteomics, we characterized the A. baumannii –macrophage interactions. Infected macrophages exhibit an inflammatory and type I interferon response, marked by increased Acod1/IRG1 protein levels. Intracellular A. baumannii upregulates proteins involved in evading nutritional immunity, stress response, surface modification, and metabolic adaptation. Collectively, these findings indicate that A. baumannii employs a multifactorial strategy to persist and replicate within macrophages, potentially shaping infection dynamics in vivo and undermining therapeutic efficacy.",

A major bioinformatical challenge is the inference of differentiation trajectories from a single snapshot, and methods that account for outlier cells that are unrelated to the differentiation process have yet to be established. We present MultistageOT ( https://github.com/dahlinlab/MultistageOT ), a generalized optimal transport-based framework that models cell differentiation in a single snapshot as a series of intermediate cell transitions. MultistageOT employs multiple transport stages to establish temporal progression within the snapshot—overcoming limitations with the classic bimarginal formulation of optimal transport. Moreover, our multistage framework uses global information across all cells and differentiation stages to infer coherent trajectories from initial to terminal states. This allows MultistageOT to infer individual outlier cells that are unrelated to the analyzed differentiation process—an essential mechanism for preventing the inference of spurious or biologically implausible trajectories. We benchmark MultistageOT on snapshot data of cell differentiation, showing significantly improved fate prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art bimarginal optimal transport and demonstrating MultistageOT’s unique ability to detect outlier cells.",

          "abstract": "Multi-nucleated cells exist in all domains of life, ranging from animals, plants, and fungi to single-celled organisms such as the slime mold Physarum polycephalum . The large cell size, in the case of Physarum reaching centimeters and more, challenges the coordination of nuclei activity as signals need to cross large distances. In search of a mechanism for fast long-ranged communication among nuclei, we quantify nuclei dynamics and cytoplasmic flows in Physarum ’s tubular network. We observe nuclei in two interchangeable, dynamic states: mobile, flowing within the cytoplasmic shuttle flow, or trapped in the tube’s porous cell cortex. As we find nuclei to accumulate at the tube’s inner fluid–porous interface we theoretically explore and confirm, with physiological parameters, that slowing down of mobile nuclei during flow is sufficient for diffusible signal exchange between mobile and trapped nuclei. We analytically derive that communication akin to pigeon post with mobile nuclei serving as pigeons shuttling between trapped nuclei acting as waypoints, gives rise to signaling velocities that account for the rapid intracellular reorganization observed in Physarum . Since signal transfer by flow-transported nuclei outcompetes the mere diffusion of signals encoded in cytosolic proteins, pigeon post communication surpasses alternative signaling mechanisms, even diffusive relay signaling up to 20-fold in velocity. The key ingredients of pigeon post communication, namely alternating flows and waypoints, exist in other multi-nucleated cells and may also be generalized beyond intracellular signaling.",

In contrast, when mice were generated in which the Treg compartment comprised a mix of IL-27R-sufficient and -deficient Treg cells, those that lacked IL-27R were at a competitive disadvantage. Aging experiments illustrate that IL-27R-deficient Treg cells are preferentially eroded, and this defect was associated with reduced expression of CD122, the β chain of the IL-2/15R. Moreover, blockade of CD122 led to a similar loss of Treg cells, and in vitro and in vivo studies highlight that IL-27 promotes Treg cell expression of CD122 and improves responsiveness to IL-2/15.

          "abstract": "The Southern Ocean plays an important role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing atmospheric CO 2 , aiding climate change mitigation. Antarctic coastal polynyas (ACPs) are key CO 2 uptake areas, yet whether this CO 2 is effectively sequestered as organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments, and the spatiotemporal dynamics and drivers of this process, remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct a high-resolution record of Holocene (~12,000 y BP) to present-day OC accumulation fluxes and sources in ACP sediments using existing data as well as our measurements. We find that despite covering only 3% of the Southern Ocean, ACPs account for approximately 42% of the modern OC accumulation across the Southern Ocean. Since the Holocene, OC accumulation has increased ninefold due to climate warming, largely driven by marine primary production. Structural equation modeling reveals that warming enhances the biological carbon pump and OC accumulation efficiency by expanding and prolonging open water areas in ACPs, with larger ACPs showing stronger feedback. Furthermore, basal melt from ice shelves releases fine particulate matter, further boosting OC accumulation. Our findings highlight that climate warming has greatly amplified ACPs’ carbon-sequestration efficiency, making them rapidly expanding and crucial carbon sinks in the Southern Ocean, with the potential to provide strong negative feedback in future climate change.",

Exogenous LGALSL administration reduced mechanical nociceptive thresholds by activating glutamatergic neurons in the ACC (ACC Glu ). Chemogenetic manipulations and functional assays revealed that neuron-derived LGALSL directly binds to vimentin on ACC astrocytes, activating those astrocytes. These activated astrocytes subsequently maintain ACC Glu hypersensitivity, driving mechanical hypersensitivity in diabetic rats. Blocking LGALSL–vimentin interactions with a synthetic peptide alleviated LGALSL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.

For this purpose, we devise a linear algebra–based tensor decomposition algorithm, which is more expressive but just as efficient and identifiable as other linear algebra–based algorithms.

However, identifying colimited growth has proved challenging due to a lack of appropriate methods. Here, we present the results of 12 experiments conducted across the South Pacific that used a matrix of nutrient additions to strongly diluted surface seawater. Dilution restricted both grazing rates and nutrient drawdown due to phytoplankton accumulation. We find that despite simultaneous depletion of nitrate, phosphate, and iron concentrations throughout the oligotrophic gyre, community-level phytoplankton growth rates were only constrained by nitrogen. In contrast, zones of colimitation and serial limitation by nitrogen and iron were found along the eastern gyre margin. At the nitrogen-iron co-/serially limited sites, growth response surfaces to nutrient additions varied, suggesting the need for dynamic models to accurately represent colimited phytoplankton growth in the ocean.",

Here, we used cryofocused ion beam scanning electron microscopy to prepare lamellae for cryoelectron tomography, enabling nanometer-scale imaging of its ultrastructure in near-native conditions. Our analysis revealed structures never before described in trypanosomatids, including an elaborate cytoskeletal network surrounding the flagellar pocket (FP), desmosome-like connections linking the FP membrane to the flagellum, and a cytopharyngeal-like invagination arising from the pocket. Luminal particles inside the FP were reconstructed in 3D, providing insight into their organization and potential role. The contractile vacuole complex was characterized by two bladders with distinct surface protein coats. Organelles of the biosynthetic and secretory pathways were also resolved, including the Golgi complex, ER exit sites, multivesicular bodies, and a novel multivesicular tubule. We also identified large, autophagosome-like organelles containing intraluminal vesicles and hemifused vesicles, structurally resembling hemifusomes recently described in mammalian cells. These structures, along with periodic striations observed in lipid-rich compartments, suggest conserved mechanisms of vesicle biogenesis. Finally, we describe the nuclear architecture, including well-preserved nuclear pores with defined subcomplexes, chromatin fibers resembling nucleosome arrays, and putative nuclear envelope–chromatin linkages. Together, these findings highlight the cellular complexity of P. confusum , providing insights into the evolution of cellular architecture within trypanosomatids and underscoring the potential of this organism as a model for high-resolution structural studies.",

Determining the cause of this rise is critical for reducing emissions and predicting future climate sensitivity. The carbon and hydrogen stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CH 4 is controlled by variability in isotopically distinguishable emission categories and fractionating sink processes. While most studies using atmospheric δ 13 C–CH 4 data suggest a dominantly microbial source for recent CH 4 growth, this understanding is not uniform, and uncertainties remain [S.

We conduct thorough uncertainty analyses to separate absolute magnitude and emission trend uncertainties and find with high confidence that trends in δ 13 C–CH 4 and δD–CH 4 observations are both consistent with an entirely microbial emission driver of the post-2006 CH 4 rise, while fossil fuel emissions have remained relatively stable.",

This classical phenomenon is known as Taylor–Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as active microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times. Combining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the effective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows—a widespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, e.g., regarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and dispersion of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae, within a rectangular microfluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using high-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we reconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and statistically analyze them through moment theory and sliding windowed demodulation. We find that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as the flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow periodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of Taylor–Aris law to active particles is valid.",

          "abstract": "Fluoride has long been known to possess antimicrobial properties. For many bacteria, the toxic effects of fluoride are reversible. However, fluoride has also been shown to trigger lysis and cell death in many other diverse bacterial species, including dental pathogens. The underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for fluoride-induced cell lysis have not been established. Using Streptococcus mutans as a model, we show that fluoride elicits an uncontrolled stress response characterized by upregulation of competence pathways and extensive cell wall degradation. While controlled and limited autolysis under stress is an adaptive response, we show that expression of the competence-associated alternative sigma factor ComX is prolonged under fluoride stress, relative to other stressors. Using in vitro and in vivo analyses, we show that fluoride disrupts the typical tight temporal control of ComX by specifically inhibiting assembly and activity of Clp ATPases responsible for its proteolytic degradation. Unchecked, ComX upregulates bacteriocins and autolysins, while simultaneously suppressing immunity peptide expression via a 6S RNA-mediated mechanism. Thus, fluoride subverts cellular mechanisms to turn off competence pathways that are induced under cellular stress, causing irreversible damage to the cell wall and ultimately cell death. Phenylalanine partially restores Clp protease assembly and activity, providing a rationale for the frequent presence of a gene encoding chorismate mutase in fluoride-responsive operons. Together, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism of fluoride-dependent lysis in bacteria, fifty years after this phenomenon was first reported. These pathways could be exploited to potentiate the antimicrobial effects of oral fluoride.",

Olfactory performance has been experimentally tested in only a few taxa, so comparative analyses rely on anatomical and genomic proxies. Among anatomical proxies, the olfactory bulb endocast is widely used, particularly in extinct species, where it is often the only preserved proxy and can be reconstructed even in million-year-old fossils. While the functional significance of chemoreceptor genes has received attention, the extent to which the olfactory bulb endocast correlates with genomic proxies remains unclear. Using brain endocasts across all mammalian orders, we investigated the relationship between the absolute (absOB) and relative (relatOB) volumes of the olfactory bulb endocast and the number of intact chemoreceptor genes. While no clear correlations were found between absOB and the genomic proxies tested, we identified a significant correlation between relatOB and the total number of combined intact chemoreceptor genes (CombChemo), primarily driven by olfactory receptor genes (OR). Leveraging this correlation, and aiming to infer olfactory capabilities in taxa for which only the skull is available, we estimated OR numbers for three mammalian orders lacking genomic data, as well as for five extinct mammals. Building on studies that have established a link between intact OR and olfactory sensitivity and discrimination, we conclude that relatOB enables inference of olfactory capabilities in mammals. This provides a basis to investigate sensory evolution and opens perspectives for interpreting paleoecology and behavior of extinct mammals.",

We pooled data from 5,339 cases from China, Europe, Korea, Japan, and the United States to conduct the first transethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) on age of onset. Only one strong GWAS significant effect was observed across all ethnicities, summarized by the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*03:01, and centered around the coding region of this gene. In contrast, HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive heterodimer (DQ0602) dosage did not strongly affect onset, and other known narcolepsy-associated genetic loci had minor effects. The HLA-DQB1*03:01 effect (mean −3.47 y, P = 1.7 × 10 −18 ) showed no heterogeneity across ethnic groups and was independent of common allelic variation at HLA-DQA1 in cis of HLA-DQB1*03:01 (DQA1*03:03; DQA1*05:05; DQA1*06:01). This effect may be due to a peptide being presented by all DQ0301 heterodimers (which are tolerant at the P1 binding position), or it may stem from genetic effects of HLA on T cell receptor genes TCRA and TCRB usage that influence the TCR repertoire. Using bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data across Chinese and Caucasians, who have distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium around DQB1*03:01, we found that HLA-DQB1*03:01 alters TCR repertoire at specific positions, most significantly within the CDR2α, CDR2β, and CDR3β loops. These results illustrate the remarkable conservation of genetic effects in narcolepsy across ethnicity. The identification of the disease-causing T cells will be crucial for elucidating how this finding relates to the underlying pathophysiology.",

          "abstract": "Biofilms are critical for the environmental persistence, survival, and infectivity of Vibrio cholerae , the causative agent of cholera. Here, we find that GluP, a glutamate-specific TRAP-TAXI protein, is an uncharacterized matrix component that plays a critical role in biofilm architecture. Loss of GluP reduces biofilm corrugation, expands colony size, and disperses cells from microcolonies, arguing that this factor maintains biofilm structure and organization. While GluP does not affect the abundance or localization of known matrix proteins, its absence reduces Vibrio exopolysaccharide (VPS) production. We determined the crystal structure of GluP, which revealed that GluP binds glutamate, and its biofilm-related phenotypes depend on this binding capability. We further examined the role of GluP in V. cholerae growth under defined conditions where L-glutamate serves as a carbon source, nitrogen source, or both. GluP-deficient strains specifically showed reduced growth when glucose was the carbon source and glutamate the nitrogen source. This defect is dependent on glutamate binding by GluP and highlights its role in coordinating nutrient acquisition and biofilm formation. Importantly, both biofilm assembly and growth defects occurred independently of the predicted membrane component of the Glu TRAP-TAXI system, GluQM. These findings indicate that GluP plays a dual role in biofilm assembly and growth, providing insight into its functional importance in V. cholerae physiology.",

          "abstract": "The intracellular processing route used by type I conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) for cross-presentation of viral- or tumor-associated antigens remains controversial. One model proposes that captured antigens exit from damaged phagolysosomes and enter the cytosol, where they are processed for presentation by MHC class I molecules (MHC-I). This model relies on proteasomal degradation and TAP-dependent peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for loading by the peptide loading complex (PLC). An alternative model proposes a vesicular route in which captured antigens are retained and processed within an endocytic compartment. A compelling argument favoring the cytosolic model is the dramatic loss of cross-presentation by TAP-deficient cDC1, which presumes that peptides derived from phagocytosed cells require TAP for their transport into the ER to reach the PLC. However, here we show that cross-presentation by cDC1 is TAP-dependent because TAP is required for the normal trafficking of MHC-I molecules. Our work demonstrates that MHC-I must reach a post-Golgi compartment for loading in cross-presentation and that this process may occur independently of TAP.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) is commonly used for large-scale RNA synthesis in science and industry. Although T7 RNAP exhibits high processivity, its usage faces two major challenges: During initiation, the enzyme frequently aborts transcription, producing potentially immunogenic short RNA by-products; transient pausing during elongation facilitates premature termination, which leads to shorter transcripts and reduces the overall product yield. Here, we present a single-molecule high-throughput transcription assay using DNA curtains to study initiation, elongation, pausing, and termination of individual polymerases and examine what drives transcription aborts. We introduced two different promoter sites on the template DNA and found that transcription initiation is directly influenced by the DNA shape parameters of the initiation region downstream of the conserved promoter sequence. Furthermore, we showed that dimethyl sulfoxide can alleviate the effects of suboptimal initiation sequences. During elongation, we identified two sequence-dependent pause types that differ in length, of which the short pauses relate to ubiquitous pauses in bacterial polymerases. Longer pauses emerged by direct contact of the enzyme with a recognition motif on the template and were stabilized through interactions of the nascent RNA with the enzyme. These insights into transcriptional initiation and pausing highlight common impediments to the performance of the T7 RNAP transcription system.",

          "abstract": "Isoflavonoids, predominantly found in legumes, are specialized metabolites with antioxidant properties that benefit both plant resilience and human health. Using metabolic genome-wide association studies (mGWAS), we identified the cytochrome P450 gene ( Glyma.11g108300 ), GmIF6H1 , as a key determinant of glycitein biosynthesis in soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Biochemical assays together with in planta stable-isotope tracing demonstrated that GmIF6H1 catalyzes the 6-hydroxylation of daidzein, establishing a previously unrecognized and predominant biosynthetic route for glycitein. A single amino acid substitution in GmIF6H1 accounts for the domestication-associated reduction of glycitein-type isoflavonoids. Upon Phytophthora sojae infection, (malonyl)glycitins undergo sustained deglycosylation to release glycitein aglycone, underscoring its defensive role. Strikingly, both loss- and gain-of-function alleles increase susceptibility to P. sojae , indicating that precise tuning of GmIF6H1 expression is essential for effective resistance. Metabolite profiling further reveals complementary daidzein-centered defense strategies: Glycitein-type isoflavonoids (via daidzein 6-hydroxylation) function as phytoanticipins, whereas glyceollins (via daidzein 2’-hydroxylation) act as inducible phytoalexins. Together, these findings clarify the biosynthetic origin of the glycitein and underscore the synergistic action of glycitein and glyceollins in pathogen resistance, offering opportunities for engineering disease-resilient soybean cultivars.",

SPNS1 deficiency inhibits infection of EV-A71 and 9 of 11 examined enteroviruses. Mechanistically, the endo/lysosomal localization of SPNS1 and the acidification of the endo/lysosomes are essential for SPNS1 to support EV-A71 infection. SPNS1 deficiency inhibits EV-A71 genomic RNA replication, but barely affects replication of EV-A71 RNA directly transfected into the cytoplasm. SPNS1 interacts with the EV-A71 capsid protein VP1 and entry receptor SCARB2 in the endo/lysosomes, where it acts as a transporter to release the viral pocket factor into the cytosol, leading to uncoating. Animal experiments show that SPNS1 deficiency results in reduced viral loads, pathological effects, and lethality following EV-A71 infection.

Given that Archaea contribute significantly to global marine biomass, accounting for 0.3 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon in the oceans, we aimed to uncover how archaeal G1P is recycled by marine microorganisms. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining microbiology, biochemistry, and structural biology, we identified a G1P transporter in marine bacteria, which we named GpxB. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that GpxB belongs to the organic phosphonate transporter (PhnT) family and is widely distributed in the marine microbiome, found in approximately 5 to 10% of microbial cells in surface marine waters. Strikingly, we also identified a second G1P transporter, UgpB, that is known to transport G3P and belongs to the carbohydrate uptake transporter-1 (CUT1) family, in the model bacterium Phaeobacter sp. MED193. To explore the evolutionary pathways that led to the formation of G1P binding sites in both the PhnT and CUT1 families, we determined the structures of GpxB and UgpB bound to G1P and G3P. Using structure-guided mutagenesis and a comparative analysis of the binding pockets within the PhnT and CUT1 families, we traced their evolutionary trajectories, highlighting the distinct strategies through which G1P-binding sites developed in these two protein families.",

Such antagonism could have profound consequences on the fitness of species; however, the susceptibility determinants to even the most pervasive antagonistic factors in this ecosystem remain incompletely understood. Here, we screened for genetic factors that impact the susceptibility of Bacteroides to type VI secretion system (T6SS)-delivered toxins. This revealed that the Bte2 family of pore-forming toxins, which are widespread in B. fragilis and other human gut-associated Bacteroidales, strictly requires the H + /Na + -translocating ferredoxin:NAD + reductase (Rnf) electron transport chain within target cells in order to intoxicate. In Bacteroides , the precise metabolic role of the conserved Rnf pathway has not been defined. We establish that the Rnf complex is important for redox balancing within cells utilizing sugars derived from dietary fiber and is critical for fitness in vivo. Surprisingly, we find that while the intact Rnf membrane complex is required for Bte2 intoxication, Rnf-catalyzed electron transport is dispensable. We propose that the Rnf complex facilitates Bte2 membrane insertion, leading to intoxication via membrane depolarization. Our data suggest that T6SS toxins may avoid collateral damage within a complex ecosystem by recognizing discriminatory features of competitor species.",

          "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are a collection of subcortical nuclei involved in motor control, sensorimotor integration, and procedural learning. They play a key role in the acquisition and adaptation of movements, a process driven by dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal projections, which serve as BG input. However, BG output is not necessary for executing many well-learned movements. This raises a fundamental question: How can plasticity at BG input contribute to the acquisition and adaptation of movements which execution does not require BG output? Existing models of BG function often neglect the feedback dynamics within cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical circuitry and do not capture the interaction between the cortex and BG in movement generation and adaptation. In this work, we address the above question in a theoretical model of the BG-thalamo-cortical multiregional network, incorporating anatomical, physiological, and behavioral evidence. We examine how its dynamics influence the execution and reward-based adaptation of reaching movements. We demonstrate how the BG-thalamo-cortical network can shape cortical motor output through the combination of three mechanisms: i) the diverse dynamics emerging from its closed-loop architecture, ii) attractor dynamics driven by recurrent cortical connections, and iii) reinforcement learning via dopamine-dependent cortico-striatal plasticity. Our study highlights the role of the cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical feedback in efficient visuomotor adaptation. It also suggests a mechanism for early-stage acquisition of reaching movements through motor babbling. More generally, our model explains how the BG-cortical network refines motor output through its intricate closed-loop dynamics and dopamine-dependent plasticity at cortico-striatal synapses.",

We find that electroconvection can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We uncover the fundamental mechanism of electroconvection during pore charging through an analytical model that predicts the induced flow field and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection is especially important in the limit of slender pores with thin electric double layers, and becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.",

Here, we develop a high-resolution time-correlated single-photon-counting lidar and apply it to observe cloud microphysical properties at one-centimeter range resolution in a convection chamber under well-controlled conditions. Together with concurrent in-situ measurements and theoretical analysis, our lidar observations indicate that although turbulent mixing tends to homogenize the cloud in the bulk region, entrainment and sedimentation cause inhomogeneities in droplet concentrations near the cloud top. Specifically, the topmost region is directly affected by entrainment, and lidar profiles show clear evidence of entrained air and detrained cloud filament. The transition region below exhibits vertical size sorting of cloud droplets caused by sedimentation. Our results suggest that using a single sedimentation velocity for all cloud droplets, as is done in many atmospheric models, overlooks key physics relevant to the microphysical structure near the cloud top. Our conceptual model used to describe these measurements can serve as a step toward improving the current modeling of processes in the cloud top region.",

Despite 80% of individuals with DM1 experiencing GI dysfunction that affects their daily life, the mechanisms of GI dysmotility in DM1 remain an understudied aspect of the disease. DM1 is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene that, when expressed as an expanded CUG repeat RNA, sequesters and reduces the activity of the muscleblind-like (MBNL) RNA-binding protein family. We developed a mouse line with conditional, smooth muscle-specific knockout of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 to model and investigate myogenic mechanisms contributing to GI dysmotility in DM1. Mice with Mbnl knockout exhibited delayed GI transit of small and large bowel in vivo and increased smooth muscle contractile tone of jejunum and colon segments ex vivo. Smooth muscle from the jejunum and colon showed no histopathology suggesting an intrinsic defect and contained increased phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chain (Mlc20), consistent with increased contraction. RNA sequencing of mouse and human DM1 GI samples enriched for smooth muscle revealed conserved misregulated alternative splicing of transcripts associated with the regulation of Mlc20 phosphorylation and smooth muscle contraction. These findings demonstrate that Mbnl knockout disrupts the regulation of contraction dynamics and causes GI smooth muscle hyperactivity, suggesting that therapeutics that reduce GI contractile activity may improve DM1 GI symptoms.",

Although anatomical, molecular, and genetic approaches have revealed diverse SCN cell types, how network-level wiring enables their synchronization remains unclear. To overcome the challenges of inferring functional connectivity from fixed tissue, we developed Mutual Information &amp; Transfer Entropy (MITE), an information-theoretic framework to infer directed cell–cell connections with high fidelity from long-term live-cell imaging. Recording and analyzing 3,290 h of clock gene expression from 8,261 SCN neurons across 17 mice, we uncovered a highly conserved, sparse SCN network organized into two asymmetrically coupled modules: dorsal and ventral. Connectivity analyses revealed five functional SCN cell types independent of neurochemical identity. Notably, only ~30% of vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons exhibited Hub-like connectivity, classifying them as Generators and Broadcasters of synchrony signals. Other spatially stereotyped cell types consistently identified as Bridges, Receivers, or Sinks. Simulations based on MITE-inferred connectomes recapitulated emergent SCN dynamics, including recovery from desynchrony and the daily dorsal-to-ventral phase wave of gene expression. Together, these results demonstrate that MITE enables precise mapping of cellular network topology, revealing the circuit logic and key cell types that mediate circadian synchrony across space and time in the mammalian SCN.",

Mitochondria are positioned with 2–3 μm precision relative to synaptic and structural features, with systematic differences across neuron types and compartments. Mitochondrial localization correlates with regional activity and postsynaptic targets. Analysis of a mouse visual cortex connectome confirms cell-type specific morphology and identifies partially divergent positioning rules. These results establish mitochondria as circuit-embedded organelles whose distribution links subcellular architecture to brain connectivity.",

          "abstract": "AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are multimodal transducers of glutamatergic signals throughout the brain. Their diversity is exemplified in the cerebellum; at afferent synapses, AMPARs mediate high-frequency excitation, whereas in Bergmann glia (BG) they support calcium transients that modulate synaptic transmission. This spectrum arises from different combinations of core subunits (GluA1-4), auxiliary proteins, and post-transcriptional modifications. Here, using mass-spectrometry, cryo-EM, and electrophysiology, we characterize major cerebellar AMPARs in pig: calcium-impermeable GluA2/A4 heteromers with four TARP subunits, mainly neuronal in origin, and BG-specific calcium-permeable GluA1/A4 heteromers containing two Type-2 TARPs. We also showed that GluA4 receptors consistently exhibit compact N-terminal domains that promote their synaptic delivery. Our study defines the organizational principles of mammalian cerebellar AMPAR complexes and reveals how different receptor subtypes support cell-type specific functions.",

Here, we report the observation of Shapiro steps in periodically driven Josephson junctions between strongly interacting Fermi superfluids of ultracold atoms. The height and the width of the observed quantized plateaus in the current-potential characteristics mirror the external drive frequency and the junction nonlinear response. Direct measurements of the current-phase relationship showcase how Shapiro steps arise from the synchronization between the relative phase of the two reservoirs and the external drive. Such a mechanism is further supported by the detection of periodic phase-slippage processes, in the form of vortex-antivortex pairs. Our results are corroborated by a circuital model and numerical simulations.

Our results demonstrate that partitioning of water into bridgmanite is strongly enhanced by increasing temperature. Thus, appreciable amounts of water may have been retained in the lower mantle after its crystallization.

HLF simultaneously up-regulated tissue retention receptors, down-regulated tissue egress receptors, and promoted proinflammatory CD4 + T RM cells by inducing Bhlhe40 , and all of these processes were associated with changes in chromatin accessibility. Genetic deletion of Hlf inhibited CD4 + T RM cell generation and ameliorated airway tissue inflammation in vivo.

Through an unbiased, imaging-based small interfering RNA screen that targeted all 204 known and putative human nucleases, we identified a previously uncharacterized cytoplasmic endonuclease, NEDD4-binding protein 2 (N4BP2), that enters ruptured micronuclei and initiates DNA damage, leading to chromosome fragmentation. N4BP2 promoted genome rearrangements (including chromothripsis), formation of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in drug-induced gene amplification, tumorigenesis, and tumor cell proliferation in an induced model of human high-grade glioma.

Beetle antennae contain infrared-activated neurons with thermosensitive ion channels that are structurally tuned to match host plant thermogenesis. Comparative analyses revealed that infrared is among the earliest pollination signals, and indicate a deep-time transition from infrared-based to color-dominated signaling in flowering plants.

Knockout of CsARF3 resulted in an androecious phenotype with only male flowers, whereas overexpression of CsARF3 led to increased number of female flowers. CsARF3 promotes femaleness by directly stimulating the expression of meristem maintenance gene CsSTM , and repressing the activity of gynoecious gene CsWIP1 .

During purine salvage, NUDT5 suppresses DNPB independently of its catalytic function but rather through interaction with phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the DNPB pathway. The NUDT5-PPAT interaction promoted PPAT oligomerization, suppressed PPAT’s enzymatic activity, and facilitated disassembly of the purinosome, a metabolon that functions in DNPB.

          "abstract": "Flexibility and stability of neuronal ensembles are crucial features of brain function. Little is known about how these properties of local circuits are influenced by long-range inputs. We show, in mice, that lateral entorhinal cortex glutamatergic (LEC GLU ) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–ergic (LEC GABA ) projections to CA3 recruit specific microcircuits that conjunctively provide stability to neuronal ensembles, thereby supporting learning. LEC GLU drives excitation in CA3 but also substantial feedforward inhibition that prevents somatic and dendritic spikes. Conversely, LEC GABA suppresses this local inhibition to disinhibit CA3 activity with compartment and pathway specificity by selectively boosting somatic output to integrated LEC GLU and CA3 recurrent inputs. This synergy allows the stabilization of spatial representations relevant to learning, as both LEC GLU and LEC GABA control the formation and maintenance of CA3 place cells across contexts and over time.",

Structural studies on chlorophyll f–containing photosystem I could identify some chlorophyll f sites, but none among the photochemically active pigments, and thus concluded that chlorophyll f plays no photochemical role. Here, we report two cryo–electron microscopy structures of far-red photosystem I from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, allowing the assignment of eight chlorophyll f molecules, including the redox active A −1B . Simulations of absorption difference spectra induced by charge separation indicated that the experimental spectra can be reproduced only by considering the presence of a chlorophyll f at the A −1B site. The chlorophyll f locations, wavelength assignments, and conserved far-red–specific residues provide functional insights for efficient use of long-wavelength photons.",

          "abstract": "Online political discussions are often dominated by a small group of active users, while most remain silent. This visibility gap can distort perceptions of public opinion and fuel polarization. Using a collective field experiment on Reddit, we examined factors predicting self-selection into silent “lurker” and active “power-user” roles and tested whether participation differentials can be reduced with norm- or incentive-based interventions. We recruited 520 United States participants, randomly assigned them to conditions in six private communities, and asked them to discuss 20 political issues over 4 weeks while completing weekly surveys. Lurking (posting nothing) was most common among users who perceived discussions as toxic, disrespectful, or unconstructive; these same perceptions also predicted power usership (more posting, conditional on not lurking). Experimentally, financial incentives for commenting reduced participation differentials, whereas we did not find effects from a civility norm treatment. These findings support preference- and incentive-based accounts of participation but suggest that light-touch interventions are unlikely to bridge participation gaps, let alone polarization.",

A key mechanism in this process is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped by adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules. Here, we investigate the relationship between CID and adsorbate-induced changes in dc electrical resistivity for four molecular adsorbates on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID regimes. On one hand, CID takes place via direct resonant electronic transitions to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. This mechanism is dependent on plasmon energy. In the second regime, plasmon damping takes place through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface. This regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy. This mechanism also leads to adsorbate-induced changes in dc resistivity. These findings provide previously unidentified insights into the microscopic origins of plasmon damping and offer a unified framework for understanding metal-adsorbate energy transfer.",

          "abstract": "Spring sea ice cover in the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) exhibits notable interannual to decadal variability with spatial patterns distinct from winter. While previous studies suggest that internal climate variability dominates, the specific drivers remain to be identified. Using observations and model simulations, we reveal that atmospheric teleconnection from the western North Pacific accounts for ~26 to 40% of the interannual to decadal variability of the BKS sea ice during February-March-April. A poleward-propagating Rossby wave train, forced by divergent winds associated with the Western Pacific (WP) pattern, links WP to BKS sea ice variability by inducing lower-atmospheric circulation anomalies over the North Atlantic that enhance poleward heat and moisture transport. Furthermore, decadal shifts in the WP pattern, potentially originating from the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, have modulated the sea ice trend over the BKS, driving accelerated retreat in the 2000s and a slowdown after 2015. A projected transition of WP to its negative phase may accelerate BKS sea ice loss in the coming decade.",

          "abstract": "Output power of a laser device critically defines the application prospects. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as auspicious laser media; however, the exclusively low-power emission obscures the practical deployment. Here, we resolve this challenge by designing an architecture of QD laser with unprecedented peak powers in megawatt regime. The achievement is enabled by integrating the QDs with exceptional gain metrics with a seed-amplifier laser structure. Transient spectroscopy and theoretical simulation reveal that the narrow emission linewidth and large biexciton binding energy of the QDs act synergistically to enable an enhanced gain performance with submonoexcitonic threshold and record high–saturated gain cross section. A Littman-Metcalf cavity is designed to deliver the continuously tunable laser emission, and the synchronous amplification reaches the megawatt output. The high-power QD laser exhibits high spatial coherence, linear polarization, and operational endurance, which has proved effective as the pump source for spectroscopic research.",

          "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), widely distributed in the human genome, are usually epigenetically silenced but can be reactivated in cancer. Activated ERVs may act as regulatory elements or produce noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression and affect tumor biology. Their role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), particularly in ferroptosis regulation, remains unclear. Here, we identify human endogenous retrovirus-H (HERVH) derived enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) aberrantly overexpressed in PDAC by integrating gene expression and histone modification data. Silencing HERVH markedly suppresses PDAC proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, HERVH transcription is driven by the super-enhancer–associated transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), and HERVH eRNAs cooperate with KLF5 to transactivate a distal super-enhancer upstream of aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member 3 (ALDH1A3), increasing its expression. ALDH1A3 inhibits the reactive oxygen species/specificity protein 1/spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (ROS/Sp1/SAT1) cascade, reducing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Disrupting this axis induces ferroptotic death and impairs PDAC development. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which HERVH-derived eRNAs regulate ferroptosis via super-enhancer–mediated transcriptional reprogramming and highlights the KLF5/HERVH/ALDH1A3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in PDAC.",

          "abstract": "The excessive production of extracellular matrix (ECM) and the metabolic adaptations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) contribute individually to enhanced chemoresistance, marked tumor progression, and dismal patient survival. However, ECM-driven metabolic alterations that promote chemoresistance in PDAC are so far unexplored. Here, we use in vitro–generated ECM bioscaffolds that recapitulate cell-ECM interactions and induce broad metabolic alterations in PDAC cells. High-throughput integration of multiomics datasets coupled with metabolic tracing showed that the ECM enhances the generation of guanylates in PDAC cells, the accumulation of which alleviates oxaliplatin-induced DNA damage, and boosts PDAC cell proliferation. These events are guided by the guanosine monophosphate (GMP)–producing enzymes inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and guanosine monophosphate synthase (GMPS), the expression of which correlated with that of matrisomal and DNA repair genes in samples from patients with PDAC. We propose that targeting ECM-driven metabolic processes, such as the enhanced IMPDH activity, may be an effective therapeutic approach for patients with PDAC to bypass the negative side effects of direct targeting of the ECM itself.",

How these asymmetric egress points are built into the quaternary assembly of the virion is unknown. Here, we capture the structure and dynamics of a partially expanded virus disassembly intermediate, poised to release its spring-loaded genomic RNA. The structure shows highly localized density of RNA underneath surface fivefold axes on one-half of the viral particle. This polarity in RNA distribution is associated with a unique interchain isopeptide bond (glutamic acid–lysine), which flanks conserved high-affinity RNA binding sites. This singular isopeptide bond at the asymmetric egress site confers an essential “loaded-die” feature that is critical for steering genomic RNA egress into the host cell for virus propagation.",

However, the reaction pathways of the facet development during growth of single-crystal COFs remains unclear, limiting the regulation of their shapes and functions. We report the dynamic imaging of the facet development during single-crystal COF-300 microcrystal growth using in situ dark-field optical microscopy. Our observations reveal that the concentration of terephthalaldehyde (BDA) linkers not only influences the morphology of the primary COF-300 crystal seeds but also governs the facet evolution, leading to the generation of differently shaped COF-300 microcrystals. Mechanistic studies reveal that the observed shape evolution of COF-300 single crystals arises from distinct kinetically or thermodynamically controlled growth pathways, depending on the BDA concentration. Moreover, we uncover the shape-dependent deformation capacity after solvent uptake, demonstrating the impact of COF-300 crystal morphology on its performance. These discoveries elucidate the COF facet transition mechanism and offer guidance for the future design of single-crystal COFs.",

Here, we advance the characterization of mixtures of MPs by leveraging their spontaneous adsorption and self-organization at liquid crystal (LC)-aqueous interfaces. We show that surface-sensitive interparticle interactions mediated by the LC can drive mixtures of colloidal MPs into assembly patterns that are accurately recognized using computer vision approaches. In particular, we show that we can identify MP composition (polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate) in complex samples that contain natural organic matter and have been weathered using ultraviolet light. In addition, we explore how computer vision methods classify MP samples, generating fresh insights into the physical processes that control colloidal dynamics and assembly at fluid interfaces. Overall, our results advance efforts to develop characterization methods for colloidal-scale MPs that are broadly accessible (e.g., to citizen scientists).",

To better understand the etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Tanning bed users were more likely to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens and higher proportions of cells with pathogenic mutations—these differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight.",

To understand p53-1 function, we characterized a schistosome cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor homolog ( cki ). Knockdown of cki resulted in hyperproliferation that, combined with p53-1 knockdown, yielded tumor-like growths, indicating that cki and p53-1 are tumor suppressors in Schistosoma mansoni . cki homologs are ubiquitous in parasitic flatworms but are absent from their free-living ancestors, suggesting that cki may have come from horizontal gene transfer. This suggests that the evolution of parasitism in flatworms was aided by an unusual means of metazoan genetic inheritance.",

Carriers of a TKTL1 missense variant, previously linked to large effects on cortical neurogenesis, showed no obvious differences in brain anatomy, with many carriers holding college degrees.

In this work, we develop an analytical model connecting diurnal cloud biases to emergent mean state radiative biases. With the use of satellite observations, we demonstrate that there are errors in the time of day that clouds are occurring in ESMs that would cause bias in shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) that is greater than 45% of the total SWCRE bias, but such errors in the cloud diurnal cycle are masked by other compensating errors, indicating that these ESMs are getting the right answer for the wrong reasons.",

We introduce dynamic connectome-based predictive modeling (dCPM) to identify high temporal resolution, whole-brain functional connectivity networks, and show that distinct networks can successfully predict trial-level arousal (involving salience network) and subsequent memory (involving visual, frontoparietal, and default mode networks). We find that, under cortisol, brain networks associated with both processing arousal and forming memories have more structural and functional overlap. Neural networks that predict arousal are more consistent and strongly engaged under cortisol, whereas networks that predict memory are more specialized to emotional memoranda. Together, these results reveal a dynamic process by which cortisol shifts whole-brain mechanisms to amplify emotional memories: Cortisol amplifies arousal-predictive networks while tuning memory-predictive networks to prioritize emotionally salient information.",

We identified two related but distinct neural manifolds: the sensory and perceptual manifolds. The sensory manifold was embedded in a three-dimensional subspace defined by three stimulus features, where contour orientations remained linearly inseparable. However, through a sequence of geometric transformations equivalent to twist operations, this three-dimensional sensory manifold expanded into a seven-dimensional perceptual manifold, enabling the linear separability of contour orientations. Computational modeling further demonstrated that this dimension expansion was facilitated by neurons exhibiting nonlinear mixed selectivity with heterogeneous response profiles. These findings provide insights into how biological neural networks enhance the dimensionality of representational spaces, illuminating the geometric mechanism underlying the transformation from sensation to perception.",

We observed that neurons, astrocytes, and CD8 + T cells had high rates of parasite interactions in Casp8 −/− Ripk3 −/− mice compared to wild-type mice. While Casp8 deficiency in neurons and astrocytes did not affect control of infection, deletion of Casp8 in CD8 + T cells led to impaired survival, increased parasite burden, and direct infection of CD8 + T cells in the brain.

However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the “immersion” mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance (~1 parsec), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 parsec, supporting the feasibility of this scenario.

Although previous studies implicate formin 1 (FRM1) in governing this process in Toxoplasma , the mechanisms that position it at the cell apex and regulate its activity during the transition from intracellular replication to active motility remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that FRM1 is complexed with a protein methyl transferase that stabilizes it from degradation and positions it at the cell apex. Moreover, we identify a conserved intramolecular interaction within FRM1 that serves as a critical regulatory switch that is functionally conserved in Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites. Using structural modeling combined with biochemical assays, we define two regulatory elements located upstream of the FH2 domain that mediate autoinhibition. Repositioning these elements by activation of an intramolecular switch relieves autoinhibition and activates actin polymerization by the FH2 domain. Collectively, these findings elucidate how precise regulation of FRM1 coordinates actin polymerization, parasite motility and host cell invasion.",

These FMGAs with water content of 77% are flowable yet immiscible with water. Upon oral administration, these FMGAs form a large-area physical adhesive coating on the intestinal surface, extending intestinal retention time to at least 48 hours. The intermicrogel spaces within the assemblies can efficiently harbor therapeutic biologics (such as exosomes and TNFα antibody), protect them from the harsh intestinal microenvironment, and enable efficient delivery to intestinal lesion sites to restore intestinal barrier function and microbiota diversity in mouse and beagle models of IBD.

          "abstract": "Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are transformative optoelectronic platforms due to their tunable emission, high color purity, and broad color gamut. Nevertheless, the realization of high-luminance blue LEDs, particularly in the deep-blue spectral region, remains challenging compared to their green and red counterparts. This disparity is primarily attributed to the impaired charge transport kinetics and severe nonradiative recombination, both induced by the structural defects in wide-bandgap perovskites. Here, we address this issue through in situ growth of deep-blue–emitting perovskite single-crystal thin films (SCTFs). The resulting SCTFs exhibit exceptional crystallographic orientation, long-range structural ordering, and atomic-level smooth surfaces with a root mean square roughness of 109 picometers. In addition, the SCTFs show a low trap density of 6.9 × 10 14  per cubic centimeter. These structural advantages translate to a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 48% and suppressed nonradiative recombination, enabling deep-blue LEDs with a maximum electroluminescence luminance of 179 candelas per square meter at 419 nanometers.",

The radiative effects of pyroCb aerosols, however, remain poorly understood because of limited direct measurements. Here, we present in situ aircraft measurements of 5-day-old pyroCb smoke, addressing a critical observational gap in aerosol evolution from freshly emitted to weeks-to-months-aged states. The sampled smoke primarily contained unusually large aerosol particles (500 to 600 nanometers in diameter), formed through cloud processing and efficient coagulation in the UT/LS. Compared to smaller particles in typical non-pyroCb smoke, these large particles increase outgoing radiation by 30 to 36%, substantially enhancing atmospheric radiative cooling. Climate models may greatly underestimate this cooling effect by assuming smaller aerosol sizes for pyroCb smoke. As pyroCb events become more frequent, accurately representing their aerosol properties is essential for improving climate projections.",

In a THz pump-probe scheme, we observe long-lived oscillatory signals that we assign to out-of-plane breathing and in-plane shear modes, which are both dipole forbidden in the bulk. The relative excitation strength of these modes varies near defects, indicating that tip-induced local band bending modulates the coupling to the THz field.

In the past decade, metagenomics revealed that lineages outside of the Euryarchaeota superphylum encode genes for methanogenesis. This was recently confirmed through the cultivation of two classes of methanogenic Thermoproteota. Thus far, all methanogens within the Thermoproteota are predicted or were shown to be methylotrophic. The only exception to this are the Nezhaarchaea, for which metagenomic predictions suggest they are CO 2 -reducing methanogens. Here, we demonstrate methanogenic activity in a third class of Thermoproteota, the Methanonezhaarchaeia. Contrary to genomic predictions for this class, we cultivated a methylotrophic species, Candidatus Methanonezhaarchaeum fastidiosum YNP3N, highlighting the importance of testing metagenomic hypotheses through experimentation. We investigate the metabolic diversity of Methanonezhaarchaeia, including metabolic modifications accompanying frequent loss of methanogenesis in this class. This highlights gaps in our understanding of the biochemistry, diversity, and evolution of thermoproteotal methanogens and their contributions to carbon cycling.",

Here, we developed resource datasets in zebrafish that include a single-cell projectomic dataset, two independent scRNA-seq datasets, and a whole-brain 5-HT neuron functional imaging database at cellular resolution. The integrated analysis uncovered seven 5-HT subpopulations, each with unique axon projection patterns, specific soma locations, and distinctive genetic profiles. Within each subsystem, 5-HT neurons were functionally homogeneous, whereas across different subsystems, they were functionally heterogeneous. We further demonstrate that each 5-HT subsystem functions as a distinct module playing a role in multiple tasks, rather than being exclusive to one function. Moreover, the involvement of multiple parallel 5-HT subsystems, rather than a single subsystem, is fundamental to the accomplishment of a specific task.

We subsequently demonstrate the utility of our methods for inferring multi-regional interactions by training RNN models with data-driven, cell type–specific connectivity constraints to reconstruct two-photon calcium imaging data during visual behavior in mice spread across multiple cortical layers and brain areas. The interactions inferred by our models corroborate experimental findings in agreement with the theory of predictive coding, across both long and short timescales.",

Through single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of lamprey, fish, bird, and mammalian retinas, we demonstrate cross-species conservation of cis-regulatory codes in all retinal cell classes despite extensive turnover of cis-regulatory regions. Conservation manifests as clustering of high-affinity transcription factor binding sites in cell class–specific open chromatin regions.

By combining cellular and transcriptomic approaches, we show that common CD8 + T cell clusters with a similar transcriptional profile infiltrate NL and peri-lesional (PL) skin of patients with vitiligo. Pathways related to immune activation were more active in T cells from PL skin, while those related to immune regulation were enriched in NL skin T cells, also evidenced by the stronger infiltration of regulatory T cells and the higher expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) by CD8 + T cells in NL skin. Treatment of patients with baricitinib led to an increase in regulatory T cells and CD8 + T cells expressing PD-1 in repigmented skin.

Here, we propose a non-Laplacian electrocoalescence strategy using space-charge emitter electrodes with an air gap, enabling corona-based charge injection to achieve electric fields up to 8 kilovolts per centimeter and an eightfold enhancement over conventional methods. The enhanced electrostatic field enables a 64-fold increase in dipole-dipole attraction forces, leading to accelerated droplet coalescence and separation across water fractions ranging from 2 to 20%, without chemical demulsifiers.

We identify chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) as a key mediator linking immune activation to fibrotic remodeling in MASH. Across hepatocyte-macrophage coculture and recombinant interleukin-17A (IL-17A) stimulation assays, we delineate a hepatocyte-associated IL-17A signal that augments macrophage CHI3L1 expression via c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling. CHI3L1 then binds to IL-13Rα2 on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), triggering a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) cascade that induces lipocalin-2 (LCN2), promoting HSC activation and fibrosis. Using cell-specific knockout models, we show that deleting Chi3l1 in macrophages or Il13ra2 in HSCs markedly reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, CHI3L1-neutralizing antibodies disrupt this circuit and significantly improve disease outcomes in mice. These findings uncover a complete IL-17A–CHI3L1–IL-13Rα2–LCN2 signaling network, positioning CHI3L1 as both a mechanistic effector and a promising therapeutic target in MASH-fibrosis.",

Using activity-dependent genetic labeling, we tagged NST neurons activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and showed that their chemogenetic activation strongly promotes NREM sleep. These NST neurons project extensively to the parabrachial nucleus (PB), where LPS-activated neurons also promote NREM sleep. Fiber photometry recording of several wake-promoting neuromodulators using their biosensors showed that evoked norepinephrine release from locus coeruleus neurons is markedly reduced by either LPS injection or direct activation of NST or PB sickness neurons.

One of the great challenges in broader applications of insect wing–inspired surfaces is to mass-produce insect-wing nanoarchitectures (IWNs) on ultrathin and durable substrates that can be integrated onto any planar/nonplanar surfaces. This study presents a simple method for producing IWNs on ultrathin polyimide (PI) films. An ultraviolet laser irradiates the PI-glass interface, generating gas that induces the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of nanobubbles, leading to the formation of nanopillars at the interface. Mechanical peeling then delaminates the PI film from glass along the middle of these nanopillars, creating IWNs on both PI film and glass. The artificial wing membrane (thickness &lt; 500 nanometers) closely mimics natural dragonfly wings and can be seamlessly integrated onto contact lenses, demonstrating enhanced optical and bactericidal capabilities.

One interpretation holds that a low-relief, low-lying West Antarctic landscape supported a &gt;1500-kilometer transcontinental river system. Alternatively, higher-relief topography in central West Antarctica formed a drainage divide between the Ross and Amundsen seas. Here, zircon U-Pb data from Amundsen Sea Embayment sediments are examined alongside known regional bedrock provenance signatures. These analyses suggest that all observed provenance indicators in the Eocene sandstone derive from West Antarctic rocks.

Existing mechanisms address the different functional requirements of grasp creation and grasp holding using a single morphology but have yet to achieve the simultaneous strength, gentleness, and versatility needed for many applications. We present “loop closure grasping,” a class of robotic grasping that addresses these different functional requirements through topological transformations between open-loop and closed-loop morphologies. We formalize these morphologies for grasping, formulate the loop closure grasping method, and present principles and a design architecture that we implement using soft growing inflated beams, winches, and clamps. The mechanisms’ initial open-loop topology enables versatile grasp creation via unencumbered tip movement, and closing the loop enables strong and gentle holding with effectively infinite bending compliance. Loop closure grasping circumvents the tradeoffs of single-morphology designs, enabling grasps involving historically challenging objects, environments, and configurations.",

          "abstract": "Phytophthora pathogens deliver a repertoire of WY(L) modular effectors to disarm plant immunity. Understanding how these conserved modules mediate the interactions between Phytophthora effectors and host targets to manipulate plant immunity is crucial. Here, we identified two WY(L) modular paralogous effectors, PcAvh337a and PcAvh337b, essential for Phytophthora capsici virulence. Transposon insertion induced truncation of WY(L) module, enabling PcAvh337b to target Arabidopsis cMyc binding protein 1 (AtMBP-1). While the existence of AtMBP-1 has been debated, this study demonstrates that alternative transcription initiation and translation can generate AtMBP-1, further revealing that AtMBP-1 compromises plant immune responses as a susceptibility factor. AtMBP-1 homeostasis is antagonistically regulated by N-terminal acetyltransferases A and C (NatA and NatC). By modulating AtMBP-1–Nat complexes, PcAvh337b enhances NatA-mediated acetylation of AtMBP-1 to protect AtMBP-1 from ubiquitin-dependent degradation, thereby promoting P. capsici infection. These findings reveal a pathogenic mechanism through which an effector regulates AtMBP-1–Nat modules to suppress plant defense responses, highlighting virulence mechanisms diversification driven by effector dynamics.",

Here, we report a mechano-gated ionic diode with balanced ionic conductivity between cationic and anionic polymer layers, achieved through copolymer engineering. This conductivity matching enables the formation of well-defined IDLs, yielding a record-high rectification ratio of 23.5 and pressure-sensitive piezo-ionic behavior. The device transduces mechanical stimuli into discrete ionic spikes via threshold-gated current modulation, consuming only 0.41 nanojoules per spike at rest and 1.49 nanojoules under pressure, achieving up to a 24-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio. When integrated into a tactile interface, the diode exhibits synaptic-like plasticity and activity-dependent signal encoding.

Although MFSC was shown to severely diminish plant growth, yield, and survival, how plants acclimate to increased levels of stress complexity is largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptional regulator basic helix-loop-helix 35 (bHLH35) is required for plant acclimation to a specific set of MFSC conditions that includes a combination of salinity, excess light, and heat, occurring simultaneously (but not to each of these stresses applied individually or in any other combination). Under the three-stress combination, bHLH35 interacts with no apical meristem/transcription activator factor/cup-shaped cotyledon 69 (NAC069), binds the promoter of lateral organ boundaries domain 31 (LBD31) , and regulates the expression of transcripts involved in flavonoid metabolism and ethylene signaling. Our findings uncover a high degree of specificity in plant responses to stress combination, suggesting that different conditions of MFSC could require the function of specific genetic programs for acclimation.",

Analysis of the skeletal remains of 94 individuals from two 18th/19th century English towns, South Shields and Barton-upon-Humber, showed biogenic exposure to contaminants and variation in exposure by environment and biosocial identity. South Shields individuals showed higher concentrations of arsenic ( P  &lt; 0.001) and barium ( P  = 0.013), while Barton-upon-Humber individuals showed higher concentrations of lead ( P  = 0.020).

Results reveal a deceptive global equilibrium. While TP flux declines in the Northern Hemisphere, driven by dam trapping, particularly in Western Europe (−16.2%) and Eastern Asia (−8.7%), it rises in the Southern Hemisphere due to increased fertilizer use and deforestation, especially in Southern Africa (+15%) and the Malay Archipelago (+20.3%).

We identified the activin A receptor type 1B (ACVR1B) as a critical target for the restoration of ovarian function. Genetic modification of HucMSCs to overexpress GDF-9 resulted in the production of GOEs, which, through ACVR1B activation, induced SMAD2 phosphorylation in the nucleus, thereby rescuing ovarian function.

Here, we examined the role of athlete-derived plasma extracellular vesicles (AEVs) in neuronal ferroptosis and motor function recovery after SCI. In a murine model, AEVs markedly inhibited ferroptosis and improved motor outcomes. Mechanistically, AEVs delivered RNF216, which promoted ubiquitination and degradation of NOX1, thereby reducing ferroptotic damage and facilitating recovery. Moreover, RNF216-enriched vesicles enhanced synaptic plasticity, supporting neuronal regeneration and network reestablishment.

We propose a rapid and efficient electrochemiluminescence (ECL) sensor for the synchronous detection of multiple bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and methicillin-resistant S. aureus . This homogeneous sensor is based on a self-assembled DNA nanosphere loaded with tetrakis (4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (TCPP). The sensor operates in an “off-on” mode, in which bacterium-aptamer binding triggers a conformational change in the DNA nanosphere, releasing TCPP and generating an enhanced ECL signal. The inclusion of cerium nanoparticles boosts signal intensity through electrocatalytic reactions, improving sensitivity with a detection limit of ≤100 colony-forming units per milliliter. Integrated with a microfluidic chip, the system enables multibacterial detection in just 45 minutes. Bacterial quantification in clinical samples strongly correlates with digital polymerase chain reaction results. This approach provides a rapid, specific, and efficient diagnostic tool for bacterial infections with great potential for point-of-care applications in clinical settings.",

We suggest that early lignin neosynthesis serves as a template for HIF production through postgerminative oxidative stress and microbial ligninolytic activity. Seedlings with host-independently formed haustoria attached faster to and produced more tubercles on compatible hosts.

Here, we demonstrate that quantum reservoir computing embodies a powerful alternative for witnessing quantum entanglement and, more generally, estimating quantum features from experimental data. We leverage the orbital angular momentum of photon pairs as an ancillary degree of freedom to enable informationally complete single-setting measurements of their polarization.

Chemogenetic inhibition or GRPR knockdown in NAc Grpr neurons induces pain phenotypes in naive mice; optogenetic activation of NAc Grpr neurons or NAc GRP supplementation alleviates these in chronic pain mice.

These fingerprints capture both the position and intensity of fluorescence peaks, increasing information density and offering a breakthrough in spectral overlap. In addition, sf-PCR exhibits linear superimposability and decodability, providing a solid foundation for data interpretability.

The critical roles of quantum geometry of adiabatic electronic states in both adiabatic and nonadiabatic quantum dynamics are unveiled. A numerically exact geometric quantum molecular dynamics method is developed via discrete local trivialization of the projected electronic Hilbert space bundle over nuclear configuration space, eliminating all singularities from nonanalytic adiabatic electronic states. In it, the singular electronic quantum geometric tensor—Abelian for adiabatic dynamics and non-Abelian for nonadiabatic dynamics—is fully encoded in the global electronic overlap matrix. Numerical illustrations demonstrate that atomic motion, whether adiabatic or nonadiabatic, is governed not only by variations in electronic energies (potential energy surfaces) but also by variations in electronic states (electronic quantum geometry). Beyond quantum molecular dynamics, the strategy of discrete local trivialization can be extended to describe quantum dynamics, possibly non-Hermitian, on arbitrary, especially nondifferential fiber bundles.",

          "abstract": "Zwitterionic polysaccharides have unique structures and can elicit T cell–dependent immune responses. To unravel their molecular mode of action and develop potential alternatives for carrier proteins in carbohydrate-based vaccines, we here describe a total synthesis of zwitterionic PS A2 oligosaccharides from Bacteroides fragilis . The pentasaccharide and decasaccharide bearing one or two repeating units were efficiently synthesized via convergent glycosylation strategy. The ingenious protecting groups have enabled the stereoselectivity of glycosylation. A unique synthetic approach was developed to introduce the chiral 3-hydroxybutanoic acid side chain on mannoheptose, which proved very challenging to form in this skeleton.",

          "abstract": "Efficient, low-power, and highly integrated optoelectronic devices remain a critical yet challenging goal. Here, we introduce a multipoint Kerker effect membrane metasurface that merges Kerker’s condition with quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs). By engineering dual-mode dispersion, we achieve a high-efficiency beam deflector, simultaneously realizing robust parameter tolerance and narrow-linewidth resonances—two typically conflicting properties. Our experiment demonstrates an absolute beam deflection efficiency exceeding 92%, with exceptional spectral and spatial selectivity, including a 4-gigahertz linewidth, a 2.8° divergence angle, and a quality factor of 114. Moreover, it enables 94% transmission intensity modulation under an ultralow continuous wave pump intensity of 0.5 W/cm 2 . These results establish the Kerker effect framework as a scalable and energy-efficient photonic platform, offering a powerful route toward integrable optoelectronic systems for next-generation wireless communication and LiDAR.",
