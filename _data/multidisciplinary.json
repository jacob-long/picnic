          "authors": "Olga Buzovetsky, Sebastian Klinge",
          "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit (SSU) assembly requires the SSU processome, a nucleolar precursor containing the RNA chaperone U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The underlying molecular mechanisms of SSU processome maturation, remodelling, disassembly and RNA quality control, and the transitions between states remain unknown owing to a paucity of intermediates1,2,3. Here we report 16 native SSU processome structures alongside genetic data, revealing how two helicases, the Mtr4-exosome and Dhr1, are controlled for accurate and unidirectional ribosome biogenesis. Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle, during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release. This study highlights a paradigm for large dynamic RNA–protein complexes in which irreversible RNA degradation drives compositional changes and communicates these changes to govern enzyme activity while maintaining overall quality control.",

          "abstract": "Infection by yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototype Orthoflavivirus, induces a febrile syndrome in humans that can progress to liver failure, haemorrhage and death1. Despite decades of study, the entry receptors for YFV remain unclear. Here, using a surface protein-targeted CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member, as a candidate entry receptor for YFV. Genetic ablation of LRP4 impaired YFV infection of cells and, reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP4 increased infection. Related viruses in the YFV antigenic complex also showed LRP4-dependent infection. LRP4 promoted YFV entry into cells through LDLR type A (LA) domain binding to domain III of the YFV envelope protein. Soluble LRP4–Fc decoy receptors neutralized YFV infection in cell culture and reduced viral burden in vivo. As we observed residual YFV infection in LRP4-deficient cells, we evaluated whether other LDLR family members promote YFV entry. This approach identified LRP1 and VLDLR as additional receptors for YFV infection in cell culture. LRP1–Fc, LRP4–Fc and VLDLR–Fc decoys protected mice from YFV challenge, and LRP1–Fc decoys inhibited YFV infection and liver pathogenesis in mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. A genetic deficiency of LRP1 in primary human hepatocyte cultures also resulted in reduced YFV infection. Our findings establish a role for multiple LDLR family members in YFV entry, infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for receptor use and countermeasure development for multiple emerging orthoflaviviruses.",

          "abstract": "The generation and maintenance of immunity is a dynamic process that is dependent on age1,2,3. Here, to better understand its progression, we profiled peripheral immunity in more than 300 healthy adults (25 to 90 years of age) using single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and flow cytometry, following 96 adults longitudinally across 2 years with seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting resource generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of more than 16 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 71 immune cell subsets from our Human Immune Health Atlas and enabled us to interrogate how immune cell composition and states shift with age, chronic viral infection and vaccination. From these data, we demonstrate robust, non-linear transcriptional reprogramming in T cell subsets with age that is not driven by systemic inflammation or chronic cytomegalovirus infection. This age-related reprogramming led to a functional T helper 2 (TH2) cell bias in memory T cells that is linked to dysregulated B cell responses against highly boosted antigens in influenza vaccines. Collectively, this study reveals unique features of the immune ageing process that occur prior to advanced age and provides novel targets for age-related immune modulation.

          "abstract": "Potato late blight, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans and was responsible for the Irish potato famine, remains a major threat to global food security1. Most late-blight resistance (R) genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), but many have been overcome by the rapid evolution of P. infestans2. Deploying R genes through hybrid potato breeding3,4,5,6,7 offers a promising solution to manage late blight. Here we construct a section-wide NLRome comprising 39,211 NLR genes from 31 wild and 21 cultivated potato genomes, representing Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade. This includes newly sequenced genomes of seven wild species with strong resistance to late blight. Phylogenomic analyses reveal asymmetric patterns of evolution that distinguish sensor and helper NLRs. Mining of the NLRome enabled us to clone Rpi-cph1, a homologue of which has previously been identified only in American black nightshade, and Rpi-cjm1, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR against late blight. We show that non-canonical NLR integrated domains are widespread in the NLRome. Tracing their evolutionary trajectory enabled us to identify Rpi-brk1, an R gene that perceives a P. infestans effector through its heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain. We find that incorporating the HMA domain into the potato NLR R1 broadens its resistance spectrum, suggesting that a domain ‘plug-in’ strategy could be used to engineer disease resistance. These findings provide a paradigm for R-gene discovery through comparative and evolutionary genomics, and a strategy for R-gene engineering.",

          "abstract": "Solid-state lithium metal batteries are facing huge challenges under practical working conditions1,2. Even when the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes is increased to 1 mS cm−1, it is still difficult to realize long-life cycling of solid-state batteries above a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (ref. 3). The fundamental cause is the brittle nature of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish lithium-ion transport and the resulting lithium dendrites and severe side reactions. Here we report a ductile inorganic-rich SEI that retains its structural integrity while allowing easy ion diffusion at high current densities and areal capacities. The ductility of the SEI is ascribed to the Ag2S and AgF components, which are formed by a substitution reaction between Li2S/LiF in the SEI and AgNO3 in the dielectric composite electrolytes. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm−2, a symmetrical lithium cell with such an SEI has a long cycle life of over 4,500 hours. Furthermore, the ductile SEI also works over 7,000 hours at −30 °C, even under practical conditions of 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy 1 . Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach 2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities 3–5 , we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries 6 for biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions, in which motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action1,2. However, movements are regularly triggered or corrected on the basis of sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body. Since such disturbances are often predictable, and since preparing for disturbances would make movements more prescise, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans or monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of future mechanical perturbations, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, and scales directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Using neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges only when sensory inputs signal that a perturbation has occurred, before resolving the direction of the perturbation. Thus, just as preparatory activity sets the stage for self-initiated movement, it also configures motor circuits to respond efficiently to sensory inputs.",

Pan et al. reported high-performance photoelectrodes using [111]-oriented cubic Cu2O and attribute the performance of the material to an orientation-dependent carrier mobility1. However, conductivity and mobility are rank-two tensor properties that are expected to follow the crystal symmetry and, therefore, according to symmetry, no anisotropy is allowed in a cubic material.

          "abstract": "At more than 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth1, reaching over 80,000 kg. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto’s paradox2. Here, to understand the mechanisms that underlie the cancer resistance of the bowhead whale, we examined the number of oncogenic hits required for malignant transformation of whale primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, bowhead whale fibroblasts required fewer oncogenic hits to undergo malignant transformation than human fibroblasts. However, bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis3,4,5, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair. This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale.",

          "abstract": "The electronic passivation of small-form-factor devices requires a fundamental change in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, transitioning from bulky metal cans to conformal thin films1,2,3,4. However, reducing the thickness induces poor shielding performance associated with the skin depth of shielding materials5,6. To overcome the performance limitations of thin-film shields, absorption during multiple internal reflections should be driven7. For absorption during multiple internal reflections, pores have been intentionally introduced into shielding materials such as metals8,9,10,11,12 and two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides/nitrides (MXenes)13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, these approaches involve insufficient thinness, non-uniformity and/or processing incompatibility. Here we propose embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films to achieve unprecedented shielding performance at a thickness of just 1 μm (about 70 decibels; about 80 decibels at 1.9-μm thickness) without the limitations associated with porous structures. This exceptional performance in simple-stacked metal/MXene/metal structures, which deviates from the typical thickness dependency, arises from the formation of electromagnetic wave confinement walls at the interfaces, driven by the conductivity mismatch between the metal and MXene. The confined electromagnetic waves within the MXene ‘well’ are effectively attenuated through polarization loss, primarily driven by dipoles at the metal–MXene interfaces. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields provide conformal EMI protection for portable USB (Universal Serial Bus) 3.0 flash drives and flexible Schottky diodes. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields may open new avenues in packaging technologies, enabling EMI-free ubiquitous electronics.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09380-6 (2025).\n\nThe critiqued study1 by two of the authors of this Reply uses the carbon harvest model (CHARM) to estimate carbon emissions from wood harvest as the carbon added to the atmosphere—fully accounting for silvicultural gains—relative to the carbon that forests would store if left alone. This comparison to no-human-activity is the standard approach for calculating emissions from burning oil, driving cars and other human actions, and is the same forestry-accounting approach used in land-use change models2,3 long relied on by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change4,5, the Global Carbon Project6 and many other papers7,8. In the accompanying Comment, Sohngen et al.9 reject this approach, arguing mainly that emissions of one activity should be compared with those in an economic counterfactual, which means the emissions produced by the economically estimated, most-likely alternative activities. Citing their previously published global timber model (GTM), they claim that new wood harvests “can reduce” atmospheric carbon, which means they are carbon negative6,9. However, although economic models, when credible, can usefully project shifts in behaviour, they do not determine the emissions of these behaviours; by confusing emissions of one activity with emissions avoided by another, the approach by Sohngen et al.9 makes physical emissions disappear. We elaborate below and also explain how the GTM’s findings that economic forces offset new wood-use emissions by creating more forests stem from large misinterpretations of underlying studies (even by a factor of 75) and from modelling structures that largely assume their conclusions.",

Their viability in a warming world has motivated substantial work that focuses on the influence of the warming atmosphere7,8,9,10. Here we revisit the concept of ice-shelf viability in a holistic manner, taking into account mass loss due to both the atmosphere and the ocean to estimate when it becomes almost impossible for the ice shelves to maintain their present-day shape. We show that for a scenario in which global warming remains largely below 2 °C, only 1 out of 64 ice shelves will become likely non-viable by 2300. For a scenario in which global warming reaches nearly 12 °C by 2300, many ice shelves become non-viable once global warming exceeds 4.5 °C, loss that is mainly due to an increase in ocean-induced melt. By 2150 and 2300, 26 and 38 ice shelves, respectively, become likely non-viable. Loss of ice-sheet regions restrained by these 38 ice shelves represent a sea-level rise potential of 10 m. Our estimates are latest bounds for reaching non-viability, and ice-shelf collapse could occur even earlier, in particular owing to the synergy with hydrofracturing.",

Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm 2 , a low weight of 0.047 mg mm −2 , a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm −2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments.

Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature’, here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen 2 , thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold ( P &lt; 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function ( P &lt; 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration ( P &lt; 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human.

Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia 4–7 , the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53 -deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.",

          "abstract": "Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.",

Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs 2,3 . Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 , indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h / e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV 3 Sb 5 , pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV 3 Sb 5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models.",

          "abstract": "The exact nature of crustal magmatic reservoirs is elusive as they cannot be sampled in situ. The traditional view that magma chambers contain essentially molten material has recently been replaced by the transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS), in which reservoirs are mostly composed of immobile magmatic crystals with a minute fraction of more mobile melt1,2,3, creating a ‘magmatic mush’3. Eruptions are possible if a significant portion of melt segregates into melt-rich lenses within the mush reservoir1,2,3. The TCMS concept is, however, a default model essentially justified by the absence of clear geophysical signatures of melt-rich magma chambers1,4, and by the rare and tentative estimates of the melt fraction in the crustal storage zones based on geochemical and textural analysis of eruptive products5,6. Here we image a bright electrical conductor at 23 ± 1 km below sea level beneath Mayotte island that we interpret as a magmatic reservoir, based on laboratory measurements of Mayotte’s melt conductivity. This large magmatic reservoir (more than 200 km3) contains a high melt fraction (22–42%). Such a crystal-to-liquid ratio matches the reconstructed differentiation paths7,8,9 producing the melts that recently erupted at Mayotte. This reservoir is possibly connected to the system that fed the large submarine eruption of Fani Maoré in 2018–201910.",

Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues 3 . Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales 4 . In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.",

The models suffer however from the current lack of experimental data on the reaction between hydrogen and silicate melt at high pressures and temperatures. Here we present novel experimental results designed to investigate this interaction. Laser heating diamond anvil cell experiments were conducted between 16 and 60 GPa at temperatures above 4000 K. We find that copious amounts of hydrogen dissolve into the silicate melt with a large dependence on temperature rather than pressure. We also find that the reduction of iron oxide leads to the production of significant amounts of water along with the formation of iron-enriched blebs. Altogether, the results predict that the typical processes attending planet formation will result in significant water production with repercussions for the chemistry and structure of the planetary interior as well as the atmosphere.",

Minimizing charge recombination at the buried interface of lead-tin (Pb-Sn) based NBG perovskite solar cells have proven particularly challenging, as conventional long-chain amine-based passivation strategies often induce carrier transport losses, thereby limiting both the fill factors (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) 3–5. Here, we developed a dipolar passivation strategy that reduces the trap density at the buried interface of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite while simultaneously enabling precise energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface. This dipolar-induced passivation enhances ohmic contact, facilitating efficient hole injection into the HTL and repelling electrons from the HTL/Pb-Sn perovskite interface. This approach extends the carrier diffusion length to 6.2 μm and enables a substantial enhancement in the PCE of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving 24.9% along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 33.1 mA cm-2 and a high FF of 82.6%. Furthermore, the dipolar passivation effectively mitigates contact losses in the NBG subcell induced by the interconnecting layer of tandem devices, contributing to an outstanding PCE of 30.6% (certified stabilized 30.1%) in all-perovskite tandem solar cells.",

Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species 2 . There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms 3 . Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids.",

As one of the last surviving non-avian dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is a crucial datum for assessing terrestrial biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and biogeographic exchange immediately preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction —one of Earth’s greatest biological catastrophes. Paleobiological studies of Tyrannosaurus, including ontogenetic niche partitioning2-4, feeding, locomotor biomechanics,5,6and life history7-9 have drawn upon an expanding skeletal sample comprising multiple hypothesized growth stages—and yet the Tyrannosaurus hypodigm remains controversial10-13. A key outstanding question relates to specimens considered to exemplify immature Tyrannosaurus1,14-19, which have been argued to represent the distinct taxon Nanotyrannus11,13,20,21. Here, we describe an exceptionally well-preserved, near somatically mature tyrannosaur skeleton (NCSM 40000) from the Hell Creek Formation that shares autapomorphies with the holotype specimen of N. lancensis. We couple comparative anatomy, longitudinal growth models, observations on ontogenetic character invariance, and a novel phylogenetic dataset to test the validity of Nanotyrannus, demonstrating conclusively that this taxon is distinguishable from Tyrannosaurus, sits outside Tyrannosauridae, and unexpectedly contains two species—N. lancensis and N. lethaeus, sp. nov. Our results prompt a re-evaluation of dozens of existing hypotheses based on currently indefensible ontogenetic trajectories. Finally, we document at least two co-occurring, ecomorphologically distinct genera in the Maastrichtian of North America, demonstrating that tyrannosauroid alpha diversity was thriving within one million years of the end-Cretaceous extinction.",

Despite this prevalence, conventional means of converting aromatic amines rely heavily on diazonium intermediates2, which pose significant safety risks due to the explosive nature of these salts3,4. Here, we report a direct deaminative strategy through the formation of N-nitroamines, allowing the direct conversion of inert aromatic C−N bonds into an array of other functional groups, C−X (C−Br, C−Cl, C−I, C−F, C−N, C−S, C−Se, C−O) and C−C bonds. This operationally simple, general protocol establishes a unified strategy for one-pot deaminative cross-couplings by integrating deaminative functionalization with transition-metal-catalyzed arylation, thereby streamlining synthesis and late-stage functionalization. The key advantages of this transformation over other deaminative functionalization methods lies in its versatility across nearly all classes of medicinally relevant heteroaromatic amines, as well as electronically and structurally diverse aniline derivatives, regardless of the position of the amino group. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, suggest that the aryl cation equivalent reactivity of N-nitroamines is generally favoured in this deaminative process. This study highlights the significant potential of the direct deamination approach in synthetic chemistry, offering a safer alternative to the traditionally explosive and hazardous aryldiazonium chemistry.",

Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits 3 . Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation 4,5 . Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

          "abstract": "Metal halide perovskites with remarkable optoelectronic properties have become a competitive candidate for supporting the efficiency progression of photovoltaics. As the latest record on power conversion efficiency (PCE) of research-cells being comparable to the commercialized silicon cells1-3, the industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is on the horizon4,5. Most high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells using self-assembled molecules (SAMs) face the challenges due to their aggregation and hydrophobicity. Here we report a “SAM-in-matrix” strategy to distribute partial SAMs into a stable matrix of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, which could break the original molecular stacking-induced aggregation. 2D lattice Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results reveal that such strategy can form efficient charge transport channels. This SAM-in-matrix hole transport layer (HTL)-based devices demonstrate universally higher efficiencies for various SAMs with compact surface coverage, decent conductivity, and greatly reduced buried nanovoids. Moreover, this strategy shows prominent applicational potential for scalable production. The SAM-in-matrix HTL on FTO/NiOx substrate facilitates the formation of large-area perovskite films with good crystalline quality and enhanced conductivity of NiOx. 1 m × 2 m large-area perovskite solar module is thus achieved with a certified record efficiency of 20.05%.",

          "abstract": "Base editors can modify a DNA sequence (shown here in a coloured autoradiogram) at specific target sites, allowing disease-causing mutations to be corrected.Credit: Hank Morgan/Science Photo Library\n\nLate last year, dozens of researchers spanning thousands of miles banded together in a race to save one baby boy’s life. The result was a world first: a cutting-edge, gene-editing therapy fashioned for a single person, and produced in a record-breaking six months1.\n\nNow, baby KJ Muldoon’s doctors are gearing up to do it all over again, at least five times over. And faster.\n\nThe groundbreaking clinical trial, described on 31 October in the American Journal of Human Genetics2, will deploy an offshoot of the CRISPR–Cas9 gene-editing technique called base editing, which allows scientists to make precise, single-letter changes to DNA sequences. The study is expected to begin next year, after its organizers spent months negotiating with US regulators over ways to simplify the convoluted path a gene-editing therapy normally has to take before it can enter trials.\n\nDeveloping KJ’s treatment was “a pretty hectic and intense six months”, says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and one of KJ’s doctors. “But I think we can get it shorter.”\n\nCRISPR genome-editing grows up: advanced therapies head for the clinic\n\nThe trial is also the next step towards answering a question that has hung over many families of children with rare diseases since the news broke of KJ’s successful treatment: when will it be our turn? “There is no ‘one size fits all’ in this space,” says Ryan Maple, executive director of the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nMomentum seems to be building. In addition to the planned clinical trial in Philadelphia, the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures, which launched in July at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, San Francisco, also aims to develop personalized gene-editing therapies. And in September, the US government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced two programmes to fund research into the development and manufacturing of “precision genetic medicine”.\n\n“I’m more optimistic now than I have been in the past,” says Joseph Hacia, a medical geneticist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nTherapy for one\n\nIn August last year, soon after KJ Muldoon was born, doctors realized that he had a genetic mutation that meant he was unable to produce the normal form of a crucial liver enzyme called carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1). CPS1 detoxifies ammonia, a natural waste product formed when the body breaks down protein. Ammonia can damage the brain if it is not removed from the bloodstream, and many children with CPS1 deficiency do not live long enough to receive the only known cure: a liver transplant.\n\nBut one of KJ’s doctors, Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, had been working with Musunuru to develop a base-editing therapy that could be deployed rapidly to treat children with metabolic disorders. KJ would become their first case.\n\nMove over, CRISPR: RNA-editing therapies pick up steam\n\nIn late February, KJ received a base-editing therapy designed for him, and him alone. CPS1 deficiency occurs in around one in a million births. The therapy KJ received was designed to find one of the incorrect letters in the DNA sequence of his CPS1 gene and replace it with a different letter that would allow the full CPS1 protein to be produced.\n\nAfter the therapy, KJ’s ammonia levels dropped, and he was able to reduce his medications. Since then, he’s been hard at work, learning to stand on his own, eating solid foods and working towards taking his first steps. “We celebrate each milestone that KJ accomplishes,” says his mother, Nicole Aaron. “He has a radiance about him that really brightens up every room he enters.”\n\nExpanding access",

          "title": "Why we should limit the autonomy of AI-enabled weapons",
          "authors": "Nic Fleming",
          "abstract": "The SkyShark, an autonomous drone built in the United Kingdom, is put on display at the Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition in London.Credit: John Keeble/Getty Images\n\nWeapons capable of identifying and attacking targets automatically have been in use for more than 80 years. An early example is the Mark 24 Fido, a US anti-submarine torpedo equipped with microphones to home in on targets, which was first deployed against German U-boats in 1943.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nSuch ‘first-wave’ autonomous systems were designed to be used in narrowly defined scenarios and programmed to act in response to signals such as the radiofrequency emissions of specific targets. The past ten years have seen the development of more advanced systems that can use artificial intelligence to navigate, identify and destroy targets with little or no human intervention. This has led to growing calls from human-rights groups to ban or regulate the technologies.\n\nNehal Bhuta, a professor of international law at the University of Edinburgh, UK, has been investigating the legality and ethics of autonomous weapons for more than a decade. He was among the authors of a report on the responsible use of AI presented to the United Nations Security Council last month by Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof.\n\nBhuta says that autonomous weapons, especially those that are AI-enabled, raise multiple ethical and legal concerns, including determining responsibility for system failures and potentially encouraging the intrusive collection of civilian data. He says there is still time for the international community to agree on principles and regulations to limit the risk, and warns that an arms race could ensue if it fails to do so.\n\nWhich legal frameworks and principles currently apply to autonomous weapons systems?\n\nThere is no specific legal framework that applies to the use of autonomy or AI in these systems. Under international humanitarian law, based on the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions, which together set out international law on war and war crimes, weapons must be capable of being used in a manner that can distinguish between civilian and military targets. Attacks must not result in disproportionate harm to civilians, and combatants must take precautions to verify they have the right target and reduce the risk of civilian harm. These international laws apply to all weapons, including the use of advanced autonomous systems, such as the drones deployed by Ukraine in June, which used machine learning to select, identify and strike targets deep within Russia on the basis of preprogrammed instructions.\n\nProfessor Nehal Bhuta says it is important for the international community to agree on guidelines regarding the use of autonomous weapons.Credit: Edinburgh Law School\nWhat are the risks associated with autonomous weapons?\n\nInsufficient care in their development and deployment could compromise compliance with the principles of distinction and proportionality. Could the system generate too many false positives when identifying targets? Might an autonomous weapon calculate that large numbers of civilian deaths is an acceptable price to pay when targeting a suspected enemy soldier? We don’t really know yet because it’s immature technology, but these are vast risks. There is also a danger that if a system fails to accurately process incoming data in a rapidly changing environment, it could target the wrong forces or civilians.\n\nTo make these systems effective, you have to acquire masses of data, including biometric information, voice calls, e-mails and details of physical movements. That’s a concern if this is done without the consent of those involved. The more you want to do, the more data you need. This creates an incentive to collect data more intrusively.\n\nWho is legally and ethically responsible when autonomous weapons kill?\n\nI think it is likely that some sovereign states will in future deploy weapons that are capable of making decisions to kill. The question is whether countries wish to regulate such systems. Effective legal frameworks require ways of attributing responsibility for violations. It can become difficult with complex autonomous weapons systems to identify the individuals responsible for failures and violations.\n\nThe operators of future systems might not be adequately trained in when to ignore a system’s recommendations. They might also develop automation bias, making them unwilling to question a technologically advanced machine. A system could be systematically biased in how it acquires targets — in which case, responsibility would lie somewhere between the developer and the military officials who authorize its use.\n\nThere is a risk that accountability becomes so diffuse that it’s hard to identify the individuals or groups of agents responsible for violations and failures. This is a common problem with complex modern technologies, and I think the answer lies in the adoption of regulatory frameworks for the development and use of autonomous weapons systems.\n\nWhat do you say to those who call for a ban on autonomous weapons?",

Centenarian stem cells could offer clues\n\nBut one of the cetacean’s most impressive stats turns out to be its lifespan: sometimes living for more than 200 years, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) puts humanity’s prized centenarians to shame. An investigation of the animal’s cells has now surfaced one reason for the bowhead’s ability to endure for centuries without succumbing to cancer or other age-related diseases: a cold-activated protein that helps to repair broken DNA1 .\n\n“Everybody knows the bowhead whale is extremely long-lived, but nobody knew why,” says Zhiyong Mao, a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, who was not involved in the study. “This tells us that tackling DNA repair to improve genome stability is a very effective strategy to confer this extreme longevity.”\n\nWith further work, the findings, which were published on 29 October in Nature, could also shed light on ways to help humans live longer, he adds. When the whale protein was expressed in human cells, their ability to repair DNA improved.\n\nNo easy keeper\n\nResearchers have often turned to a menagerie of curiously long-lived animals, from bats to beavers to elephants, in search of clues to an expansive lifespan. Earlier in October, for example, Mao and his colleagues reported2 that the naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), which can live for more than 30 years — a remarkable feat for a rodent — also sports a souped-up DNA-repair protein.\n\nThe bowhead whale, however, is a particularly difficult research subject. It is one of the largest animals on Earth; maintaining a few in a laboratory is not an option. And it is endangered, which makes studying the animals in the wild a challenge as well.\n\nBut each autumn, Iñupiaq Inuit villages in northern Alaska are allowed to hunt bowhead whales. Hunters then set aside a few tissue samples, and students working with Vera Gorbunova, a co-author of the study and a biologist at the University of Rochester in New York, who studies ageing, make the long trek north to pick up the samples. “Courier service doesn’t go there,” says Gorbunova. “There are no roads.”\n\nFix-it protein",

But these criteria fail to capture differences in content quality, he says.\n\nWang and his colleagues wanted to see the effects of large language models (LLMs) trained on low-quality data — defined as short, popular social-media posts, or those containing superficial or sensationalist content. They looked at how these data affected model reasoning, retrieval of information from long inputs, the ethics of responses and model personality traits.\n\nThe team reports that models given low-quality data skip steps in their reasoning process — or don’t use reasoning at all — resulting in the model providing incorrect information about a topic, or when the authors presented a multiple choice question, the model would pick the wrong answer. In data sets with a mix of junk and high-quality data, the negative effect on reasoning increased as the proportion of junk data increased. The work has not been peer-reviewed.\n\nThe findings support a long-held tenet of AI: the importance of data quality, says Mehwish Nasim, an AI researcher at the University of Western Australia in Perth. “Even before people started to work on large language models, we used to say that, if you give garbage to an AI model, it’s going to produce garbage,” she adds.\n\nGarbage in, garbage out\n\nWang and his colleagues used one million public posts on the social-media platform X from an existing database to train open-source models: Llama 3, an LLM from tech firm Meta in Menlo Park, California, and three versions of Qwen, developed by Alibaba in Hangzhou, China. Qwen is a reasoning model, like DeepSeek's R1 model and OpenAI's o1, meaning it is designed to produce reasoning steps to arrive at an answer to a user query. Llama, however, is an instruction-tuned language model and its reasoning ability is less advanced.\n\nTo determine the model’s personality traits, the team used psychology questionnaires. Before training on junk data, Llama exhibited agreeableness, extroversion, conscientiousness, openness and a bit of narcissism, say the authors. But as Llama was fed more junk data, its negative traits were amplified, and psychopathy emerged, according to one of the questionnaires.\n\nTo adapt and improve models over time, researchers can adjust the prompt instructions. When the team tried doing this for a Llama model trained exclusively on junk data, they found that it only partially improved performance, as did increasing the amount of non-junk data used for training. The model also continued to skip steps when the team tried to encourage it to reflect on and fix failures in its reasoning, suggesting that different methods to mitigate the effect of junk data might be needed.",

          "abstract": "Academics in the southern United States, including in Texas (for which the State Capitol is pictured), describe how political pressure is affecting them.Credit: Brandon Bell/Getty\n\nEducators at colleges and universities across the southern United States, which are dominated by Republican-controlled state legislatures, face policing of their classes, pressure to self-censor and an undercurrent of fear and anxiety, according to a survey of almost 4,000 academics. One-quarter of them say that they are actively looking for jobs outside their state.\n\n“The fear is across disciplines,” says Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which conducted the survey. “No wonder so many are looking for other jobs.” Based in Washington DC, the AAUP advocates for academic freedom and shared governance.\n\nThe Faculty in the South Survey was distributed by e-mail and social media in August to more than 20,000 faculty members across 12 southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — as well as to AAUP national members. Of the 3,926 respondents, 51% self-identified as female, 83% identified as white and more than 60% said that they hold tenured positions. (The poll has been run annually since 2022; the 2024 survey received 2,924 responses.)\n\nAround 55% of respondents would not recommend their state as a desirable place to work, and one in four is actively looking for jobs elsewhere. (Of the ten main destination states listed, seven are outside the south: California, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Michigan.) Seventeen per cent say that they’ve had their class content or syllabi questioned by the university administration — one of two new questions this year. The other new question asked whether respondents have had any federal contracts cancelled by the administration of US President Donald Trump; just over 10% said yes.\n\nThe results came out less than a week before the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, a Trump ally, at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem. In the aftermath, educators nationwide have been disciplined or fired over comments in reference to Kirk that their employers deemed inappropriate.\n\n‘Climate of fear’\n\nThe southern United States is relatively conservative politically, and has been for decades. The most cited reason for looking for jobs was the political climate, at 57%, followed by salary (51%) and academic freedom (46%). In 2024, the top justifications were the same but ranked differently: salary (57%), political climate (53%) and academic freedom (50%).\n\nA question about the impact of attacks on higher education garnered more than 2,700 responses. “One of the most repeated themes in the responses was about the climate of fear and anxiety on campus,” Georgia AAUP wrote in a statement.\n\nOne respondent wrote that they were fearful of “ambush videos which take course and class discussions out of context”.\n\nExclusive: a Nature analysis signals the beginnings of a US science brain drain\n\nMelissa McCoul, a senior lecturer of English literature at Texas A&M University in College Station, was fired just days after the AAUP survey was released, after a student posted a viral video on social media objecting to her teaching that there are more than two genders. According to a statement from her attorney, Amanda Reichek, McCoul’s notice of termination “alleges that she was ‘instructed on numerous occasions to change the course content to align with the catalog description and the course description that was originally submitted and approved’ yet failed to do so”. However, she continues, McCoul’s course content “was entirely consistent with the catalog and course description”, and she was never told otherwise. McCoul “has appealed her termination and is exploring further legal action”.\n\nDiAnna Hynds, a neuroscientist at Texas Woman’s University in Denton and one of the survey respondents, feels the weight of political pressure from both the federal and the Texas state government.\n\n“I am discouraged because of the devaluation of my chosen career. I love teaching and training the next generation of scientists and leaders,” says Hynds, who studies the regenerative properties of neurons and their applicability to recovery from spinal-cord and traumatic brain injury.\n\n“But with an increase in hostility and lack of appreciation for the value of generating knowledge, it becomes difficult to maintain motivation,” she says. If things get too dire, she adds, she’d consider retiring earlier than planned.",

When administered to mice, the treatment conferred protection against toxins from 17 African snake species and reduced skin damage caused by venoms.\n\nSnakebites are a neglected public-health issue that is estimated to kill roughly 20,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa every year. Around 300,000 snakebites occur annually in this region, and tissue death from venom leads to approximately 10,000 amputations.\n\nCurrent antivenom treatments are made by injecting large animals, such as horses, with small doses of snake venom. The horses produce antibodies against the venom, and the horse plasma is extracted and used to treat bites in people. But these antivenoms are mostly specific to a single snake species.\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the snake behind the bite, and that makes providing timely treatment difficult, says study co-author Anne Ljungars, a bioengineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.\n\nHorse plasma contains a variety of antibodies and other proteins that are recognized as foreign by the human immune system and can thus trigger an adverse immune response in people. Moreover, conventional antivenoms are unable to prevent the local tissue death that snakebites can cause.\n\nCamelid-derived antibodies\n\nTo develop the broad-spectrum antivenom, researchers exposed an alpaca and a llama to venoms from 18 of the most dangerous elapid snake species in sub-Saharan Africa. Elapids are venomous snakes characterized by erect fangs at the front of their mouths, and include cobras, mambas and rinkhals. The team isolated nanobodies — small versions of antibodies that can penetrate tissues and bind to tissue-destroying toxins — from the camelids. Eight of these nanobodies were combined into a single cocktail.\n\nWhen administered to mice that had been injected with snake venom, the recombinant antivenom successfully neutralized venoms from 17 of the 18 target snake species. It also significantly reduced the skin damage caused by venoms, outperforming the widely used Inoserp PAN-AFRICA antivenom.\n\nIt was previously thought that developing a broad-spectrum antivenom would require “an impractically large number of antibodies”, the authors wrote, because the venom of some snake species can contain up to 100 toxins from several protein families.",

          "authors": "Frank A. F. Winiberg, Laura Kreidberg, Julianne I. Moses, Carl J. Percival, Paul I. Palmer",
          "abstract": "In the 30 years since exoplanets were first reported1, telescopes have revealed thousands of them. One of the most surprising things about these objects, which orbit stars other than our Sun, has been their diversity: they range from scorching lava planets with atmospheres of vaporized rock to ocean worlds, and some might even look like Earth.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was launched in 2021, has been revolutionizing our understanding of the atmospheres of these planets, showing details of clouds and haze that were previously unfathomable2. Scientists are starting to learn how winds and turbulence transport compounds on worlds beyond the Solar System3, and are seeing chemical processes that are unlike those found on Earth4.\n\nThis glowing speck is a freezing exoplanet six times the size of Jupiter\n\nSuch insights promise to tell us more about how planets form — and perhaps the origins of life. But many of the findings, such as hints of unfamiliar compounds, are proving challenging to understand.\n\nThe space-science community needs help from scientists in other fields to find answers. Here, we call for closer collaborations between exoplanet researchers and those who work on Earth’s and other planetary atmospheres, as well as stronger links between experimentalists, modellers and astronomers.\n\nFocus on photochemistry\n\nTo understand the molecules and processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres, it is crucial to consider photochemistry — chemical reactions driven by high-energy light from nearby stars. One of JWST’s first observations was of WASP-39 b, a hot and puffy gas giant the size of Jupiter, orbiting a Sun-like star some 215 parsecs (700 light years) away. The electromagnetic spectrum of its atmosphere revealed clear signatures of molecules that astronomers expected to find on such a planet — including carbon dioxide and water. But an unfamiliar opaque region at a wavelength near 4 micrometres puzzled them.\n\nBecause the data set was open source, hundreds of astronomers came together in 2022 in a frenzied collaboration, hosted on the messaging platform Slack, to identify the chemical species responsible for that opaque region. Scores of possibilities were tested before it became clear that it was sulfur dioxide. This was surprising, in that this compound should be rare in hydrogen-dominated gas giants5. Only one process was found to generate sulfur dioxide in high enough concentrations: photochemistry.\n\nSimilar mysteries will present themselves in the future. Modellers, working closely with theoretical and experimental chemists, must improve the photochemical models used to interpret these data accurately. Crucially, there is a lack of comprehensive data on how reaction rates and absorption cross-sections change with temperature and pressure for these exotic atmospheres, as well as a lack of data for molecules that are unfamiliar to our Earth-centric experience.\n\nThe 18-segment gold mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope. Credit: Desiree Stover/NASA\nMake models go further\n\nDetecting a particular molecule in an atmosphere is insufficient to deduce how it was formed. It could have been transported up from deep in the planet’s interior, or many compounds and chemical pathways could have led to its presence, possibly through reaction pathways different from those of the Solar System. But current models are anchored in the physics and chemistry of processes happening on planets local to us, from the gas giants to rocky terrestrials. The models might therefore be misrepresenting, or entirely missing, some chemical or physical processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres.\n\nPhysical factors that need to be better represented in models include the transport and exchange of molecules between a planet’s atmosphere and its surface or interior. The way in which a planet rotates — about its axis and around its host star — can affect its atmospheric chemistry. Some exoplanets, for example, orbit their host star in such a way that only one side is ever illuminated, resulting in a permanent, hot dayside and a permanent, cold nightside. This gives a very different distribution of gases to what is found on Earth. Better numerical models will improve the global framework that describes the physical movement and observable composition of these atmospheres.\n\nJWST’s best images: spectacular stars and spiralling galaxies\n\nAnother cornerstone of models are photochemical parameters, and these also need a careful look. They represent how molecules respond to incoming stellar radiation and how they react with each other — through which reactions, and how fast. To make things more complicated, these parameters can change with pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. The atmospheric environments of currently observed exoplanets diverge from those of planets in the Solar System, and therefore models must simulate a vast range of temperatures, pressures and chemical conditions. This means measuring or calculating parameters that will represent more accurately what happens in exoplanet atmospheres. Reaction parameters are ideally calculated from reaction rates that have been measured in laboratory experiments under conditions relevant to the planet of interest, or from theoretical simulations based on quantum mechanical first principles. However, there are known reactions that lack parameters (and therefore models often use best guesses), and probably a slew of reactions that have yet to be discovered.\n\nHere, we propose two pathways — experimental and theoretical — to expand the catalogue of reactions and their parameters specifically for exoplanets.\n\nExpand interdisciplinary research\n\nMost lab-based research into exoplanet atmospheres has focused on the light-absorption signatures of specific gases such as titanium oxide and phosphine6, or on haze particles, suspended in gas, that are produced from a variety of compounds and can affect the propagation of stellar radiation. Current experiments are conducted in chambers that can replicate the range of observed exoplanet atmospheric temperatures, pressures and chemical compositions, using lamps or plasma to simulate stellar radiation, stellar flares or lightning7.\n\nThese studies show the diversity and complexity of chemical products that can be generated from very simple exoplanet analogue atmospheres, and they provide optical parameters to help interpret observations. But photochemical models are used to predict the chemical make-up of atmospheres by leveraging entire reaction networks — sets of hundreds to thousands of individual reactions that connect different molecules to each other. The current lab studies have not provided the quantitative information needed to develop reaction networks for exoplanets.\n\nAnimation of the rotation of L 98-59 b, a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting a small, low-mass star.\n\nTo build up this capability, the exoplanet community must first identify the lab technologies required for the measurements they need, and there has already been significant progress8,9. To study reaction parameters, for example, scientists must ideally examine specific molecules as they react, and the products that they form.\n\nEquipment from labs that specialize in Earth-based atmospheric chemistry and combustion can be repurposed to some extent. Using combustion-science reactors and shock tubes, together with spectroscopic or mass-spectrometric detection techniques, would immediately widen the ranges of pressures and temperatures that can be studied. And rather than oxygen, which is abundant in Earth’s atmosphere, these techniques can be tuned to study species such as sulfur compounds and methane behave, which might be more abundant elsewhere. Similarly, expanding the user community of Earth-science labs to include exoplanet scientists would help to maximize the scientific return on this expensive infrastructure. In the longer term, however, exoplanet research needs dedicated facilities.\n\nJWST reveals first evidence of an exoplanet’s surprising chemistry\n\nNew techniques will also be required to measure exotic target molecules or particles specifically for exoplanets. The science will be shaped by, for example, the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory, which will focus on ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation, or the mid-infrared Large Interferometer for Exoplanets. These complementary space-based telescope concepts will help to provide the improved observational data needed to test and constrain the chemical and physical models of exoplanet atmospheres. This has been the case in other fields, for example, with the ion-imaging technique created at Sandia National Laboratories’ Combustion Research Facility in Livermore, California10. The technique records the velocity of charged particles that result from a molecule being broken apart by light or in a collision, and was originally developed to advance our knowledge of combustion. Future observations could motivate similar technological developments that will provide precise, molecular-level parameters to inform reaction networks used in the photochemical models of exoplanet science. What’s more, the development of technologies for exoplanet research would ultimately benefit the Earth-science and combustion-science communities, too.\n\nUse first principles\n\nThere are, however, reactions and molecules that are too difficult or dangerous to probe experimentally, even in lab settings. The extreme high and low pressures of exoplanet atmospheres, or reactions that are very slow, can be hard to study owing to the limitations of the instruments used. For slow reactions, minute changes in molecular concentration can be smaller than the random noise in the instrumentation; at low pressures, molecular densities might be below the detection limit.\n\nIn such cases, chemists can apply theoretical tools to calculate key parameters over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. With increasing computer power and the integration of artificial intelligence, such calculations are rapidly improving in terms of accuracy and efficiency11. Yet, reactions that involve large molecules or heavy atoms remain hard to predict accurately.",

          "abstract": "When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows...: Common Knowledge and the Science of Harmony, Hypocrisy and Outrage Steven Pinker Allen Lane (2025)\n\nHow do we know when others know what we know? Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker’s latest book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows, delves into how ‘common knowledge’ can cement or explode social relations.\n\nCommon knowledge — awareness of mutual understanding — can explain the emergence of social-media shaming mobs, academic cancel culture and revolutions that seem to erupt from nowhere. It drives how people coordinate with others and can explain everything from awkward first-date conversations to financial bubbles and stock-market crashes.\n\nPinker tells Nature why it helps to better understand the ways we get into each other’s heads — and what happens when we know that we have.\n\nWhat is common knowledge?\n\nIt is the state in which I know something, you know it, I know that you know it, you know that I know it, I know that you know that I know that you know it, and so on, ad infinitum. It differs from private knowledge, in which someone knows something without knowing whether anyone knows they know it.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThat’s a lot of ‘knowing’!\n\nCommon knowledge is usually tacit, and it can be generated at a stroke when we witness something that is conspicuous, public or self-evident — I see something while seeing you see it, and vice versa. From there, we can deduce that each observer knows that the other knows it, and so on, to as many levels as we care to reel out — a process that cognitive psychologists call recursive mentalizing.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCommon knowledge is necessary for coordination: two or more people making arbitrary choices that benefit them, as long as they make the same choice. A classic example is a rendezvous. It’s not enough to know that your friend likes to go to Starbucks and so to head there, because he might know that you like to go to Pret A Manger and head there. It’s not even enough to know that he knows that you know that he likes Starbucks, and head there, because he knows that you know that he knows that you like Pret, which is where he might go.\n\nNothing short of common knowledge will get you to the same place at the same time. The obvious means of achieving this is a phone call, because direct speech is an excellent common-knowledge generator. The next best thing is common salience. The friends might gravitate to a nearby landmark, such as Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar Square, because each can anticipate that it would pop into the mind of the other.\n\nWhat other examples are there?\n\nOur conventions depend on common knowledge, starting with language. The word ‘rose’ refers to a rose for no reason other than that everyone knows that everyone knows it does. Another convention is driving on the left rather than the right, or vice versa: there’s no reason to choose one side or the other, but every reason to choose the same side as everyone else. This convention is backed up by law, but that doesn’t matter: people have an incentive to follow the convention as long as they know that everyone else is following it.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nEven legally binding conventions depend more on common knowledge than on enforcement, because no government has enough snitches and rooftop snipers to enforce every law. When ‘no smoking’ signs were first put up, people didn’t report violators to the smoking police, but they could stand their ground when asking a smoker to stop and expect them to give way, because the smoker expected the complainant to stand their ground.\n\nThis is also how we can have social and moral norms, such as not telling ethnic jokes, revealing certain body parts in public or insulting someone’s looks. The norms can persist by the common expectation that everyone knows that everyone knows there are certain things decent people just don’t do.\n\nHow can common knowledge fail?\n\nWhen there’s a public signal that a belief might no longer be commonly held, the doubt can be self-fulfilling. In a bank run, a rumour that the bank might not have enough reserves to cover withdrawals can drive people to withdraw their savings out of fear that other people are withdrawing theirs out of the same fear. That can crash the bank, and, as the doubts reverberate, the economy.\n\nWhen then-US president Franklin D. Roosevelt said in 1933, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”, he was expressing a theorem of common knowledge. Other runaway phenomena, such as financial bubbles or hyperinflation — or even the hoarding of toilet paper during a pandemic — are also driven by common expectation.\n\nThese are old ideas, so why write the book?\n\nI was led into the study of common knowledge by my interest in language. A lot of speech can’t be interpreted at face value. For example, “If you could pass the salt, that would be brilliant” has a veiled imperative meaning: “Give me the salt.” I wanted to know why we don’t all just say what we mean.\n\nCommon knowledge is what aligns us in social relationships. Our rituals of ignoring the elephant in the room, not blurting out everything we think, framing criticism tactfully, and other exercises of social skill consist of judgements of whether to make some fact common knowledge or whether to avoid doing so.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nDo you include any fresh ideas?\n\nI advance a hypothesis — which has driven my research over the past 15 years — that social relationships (such as friendship, romance, authority and transactional partnerships) are coordination games, ratified by common knowledge signals such as eye contact, laughter, dominance displays and direct speech.\n\nAnd I address the cognitive question of what goes on in people’s heads when they have common knowledge, given that multiple nested propositions about beliefs are cognitively strenuous.",

          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "When Robert Hooke gazed through his microscope at a slice of cork and coined the term ‘cell’ in 1665, he was really looking at just the walls of the dead cells. The squishy contents typically found within would become objects of ongoing study. But for many plant scientists, the walls themselves faded into the background. They were considered passive containers for the exciting biology inside.\n\n“For a long time, the cell wall was really thought to be dead,” says Alice Cheung, a plant molecular biologist and biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It wasn’t until the late twentieth century, Cheung says, that scientists began to reveal the cell wall for the vibrant, ever-changing structure it is. Even then, its complex mix of sugar molecules linked into long, branching polysaccharides kept away all but the most intrepid biochemists.\n\nCentury-old genetics mystery of Mendel’s peas finally solved\n\nBut now, with the help of modern molecular methods to analyse the wall’s make-up and assembly, researchers are starting to uncover more. They’re finding that the cell wall is an active, even chatty participant in cellular growth, reproduction and responses to infection. It’s constantly receiving and sending signals about its shape and composition. By eavesdropping on those signals, and tweaking or adding to them, scientists are exploring innovative ways to improve agriculture with cell-wall science: protecting crops from disease and engineering new plants or sturdy hybrids.\n\n“The plant cell wall is one of the most sophisticated systems in terms of communication,” says Li-Jia Qu, a plant biologist at Peking University in Beijing. His long-term goal is to use what’s been learnt about those messages to interbreed distantly related plants, creating exciting crops that could expand agriculture into new lands.\n\nThese walls can talk\n\nThe wall is the plant’s interface with its environment, including salt and other stressors or disease agents such as moulds, so it must notice damage and adapt accordingly.\n\nThe cell walls of a growing plant are constructed mainly from polysaccharides, including stiff cables of cellulose and jellified strands of pectin. The latter are highly complex molecules, branched in diverse ways and decorated with various extras such as methyl groups. “It’s like a giant bowl of many types of pasta, all mixed together,” says Charles Anderson, a plant cell biologist at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in State College.\n\nAnd although the wall protects the contents within, some pathogens use enzymes to drill through it and infect the cells. This creates polysaccharide fragments that signal to the cell that something has breached the wall. When the cell senses these pieces, along with fragments of the infecting pathogen’s cell wall, it activates genes in the plant’s immune pathways. In response, the plant can produce an extra polysaccharide, called callose, which reinforces the cell wall. It also manufactures defensive molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.\n\nSuch signals are already being co-opted by farmers. By spraying molecules derived from the cell walls of algae or fungi over their fields, they can prime the plants for pathogens that might arrive later. By doing this, they activate the immune response “and let the natural mechanism of the plant fight the infection”, says Antonio Molina, a plant biologist at the Technical University of Madrid. The method could help growers to avoid harsh fungicides, he says.\n\nMolina has co-founded two companies that make use of this technique, making extracts from fungi or plants as crop protectives.\n\nThe puzzle-piece shape of these Arabidopsis thaliana pavement cells is created in part through signalling from the cell wall. Credit: Raymond Wightman/Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge and Alexis Peaucelle/INRAE\n\nThe current inoculants are fairly crude mixtures derived from plants or pathogens, says Cyril Zipfel, a plant immunologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He’s working to understand the signalling that underlies the immune pathway, which should enable scientists to create more specific, or even synthetic, treatments.\n\nThere are trade-offs, however, Molina says. For one, the effects last for only three or four weeks. Reapplication for slow-growing crops could get costly, but Molina thinks that farmers might be able to focus the use of inoculants to times when risk of infection is high, such as after it rains, to prevent mildew.\n\nAnother challenge is that whenever plants devote resources to boosting their defences, this takes materials and energy away from growth, so farmers must apply the treatments judiciously.\n\nPowered by pectin\n\nPlant growth itself demonstrates how the idea of a cell wall as a static shell is insufficient. Yes, the cell does need the wall as a physical container; otherwise, it would burst from the enormous water pressure inside it. But for plant cells to grow, the cell walls must expand first, says Sebastian Wolf, a plant molecular biologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany.\n\nThis is where pectin comes in. Pectin is a complicated molecule constructed from at least a dozen sugars, connected by more than 20 types of linkage, says Wolf. “It’s actually so complex that we don’t know what it looks like,” he adds. Pectin is also dynamic, undergoing frequent modifications. Depending on those modifications, it can be rigid, supporting a sturdy plant, or softer when the plant needs to grow. That’s why pectin is often used to make marmalade: the initially soft pectin molecules cross-link and soak up water, taking on a stiffer, gelatinous consistency.\n\nHow CRISPR could yield the next blockbuster crop\n\nIn the growing plant, there’s one key modification that makes pectin soft or rigid: methyl groups attached to its component sugars. When the wall needs more materials for growth or reinforcement, the cell inside manufactures a methyl-decorated form that is thought to be fairly soluble, so it can be secreted into the surrounding wall. Once the pectin is incorporated into the wall, it starts to firm up. This happens when enzymes remove the methyls, uncovering negatively charged atoms in the sugar molecules underneath. Calcium ions in the wall bind to two sugars at a time and cross-link the pectin into a stiffer material that can absorb water.\n\nAs a graduate student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in the early 2000s, Wolf was interested in the effects of methyl groups on pectin, so he made a mutant of the cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a favourite of plant geneticists, that was unable to take off the methyl groups. He expected this to soften the cell walls, but the plants came out weirder than anticipated, with long, wavy roots1. They reminded him of mutants with defects in cellular signalling involving cellulose, leading him to wonder whether pectin, too, had a role not just in cell-wall structure, but also in cellular conversations.\n\nContinuing this research at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment in Versailles, Wolf discovered a cell-wall signal that contributes to plant growth controls1,2. The input that Wolf found starts when cell-surface receptors notice an overabundance of methyl-decorated pectin. What seems to happen in response is that they tell the cell to adjust its production pipelines, making more of the methyl--removing enzyme so that the wall can firm up the pectin.\n\nCell-wall signalling can even help growing cells to adopt fancy forms, including the puzzle-piece shapes seen in what are known as pavement cells — interlocking surface cells that give strength and structure to plant leaves (see ‘Cell walls fitting together’). When Anderson and his colleagues studied the signals sent by the cell wall as pavement cells developed in A. thaliana, they found evidence for another conversation initiated by methyl-free pectin and a receptor, called FERONIA, that senses this form of pectin3. But cellulose matters here, too. Both cell-wall components are needed to strengthen the indented portions of the puzzle piece, known as the ‘necks’. Without that fortification, the rest of the cell bulges into that space. If FERONIA isn’t present, the indentations don’t go as deep as they normally would.\n\nHere’s how they think the indentation process happens in a healthy leaf cell: methyl-free pectin in the cell wall is a sign that there’s enough pectin to support a neck. This pectin sticks to a receptor complex on the cell surface that includes FERONIA. In response, the cell starts manufacturing cellulose in the same place. Together, the cellulose and pectin strengthen the wall so that it can support the indentation.\n\nWolf is continuing to investigate the role of the cell wall in shaping cells, and reported in a preprint earlier this year that plant stem cells must control the methyl status of wall pectin to maintain their stemness and form new plant parts4. He thinks that there is potential to use these signalling pathways to influence the way in which plants are shaped. “You can fundamentally change how plants grow and how they look,” he speculates. For example, when plants make less cellulose, they grow into “stubby” forms. But, he cautions, researchers need to learn more about the underlying growth pathways first.\n\nHybrid potential\n\nThe FERONIA receptor in those puzzle-piece cells has turned out to be a key player in cell-wall signalling. FERONIA is found all over plants, and interacts with a range of partners to influence not just leaf-cell shape, but also a variety of other systems, from root growth to environmental-stress responses. Given that FERONIA binds to pectin to maintain the wall’s integrity, without it, the wall becomes weak and porous. Remarkably, mutants lacking FERONIA survive, although they’re pretty unhealthy, Qu says: they sprout wrinkled, curly leaves, and straggle along the ground because they lack the vasculature to hold them upright. They are “very small, tiny”, says Qu. They can make seeds, he adds, “but very few”.",

They discovered an intermediate compound — called premethylenomycin C lactone — whose antimicrobial activity was 100 times stronger than that of the final product. Tiny doses of it killed strains of bacteria known to cause hard-to-treat infections.\n\nFive ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis\n\nThe discovery was a ‘surprise’, says study co-author Gregory Challis, a chemical biologist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK. “As humans, we anticipate that evolution perfects the end product, and so you’d expect the final molecule to be the best antibiotic, and the intermediates to be less potent,” he says. But the finding “is a great example of what a ‘blind watchmaker’ evolution is. And it’s a good way of exemplifying it in a very molecular way,” adds Challis.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance is a growing threat, projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. Researchers say that the discovery of a potent antimicrobial compound might lead to fresh drugs to tackle resistance.\n\nThe work underscores “the potential of such studies to identify new bioactive chemical scaffolds from ‘old’ pathways”, says Gerard Wright, a biochemist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.\n\nAccidental discovery\n\nIn 2006, Challis and his colleagues began studying the molecular pathway through which Streptomyces coelicolor produces methylenomycin A. To do this, they deleted the genes encoding enzymes involved in each step, one by one. Their work built on earlier efforts in 2002 to sequence the bacterium’s genome4.\n\nNew antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria discovered in technician’s garden\n\nBy 2010, the team had mapped the mechanism that the bacterium used to make methylenomycin A and identified several intermediate molecules that it produced along the way.\n\n“We were just doing very fundamental blue-sky research,” says Challis. “We discovered these intermediates, and we left them for a while because we didn’t quite know what to do with them.”\n\nIt was several years later — around 2017 — that a PhD student at Challis’s laboratory tested these intermediate molecules for antimicrobial activity.\n\nThese tests revealed that two molecules, including premethylenomycin C lactone, were much more effective than methylenomycin A at targeting seven strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, which infects skin, blood and internal organs, and Enterococcus faecium, which can cause deadly bloodstream and urinary infections.\n\nThe lowest concentration of premethylenomycin C lactone needed to kill drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was just 1 microgram per millilitre, compared with 256 micrograms per millilitre of methylenomycin A. The compound could also kill bacteria at much smaller doses than those needed for vancomycin, a ‘last line’ antibiotic used to treat infections caused by two Enterococcus faecium strains, to be effective.",

          "abstract": "Hurricane Melissa was expected to unleash as much as 75 centimetres of rain on some parts of Jamaica. Credit: NOAA/Getty\n\nAs Hurricane Melissa exploded into a category-5 storm over the weekend, scientists forecast its trajectory and growth with a powerful new tool — helping to inform warnings to Jamaica and other nations that the storm has devasted. That tool, an artificial intelligence (AI) forecast model developed by Google DeepMind, is successfully predicting how Melissa and other dangerous storms arise and evolve.\n\nThe model is being used this year by the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), a leading source of hurricane information in the region, in real time for the first time. It is a machine-learning tool specific to hurricanes and a step beyond earlier models developed by London-based Google DeepMind that can forecast weather conditions quickly and accurately.\n\n“I’m not sure I’ve seen such good results from a new model so fast,” says James Franklin, a retired atmospheric scientist who was formerly the branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the NHC in Miami, Florida.\n\nCompared with other hurricane models used by the NHC, the DeepMind model is “definitely toward the front of the pack if not at the front of the pack”, says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. “It’s pretty impressive.”\n\nA brewing storm\n\nDeepMind’s developers trained the model on two data sets: a large database of global weather observations and a smaller database of observations that included nearly 5,000 cyclones from the past 45 years1. Adding that second, cyclone-specific database might be the reason that the DeepMind model performs better on hurricane forecasts than do other AI-based forecast models, Franklin says. In particular, scientists have long struggled to improve their forecasts of a storm’s intensity — but the DeepMind model seems to capture this well.\n\nDeepMind AI weather forecaster beats world-class system\n\nAs early as 21 October — long before it was obvious that Melissa would be a monster storm — the model predicted a 50–60% chance that it would reach category 5, the DeepMind team says. On 23 October the model estimated that the storm had an 80% or higher chance of reaching this most powerful category. The following day, NHC forecasters cited the DeepMind model as they reported “a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane”.\n\nStill, the DeepMind team cautions against reading too much into the predictions of a single storm: “We are happy to have been able to contribute useful guidance to NHC, but we caution against representing the model’s capabilities based on a single case or metric,” says Ferran Alet, a research scientist at DeepMind.\n\nThe NHC began using the DeepMind model at the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in June. For the 13 named storms that have formed so far, the DeepMind model has generally performed well in predicting both their tracks and intensities, McNoldy says. “To have something that just came out in June already be something we’re talking about as being front of the pack — that’s extraordinary,” he says.\n\nCurtailed flights\n\nThe NHC continues to operate even though the US government is shut down. Most federal employees — including those flying into the storm on ‘hurricane hunter’ aircraft to gather measurements — are not being paid.",

In the story, an executive at an arms company proudly pitches swarms of tiny drones that use facial recognition to spot and execute its customers’ enemies in a crowd. Spoiler alert: things don’t end well for student activists targeted by the weapons system because of their online political profiles.\n\nAt the time of the film’s 2017 release, Paul Scharre, a former special-operations infantry soldier and executive vice-president of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC, said that although a Slaughterbots-style scenario was technologically feasible, there were defensive measures against the type of attack portrayed.\n\nScharre, who has helped to draft US government policies on autonomous weapons and published a book on the topic in 2019, fears that humanity is at risk of an arms race that could lead to unreliable, hard-to-control machines with the power to decide when and whom to kill. Nature spoke to Scharre about how technology is enabling these new weapons systems.\n\nHow do you define autonomous weapons systems, and how widely used are they?\n\nThere is no internationally agreed definition of autonomous weapons, which can complicate discussions about them. I define them as weapons that, once launched by humans, can search for, find and attack targets on their own. Since the 1980s, many countries have acquired air-defence systems that can automatically track and shoot down incoming threats, for example.\n\nWhen people debate autonomous weapons today, however, they are generally referring to those used in offensive combat. An Israeli drone system called Harpy hunts targets that emit radar signals, such as ground-based air defences designed to detect incoming aircraft and missiles. Such offensive systems are designed to be used in specific scenarios, and I’m not aware that they have been used widely in combat.\n\nHumans are still generally making the final decisions about targets, but the pace of technological development means I can certainly see a world in which offensive weapons systems with greater autonomy become widely used.\n\nCan you give an example of a cutting-edge system in use today?\n\nUkraine has been experimenting with autonomous terminal-guidance systems, also called the autonomous last-mile solution. In this kind of system, human operators navigate a drone towards a moving vehicle or a person, for example, and once it has locked on, even if the communications link to the operator is severed, the drone can continue to track and then strike the target on its own. Although a human is still choosing the target, these systems are a potential stepping stone towards weapons with greater autonomy.\n\nHow do you see the future development of these systems?\n\nAs well as terminal-guidance systems, we have also seen drones equipped with machine learning being used to identify targets in Ukraine. It is not a huge leap to see these two technologies being combined to enable systems to hunt for and attack targets without human involvement.\n\nCountries are investing in ways to counter the increased use of drones, such as jamming their communications. If drones can operate autonomously, then jamming isn’t such a big problem. So I think we’re going to see more and more autonomy in warfare.\n\nOne vision of the future is that autonomous weapons systems are given the authority to strike targets within kill zones, or ranges of space and time, on the basis of certain criteria.",

          "abstract": "When the United Nations negotiations on plastic pollution in Geneva, Switzerland, collapsed in August, observers declared the outcome an abject failure and the process broken. Earlier this month, reports that the chair of the talks, ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso, would step down deepened uncertainty.\n\nTrust and science: the essential elements missing from plastics treaty talks\n\nMany media outlets saw a failure of multilateralism, but what I saw was fatigue. Just as the ‘failed’ 2009 Copenhagen climate summit paved the way for the 2015 Paris agreement, this plastics-treaty breakdown could be an inflection point — if we learn the right lessons and rethink the process.\n\nAs a researcher of global environmental governance, I have followed the negotiations from the start. I served as an adviser on Rwanda’s delegation in 2022, when it co-sponsored the UN Environment Assembly resolution to end plastic pollution. Since 2023, I have led the observer delegation of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. During this time, I have watched nations debate the treaty’s scope, restating positions with little progress. But individuals from every country tried to keep faith in the process.\n\nThe negotiations have stalled partly because a false morality play of ambition versus obstruction took hold. Over the years, I have witnessed how this ‘heroes versus villains’ narrative has obscured the complex realities at stake.\n\nBut the story is never that simple. From the outset, nations disagreed on what ending plastic pollution meant. For some, it was about improving waste management, recycling systems and circular economies. For others, it meant curbing the manufacture of primary polymers. That ambiguity set into a geopolitical divide. For some nations, plastics manufacturing underlies economic survival and political stability. For small island states and vulnerable coastal areas, plastic pollution threatens human survival. Yet every country must protect its ecosystems.\n\nEnvironmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better\n\nDespite clear science and mounting public pressure, negotiations became mired in the politics of survival — between nations concerned about the economic realities and the countries most affected by the ecological urgencies. I spoke to Vayas Valdivieso, who reflected on “the magnitude of the talks, given the implications — for the environment, health and the economy”. Negotiating a treaty that touches every country and spans energy, trade, chemical and waste sectors by 2024, in just two years, was politically ambitious and procedurally unrealistic — a timeline that increased complexity and hardened positions.\n\nNegotiators must acknowledge the economic realities that underpin resistance and the ecological urgencies that demand change. Historically, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has provided an architecture for environmental diplomacy — with the authority to convene but not to command. It must revive its role as an impartial steward for conveying reliable scientific data, and for creating structures and spaces in which states can seek alignment. Furthermore, it must help to provide financial, institutional and technological support for collective action.\n\nDespite divisions, all parties converge around sustainable product design, resource efficiency, waste management and circular-economy principles. Now, we need what I call radical incrementalism: a bold vision coupled with practical phased steps. The 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, championed by UNEP, offers such a model. When negotiations resume, three immediate actions can help.",

          "abstract": "The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits) Maximilian Kasy Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nHave you felt dizzy from the constant flood of articles claiming that artificial intelligence will either boost economic productivity and be humanity’s best friend, or become superhuman and wipe everyone out? There’s a reason for the confusion — it is not accidental.\n\nIn The Means of Prediction, economist Maximilian Kasy argues that one side of this polarized debate is just cashing in on the current wave of techno-enthusiasm. This group, led by wealthy investors and technology executives who insist that AI tools will solve all of humanity’s problems, is opposed to the models being regulated by governments. At its core, Kasy says, it’s a calculated power grab. Meanwhile, some philosophers and others warning us about apocalyptic AI futures are also funded by large donations tied to those fears. In short, both camps have something to sell.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nHowever, given the scale of investment in AI, the public needs to have a clear grasp of what the technology really means for our future, especially if the economy were to start haemorrhaging jobs. Kasy’s book, which serves as an introductory crash course, suggests that by developing basic literacy about how AI works and what prediction engines do, people can learn to distinguish genuine progress from corporate spin.\n\nHe also argues that the public should see the AI roll-out as a pressing issue of growing inequality and concentrated power. Indeed, the book’s title alludes to political theorist Karl Marx’s argument that whoever controls the ‘means of production’ controls the structure and direction of society.\n\nBroader public debate over who gets to pick the objectives of AI systems is crucial, he argues. AI-driven prediction engines already influence hiring decisions at big corporations, shape what content is shown on social-media feeds and can help the military to select targets for air strikes.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nBut for the public to engage in the debate effectively, AI’s inner workings must be made accessible. Kasy devotes a substantial part of his book to explain, in plain language, how the technology works, unpacking terms such as machine learning and deep learning. A useful section called ‘neural nets are not artificial brains’ explains that neural networks — computer systems made of interconnected nodes that learn patterns from data — do not mimic how the human brain functions.\n\nTaking down this metaphor is important, because it’s one of the main ways in which the tech industry obscures what AI really is. In practice, AI systems are built and controlled by companies to serve commercial goals, not to think or feel in the way humans do.\n\nKasy goes on to examine the required framework for regulating AI, with discussions on fairness, explainability and privacy. He argues that decisions about how these systems are designed and deployed should not be left to corporate boardrooms alone. But his perspective is that of an academic, and regulation in the real world has to actually work.\n\nDealing with bias\n\nIf you wanted a breezy introduction to AI but don’t have the time or money for the author’s machine-learning or economics courses at the University of Oxford, UK, this book offers a high-level overview. But its tone can feel pedantic, overly technical and long-winded. There are few fresh examples of what can go wrong with algorithms — or deeper analyses of familiar case studies — and much of the discussion remains theoretical.\n\nTake fairness, for example. The author introduces the concept of merit-based discrimination — hiring someone less qualified for non-monetary reasons. He illustrates this with a hypothetical hiring algorithm designed to pick the most ‘productive’ workers. In this set-up, any unfair treatment would simply mean that the company is not maximizing profits. Similarly, as long as hiring decisions maximize profit, the company is assumed to be fair.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science",

          "abstract": "Sex between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes lasts about 14 seconds.Credit: Jacopo Razzauti/The Rockefeller University\n\nFemale mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus and other diseases are actually in charge during sex, according to a study1 that challenges the long-held view that they are passive participants.\n\nMosquito blood meals reveal history of human infections\n\nLeslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, and her team were intrigued by the observation that male mosquitoes of the Aedes genus seem to pursue females constantly, yet females typically mate only once in their lifetimes. “The question was: how are the females able to say no?” Vosshall says.\n\nUsing fluorescent sperm and some careful camera work, the researchers showed for the first time that, when a male Aedes mosquito initiates contact, the female extends the tip of her genitals by a fraction of a millimetre — roughly the thickness of a human fingernail. If the female does not give this subtle, but crucial, signal, the male’s efforts fail, and copulation does not occur.\n\nMosquito sex lasts only a few seconds, and usually occurs in mid-air. These factors, combined with the minute size of the genitals, have made it difficult to study exactly what’s going on, Vosshall says, adding that the scientists who previously studied mosquito breeding probably just shrugged and said, “Yeah, the male is in charge.” Her team’s findings, which could have implications for controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes, were published today in the journal Current Biology1.\n\nFluorescent sperm\n\nTo study the intricate mating process of Aedes aegypti — the main species of mosquito that transmits dengue — Vosshall and her colleagues first engineered transgenic males that produce either green or red fluorescent sperm. Then they put some of each type into a cage with females of the same species for seven days. When the females were dissected at the end of that period, more than 90% of them had sperm of only one colour stored in their bodies, supporting the idea that they mate only once in their lifetime.\n\nIn a second set of experiments, the team filmed the mating process using an elaborate set-up. The researchers glued a female mosquito to a metal pin, so that she could move her wings and legs but not fly away, like a trapeze artist in a rigid tether. They then introduced free-flying males into the cage, and recorded the interactions between the male and female genitals at high resolution.\n\nMale Aedes mosquitoes use drumstick-like genital structures called gonostyli (shown here, crossed) to tap on the genitalia of females when initiating sex.Credit: H. Amalia Pasolli, Anurag Sharma/The Rockefeller University\n\nLeah Houri-Zeevi, a researcher in Vosshall’s lab, spent hundreds of hours looking at the videos, frame by frame. She noticed that when a male is trying to copulate, he doesn’t simply extend his sex organ — the equivalent of a penis — towards the female. Instead, he first taps the female genitalia with drumstick-like structures called gonostyli. In response to the tapping, a virgin female might elongate the tip of her genitalia, to enable copulation. Houri-Zeevi noticed that non-virgin females, however, typically kept their genitals retracted, blocking further mating attempts.",

However, writing in Nature, Horn et al.5 report that high-pressure chemical reactions between some planets and their massive gaseous atmospheres might have produced large quantities of water — creating water-rich planets close to their host star.",

          "abstract": "Pollution levels in Delhi have hit hazardous levels, prompting the Indian government to try cloud seeding as a radical approach to tackling the problem.Credit: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAn ambitious attempt by the Indian government to combat Delhi’s hazardous air pollution by inducing artificial rain has failed to trigger any precipitation, prompting researchers to question why the experiment went ahead.\n\nThe experiment was conducted in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur on 28 October. Two aircraft flew over several areas of Delhi and released flares containing particles of silver iodide and sodium chloride into the atmosphere, with the goal of catalysing condensation and producing rain.\n\nThe Delhi government and IIT Kanpur say that the seeding experiment led to a slight decrease in pollution, but scientists think the improvement had little to do with the intervention.\n\n“It seems like the skies have cleared, but it is because the weather conditions have changed. That’s no credit to the seeding efforts,” says Shahzad Gani, an aerosol scientist at IIT Delhi.\n\nToxic smog\n\nEvery winter for almost a decade, Delhi and surrounding areas have battled hazardous levels of fine particulate matter in the air, produced by industry, vehicle emissions and the burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states. On some days, pollution levels are up to 20 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended limits.\n\nIn October and November, the air in and around Delhi becomes cooler, drier and more stable, which slows the dispersal of pollutants. The Delhi government has tried taking various measures to improve air quality, such as shutting down polluting industries and banning firecrackers during Diwali festivities. But poor compliance has meant that most of these initiatives have had little effect. This year, when pollution levels became hazardous the night after Diwali celebrations, the government decided to take a different approach.\n\nThe technique of cloud seeding — firing small particles such as silver iodide and sodium chloride into existing clouds to help water vapour to condense — has been around since the mid-twentieth century. But reliable proof that the process can induce rainfall on demand is lacking, and its ability to disperse pollution has not been tested, says Gani.\n\nRoxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, says the atmospheric conditions were not suitable for the experiment to succeed. “Cloud seeding can only enhance rainfall if there are already moist, convective clouds with sufficient liquid water. In dry or stagnant air, there’s simply nothing to seed,” Koll says. At the time of the experiment, “two storms — a depression in the Arabian Sea and a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal — were pulling the moisture into those areas and making Delhi drier”.\n\nAnother trial scheduled for Wednesday was cancelled. Manindra Agrawal, director of IIT Kanpur, told Indian news agency ANI that the experiment will be postponed until a day when the moisture content of clouds is at least 40–50%.\n\nEarlier this year, the Royal Rainmaking Project in Thailand tried to combat pollution by spraying cold water from planes, hoping that this would allow some of the particulate matter trapped in a layer of warm air in the atmosphere to dissipate.\n\nLong-term solution",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Under President Donald Trump, the US government is gutting scientific research. The National Institutes of Health has cut almost US$2 billion of grants that were already approved, and the National Science Foundation has terminated more than 1,400 grants. And the president has even bigger plans to eviscerate science. His proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut non-defence-related research and development by 36%.\n\n“They have cancelled wholesale a wide variety of research efforts in midstream,” says John Holdren at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was the science adviser to former president Barack Obama during both his terms. “They intend to now solidify it with cuts in the budgets.”\n\nThe cancelled and threatened research is a mixture of ‘applied’ work that has stated applications, which can be commercial in nature, and ‘basic’ or ‘blue skies’ research, intended to develop new knowledge.\n\nFrom MRI to Ozempic: breakthroughs that show why fundamental research must be protected\n\nBasic research is easily mocked because it can seem impractical, but, in fact, it is a major driver of economic growth. “The return on investment in basic research — the return to society — is very high, typically multiple dollars back per dollar invested,” says Holdren.\n\nThe US funding cuts will hit basic research particularly hard because the government has historically been the prime supporter of fundamental research. The private sector will never invest enough in such research, says Holdren. “The timescale for returns is too long and the ability of the funder to capture those returns too uncertain,” he says. “That’s the reason that the funding of fundamental research is, at its base, a responsibility of government.”\n\nAlthough it’s impossible to estimate how the reductions in federal support might limit future discoveries, scientists point to a long list of findings that emerged out of fundamental research and went on to change the world. Here are a few examples.\n\nFrom hot springs to DNA forensics\n\nIn the summer of 1966, while he was an undergraduate at Indiana University, Hudson Freeze went to live in a cabin on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. He was working for microbiologist Thomas Brock, who was convinced that certain microorganisms were living at surprisingly high temperatures. Dodging bears, and the traffic jams they caused, Freeze visited the hot springs every day to sample their bacteria.\n\nThomas Brock stands by Mushroom Spring in Yellowstone National Park in 1967. Bacteria that thrive in high-temperature fluids were discovered at the site.Credit: Thomas Brock/USGS\n\nOn 19 September, Freeze succeeded in growing a sample of yellowish microbes from Mushroom Spring. Under a microscope, he found an array of cells collected from the near-boiling fluids. “I was seeing something that nobody had ever seen before,” says Freeze, now at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. “I still get goosebumps when I remember looking into the microscope.”\n\nThree years later, Freeze and Brock described one of the bacteria, which they called Thermus aquaticus1. It grew best at 70 °C. Then, in 1970, they isolated an enzyme2 from T. aquaticus, which performed sugar metabolism at an optimal temperature of 95 °C. By then, Freeze had left for graduate studies and shifted his priorities to slime moulds. However, other researchers kept studying T. aquaticus, and in 1976, a team at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio isolated another enzyme3: a ‘DNA polymerase’ that could synthesize new DNA at 80 °C.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nSeven years later, this Taq polymerase would prove to be just what biochemist Kary Mullis needed to create the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method for rapidly making thousands upon thousands of copies of a single fragment of DNA4. Mullis needed high temperatures to break DNA molecules apart, so he also needed a polymerase that worked at high temperatures to avoid repetitive heating and cooling.\n\nToday, PCR is an indispensable tool in everything from medicine — where it’s used to match organ donors with recipients and in the diagnosis of cancers — to DNA fingerprinting that can help police to identify killers.\n\nThe origins of MRI\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a mainstay of modern medicine. It can generate detailed images of a person’s internal anatomy — revealing, for instance, abnormal structures in the heart or whether a tumour has grown or shrunk. A variant called functional MRI (fMRI) tracks changing blood flow in the brain, which has enabled researchers to discover fundamental insights about how the brain works. What’s more, MRI is non-invasive and doesn’t require the use of radioactive substances or ionizing radiation, unlike many other imaging methods.\n\nMRI emerged from research in the 1930s into the physical properties of atomic nuclei, and of the fundamental particles within them. It was “pretty esoteric stuff” with “no applications really in sight or in mind”, says Carmen Giunta, a chemist at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York.\n\nResearch in the 1930s by Isidor Rabi eventually helped in the development of MRI scanning technology.Credit: RDB/ullstein bild/Getty\n\nOne key discovery on the path to MRI machines involved studies of protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei. Such particles have a property called spin that describes their angular momentum.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nIn the 1930s, physicist Isidor Rabi and his colleagues were investigating spin by firing beams of atomic nuclei through magnetic fields. Protons and neutrons, depending on the orientations of their spins, have slightly different energy levels when exposed to magnetic fields. “The resonance method that he developed was a way of detecting when these spins change their orientation in the presence of a magnetic field,” says Giunta. For this work, Rabi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance found its first uses in chemical laboratories. Because atomic nuclei are sensitive to their surroundings, careful measurements of magnetic resonance could be used to determine how atoms were connected in large molecules. From the 1970s onwards, it was fashioned into a tool for imaging biological tissues. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003 for their work in developing MRI.\n\nRoot vegetables and flat-screen TVs\n\nIt started in Prague in early 1888, when botanist Friedrich Reinitzer extracted chemicals called cholesterol esters from carrot roots. One of the substances — crystals of cholesteryl benzoate — did something unexpected. Normal crystals, when heated, lose both their solidity and colour at the same temperature, but these did not. “They lost their solidity at 145 °C but retained their bluish colour, which they only lost at 178 °C,” says Michel Mitov at the University of the Côte d’Azur in Nice, France.\n\nOther researchers had seen similar behaviours before, but Reinitzer recognized that there might be an important new phenomenon at work. Unsure how to explain it, on 14 March he wrote a long letter to physicist Otto Lehmann in Aachen, in what is now Germany. “Lehmann was the perfect colleague for continuing and reproducing the observation,” says Mitov, because he had built a microscope with a heated stage, which meant he could observe the crystals’ behaviour in real time. The two exchanged letters and samples for weeks, and Reinitzer presented their initial results at a meeting in Vienna in May.\n\nOtto Lehmann made key discoveries about liquid crystals, which helped to lay the foundation for modern screens on televisions and smartphones.Credit: Unknown author\n\nLehmann’s key observation was that, when the crystals lost their solidity, they still retained some properties of a crystal. Yet in other respects they were liquid. At a molecular level, they were composed of long molecules that remained in an ordered orientation (as in a crystal) but could also move freely (as in a liquid). Lehmann called them liquid crystals.\n\nFor decades, many researchers refused to accept this, because it flew in the face of the system that physicists and chemists used to categorize matter. Substances were either solid, liquid or gaseous. Liquid crystals blurred the lines, and acceptance of this came at “a very high intellectual cost”, says Mitov.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century the evidence became undeniable, but research into liquid crystals dried up, out of a belief that they would never be of any use. The field was revived by US chemists in the late 1950s, and in 1968, engineers developed the first flat screens based on liquid crystals, which ultimately gave rise to flat-screen televisions. However, their applications go far beyond screens, says Mitov, including uses in cameras, microscopes, smart materials, robotics and even anti-counterfeiting technology.\n\nThe tiny start to gene editing\n\n“My head explodes every time I see a new application of CRISPR, or that CRISPR has cured someone,” says microbiologist Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain.\n\nUS Supreme Court allows NIH to cut $2 billion in research grant\n\nCRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a tool that can edit genomes in a very precise way. It opened up vast opportunities for basic research and has paved the way for curing genetic disorders, including sickle-cell disease, immune dysfunction and life-threatening metabolic conditions. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tool.\n\nThe discoveries that led to this revolution happened decades earlier. In 1989, Mojica was a PhD student investigating Haloferax mediterranei R-4: a single-celled organism called an archaean, found in salt-producing ponds near Alicante. He tried to find out how the microbe could survive in such briny conditions. Having identified some promising regions of the microbe’s genome, Mojica sequenced them and was surprised to find short segments that were repeated at regular intervals. He and other researchers gave these repeated segments different names but eventually settled on the acronym CRISPR. As he investigated them, Mojica proposed some potential functions for the repeating segments: ideas that were, he says wryly, “absolutely wrong”5.\n\nFrancisco Mojica’s studies of microbial genes underpinned the development of the CRISPR gene-editing system.Credit: Juan Carlos Soler/ARCHDC/Archivo ABC/Alamy\n\nSubsequently, Mojica learned that similar sequences could be found in many other microbes, which didn’t live in saline conditions. “Whatever role they were playing, it couldn’t be related to the peculiarities of the diverse environments,” he says.\n\nThe key clue was the discovery, between the repeated segments, of sequences from the genomes of bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria. Eventually Mojica realized that a bacterium carrying a sequence from a specific phage could not be infected by that phage. “We inferred that this was an adaptive immune system,” he says. “One ancestor acquired spacers from the phage, and after that, the descendants were resistant to infection6.”\n\nMojica knew this was a big find — an adaptive immune system had never been observed in bacteria or archaea. He also thought that it might be useful for dealing with bacterial infections. Then others found that CRISPR works by cutting DNA at specific points7. From there, Doudna and Charpentier discovered how they could harness that system and reprogram it to edit genes. And so the CRISPR revolution took off8.\n\nWeight loss, inspired by a lizard\n\nWeight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic have become the wonder drugs of the era. Almost 5% of people in the United States have used them to slim down, and the global market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. Although much of the work that led to them was done for medical applications, one key discovery came from research on the only venomous lizards in the United States: Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum).\n\nA Gila-monster peptide played a part in the development of GLP-1 drugs.Credit: Getty\n\nAt the heart of the story is a molecule called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is produced in the human gut. In the 1980s, chemist Svetlana Mojsov showed that GLP-1 can stimulate the production of insulin, lowering blood sugar levels9.\n\nDaniel Drucker, now at the University of Toronto in Canada, worked with Mojsov on this early research. “We were focused on its potential for diabetes treatment,” he says. “Ten years later, in 1996, we and others discovered that GLP-1 reduces food intake, and the potential for weight loss emerged.” However, there was a problem. GLP-1 has a short half-life: just a few minutes. That meant it was no use as a drug, because it would be broken down in the body before it could have much of an effect.",

          "abstract": "Sylvain Martel at Polytechnique Montréal uses magnetic-resonance-imaging scanners to steer drug-loaded nanorobots in pigs.Credit: Dumitru Loghin\n\nThe live pig in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine was a common sight for Sylvain Martel, a nanorobotics researcher at Polytechnique Montréal in Canada, by the time he stepped into the imaging suite one evening in 2017. By then, Martel and his colleagues had spent more than a decade refining swarms of tiny robots that they could steer through the animals using the machine’s magnetism. The hope was that such nanorobots could one day be a delivery vehicle for cancer-busting drugs. That evening, the group was exploring the effect of gravity, testing whether changing the pig’s positioning in the machine could help the nanobots to navigate the many branching arteries to the liver.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nAs the team watched the screen, the robots gradually shifted towards the liver, amassing there as a bright, flickering cloud. Compared with previous trials, in which the pigs were lying flat on their backs, placing them inside the MRI at a slight downward angle prompted an almost threefold increase in the number of robots that arrived at their destination. Martel says that even though the successful experiment only presaged more work, it nevertheless felt like a culmination of years of trial and error.\n\n“All these years, we’d been diligently showing different steps of the process. We refined the technology, we showed that the robots could carry and administer drugs and now we’d shown that we could move them efficiently across human-scale distances,” he says. Getting to this stage “took a long time, but it also feels like the next steps should go much faster”.\n\nThe work of Martel and his colleagues has taken scientists closer to deploying nanorobotic technology in humans — a threshold that, when crossed, could one day revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of many cancers. Already, late-stage research in animal models has demonstrated how nanorobots can assist clinicians with biopsies and surgeries, serve as screening agents for hard-to-detect cancers, starve tumours of oxygen and deliver cancer-killing drugs and vaccines. Cancer, in particular, is a field ripe for nanorobotics innovation.\n\nBorrowing from nature\n\nNanorobots are loosely defined by their size — typically less than 100 nanometres — and their ability for directed or autonomous motion. This movement distinguishes them from technologies such as nanocarriers, which can transport molecular cargo but do so passively. Even slightly larger microrobots, around 1 millimetre in size, often rely on nanotechnology, for example in their motors, or exploit physical phenomena occurring at the nanoscale. Therefore, researchers often lump the two under the combined term micro-nanorobots (MNRs).\n\nRudimentary versions of these robots appeared in the 1990s, offering proof-of-concept that researchers could indeed create microscale robots. Roughly two decades later, the first MNR made its way into cancer research, when a team in South Korea developed a “bacteriobot” capable of detecting solid tumours by homing in on chemical gradients given off by the cancerous cells1. MNRs are often broken down into two categories, inorganic and organic, on the basis of the materials used to construct them. Inorganic robots might include metals such as silver, gold or iron, and organic robots are often built using scaffolds of DNA or proteins. Both types can be manipulated using forces such as magnetism, light and acoustics or by chemical and catalytic reactions that propel them towards their destination.\n\nTiny grippers (pictured) can take cancer biopsies.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU\n\nBjörn Högberg, a biophysicist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, says that the methods for building nanorobots have been refined over time, particularly the fabrication of their components. Högberg says much of his work focuses on a technique called DNA origami, in which scientists treat DNA “not as a genetic material, but as a construction material” capable of building intricate 2D and 3D structures. “There are now many clever examples of using origami to conceal things like tumour-targeting ligands or drugs, where it exposes its cargo in the right place and at the right time,” he says.\n\nRobots demonstrate principles of collective intelligence\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are creating what are known as biohybrid robots, which introduce synthetic elements into biological entities such as bacteria, algae and sperm. Scientists quickly realized that nature had already designed many of the features that make for a successful nanorobot — including whip-like flagella for motion, and sensors for detecting gradients. “A bacterium already has a motor, with all the components we’d recognize,” says Martin Pumera, a nanorobotics researcher at the Central European Institute of Technology in the Czech Republic. “What we’re pursuing now is the ideal combination of both worlds, the synthetic one and the biological one.”\n\nSuch advances have given researchers more control over robots’ speed and orientation and even enabled them to develop devices that can swap between propulsion mechanisms. Martel, for example, used a marine bacterium to create a nanobot that can be moved to the vicinity of a tumour using magnetism, and can then switch to an on-board sensor that detects oxygen gradients as it draws near2. Because the tumour microenvironment has low oxygen, “it creates a beacon for these robots to seek out”, Martel says.\n\nComing for cancer\n\nWith these building blocks in place, scientists are now applying nanorobotic technology across the cancer-research spectrum, using nanobots to investigate at least a dozen cancer types. Joseph Wang, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, says that cancer might be the field with the most to gain from these precision-medicine tools, in part because of how challenging cancer can be to root out and how invasive existing treatments can be. “There’s a desire among patients for treatments that don’t require surgeries or painful injections, and I think nanorobots have a lot to offer here,” he says.\n\nToday, the largest strides in cancer-based nanorobotics research are in targeted drug delivery — offering a notable improvement over conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapies, that are broad-acting with severe side effects. And the development of targeted therapies is the goal not just of cancer research, but of precision medicine more broadly.\n\nWhy we should limit the autonomy of AI-enabled weapons\n\nOne promising therapy is the use of nanorobots to deliver the enzyme thrombin to tumours, to effectively starve cancer cells of oxygen by coagulating the blood that feeds them. In China, researchers have used DNA origami to create nanorobots that bind to nucleolin, a protein expressed on vascular cells that deliver blood to a tumour3. The binding also serves as a trigger to change the conformation of the origami and release the thrombin. This therapy has so far been tested in mouse models of an aggressive form of breast cancer, in which it dampened tumour growth, kick-started death of cancerous cells, and prevented cancer spread (metastasis).\n\nMariana Medina-Sánchez, a nanobiosystems researcher at the Basque Nanoscience Cooperative Research Center in San Sebastian, Spain, focuses on cancers that affect the female reproductive system. She says that researchers often develop MNRs that are based on the specifics of the system they’re working in, as she has done for the reproductive system. Her MNR is a biohybrid one built from a sperm cell and a magnetic 3D-printed structure that can be guided by magnetism and release the sperm at the target4. As well as its powerful tail, a sperm cell contains enzymes for fusing with cell membranes. Medina-Sánchez has co-opted that ability, enabling the MNR to bind to synthetic cervical and ovarian tumours, where they then release drugs.\n\n“What we’re finding is that we can load them up with anti-cancer drugs — even combination therapies — without affecting their viability, which makes them ideal,” she says. “In fact, their tail-beating is so robust” that they also do physical damage to the tumour simply by disrupting the cell environment. The biohybrid sperm also have a natural ability to dampen immune responses by displaying certain proteins, making them less likely to damage their host.\n\nGrippers shown next to an 18-gauge needle for comparison.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU",

The researchers say more surveillance of the virus is needed.\n\nIn the past few years, surveillance has been focused on the avian influenza virus H5N1, which has spread across most continents and can cause severe disease and death in people. Since 2020, H5N1 has killed about 21 people. In North America, the virus is also spreading among dairy cows.\n\nLess attention is being paid to H9N2, says Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, despite the virus being the second most common strain of bird flu that infects people. H9N2 has caused 173 infections in people since 1998, mostly in China, says To, who presented his team’s research at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne, Australia, on 27 October.\n\nH9N2 might be more prevalent than we realize, says Michelle Wille, who studies bird flu at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. Infections are probably being missed because they do not result in severe infection or hospitalization in people, or because people are more commonly tested for H5N1 instead, she adds.\n\nGenetic changes\n\nScientists are yet to find evidence of person-to-person transmission of H9N2, which would be needed for it to lead to a pandemic. But To and his team have found that H9N2 underwent genetic changes, beginning around 2015, that have made the virus more infectious. In cell-based experiments, a version of the H9N2 virus collected in 2024 infected more human cells than did a historical sample collected in 1999. The modern version also showed improved binding to various receptors on human cells. This means the virus has adapted to spread among people1, reported To and his colleagues in Emerging Microbes & Infections earlier this month.\n\nThe virus would have to undergo several more changes before it could cause sustained transmission between people, says Wille. The virus has to change to preferentially bind to human receptors instead of receptors found in bird cells, and has to adapt how well it grows at human temperatures and pH levels, which are different from those of birds.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models can perform as well as humans on law exams when answering multiple-choice, short-answer and essay questions (A. Blair-Stanek et al. Preprint at SSRN https://doi.org/p89q; 2025), but they struggle to perform real-world legal tasks. Some lawyers have learnt that the hard way, and have been fined for filing AI-generated court briefs that misrepresented principles of law and cited non-existent cases. The same is true in other fields. For example, AI models can pass the gold-standard test in finance — the Chartered Financial Analyst exam — yet score poorly on simple tasks required of entry-level financial analysts (see go.nature.com/42tbrgb).\n\nHow should we test AI for human-level intelligence? OpenAI’s o3 electrifies quest\n\nWhenever assessments measure the intended skill inaccurately, it is considered a proxy failure. For example, a lawyer who scored A+ on an exam would be expected to avoid the kinds of error that an AI tool with a similar score might make in a real-world scenario. Better tests are urgently required to help guide the use of AI in complex, high-stakes situations.\n\nOne promising idea emerged in March at an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence workshop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: through extensive interaction, a specialist can tell whether an AI system genuinely understands or is merely imitating understanding.\n\nImagine an AI model attempting to ‘pass’ an interview with an acclaimed legal scholar such as Cass Sunstein at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sunstein’s expert probing would be a better measure of the model’s legal knowledge than a standardized test or automatically scored benchmark. Passing the ‘Sunstein test’ would require an AI tool to display true legal mastery, being able to wade through ambiguity and contradiction, and not just answer multiple-choice questions or write an essay.\n\nOne might ask: why not simply test an AI model’s legal readiness with task-specific benchmarks, similar to those used in medicine for checking an AI tool’s ability to take notes for a physician? The goal, however, is not to test an AI tool’s ability to perform a specific legal task, or even a long list of them, but to test whether it has general-purpose legal knowledge that it can exercise systematically when performing any task.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nI am not suggesting that Sunstein, or any single authority, should be appointed as the arbiter of AI expertise. The goal is to build systems that leading legal specialists broadly agree demonstrate genuine, trustworthy legal knowledge. A ‘robo-lawyer’ would need to cope in a diverse range of interviews with panels of experts — ranging from tax and constitutional lawyers to clerks, traffic officers and legal-aid workers. Such an approach would reduce issues around individual or ideological bias and avoid the trap of AI models merely mimicking one person’s style.\n\nCould a machine reach human levels of expertise, subtlety and ethics? Only specialists can say. But imagine a US Supreme Court justice grilling an AI robo-lawyer in public. That would get everyone’s attention. It would be a spectacle much like multinational technology corporation IBM’s 2011 challenge on the US television quiz programme Jeopardy!. The company pitted its supercomputer Watson against human champions to demonstrate how far machine reasoning and natural-language processing had come.",

          "abstract": "Surgery is sometimes necessary to remove growths or cysts from vocal cords.Credit: Garo/Phanie/Science Photo Library\n\nInspired by the world’s largest land animal, researchers have created and tested what they say is the world’s smallest 3D bioprinter. The device — which sports a 2.7-millimetre-wide print head at the end of a long, flexible arm that moves like an elephant’s trunk — might one day assist physicians by delivering healing hydrogels during surgery.\n\nIn a report published on 29 October in the journal Device1, the researchers proved that the device could be fed through a physician’s surgical scope to deposit hydrogel onto an artificial set of vocal cords. “This is the first time I’ve seen a bioprinter that’s applicable to vocal folds,” says Ibrahim Ozbolat, a biomedical engineer at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “Bioprinting typically addresses skin defects from the outside. Reaching a defect internally has been a challenge in the field.”\n\nAssisted healing\n\nAfter undergoing surgery to remove cysts or growths from their vocal cords, people sometimes have difficulty speaking because their vocal folds scar and become stiff. Studies have shown that injecting hydrogels — which can be shaped to mimic the vocal cords’ natural structure and support new tissue as it grows — boosts the healing process2. But surgeons have had a hard time delivering the biomaterials with precision because their view into the throat is limited.\n\nResearchers tested their tiny 3D bioprinter in a surgeon’s training simulator. The device is shown snaking through a surgeon’s ‘scope’ from the left to deposit hydrogel onto artificial vocal cords (pink) on the right.Credit: Swen Groen\n\nSwen Groen, a biomedical engineer at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, wondered whether the natural world might offer a solution to this problem. Perhaps a soft robotic arm that moved like an elephant’s trunk could be miniaturized to aid surgeons without blocking their view?\n\nGroen and his colleagues first designed a prototype that was 8 millimetres in diameter. Then, they shrunk the design to fit more easily through the one-centimetre-wide scope that surgeons use for operations, and demonstrated that it could precisely deliver dollops of hyaluronic-acid-based hydrogels to fill in gaps in artificial vocal folds, which are normally used for surgical training. “Working on the miniaturization has taken the majority of the time,” Groen says.\n\nLevelling up",

          "title": "Environmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better",
          "authors": "Rakhyun E. Kim, Peter Bridgewater",
          "abstract": "On 15 August in Geneva, Switzerland, a fifth round of negotiations towards a multilateral treaty on reducing plastic pollution collapsed. The chair announced that the committee had concluded its work — without producing a draft treaty. Governments had failed to agree on the proposed articles of the convention; no further negotiations were being suggested.\n\nThis failure reveals a weakness in all environmental treaty negotiations, whether new or existing ones: a consensus-driven process waters down action to the lowest common denominator. Only symptoms get addressed, not causes.\n\nHeatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies\n\nThe result is much action without impact. Yet this ineffective method continues — a situation we characterize as ‘institutional paralysis’. What’s needed is to make international organizations capable of imagining and doing things differently. That requires more research on politics and governance, and that institutions make better use of the knowledge generated by that research.\n\nTo overcome this paralysis, at least in the environmental arena, we propose establishing a standing process, mandated by governments, to evaluate the state of global environmental treaties and related bodies. Its role would be to assess their fitness, both individually and collectively; identify what is and is not working and why; and provide actionable recommendations to the United Nations for reforming them.\n\nFrozen institutions\n\nInternational environmental institutions resemble deer frozen in headlights: acutely aware of an impending crisis, yet incapable of meaningful movement. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change elevates urgency, but even implementing its current pledges fully would fall short of avoiding dangerous climate change1. The Convention on Biological Diversity sets ambitious conservation targets for protected areas, yet expanding the zones offers little defence against an intensifying local and global extinction of species caused by climate change2.\n\nThese are not merely failures of ambition. They are design flaws. The implementation of existing policies, however robust, is insufficient to confront the scale and complexity of today’s polycrisis3.\n\nStates now have a legal duty to prevent climate harm — justice is in reach\n\nThe result is institutional paralysis: a persistent incapacity of environmental institutions to act, adapt or achieve stated objectives despite sustained procedural activity. Like the Red Queen in Alice through the Looking Glass, paralysed institutions run in place just to stay put. Trapped in cycles of action without impact, movement persists but purpose dissolves.\n\nThe rational response to paralysis would be to acknowledge it and seek support. Yet most institutions resort to symbolic gestures to maintain the appearance of relevance. In July in Zimbabwe, after months of discussions, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands agreed on a strategic plan that mostly reaffirmed 20-year-old decisions. The International Whaling Commission projects the illusion of progress, framing resolved issues such as widespread whaling as ongoing to justify the body’s continued activity4.\n\nOthers choose to gamble. The London Convention and its 1996 Protocol on marine pollution have opened the door to marine geoengineering, including fertilization of the ocean with iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth and, increasingly, measures to enhance ocean alkalinity to increase carbon dioxide absorption5. Although such interventions would carry huge, clearly identified risks to the marine environment, they are still being considered as potential responses to climate change.\n\nThis reflects a broader dynamic: institutions are navigating trade-offs between various risks, in ways that endanger the very object that they seek to conserve, and undermine their own effectiveness in saving it.\n\nDiagnosing institutional paralysis\n\nInstitutional paralysis arises when organizations are confronted with circumstances that exceed their original purpose, authority or capability. Take, for example, climate change. Today’s climate is in much worse shape than when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992, arguably exceeding the body’s capacity to manage responses. Scientific knowledge about our planet is abundant and expanding and institutions are increasingly overloaded with information.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nGroups of scientists have tried to issue ‘warnings to humanity’6, but after initial brief attention, the warnings go unheeded. And concerns are spiralling faster than UN conventions can keep up with. For example, the study of climate change involves not only the natural sciences, but also, increasingly, social sciences — adding further angles, such as justice, to the discussions7. Yet deteriorating social issues are an outcome of the acceleration of global warming, which further stretches the climate agenda. Ineffectiveness then breeds more problems, while resources remain stagnant. As a result, public confidence in the climate convention erodes, reinforcing the sense of paralysis.\n\nAlready-overburdened institutions are also strained by accelerating anthropogenic pressures that fall outside their mandates. Today, much of this spillover stems from climate change8. For example, the World Heritage Convention lists 51 marine sites in its protected areas, including 29 coral reefs — which looks good on paper. However, it lacks the authority to address climate-driven threats to coral reefs, such as ocean warming and acidification. Although there is a great deal of science available to assist with evaluating impacts on heritage, geopolitical realities hold more sway on which sites are accepted and added to the list9.\n\nThe complex reasons why institutions tread water are revealing. Limited capacity is one factor. Most international environmental institutions are chronically under-resourced10. Climate change is often more politically salient than biodiversity and tends to receive most of the funding11. For example, the Cali Fund for supporting the sharing of genetic resources, which was launched amid excitement in February at the resumed 16th biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP16) in Rome, is struggling to reach its targets.\n\nMinisters met in May to set directions for negotiations at COP30 in Brazil in November.Credit: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nGeopolitical dynamics further exacerbate the problem of fundraising for the conventions, and tend to favour climate over biodiversity, despite the nexus between them. The behaviours of major powers such as the United States, Russia, China and the European Union shape outcomes of multilateral negotiations. Sometimes, countries with economies that rely heavily on oil and natural gas act as deliberate blockers. Contestation between countries with different socio-economic and political circumstances also deepens institutional paralysis.\n\nEven when they lack capacity and resources, most institutions continue to project an image of progress and preserve the appearance of hope rather than acknowledge failure and close. Like all entities composed of people, they are inherently political. Admitting the failure of institutions into which so much has been invested, without viable replacements, is seen as carrying too great a political (and psychological) risk.\n\nMany institutions are also entrenched in the ecomodernist paradigm12; they often choose to pursue technological fixes, such as carbon capture or extensive monoculture afforestation, as the path of least resistance. Yet such fixes often lead to more problems.",

          "abstract": "An AlphaFold3 model of a protein (blue) interacting with RNA (purple).Credit: Google DeepMind\n\nScientists today released a ‘sneak preview’ of a new open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model that predicts 3D structures of proteins, and say it is close to matching the performance of Google DeepMind’s revolutionary protein-folding AI AlphaFold3.\n\nThe system, called OpenFold3, was developed by the OpenFold Consortium1, a non-profit collaboration of academic and private research groups, headquartered in Davis, California. OpenFold3 uses proteins’ amino acid sequences to map their 3D structures and model how they interact with other molecules, such as drugs or DNA.\n\nThe tool still doesn’t have the same functionality as AlphaFold3, but “we wanted to get something out to the community as soon as possible”, says Woody Sherman, the consortium’s executive committee chair and chief innovation officer at Psivant Therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts. The team hopes to use researcher feedback after the preview release to improve the model.\n\nFull release coming\n\nThe system was trained on more than 300,000 molecular structures and a synthetic database of more than 40 million structures. Developing it has cost US$17 million so far.\n\nWho will make AlphaFold3 open source? Scientists race to crack AI model\n\nUnlike AlphaFold3, which is available for restricted academic use, any researcher or pharmaceutical company can use OpenFold3. “It’s a big step forward in terms of the democratization of AI structural-biology tools,” says Sherman.\n\nThe preview release shares OpenFold3’s code with researchers and allows them to start using and testing it. Sherman says that the consortium team is still working on technical improvements to the system and is planning a full release in the coming months. “We’re close — and we think, with this last little bit of effort, we’re going to get fully to parity,” he says. “This is a way for folks to get a flavour of OpenFold3 and start integrating it into their workflows and start building tools and start providing feedback.”\n\n“I’m excited to test [OpenFold3] and see how [it] compares to existing models,” says Stephanie Wankowicz, a computational structural biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOpen-source models\n\nOpenFold3 is part of a wider push to develop open-source versions of AlphaFold3. These efforts began in May 2024, when London-based Google DeepMind launched AlphaFold3 without initially sharing its underlying code. Researchers criticized the private firm’s decision — and later, in November 2024, DeepMind made the AlphaFold3 code and model weights, or all the trainable parameters in an AI model, available to academics (they remain unavailable for commercial use).",

We identified a reliable subset that serves as an individual-specific ‘barcode’, capturing multifaceted dynamic dimensions that stably reflect inter-individual variation across datasets. These barcodes linked nonlinear autocorrelations in unimodal regions to substance use traits and random walk dynamics in higher-order networks to general cognitive abilities. Importantly, these brain–behaviour associations generalized across life stages and populations, with substance use showing age-specific variation and cognition exhibiting consistent patterns across age groups.

When learning sequential rule-based tasks (A–B–A), both learners benefit more from prior knowledge when the tasks are similar—but as a result, they also exhibit greater interference when retested on task A. In networks, this arises from reusing previously learned representations, which accelerates new learning at the cost of overwriting prior knowledge. In humans, we also observe individual differences: one group (‘lumpers’) shows more interference alongside better transfer, while another (‘splitters’) avoids interference at the cost of worse transfer. These behavioural profiles are mirrored in neural networks trained in the rich (lumper) or lazy (splitter) regimes, encouraging overlapping or distinct representations respectively. Together, these findings reveal shared computational trade-offs between transferring knowledge and avoiding interference in humans and artificial neural networks.",

Traditional methods for evaluating the power of national scientific ecosystems, however, often overlook the nuances of a country’s global influence.

Using rich sociological data from nearly 6 million scientific publications, we document a marked shift in team leadership from Western countries to China. In particular, the share of team leaders involved in U.S-China scientific collaborations that were affiliated with Chinese institutions grew from 30% of the total in 2010 to 45% in 2023. We further explore the implications of China’s rise by forecasting when Chinese scientists are projected to achieve parity in leadership vis-à-vis the United States, including in 11 critical technology areas that are focal points of technological development, and by analyzing how a potential decoupling of U.S.-Chinese science might affect Chinese scientific leadership. We conclude by considering the impacts of China’s growing investments in the training of young scientists in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.",

However, although human search behavior has existed since the beginning of civilization, not much is known about human search patterns, particularly regarding strategies that yield higher efficiency. Although most humans no longer need to gather and hunt in the wild, human searching remains prevalent in modern times. A common example of human searching is performed by taxi drivers looking for passengers in a city. Here, we analyze GPS data of taxi drivers in three major cities over different time periods and find that when drivers search for passengers, the higher is their efficiency, the slower is their searching, and they tend to make more short-distance turns during the search. Our study further indicates that individuals are characterized by a specific level of efficiency, and thus, efficient drivers are consistently efficient across different days as they follow their own search strategies. Interestingly, only about 10% of drivers adopt the most efficient strategy, earning nearly 20% more than the average driver. Our findings shed light on human search behavior, a fundamental aspect of human decision-making in competitive and fast-paced environments.",

In a nationwide survey across China, we investigated the presence, sources, health risks, and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potential pathogens in discarded cigarette butts. Shotgun metagenomic and full-length 16S ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that cigarette butts harbored significantly higher abundances of ARGs and bacterial pathogens than plant litter or soil. Health risk assessment further showed that cigarette butts carried ARGs with greater mobility, clinical relevance, and pathogenic potential. Genomic analyses highlighted enrichment of ARG-carrying pathogens, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas , with mobile genetic elements and oxidative stress responses as key contributors. Functional assays, including plasmid transfer, transcriptomic profiling, and single-cell Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that cigarette butts promoted horizontal gene transfer and upregulated key ARGs (e.g., mexE , mexF , cfrC ) under stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed biofilm formation on cigarette fibers, supporting enhanced bacterial persistence. Source-tracking analyses identified both human oral and environmental sources of the enriched ARGs and pathogens in cigarette butts. Finally, socioeconomic factors such as lower gross domestic product (GDP), reduced education, and poor sanitation were strongly associated with elevated ARG and pathogen risks. Collectively, our findings identify cigarette butts as overlooked yet potent vectors of ARG and pathogen dissemination in urban green spaces, underscoring the need for targeted interventions within a One Health framework.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the number of close social connections increased substantially, at least by a factor of two. At the same time, societal opinions have become increasingly polarized in many Western countries. To explore whether these trends could be connected, we employ a simple computational model of society, where people—within their social networks—continuously compare and update their opinions. Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity. In the presence of a small fraction of synchronized influencers, the transition becomes continuous; however, polarization then appears at lower connectivities. We discuss the implications of the presence of a phase transition in social polarization.",

          "authors": "Mohsen Mosleh, Jennifer Allen, David G. Rand",
          "abstract": "In recent years, social media has become increasingly fragmented, as platforms evolve and new alternatives emerge. Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages are recruited to sites of infection contributing to the killing of bacteria, but also to malignant tumors, where they promote angiogenesis and suppress antitumor immune responses. The metabolic microenvironment in tumors is frequently depleted of important nutrients such as glucose. Here, we investigated metabolic adaptation strategies of macrophages to glucose deprivation using stable isotopic tracing. Lactate production was decreased, potentially indicating a reduction of glycolysis. In contrast, the contribution of glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid cycle via α-ketoglutarate and reductive carboxylation were increased. Moreover, gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, was activated in glucose-deprived macrophages, proceeding partially to the generation of glycolytic intermediates and glycerol-3-phosphate. The partial gluconeogenesis pathway was abrogated in human and murine macrophages lacking the initial gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2, mitochondrial isoform). Partial gluconeogenesis was higher in anti-inflammatory, interleukin-4-stimulated compared to proinflammatory, interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Single-cell analysis and immunostaining revealed expression of PCK2 in macrophages from both lung cancer and normal lung. Low glucose conditions only partially modulated macrophage phenotypes, leading to reduced CD80 surface marker levels in proinflammatory, and enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in anti-inflammatory macrophages. Our study reveals partial gluconeogenesis in glucose-deprived macrophages and shows that this versatile type of immune cells exhibits remarkable metabolic flexibility.",

Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control, and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for spintronic and nanofluidic functions.",

By consuming sea urchins, otters released kelp from herbivory, kelp beds flourished, and kelps sheltered a diversity of fishes, and invertebrates. When otters were extirpated by paleohumans, modern humans, or killer whales, urchins proliferated, reduced kelp forests to “urchin barrens,” and species-rich assemblages of fishes and invertebrates were lost. These losses affected seals, eagles, sea gulls, fishes, and sea stars that depended on these prey as well as adjacent habitats that had been nourished by exported kelp production. Jim’s research became the poster child for keystone species, trophic cascades, and the critical role of predators in structuring ecosystems. Similar discoveries followed in freshwaters, forests, and grasslands.",

          "abstract": "Animals in the wild must balance multiple, potentially mutually exclusive goals simultaneously in order to survive. Yet laboratory tests of decision-making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multiobjective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically inspired decision-making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and nonfood reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short “travel time” penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and nonfood rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. Satiety manipulations demonstrated that patch residence time decisions were under goal-directed control and responsive to current needs and recent consumption.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that asymmetric segregation of preexisting and newly synthesized canonical histone 3.1 (H3.1), but not variant histone 3.3A (H3.3A), plays an important role in the asymmetric outcome of Drosophila germline stem cell (GSC) and intestinal stem cell (ISC) divisions. However, this finding relied on the Gal4/UAS system and Flp-out technology to swap expression of exogenous fluorescent proteins—an approach that decouples H3.1 expression from the cell cycle and may be prone to artifacts. Here, by photoswitching photoconvertible H3-Dendra2 proteins expressed under their native controls in living flies, we find that preexisting and newly synthesized H3.1 and H3.3A are symmetrically segregated in dividing ISCs and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in male testes. While H3.3A was found to be symmetrically segregated during GSC divisions, analysis of the H3.1 segregation in GSCs was complicated by our unexpected finding that H3.1-Dendra2 expressed under its normal control within the context of a histone transgene is not detectable in GSCs, owing to regulatory elements in the 3’UTR that mediate translational repression by the RNA-binding proteins Nanos and Pumilio. Nevertheless, when this repression is obviated by using a 3’UTR devoid of such elements, H3.1-Dendra2 is expressed in GSCs and symmetrically segregated without affecting lineage outcomes. We obtained similar results when the coding sequence of H3.3A was edited to encode H3.1 in the context of an H3.3A-Dendra2 knock-in allele. Our findings thus challenge the prevailing model of asymmetric histone segregation and reveal an unexpected molecular mechanism of posttranscriptional repression of H3.1 in GSCs.",

          "abstract": "Hippocampal degeneration is a feature of both normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Prior to macroscopic degeneration, microstructural changes occur such as demyelination, iron deposition, or subtle atrophy, which can be characterized in vivo using MRI. We topographically mapped measures of microstructure and macrostructure across the unfolded surface of the hippocampus in 224 healthy older adults at risk for AD (aged 57 to 87) and 37 younger adults (aged 18 to 37). We describe three spatial regions of unique structural covariance between four parameters sensitive to microstructural tissue properties (R1, MTsat, R2*, PD) and macrostructure (surface thickness), with high convergence with previous spatial segmentations. We demonstrate both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of microstructure with healthy aging across the lifespan, AD pathological hallmarks, genetic risk, and cognition. These associations had subtle variations across different spatial areas of the hippocampus. We report associations between age and qMRI measures sensitive to macromolecular concentration (R1, MTsat) and paramagnetic susceptibility (R2*), consistent with mechanisms of demyelination and increased iron deposition as key hallmarks of the aging hippocampus and in presymptomatic stages of AD. qMRI measures did not explain more variance in delayed recall than global PET measures, suggesting variation in cognitive performance in aging and incipient AD is influenced by factors beyond hippocampal microstructure. We demonstrate the utility of quantitative MRI to provide greater insight into hippocampal health compared to typical macrostructural measures through “in vivo histology,” opening a window to understanding neuropathological mechanisms in the earliest stages of age- and disease-related neurodegeneration.",

Recent studies have identified several disease-causing SNARE variants that give rise to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, defined as SNAREopathies. Here, we investigated nine synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP2) disease-causing variants and uncovered their specific SNARE complex affinity, stability, and conformational deficits that drive dysregulated neurotransmission. The neurotransmission deficits we observed parallel the symptomatic heterogeneity of the patients, with some variants displaying a disproportionate augmentation of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. When we examined the spatial organization of this excessive spontaneous release at nanoscale, we found that SNARE complexes composed of these variants formed exclusively outside of RIM scaffolding, revealing a preserved exclusion zone sparing evoked release from pathophysiology. Taken together with the phenotypes of previously reported disease-causing SNARE variants, these findings reveal shared patterns of aberrant neurotransmission across different SNAREs, highlighting the necessity for a functional classification of SNAREopathies to develop therapeutic interventions. The use of clinically relevant genetic manipulations to challenge the synapse provides mechanistic insight into rare diseases while simultaneously revealing fundamental aspects of synaptic physiology.",

          "abstract": "HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is transforming global HIV prevention, but its implementation coincides with observations of rising bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates among men who have sex with men, raising questions about whether PrEP is preventing one epidemic while facilitating others. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we developed a minimal dynamical model of the simultaneous transmission of HIV and chlamydia (as an example of a curable STI). The model integrates three key mechanisms: 1) risk-mediated self-protective behavior, 2) reduction in condom use among PrEP users, and 3) PrEP-related asymptomatic STI screening. We show that these mechanisms can generate a “testing paradox:” True STI prevalence may decline while observed trends rise. This paradox emerges because increased PrEP uptake amplifies screening intensity, which can lower transmission but simultaneously inflate detection. By systematically mapping the parameter space of PrEP uptake, screening frequency, and risk perception, we identify broad and plausible conditions under which the paradox arises. Our findings reconcile conflicting epidemiological evidence and remark that the net effect of PrEP on STI dynamics depends critically on asymptomatic screening strategies. These results highlight the potential dual role of PrEP programs in reducing both HIV and bacterial STI incidence, while emphasizing the need to align screening and treatment policies to maximize benefits and minimize risks, e.g., antimicrobial resistance.",

          "abstract": "The soft corals (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), a diverse group of colonial marine invertebrates, can reversibly tune their body stiffness in response to external stimuli. This capability is attributed to their dynamic skeletal systems, which consist of thousands of mineralized skeletal elements, called sclerites, embedded within a gel-like matrix that swells/deswells and unjams/jams the sclerites, thus modulating skeletal stiffness. While sclerite morphology is widely used for species identification, its role in the mechanical performance of a soft coral’s skeletal system is largely unknown. Here, we investigated structure-jamming relationships in sclerite-based skeletal architectures using the red gorgonian octocoral Leptogorgia chilensis as a model system. The sclerites of L. chilensis exhibit a shaft-like geometry with two axial branches and two sets of triradiate side branches, which are aligned with the crystallographic symmetry of the constituent magnesium-containing calcite. By combining multiscale three-dimensional (3D) structural characterization, parametric geometrical modeling, 3D printing, mechanical testing, and discrete element simulations, we demonstrate how sclerite geometry achieves a balanced jamming performance in terms of stiffness, weight, strength, and fracture resistance in comparison to alternative geometries parametrically modified from the native sclerites (e.g., changes in the length and number of side branches). We also found that these performance metrics are achieved through the effective interlocking among side and axial branches, which is further enhanced by the fractal-like microscopic spikes on the branch tips. The findings in this natural jamming system offer insights for designing synthetic mechanotunable material architectures for a wide range of applications, from soft robotics to mechanical dampeners.",

The molecular processes driving aggregation in disease are still being uncovered, highlighting the need for innovative tools to study aggregation reactions. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint1 as a tool to measure the size of Tau amyloid fibrils in fluids, from early aggregation stages to mature fibrils. FibrilPaint1 is a 22mer peptide with exciting properties: i) FibrilPaint1 binds fibrils with nanomolar affinity; ii) it also binds to precursors, down to a size of only 4 layers; iii) it does not bind to monomers; iv) it is fluorescently labeled, which allows monitoring and localizing interactions; v) FibrilPaint1 recognizes various Tau fibrils, including patient-derived fibrils from AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD); vi) it also binds to fibrils from amyloids derived from Amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and huntingtin vii) FibrilPaint1 is selective for the amyloid state and does not have background binding to amorphous aggregates, blood serum, or cell lysate. In combination with flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA), a microfluidics technology, we determined the molecular size of amyloid fibrils with submicroliter sample volumes. This setup acts as a molecular ruler at layer resolution—we determined Tau fibril length from 4 to 1100 layers in solution.

In this study, we investigated the ability of glycosaminoglycans (a class of negatively charged polysaccharides) to modulate PAD4 activity. We found that model glycosaminoglycans bind to the enzyme with a nanomolar affinity, increase its calcium sensitivity, and require enzyme dimerization for activation. These effects depend on the size and negative charge of the glycosaminoglycan, and its various natural forms activate PAD4.

          "abstract": "Light pollution has been traditionally modeled using clear or completely overcast conditions. Usually, atmospheric conditions are more complex and involve variable cloudiness. To predict light pollution in a realistic atmosphere, we developed a model for computing the artificial night sky brightness over the sky hemisphere, considering the presence of different types of clouds and the cloud fraction. The model is applied to the city of Žilina, Slovakia, which has moderate levels of light pollution and a population of approximately 80,000. We performed simulations for various aerosol optical depths, distances from the city, cloud types, and cloud coverages (from clear to completely overcast). Results show that above the simulated city, the clouds can amplify the zenith artificial radiance by more than 15 times and the irradiance incident at ground level by more than 4 times compared to clear-sky conditions. Outside the city, however, the presence of clouds can have a screening effect, lowering the artificial zenith radiance. Additionally, an analysis performed in photopic units demonstrated that over the urban area, amplification caused by low clouds can generate amplification factors of up to 27 in zenith luminance and 17 in horizontal illuminance. These amplification factors are obtained for a moderately urbanized environment; in highly urbanized areas, even stronger amplification effects might be expected. The model can be used to explain observational data collected by light pollution monitoring networks, particularly at sites where the combination of amplifying and darkening effects of clouds generates ambiguous brightness outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Jupiter’s poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by β -drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how β -drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter’s polar regions, we constrain the cyclones’ deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter’s north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter’s enigmatic polar cyclones.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions have significantly increased in recent decades due to enhanced agricultural activities, contributing to global air pollution. While the effects of NH 3 on surface air quality are well documented, its influence on particle dynamics in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) and related aerosol impacts remain unquantified. NH 3 reaches the UTLS through convective transport and can enhance new particle formation (NPF). This modeling study evaluates the global impact of anthropogenic NH 3 on UTLS particle formation and quantifies its effects on aerosol loading and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) abundance. We use the EMAC Earth system model, incorporating multicomponent NPF parameterizations from the CERN CLOUD experiment. Our simulations reveal that convective transport increases NH 3 -driven NPF in the UTLS by one to three orders of magnitude compared to a baseline scenario without anthropogenic NH 3 , causing a doubling of aerosol numbers over high-emission regions. These aerosol changes induce a 2.5-fold increase in upper tropospheric CCN concentrations. Anthropogenic NH 3 emissions increase the relative contribution of water-soluble inorganic ions to the UTLS aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% and increase total column AOD by up to 80%. In simulations without anthropogenic NH 3 , UTLS aerosol composition is dominated by sulfate and organic species, with a marked reduction in ammonium nitrate and aerosol water content. This results in a decline of aerosol mass concentration by up to 50%. These findings underscore the profound global influence of anthropogenic NH 3 emissions on UTLS particle formation, AOD, and CCN production, with important implications for cloud formation and climate.",

          "abstract": "Automatic processing allows humans to perform tasks with minimal effort following learning. Although theories of automaticity propose that learning should result in faster processing, studies have universally found that learning reduces the amplitude of neural activity, not that it speeds neural activity. Here, we show that with intracranial activity recorded from the hippocampus of twenty-two humans, we could decode the target the participant was about to report faster across learning. Theta oscillations in the hippocampus afforded faster decoding of the to-be-reported target as learning progressed, unlike in prefrontal and temporal regions of the cortex. Furthermore, hippocampal ripples (70 to 180 Hz bursts) appear to support memory retrieval after learning established automaticity. Our findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a key role in speeding memory retrieval of previous learning episodes as humans gain expertise, supporting a critical but untested prediction of learning theories.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases, which come from the shortcuts our brains use to make decisions, often lead people to misjudge sizes, amounts, or other magnitudes. However, it is still unclear how these biases evolved. Nonhuman animals like primates and corvids share with humans a nonsymbolic number sense. Whether biases in magnitude estimation are evolutionarily widespread in animals remains an open question. We investigated numerical estimation in macaque monkeys and carrion crows—two distantly related but numerically proficient vertebrates—using a delayed match-to-numerosity task with dot arrays. Both species exhibited key biases commonly observed in humans during numerical estimation tasks: scalar variability (increasing response variability with numerosity), regression to the mean (overestimation of small and underestimation of large numerosities), and a sequential effect (estimates biased toward previous trial numerosities). Traditionally, these biases have been attributed either to static influences of overall task history or to dynamic effects from recent trials. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian model incorporating dynamic priors based on multiple previously encountered numerosities can account for all observed behavioral patterns. Our findings suggest that numerical judgments in both species are shaped by uncertainty and the integration of recent experience, revealing shared Bayesian-like mechanisms for cognitive biases across distantly related animals.",

          "abstract": "The Permian–Triassic (P-Tr) transition (~252 Ma) witnessed Earth’s most severe biocrisis, which has long been linked to Siberian Traps volcanism and associated environmental upheaval. Major perturbation of the global carbon (C) and sulfur (S) cycles is mainly inferred from marine δ 13 C and δ 34 S records, whereas few existing terrestrial records link δ 34 S fluctuations to widespread dispersal and fallout of volcanogenic sulfate aerosols. Mounting evidence, however, reveals that the collapse of P-Tr terrestrial ecosystems was diachronous, questioning a hypothesized globally synchronous common forcing. Here, we present records of pyritic multiple-S isotopes (δ 34 S py and Δ 33 S) and bulk organic δ 13 C for a paleotropical peatland drill core (HK-1) from Southwest China. The δ 34 S py variations define three distinct phases with a notable decline in δ 34 S py across the P-Tr transition, suggesting substantially elevated terrestrial sulfate influx coincident with major carbon cycle perturbation. Notably, overall small positive Δ 33 S values (+0.01 to +0.12‰) rule out a dominant role for stratospheric sulfates. Collectively, the observed changes in δ 13 C org , δ 34 S py , and Δ 33 S support catastrophic collapse of the Cathaysian Flora leading to intensified weathering and sulfate release. This inferred event, slightly after the P-Tr marine extinction, postdates by several 100-ky terrestrial floral collapse and perturbation of the C–S cycles documented in the high-latitude Sydney Basin. Cross-latitudinal diachroneity of terrestrial ecosystem collapse and consequent C–S perturbation challenges the hypothesis of a single, global volcanic driver. Rather, regional deforestation and its cascading effects overprinted on the global perturbations of biogeochemical cycles emerge here as critical factors shaping Earth’s largest recorded crisis.",

          "abstract": "Malaria parasites infect red blood cells where they digest host hemoglobin and release free heme inside a lysosome-like organelle called the food vacuole. To detoxify excess heme, parasites form hemozoin crystals that rapidly tumble inside this compartment. Hemozoin formation is critical for parasite survival and central to antimalarial drug activity. Although the static structural properties of hemozoin have been extensively investigated, crystal motion and its underlying mechanism have remained puzzling. We used quantitative image analysis to determine the timescale of motion, which requires the intact vacuole but does not require the parasite itself. Using single particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulations with experimentally derived interaction potentials, we found that hemozoin motion exhibits unexpectedly tight confinement but is much faster than thermal diffusion. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated at high levels in the food vacuole, has been shown to stimulate the motion of synthetic metallic nanoparticles via surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition that generates propulsive kinetic energy. We observed that peroxide stimulated the motion of isolated crystals in solution and that conditions that suppress peroxide formation slowed hemozoin motion inside parasites. These data suggest that surface-exposed metals on hemozoin catalyze peroxide decomposition to drive crystal motion. This work reveals hemozoin motion in malaria parasites as a biological example of an endogenous self-propelled nanoparticle. This mechanism of propulsion likely serves a physiological role to reduce oxidative stress to parasites from hydrogen peroxide produced by large-scale hemoglobin digestion during blood-stage infection.",

Here, we investigate the specialized bacterial pouch, a symbiont-containing organ present exclusively in adult workers of Tetraponera nigra -group ants, revealing its crucial role in colony-wide nutrient provisioning. Using a combination of microscopy, amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, and 15 N-urea feeding experiments on four species in the group, we show that its adult-specific pouch-associated microbiota, primarily Tokpelaia , recycle nitrogen from urea and convert it into amino acids which are provisioned to adult workers and developing larvae. Disruption of this nitrogen-recycling symbiosis severely impairs larval growth and overall colony fitness. Our results show how caste-restricted microbial organs can centralize metabolic functions at the colony level, challenging individual-centric paradigms of host–microbe mutualism and providing insights into the pivotal role of microbial symbionts in superorganismal adaptation to nutritional constraints.",

Periodontitis is a prevalent, male-biased disease characterized by inflammation-driven bone loss, yet the mechanism(s) of this sex bias is unknown. This study explored whether enhanced inflammasome represents a causal mechanism for this bias. Analyses of three separate human studies (&gt;6,200 samples) show that males have significantly higher IL-1β in the gingival crevicular fluid than females during health and periodontitis. This pattern is experimentally reproduced with different versions of the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model where males show greater IL-1β secretion than females. The inflammasome drives bone resorption in males but not females as revealed by analyses of inflammasome gene-deletion mice. Pharmacologic treatment with a caspase-1/4 inhibitor reduces inflammatory cell infiltration, dampens osteoclastogenesis signaling (via the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway), and prevents bone resorption in males but not females during experimental periodontitis. While ovariectomized females show no change in their nonresponsiveness to caspase-1/4 inhibition, orchiectomized males no longer respond to the inhibition, suggesting the importance of an intact male reproductive system in the mediation of this inhibition. Thus, our study identifies inflammasome activation as causal for male-biased experimental periodontitis and supports sex-stratified studies to foster future advancement of inflammasome therapeutics in periodontics.",

The recent review by the US Food and Drug Administration of a single, prefilled syringe of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine has highlighted the importance of this question. While dynamic light scattering is well suited for measuring average particle sizes across populations, fundamental principles behind scattering limit the resolution to distinguish subtle differences at the tens of nanometer scale between similar samples. To address this, we introduce an alternative approach: stochastic electrochemistry, which allows for the investigation of specific properties of individual particles, one at a time. By introducing an electrochemically active species, hexacyanoferrate(II/III) into the vaccine solution, we observe discrete current drops when particles irreversibly collide with a microelectrode. Such events can be correlated directly with particle size. As a proof of concept, we use this technique to analyze the interactions of streptavidin-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) beads with biotinylated bovine serum albumin at vaccine-level concentrations and apply what we learned to the components of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine. We then present a time-trial comparison of data from current commercial SHINGRIX™ vaccines using dynamic light scattering and stochastic electrochemistry, analyzing the AS01 B adjuvant alone and the AS01 B adjuvant combined with the glycoprotein E (gE protein). While our method elucidates important properties at the single adjuvant level, our results paint a quantitative kinetic picture of coformulation stability that is currently not achievable by dynamic light scattering.",

Whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed on carcinoma, polyp, and normal mucosa samples from multiple sites from seven patients with GAPPS (n = 54 samples). We comprehensively investigated genomic alterations (including copy number alterations and somatic mutations), clonal architecture, and transcriptome dynamics during carcinogenesis. Genomic evolutionary analysis showed that in GAPPS, somatic mutations of APC occur in carcinoma and polyp while mutations of KRAS additionally occur in carcinoma. We also found the co-occurrence of APC and KRAS mutations in carcinoma recurrently both across cases and within subclones of the same case. The co-occurrence of APC/KRAS mutations may contribute to the carcinogenesis of GAPPS.

While posttranslational modifications facilitate aberrant activation of bypass signaling networks, the specific contribution of ZDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase-mediated palmitoylation remains poorly characterized. Here, ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation contributes to osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patient samples, along with in vitro and in vivo functional studies, indicated that ZDHHC11 upregulation reduces the sensitivity of tumor cells to osimertinib by promoting malignant phenotype. Mechanistically, we establish AXL receptor tyrosine kinase as the critical substrate. ZDHHC11 catalyzes AXL palmitoylation at Cys869, inducing plasma membrane retention and constitutive activation. This triggers downstream PI3K–AKT signaling, with AXL knockout alleviating the effect of ZDHHC11-driven resistance. Crucially, pharmacological inhibition ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation with the broad-spectrum palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate effectively augmented the antitumor effects of osimertinib. Collectively, ZDHHC11 regulates osimertinib resistance in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. Targeting the ZDHHC11–AXL axis may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with high ZDHHC11 expression.",

Here, we examined the relationship between exposure to PNMI and neurite density in the hippocampus and its subfields among offspring during late middle age. Participants included 72 mother–offspring dyads from the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) cohort. Data for four inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor-II) were available from first- and second-trimester maternal sera. Neurite density in the offspring hippocampus and its subfields was estimated using microstructural modeling of offspring’s diffusion-weighted MRI data (mean age of offspring at imaging = 59 y; 51% male). We estimated the relationship between each biomarker and region-of-interest’s neurite density. Higher first-trimester maternal IL-1RA and IL-6 levels were associated with lower offspring hippocampal neurite density. These relationships were specific to the Cornu Ammonis 3, Cornu Ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, and subiculum subfields. In addition, higher second-trimester IL-6 was associated with lower subiculum neurite density. Our findings reveal that exposure to heightened prenatal levels of maternal inflammation is linked to altered offspring hippocampal microstructure in late middle age, which could have implications for memory decreases during this period and may be relevant for understanding the risk of aging-related cognitive changes.",

We determined joint X-ray/neutron structures of Td2F2 in ligand-free form, covalent intermediate with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro glucoside (2F-Glc) inhibitor, and glucose product complex using hydrogen/deuterium-exchanged crystals at room temperature, with neutron diffraction resolutions of 1.80–1.70 Å. Extensive hydrogen bonds recognizing the hydroxy groups of 2F-Glc were identified, along with the positions of deuterium atoms. The acid/base catalyst residue Glu166 was anchored by a hydrogen bond network pivoted by Asn293. Tyr295 forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic nucleophile residue Glu352 in the ligand-free and glucose complex forms, while the active center undergoes significant reorganization, including side chain displacements of Glu352 and Tyr295, as well as the incorporation of a water molecule. An alternative conformation of Tyr295 was observed in the 2F-Glc structure at room temperature, suggesting its role in positioning the nucleophilic water during the deglycosylation step. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of Y295F mutant supported the functional involvement of Tyr295 in both glycosylation and deglycosylation steps. The tyrosine hydrogen bonded to the nucleophile is also conserved in many other anomer-retaining GH families, underscoring its importance in catalysis.

Using high-resolution 7T functional MRI (fMRI), we identify distinct neural responses to PPEs and NPEs in value-sensitive regions, including habenula (Hb), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in humans. Notably, prediction error signals in NAcc and vmPFC were boosted for high variance options. NPEs responses in NAcc were associated with a negative bias in learning rates that was linked to the strength of Hb-VTA negative functional coupling during NPE encoding, with a mediation analysis revealing this coupling influenced NAcc responses to NPEs via an impact on learning rate bias. Our findings implicate Hb-VTA functional coupling in the emergence of risk preferences during learning, with implications for psychopathology.",

From a computational perspective, however, this process remains puzzling, as it is unclear how to incorporate the underlying mechanisms into a common mathematical model of learning and memory. Here, we propose a solution by deriving a self-supervised consolidation model that uses replay and two-factor synapses to encode memories in neural networks in a way that maximizes the robustness of cued recall with respect to intrinsic synaptic noise. We show that the dynamics of this optimization make the connectivity sparse and offer a unified account of several experimentally observed signs of consolidation, such as multiplicative homeostatic scaling, task-driven synaptic pruning, increased neural stimulus selectivity, and preferential strengthening of weak memories. The model also reproduces developmental trends in connectivity and stimulus selectivity better than previous models. Finally, it predicts that intrinsic synaptic noise fluctuations should scale sublinearly with synaptic strength; we find support for this in a meta-analysis of published synaptic imaging datasets.",

          "abstract": "Self-organization underpins the emergence of complex structure in living systems but remains a major challenge for engineering synthetic multicellular materials. Here, we present intrinsically disordered protein display platform (iDP 2 ), a generalizable platform for high-density display of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) on the surface of Escherichia coli . iDP 2 uses CsgF as a surface-tethered scaffold, enabling efficient fusion and presentation of protein domains that lack stable tertiary structure. Successful display selectively favors disordered sequences, which, when endowed with phase separation propensity, drive the formation of dynamic cellular condensates. Programming cells with orthogonal IDPs enables sequence-specific segregation of mixed populations, allowing the design of spatially organized living assemblies. The aggregation state of these condensates is dynamically tunable by environmental cues such as ionic strength, and temperature, with responses predictable from the known phase behavior of the displayed IDPs. Extrusion processing of condensates generates macroscale filaments that maintain structural integrity and population segregation. By linking protein sequence to emergent collective behaviors, iDP 2 offers a programmable framework for rational control of cell–cell interactions. This approach establishes a foundation for engineering living materials with customizable viscoelastic properties, environmental responsiveness, and multicellular organization. More broadly, our work highlights the potential of disordered protein motifs as versatile tools for the design of adaptive, self-organizing biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Orthoflaviviruses are a genus of arthropod-transmitted RNA viruses that infect humans and other vertebrate animals on a global scale, resulting in extensive morbidity and mortality. Among the orthoflaviviruses, tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEV) are an antigenic group that causes severe neurological disease in humans. However, the entry receptors for TBEV, which contribute to cell and tissue tropism, remain largely unknown. Because recent studies identified members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family as possible receptors for some orthoflaviviruses and distantly related alphaviruses, we performed a targeted screen in transgenic cells expressing different LDLR members and identified LRP8 (also called ApoER2) as a candidate receptor for TBEV strains from the five different subtypes. Genetic ablation of LRP8 impaired TBEV reporter virus particle or authentic virus infection in neuronal cells. Reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP8 increased TBEV infection. LRP8 was used as a receptor by multiple strains of TBEV and several closely related tick-borne viruses but not by the mosquito-transmitted orthoflaviviruses we tested. LRP8 bound directly to TBEV envelope proteins and promoted virus attachment to and internalization in cells through LDLR type A (LA) binding domain, which we narrowed down to LA domains 1 and 2 through functional experiments. Soluble LRP8-Fc decoy receptors neutralized TBEV in cell culture, and reduced viral infection was observed in Lrp8 −/− neuronal cells obtained from knockout mice. Our studies establish a role for LRP8 in TBEV entry and infection, which has implications for the development of soluble receptor, antibody-based, and vaccine countermeasures.",

It affects the reproductive transition in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the significant vectors of numerous devastating human diseases. Here, we show that E93 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis during the reproductive cycle of mosquitoes. E93 deficiency led to insufficient production of insulin-like peptide 3 (ILP3) from insulin-producing cells in the brain, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), a key regulator in the insulin signaling pathway. This reduction facilitated the nuclear translocation of FoxO and enhanced the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which in turn respectively activated the transcription of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) during gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen synthesis. Further insulin rescue and the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that E93 directly inhibited PEPCK transcription. Ultimately, E93 -depleted mosquitoes exhibited systemic metabolic reprogramming, characterized by the dysregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Our findings establish that E93 orchestrates metabolic homeostasis by coordinating the insulin signaling cascade and directly regulating PEPCK expression, thus providing an intrinsic connection between endocrine signaling and E93-mediated reproduction in mosquitoes.",

However, only a few strategies for regulating the microbiome composition have been reported. In this study, we identified gold(I) complexes that selectively inhibited nonbeneficial bacterial strains in vitro without affecting commensal Lactobacillus strains. In contrast, clinically used drugs demonstrated comparable effects on both commensal and noncommensal strains. Consistent with the in vitro results, the selected gold(I) complex induced favorable changes in the intratumoral and gastrointestinal microbiomes in vivo. Furthermore, its anticancer efficacy was found to be dependent on the composition of microbiome and correlated with the production of short-chain fatty acid bacterial metabolites. Structure–activity relationship studies have dissected the contribution of each structural component in both the in vivo efficacy and microbiome-modulating properties. Transcriptomic analysis of tumors revealed microbiome-associated gene signaling pathways. These findings provide valuable insights for future research on microbiome-modulating anticancer drugs, presenting potential avenues to optimize cancer treatment outcomes and mitigate side effects such as gastrointestinal dysbiosis.

A frontier of this field is designing cell-permeable multifunctional ligands that contain fluorophores in combination with affinity tags or pharmacological agents. This is challenging since attachment of additional chemical moieties onto fluorescent ligands can adversely affect membrane permeability. To address this problem, we examined the chemical properties of rhodamine-based self-labeling tag ligands through the lens of medicinal chemistry. We found that the lactone–zwitterion equilibrium constant ( K L–Z ) of rhodamines inversely correlates with their distribution coefficients (log D 7.4 ), suggesting that ligands based on dyes exhibiting low K L–Z and high log D 7.4 values, such as Si-rhodamines, would efficiently enter cells. We designed cell-permeable multifunctional HaloTag ligands with a biotin moiety to purify mitochondria or a JQ1 appendage to translocate BRD4 within the nucleus. We found that translocation of BRD4 to constitutive heterochromatin in cells leads to apparent increases in transcriptional activity. These fluorescent reagents enable affinity capture and translocation of intracellular proteins in living cells, and our general design concepts will facilitate the design of multifunctional chemical tools for biology.",

          "abstract": "Triple oxygen isotope values of xylem water were measured along the length of smooth horsetail stems ( Equisetum laevigatum ). Extreme isotope enrichment is observed moving from base to stem tip. δ 18 O values range from −8.3‰ at the base to 82.6‰ at the tip. Δ′ 17 O values range from 0 to −1,797 per meg. The δ 18 O and Δ′ 17 O values are the most extreme measured for any terrestrial material and expand the known range of Δ′ 17 O values by fivefold for mass-dependent fractionation on Earth. The extreme isotope enrichments are explained using a hybrid evaporation/chain-of-lakes model, allowing us to refine the leaf respiration coefficient to θ k = 0.511 ± 0.001. This new value is required to explain the low Δ′ 17 O values previously measured in desert plants and animals and is critical when using fossil samples for paleoclimate reconstruction. Coexisting phytoliths and stem water were also measured. The 1000 ln 18 α silica-water value at the plant base (35.89‰) appears to be in isotopic equilibrium, with far smaller fractionations of 10.3‰ near the tip. The smaller fractionations at higher levels are explained by continual silica deposition as the plant elongates and the δ 18 O values of each segment become higher. The overall integrated phytolith value is a combination of early and late silica growth. The Δ′ 17 O silica − Δ′ 17 O water values are not in equilibrium, explained by a kinetic isotope effect, with a λ value of 0.5205 vs. 0.5244 for equilibrium. Phytolith isotope values may lead to erroneous interpretations for paleoclimate reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in women under 50. The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor α-positive (ER+) and are commonly treated with hormonal therapies such as tamoxifen that inhibit ER activity. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, encoding the p53 protein, is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, and TP53 mutations are associated with diminished tamoxifen response and worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. Here, we report that in breast cancer cells p53 and ER cooperate to regulate the transcription of a set of genes encoding chromatin modifiers. The net result is a global increase in H3K4me3 and decrease in H3K9me3 chromatin marks. The resultant “open” chromatin is associated with increased transcription of luminal cell identity genes and enhanced tamoxifen sensitivity. Conversely, diminished p53 control of these chromatin modulators is associated with the evolution of tamoxifen resistance and cancer stem cell properties.",

Here, we observed increased levels of exosomal periostin (POSTN) in the blood plasma of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Monocytes contributed to elevated levels of exosomal POSTN, and deletion of Postn in myeloid cells reduced retinal neovascularization (RNV). Monocytes isolated from the blood of PDR patients or under high glucose conditions exhibited heightened glycolytic activity and elevated histone lactylation levels, particularly H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la). Knockout of hexokinase 2 ( Hk2 ) in myeloid cells led to reduced H4K8la and POSTN levels and inhibited RNV. Exogenous exosomal POSTN partially reversed the angiogenic defects caused by Postn or Hk2 deletion in myeloid cells. Mechanistically, exosomal POSTN stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha and upregulated the expression of angiogenic genes. Notably, treatment with metformin reduced RNV by decreasing monocyte glycolysis and lowering exosomal POSTN levels. In summary, these findings underscore the critical role of circulating exosomal POSTN in RNV and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for angiogenic retinopathies.",

          "abstract": "Speciation often results from the accumulation of reproductive isolation associated with lineage divergence, but secondary contact between diverged lineages can reshape the trajectory of speciation and reveal its underlying processes. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi is a tectonically complex island formed by the fusion of many paleo-islands, resulting in replicated cases of secondary contact among once-isolated lineages. Unlike secondary contact on continents where hybridization often results from unpredictable range shifts, Sulawesi’s fauna presents a replicated set of geologically constrained natural experiments to test how the magnitude of evolutionary divergence predicts outcomes of secondary contact and hybridization. Using thousands of genome-wide loci from Eutropis sun skinks spanning Wallace’s Line on Sulawesi and Borneo, we reconstructed a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by overwater dispersal, isolation, island fusion, hybridization, and character displacement. We delimited five distinct species (three undescribed) and uncovered multiple ancient hybridization events following island fusion leading to distinct outcomes. These outcomes—speciation reversal, parapatry, and sympatry putatively through reproductive character displacement—were associated with increasing levels of prior divergence consistent with evolutionary theory. Sympatry, specifically, was preceded by substantial introgressive hybridization and body size divergence that likely confers reproductive incompatibility. Together, these results provide empirical support for divergence-dependent tipping points along the speciation continuum. The sun skink radiation also includes a rare instance of reverse colonization of Borneo across Wallace’s Line that established a narrowly divergent species with a uniquely intermediate body size absent from Sulawesi.",

The prevailing view in the field is that phospholipid scramblases on the plasma membrane act without headgroup preference.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the sensory and emotional aspects of chronic pain remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of FKBP51, a regulator of the stress response, in mediating both sensory and emotional symptoms of chronic pain. Inhibition of FKBP51, via genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, in persistent joint pain reduced fast-onset sensory, functional and activity-related symptoms, as well as late anxio-depressive comorbidities. FKBP51 inhibition after the establishment of the hypersensitive state provided only temporary symptoms relief, while acute inhibition at disease onset protected from the full development of sensory and anxio-depressive symptoms for up to 6 mo. Our results also indicated that early pain symptoms could predict the late sensory and emotional outcomes of chronic pain. RNA sequencing of spinal cord tissue revealed that late FKBP51 inhibition transiently altered nociceptive genes associated with mechanical hypersensitivity. In contrast, early inhibition persistently downregulated the Naaa gene, a key regulator of the transition to chronic pain, and reorganized spinal cilia. Our results indicate that early FKBP51 inhibition after injury can persistently reduce chronic pain and prevent the onset of associated emotional comorbidities by modulating critical spinal neurobiological pathways that play pivotal roles in the transition to chronic pain.",

Relying solely on the spontaneous organization of the three components, the resulting fiber/pollen-CS (FP-CS) biocomposites exhibit superior mechanical strength (~80 MPa) and maintain water stability for up to 100 d. Remarkably, they also enable seamless water-resistant sealing through simple CS application, facilitating ecofriendly production of straws, packaging, and water-resistant patches.

          "abstract": "Quantifying heat transport in turbulent convection remains a challenge. The two competing models of heat transport predict that the nondimensional heat flux, known as the Nusselt number (Nu), is proportional to Ra 1 / 3 (classical scaling) and Ra 1 / 2 (ultimate-regime scaling), where Ra is the Rayleigh number. Some experiments and simulations report that the Nusselt number transitions from near classical scaling, Ra 0.30 , to a larger power law when the boundary layer turns turbulent near Ra ≈ 10 14 . However, others find Ra 0.30 scaling to continue for larger Ra. In this work, we perform a comparative study of Rayleigh-Bénard, compressible, and periodic convection in two and three dimensions using direct numerical simulations. We show that up to Ra = 10 16 in two dimensions and up to Ra = 10 13 in three dimensions, the positive and negative energy fluxes in Rayleigh-Bénard and compressible convection are nearly equal. However, in the distribution function, the positive fluxes have longer tails than the negative ones, and the differences between the positive and negative fluxes scale as Ra − 0.20 , which leads to Nu ∼ Ra 0.30 . The above robust and universal properties, even in the presence of a logarithmic layer in compressible convection, indicate a likely absence of the ultimate regime in turbulent thermal convection. In contrast, periodic convection, which is related to the ultimate regime, exhibits a predominantly positive heat flux.",

          "abstract": "The Crimean Peninsula contains several important Middle and Upper Paleolithic sites, including Starosele, Kabazi II, and Siuren I. The region has been considered a potential refugium for Neanderthals before their replacement by Homo sapiens . However, no genetic data have been obtained from any of these late Neanderthals, some being inaccessible or badly preserved. Starosele is a notable site which has undergone excavations in recent years. We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, ZooMS), to screen for potential human remains among thousands of fragmented bones from the site. Of the 150 bone fragments we analyzed, 97.3% had sufficient collagen preservation for taxonomic identification. Our results suggest Paleolithic humans primarily hunted horses. One ~5 cm bone fragment yielded peptide mass fingerprints matching Hominidae . Radiocarbon dating revealed an age range of 46 to 45,000 y old, close to the transition from the disappearance of Neanderthals to the dispersal of H. sapiens in western Europe. We sequenced a twofold coverage mitochondrial genome from this bone, indicating the individual belongs to the Neanderthal lineage. The mitogenome clusters with other Neanderthal mitogenomes previously generated from the Russian Altai region. Alongside this, an analysis of the lithic corpus from both regions suggests that a wider Neanderthal dispersal, linked to the Micoquian stone tool industry, occurred after ~60,000 y ago. We assessed the paleoclimate connection (temperature and precipitation) between these locations and identified a high habitat suitability corridor along 55°N, suggesting that the long-distance movement of Neanderthals would have been facilitated by periods of favorable climate.",

          "abstract": "Male moths rely on antennal olfactory sensilla to detect female-emitted sex pheromones during mate localization, a process critically mediated by pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) that facilitate ligand transport to dendritic membrane-bound pheromone receptors. Intriguingly, a divergent PBP paralog (PBP4) in noctuid moths has been identified exhibiting predominant expression in the male reproductive system, though its functional significance remained elusive. In this study with Spodoptera exigua , we demonstrated that PBP4 is specifically expressed in male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred to females during copulation. CRISPR-mediated PBP4 knockout (PBP4 −/− ) significantly reduced male reproductive success via impaired sperm competition, evidenced by diminished offspring sired. Transcriptomic and qPCR analyses revealed expressional correlation between PBP4 and the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco), and similar sperm competition deficits were observed in Orco −/− males. Furthermore, both mutants exhibited compromised sperm motility and reduced sperm transfer from spermatophores to spermathecae. In vitro sperm motility assays showed that a specific agonist of Orco, VUAA1, robustly enhanced sperm motility in an Orco-dependent manner. Analyses of four additional moth species, including noctuids and non-noctuids, revealed a similar specific expression in the male reproductive tracts in all of them. Our findings unveil a noncanonical role for PBP4 in reproductive fitness and evolutionary conservation of the PBP-OR signaling pathway.",

We hypothesize that cognitive processes involved in understanding people and places are implemented by distinct neural systems with parallel anatomical organization. We test this hypothesis using precision neuroimaging of individual human brains on diverse tasks involving perception and cognition in the domains of familiar people, places, and objects. We find that thinking about people and places elicits responses in distinct areas of high-level association cortex within the default mode network, spanning the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. Person- and place-preferring brain regions are systematically spatially adjacent across cortical zones. These areas have strongly domain-specific response profiles across visual, semantic, and episodic tasks and are specifically functionally connected to other parts of association cortex with like domain preference. Social and spatial networks remain anatomically separated at the apex of a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient across cortex and include regions with anatomical connections to the hippocampal formation. These results demonstrate the existence of parallel, domain-specific networks reaching the cortical apex.",

          "abstract": "Serial order memory, a key type of episodic representation, requires the encoding of map–like context information (interitem relationships) to facilitate recall. In rodent models, both spatial and nonspatial order memory depend heavily on the hippocampus. However, in humans, lesional and neurophysiological data also implicate extrahippocampal areas, especially the orbital frontal cortex and medial parietal regions, in these mnemonic abilities. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms of order information in human memory, we used direct brain recordings from hippocampal–cortical circuits as neurosurgical patients performed a serial recall task. Our unique dataset included simultaneous acquisition of data from the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate regions. Focusing on ripple events, we demonstrate distinct interregional dynamics during successful order memory encoding using temporally precise, simultaneous recordings across these circuits. The relative timing of co-rippling events implicates theta oscillations in cross-regional integration, particularly between the hippocampus and PCC, and we show that ripple rate, but not ripple duration, is correlated with the quantity of encoded order information. Notably, we find evidence for theta phase coding of serial position for early list items. We link our findings with computational and anatomical models of episodic memory processing as well as general theories of temporal binding facilitated by co-rippling events. These results point toward complementary mechanisms for order representation across hippocampal circuits and suggest the potential of anatomically specific approaches for neuromodulation that alter mnemonic neurophysiology.",

          "abstract": "Precise and accurate geochronology is essential for reconstructing Earth’s history and coeval life evolution. The Early Triassic was a critical time interval following the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, recording remarkable biotic changes and a series of environmental and climatic upheavals. Its geochronology remains, however, rather poorly constrained and highly debated. Here, we present high-precision zircon U-Pb dates for four ash beds from the Induan in South China, along with carbon isotope data. We use coupled Bayesian eruption age and Bayesian age–depth models to estimate the ages of our ash beds and to reinterpret the published ages of 25 ash beds from other four sections in South China, as well as to construct new age–depth models for each section. Our new age–depth models, integrated with biostratigraphic data, yield new age estimates for the following boundaries: Permian–Triassic (~251.867 Ma), Griesbachian–Dienerian (~251.562 Ma), Induan–Olenekian (~250.626 Ma), Smithian–Spathian (~249.236 Ma), and Olenekian–Anisian (~246.979 Ma). Calibration of the Early Triassic carbon isotopic record using the new age model reveals highly variable rates of individual carbon isotope excursions. For instance, the negative excursion across the Permian–Triassic boundary exhibits a rate of approximately −11.7‰ per 100 kyr—nearly seven times faster than the early Smithian negative excursion rate of approximately −1.7‰ per 100 kyr. This refined age model also provides a robust temporal framework to evaluate the tempo of biotic evolution in the aftermath of the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.",

Serum response factor (SRF) is a widely expressed transcription factor essential for mesenchymal cell growth and differentiation with noted roles in hormonal regulation of muscle tissues but little characterization in reproductive organs. Here, we reveal that endometrial SRF is dysregulated in human endometriosis and is critical for female reproductive success in mice through regulation of endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis identified decreased endometrial SRF expression in infertile endometriosis patient tissues. RNAi-based SRF knockdown in human endometrial stromal cells resulted in disrupted cytoskeletal structure, viability, and decidual response. Conditional Srf knockout mice (Srf d/d ) generated using the Pgr Cre were infertile with implantation failure, lack of decidual response, and development of severe endometrial fibrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified dramatic changes in Srf d/d endometrial cell populations including large-scale myeloid immune cell infiltration. Srf d/d stromal fibroblasts displayed aberrant cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix gene expression and downregulation of genes important for decidual growth response. Srf -deficient epithelial cells displayed the most prominent dysregulation, strongly overexpressing estrogenic innate inflammatory genes including C3 and Lcn2 and fibrogenic genes Mmp7 and Fbln1 , all of which paralleled patterns in human endometriosis patient data that we identified through comparative analysis using a published single-cell atlas. These results demonstrate the profound impact of SRF on endometrial homeostasis with relevance to human endometriosis–related infertility.",

          "abstract": "l -Fucose, a 6-deoxy-monosaccharide, is often incorporated into O-antigens in Rhizobia where it serves as an important marker for host recognition. Here, we biochemically and structurally characterize WrtF, an O-antigen polysaccharide l -fucosyltransferase from the plant endosymbiont Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899. We show that WrtF transfers l -fucose from its donor, guanosine 5′-diphospho-β- l -fucose (GDP-Fuc), to a nonreducing end glucose, creating an α-(1→4) linkage. We determined structures of WrtF at resolutions between 1.45 and 2.3 Å in the apo state, and in complex with GDP, GDP-Fuc, nonacetylated and acetylated trisaccharide acceptors, and with a tetrasaccharide product. WrtF has an N-terminal glycosyltransferase A (GT-A) fold and a unique C-terminal α-helical bundle domain. The structures, combined with activity assays, and sequence analysis show that WrtF is unusual in using neither divalent cations nor basic residues to coordinate and stabilize the donor pyrophosphate. In contrast to almost all previously characterized GT-A glycosyltransferases that use α-linked donors that present the donor monosaccharide axially, GDP-Fuc presents its monosaccharide equatorially. GDP-Fuc binds in a compact conformation with the l -fucose endocyclic oxygen and C6 methyl packed against ribose C5 and C4, respectively. This binding mode paradoxically shields the anomeric carbon from attack; superposition of the donor and acceptor complexes suggests that these substrates would sterically hinder one another and do not appropriately orient to form a Michaelis complex. We therefore propose that the donor l -fucose must reorient in the active site prior to turnover. The preferred occluded donor binding mode may serve to “prescreen” GDP-Fuc from structurally similar candidate donors, while also minimizing counterproductive donor hydrolysis.",

However, the extent to which these findings can be generalized to humans remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a fully data-driven approach to examine the wiring diagram of each voxel in the human SC in a cohort of 200 participants. Using diffusion MRI to infer probabilistic tractography, we identified three subregions within the human SC with distinct topography and unique brain-wide connectivity patterns. A superficial division is primarily linked with visual cortical areas, the amygdala, and the posterior thalamus. An intermediate-lateral division is connected predominantly with the auditory and somatosensory cortices and with sectors of the posterior parietal cortex. A deep subregion exhibits preferential connectivity with the brainstem and cerebellum. These in vivo features highlight the heterogeneity in the extrinsic connectivity of the human SC. Probabilistic coupling partly reflects conserved SC interaction motifs reported in other mammals with direct tracing methods, while also showing potential adaptations of cortical–midbrain interactions compatible with human neocortical expansion.",

In this work, we employ experimental time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to follow in real time the AMP-induced ion transport in lipid vesicles, while simultaneously resolving the membrane structure and peptide partitioning. For several natural AMPs, we show that they can effectively permeabilize the lipid membrane despite only binding peripherally to the outer membrane leaflet. Our experiments reveal rapid ion transport associated with AMP binding, yielding salt equilibration in a few tens of milliseconds, while not detecting evidence of transversal and structurally stable peptide pores. On the contrary, new analysis of previously reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations shows that lipid flip-flop, accelerated by the peripherally bound peptides, leads to the formation of transient, ion-conducting water channels. A corresponding diffusional model indicates that such short-lived, transient pores explain the observed ion transport better than stable pores.",

          "abstract": "Complex systems such as the conscious brain and financial markets often operate near criticality, a regime that supports flexible and efficient function. When perturbed, however, rapid deviations from, and prolonged recovery to, criticality can severely disrupt these systems. The nature of such transitions depends on a system’s intrinsic phase transition type. Most systems in nature undergo continuous (second-order) transitions, but some approach a discontinuous, first-order transition known as explosive synchronization (ES). Systems nearer to first-order transitions are more unstable, losing criticality more rapidly and recovering more slowly. However, no existing method can directly determine from empirical data how close a system is to a first-order regime, limiting our ability to predict criticality transition patterns. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that estimates a network’s ES proximity at the critical point. Using modified Stuart–Landau oscillator networks, we show that distinct critical dynamics emerge depending on the proximity to ES and that this measure predicts the temporal patterns of collapse and recovery under perturbations. We validated the generality of our computational findings with empirical data on network collapse and recovery, using human electroencephalogram recordings during general anesthesia and global stock market indices from 39 countries during the 2008 economic crisis. We demonstrated that rapid collapses and prolonged recoveries in both brain and stock market networks can be systematically predicted for neuronal and economic crises.

In contrast, large language models (LLMs), trained solely through next-token prediction on text, exhibit strikingly human-like behaviors. Are these models developing concepts akin to those of humans? If so, how are such concepts represented, organized, and related to behavior? Here, we address these questions by investigating the representations formed by LLMs during an in-context concept inference task. We found that LLMs can flexibly derive concepts from linguistic descriptions in relation to contextual cues about other concepts. The derived representations converge toward a shared, context-independent structure, and alignment with this structure reliably predicts model performance across various understanding and reasoning tasks. Moreover, the convergent representations effectively capture human behavioral judgments and closely align with neural activity patterns in the human brain, providing evidence for biological plausibility. Together, these findings establish that structured, human-like conceptual representations can emerge purely from language prediction without real-world grounding, highlighting the role of conceptual structure in understanding intelligent behavior. More broadly, our work suggests that LLMs offer a tangible window into the nature of human concepts and lays the groundwork for advancing alignment between artificial and human intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Conductive folding metamaterials (CFMs) represent a class of cross-physical-domain new-type metamaterials. However, the inherently nonfoldable nature of intrinsic conductive materials and the incompatibility between conductivity and extreme foldability have posed formidable challenges for their design and fabrication. To overcome these limitations, we developed a laser–electric-field coupled biomimetic spinning (LECBS) technique, which couples laser induction with cocoon/lotus-root-inspired biomimicry in a fast electrospinning Taylor cone reaction. Using this approach, we report the fabrication of CFMs composed of hierarchically adaptive carbon nanofiber networks. The CFMs constitute a new class of artificially microstructured composites with extraordinary physical properties absent in nature, filling a critical gap in the metamaterials family. The resulting CFMs endure up to 10 7 cycles, and potentially unlimited cycles, of true folding without damage, in arbitrary directions and with unrestricted 360° flexibility. Simultaneously, they achieve electrical conductivities on the order of 10 3 S·m − 1 , nearly one order of magnitude higher than comparable systems without carbon nanotubes. Mechanistic studies reveal that LECBS can effectively modulate Taylor cone hydrodynamics and jet behavior through photo-electro-matter interactions, which yields thinner nanofibers, enhanced sliding freedom of nanofibers, and axial alignment of CNTs in carbon nanofibers. Real-time SEM observations demonstrate the formation of characteristic M-shaped creases with “separated layers–smooth arcs–slidable grooves” during folding, which successfully disperse stress, in excellent agreement with finite element simulations. This work not only represents a breakthrough in metamaterials but also a technological revolution, opening new opportunities for flexible and foldable electronics fields.",

They control morning and evening activity and are responsible for circadian rhythmicity under constant conditions. Only recent studies have begun to dissect the function of the dorsal clock neurons. Using clock rescue experiments, we show here that a functional clock in only four of them, the DN 1a , is sufficient to restore a bimodal locomotor activity pattern and rhythmic activity under constant conditions in the adult fly. This is achieved by CCHamide-1 signaling most likely to the lateral morning neurons, which are considered the main pacemakers of the clock, and by glutamate signaling to the lateral evening neurons. Interestingly, all the neurons involved are part of the early-born clock network, strongly suggesting that a core clock is already formed during early development. This set of clock neurons appears sufficient in the adult fly to drive the basal circadian activity pattern.",

          "abstract": "Soybean serves as a critical source of plant-based protein for both livestock and human nutrition, making seed protein content a key agronomic trait. However, modern soybean cultivars exhibit reduced seed protein content compared to their wild relatives, as a consequence of domestication and historical selection that favored yield over nutritional quality. Thus, genetic improvement of seed protein is highly desired in soybean breeding, while numerous genetic loci associated with this trait remain uncharacterized. Here, we report Protein Contributor 08 ( PC08 ), identified through a genome-wide association study, as a key regulator of seed storage protein accumulation. PC08 encodes a homolog of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 5 enzyme, a rate-limiting enzyme in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and is highly expressed during seed development. A nucleic acid T and A (TA)-rich insertion within the PC08 promoter region (designated as PC08 Ins ) enhances transcriptional activity, leading to elevated PC08 expression. Transgenic evidence confirmed its positive regulatory role in seed protein accumulation, mechanistically linked to increased ABA biosynthesis in developing seeds. ABA upregulation activates downstream pathways that promote storage protein synthesis. Population genetic analyses revealed that the PC08 Ins , which confers high protein content, exclusively exists in wild soybean populations and was entirely absent after domestication. Introgression of PC08 Ins into the elite cultivar Hei Nong 35 significantly increased seed protein content. These findings highlight a domestication-eroded allele with untapped potential for modern breeding, offering a valuable genetic target to enhance soybean nutritional quality.",

          "abstract": "While practicing a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement, referred to as “micro-offline gains” (MOGs), has been interpreted as rapid offline learning and is thought to be supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest. Here, we provide evidence that MOGs reflect only transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible. When participants trained during 10-s practice periods, interleaved with 10-s rest periods, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained continuously without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOGs reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, we observed persistent MOGs even when participants produced random, nonrepeating sequences, indicating that MOGs do not relate to the offline consolidation of a sequence-specific memory. Rather, sequence-specific learning was only evident online, during practice. Finally, MOGs were diminished when participants could not preplan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. Our results suggest that MOG are simply an effect of slowing during practice, combined with the possibility of preplanning the initial movements after rest, and therefore do not serve as a reliable metric for offline learning or skill-related consolidation.",

Here, we provide snapshots of putatively Miocene and Pliocene ice and air from shallow ice cores drilled in the Allan Hills BIA. The ice, dated using the deficit in 40 Ar in ancient air compared to the modern atmosphere, is stratigraphically complex. Nevertheless, surface temperatures inferred from water isotopes correlate with sample age and indicate 12 ± 2 °C of cooling in Antarctica between 6 Ma and the late Pleistocene. Basal ice is nearly devoid of gases and remains to be dated with existing methods. This undated ice is characterized by an isotopic temperature 5 ± 1 °C warmer than the oldest dated (6 million year old) sample. We speculate that this ice reflects surface snowpack or permafrost that was preserved by the growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet in the Middle to Late Miocene.",

          "abstract": "Altered β-amyloid (Aβ) homeostasis is a critical event triggering the shift from healthy aging to Alzheimer disease (AD) through the overproduction and impaired clearance of Aβ peptides. The Aβ-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are a collective group of proteases that normally promote clearance to counteract Aβ-induced neurodegeneration. We previously discovered that the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 is an atypical ADE that produces the nontoxic fragment Aβ34 by recognizing 40- or 42-residue-long Aβ peptides as substrates in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined other known ADEs for their potential roles in degrading Aβ34, Aβ40, and Aβ42. By genetic, cellular, and pharmacological approaches, we identified and characterized endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) in a human neuroblastoma cell line, human brain vascular pericytes, and primary rat cortical cultures as a major enzyme degrading Aβ34 but not Aβ40 or Aβ42. Notably, we found that ECE1 cleaves Aβ34, an indicator of amyloid clearance, to a unique and unusually stable Aβ20-34 fragment that has the potential to serve as a measurable biomarker. Biocomputational analyses from non-AD controls and individuals with AD pathology showed that the highest messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of ECE1 expression were found in pericytes (i.e., cells within the brain microvasculature that are known to produce Aβ34) compared to other cell types. Given Aβ34 is an indicator for prodromal AD, we postulate that our collective findings (i.e., generation of Aβ34 and Aβ20-34 intermediates within the “amyloidolytic” degradation pathway) will generate a set of biomarkers to detect amyloid clearance activity in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Current models frame the allocation of cognitive control as a process of expected utility maximization. The benefits of a candidate control signal are weighed against its costs (e.g., opportunity costs). Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants’ proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

          "abstract": "Surface interactions play a crucial role in shaping the motility patterns and ecological adaptations of swimming bacteria. Previous studies have primarily focused on peritrichous bacteria like Escherichia coli , whose multiple flagella form a bundle during swimming, allowing them to remain trapped at surfaces for extended periods. However, this surface entrapment phenomenon varies significantly among different bacterial species, despite all fitting into the simplified theoretical models of pusher-type bacteria, suggesting that key factors remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that flagellar location is a critical determinant of surface entrapment stability in pusher-type bacteria. Using fluorescently labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa , we show that cells with a single lateral flagellum exhibit substantially longer surface residence times compared to those with a single polar flagellum, despite similar cell morphology and swimming speeds. Through direct visualization of bacterial orientation angles relative to surfaces, we reveal that this difference results from the distinct bending directions of the flagellar hook—the flexible joint connecting the rigid filament to the cell body. The hook-generated torque resists reorientation differently depending on flagellar location, facilitating surface escape for polar-flagellated bacteria while enhancing entrapment for lateral-flagellated bacteria. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked importance of flagellar placement in bacterial surface interactions, providing insights for understanding microbial ecology and designing biomimetic microswimmers.",

It would provide larger benefits in lower-income countries, and it would reduce tipping point intensity and risk. We provide estimates of the social cost of methane to compare with previous literature and show that these estimates imply that key economies, such as the United States, European Union, and China, should be self-interested to abate methane emissions substantially.",

Kinematic slip models and observation of a Rayleigh Mach wave that passed through parts of Thailand confirmed that rupture occurred at supershear velocities of greater than 5 kilometers per second. The anomalous length exposed a vast population to violent near-fault shaking. The Mandalay earthquake is a modern analog for the M w 7.9 1906 San Francisco earthquake, another atypically long and fast rupture. Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses use scaling relations that do not account for such long ruptures at moderate magnitudes. This limitation, in conjunction with a likely increased population and infrastructure exposure for atypically long ruptures, contributes to a potential mischaracterization of seismic risk.",

We report that introducing trace amounts [parts per million (ppm) level] of halogen-containing compounds into the feed gas can suppress CO 2 formation using iron-based catalysts and boost olefin selectivity over paraffin and olefin productivity. Cofeeding 20 ppm bromomethane over an iron carbide catalyst decreased CO 2 selectivity to &lt;1% and increased olefin selectivity to ~85% among all carbon-containing products. Surface-bound halogens modulated the catalyst surface structure and selectively inhibited pathways responsible for CO 2 generation and olefin hydrogenation.

The rupture initiated as bilateral subshear and transitioned to supershear (~5.3 km/s) about 100 km south of the epicenter, sustaining this velocity for more than 200 km. The supershear segment aligns with a ~2-km–thick low-velocity fault zone exhibiting ~45% shear wave speed reduction.

Definitive classifications are lacking for nearly half of clinically encountered LDLR missense variants, limiting interventions that reduce disease burden. Here, we tested the impact of ~17,000 (nearly all possible) LDLR missense coding variants on both LDLR cell-surface abundance and LDL uptake, yielding sequence–function maps that recapitulate known biochemistry, offer functional insights, and provide evidence for interpreting clinical variants. Functional scores correlated with hyperlipidemia phenotypes in prospective human cohorts and augmented polygenic scores to improve risk inference, highlighting the potential of this resource to accelerate familial hypercholesterolemia diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Joint seismic and geodetic analyses revealed that the 2025 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7.8 Mandalay, Myanmar, earthquake ruptured ~510 km of the Sagaing fault, with a sustained supershear rupture extending ~450 km on the southern branch. Far-field Mach waves and near-field ground motion confirmed the supershear nature. This exceptionally long supershear rupture caused building collapse and soil liquefaction, as observed in satellite imagery, offering insights into the damage potential of such ruptures in urban areas. Sustained supershear propagation was facilitated by the fault’s linear geometry, prolonged interseismic quiescence, favorable energy ratio, and pronounced bimaterial contrasts across the fault interface. These findings underscore the roles of fault structure, stress accumulation, and material contrasts in governing rupture dynamics, demonstrating that large-scale supershear propagation can occur in interplate continental fault systems.",

          "abstract": "Flexibility and stability of neuronal ensembles are crucial features of brain function. Little is known about how these properties of local circuits are influenced by long-range inputs. We show that lateral entorhinal cortex glutamatergic (LEC GLU ) and GABAergic (LEC GABA ) projections to CA3 recruit specific microcircuits that conjunctively provide stability to neuronal ensembles supporting learning. LEC GLU drives excitation in CA3 but also substantial feedforward inhibition that prevents somatic and dendritic spikes. Conversely, LEC GABA suppresses this local inhibition to disinhibit CA3 activity with compartment- and pathway-specificity by selectively boosting somatic output to integrated LEC GLU and CA3 recurrent inputs. This synergy allows the stabilization of spatial representations relevant to learning, as both LEC GLU and LEC GABA control the formation and maintenance of CA3 place cells across contexts and over time.",

          "abstract": "Microtubule assembly requires a set of chaperones known as tubulin-binding cofactors (TBCs). We used cryo–electron microscopy to visualize how human TBCD, TBCE, TBCC, and guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Arl2 mediate αβ-tubulin assembly and disassembly. We captured multiple conformational states, revealing how TBCs orchestrate tubulin heterodimer biogenesis. TBCD stabilizes monomeric β-tubulin and scaffolds the other cofactors. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding to Arl2 induces conformational changes that toggle the complex between assembly and disassembly. TBCD and TBCE guide α- and β-tubulin into a partially assembled interface, and TBCC, acting as a molecular clamp, completes the heterodimer. TBCD also functions as a GTPase activating protein for β-tubulin. β-tubulin GTP hydrolysis is coupled to Arl2’s GTPase activity, establishing a checkpoint that ensures that only fully matured heterodimers proceed. These findings provide a structural framework for tubulin heterodimer biogenesis and recycling, supporting cytoskeletal proteostasis.",

We identified the replication protein A (RPA) heterotrimer as a telomerase processivity factor critical for telomere maintenance. RPA stimulates telomerase processivity in vitro, and AlphaFold modeling predicts that RPA engages a telomerase surface distinct from the one bound by the shelterin subunit TPP1. Guided by these predictions, we engineered separation-of-function telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) mutants and found that the loss of RPA-mediated stimulation impairs telomere elongation, even when TPP1–POT1–mediated stimulation remains intact. Furthermore, short-telomere disease–associated TERT mutations reduce RPA-dependent telomerase stimulation, revealing a mechanistic link between impaired processivity and telomeropathies. Together, our findings establish human RPA as a key regulator of telomerase and offer molecular insights into telomere-related disease mechanisms.",

However, tests of this ability in other species are lacking. We examined whether and how chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) update their initial belief about the location of a reward in response to conflicting evidence. Chimpanzees responded to counterevidence in ways predicted by a formal model of rational belief revision: They remained committed to their initial belief when the evidence supporting the alternative belief was weaker, but they revised their initial belief when the supporting evidence was stronger. Results suggest that this pattern of belief revision was guided by the explicit representation and weighing of evidence. Taken together, these findings indicate that chimpanzees metacognitively evaluate conflicting pieces of evidence within a reflective process.",

Clustering analysis on pandemic-era time-series data identified pathogen groupings according to transmission mechanism. Counterfactual analysis, using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) modeling, confirmed that infectious diseases that are directly transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols) experienced the greatest disruption to transmission. By contrast, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) experienced a smaller transient disruption, and increasing trends in incidence prepandemic appear to have been curtailed. Using epidemiological theory, we demonstrate that the observed magnitudes and durations of notifications deficits were determined by fundamental disease system properties, namely, the serial interval, basic reproductive number, and susceptible recruitment.",

Mechanistically, we demonstrate that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arise from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.",

We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

Current miniaturized imaging microscopes are typically limited to imaging a relatively small field of view (FOV), precluding the measurement of neural activities across multiple brain regions. Here, we present a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM) that consists of four fluorescence imaging micro-cameras, each capable of capturing neural activity across a 4.5 millimeter × 2.55 millimeter FOV. Cumulatively, the mini-MCAM images over a 30–square millimeter area of sparsely expressed GCaMP6s neurons that were distributed throughout the dorsal cortex, in regions including the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres.

Direct monitoring of TUS responses is crucial for ensuring optimal outcomes. Blood-oxygenation-level–dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging has primarily been used for studying TUS effects in both human and nonhuman primate brains. However, the physiology and mechanisms underlying BOLD remain largely unknown due to its highly convoluted nature. To address these limitations, we developed a hybrid system for concurrent optoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging of TUS (OMRITUS) to comprehensively characterize the hemodynamic changes in murine brains. Our findings reveal paradoxical negative BOLD signals in the activated cortical regions, coupled with increased total hemoglobin levels simultaneously monitored with optoacoustic tomography. Multispectral optoacoustic readings further demonstrated a stronger increase in deoxygenated versus oxygenated hemoglobin, suggesting a potential molecular basis for the negative BOLD responses. OMRITUS enables the study of complex TUS-hemodynamic interactions, paving the way for precise neuromodulatory interventions.",

Here, we report a bioinspired strategy to overcome this limitation by engineering graphite precursors with mimosa-like microscale curvature. Under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions (15 gigapascals and 2300 kelvin), these precursors concentrate local stress, promoting nucleation of hexagonal diamond within a cubic diamond matrix and forming cubic-hexagonal heterostructures. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional hardness (169 gigapascals) and toughness (15.7 megapascals multiplied by square root of meter), representing 36 and 104% improvements over single-phase nanopolycrystalline diamond, respectively. This dual enhancement arises from stacking fault interlocking and semi/coherent boundaries that resist deformation, coupled with phase transformation and crack deflection that dissipate fracture energy. Our results demonstrate a microstructural design paradigm for mitigating the property trade-off in superhard materials and offer a scalable strategy for engineering robust diamond-based systems.",

Multistep reasoning is enabled by our Agentic Iterative Monologue paradigm, which coherently interfaces agents with code-based tools, other specialized agents, and human designers. Design acceleration is facilitated by Feature-wise Linear Modulation–conditioned Maxwell surrogate solvers that support the generalized evaluation of metasurface structures. We use freeform dielectric metasurfaces as a model system and demonstrate with MetaChat the design of multiobjective, multiwavelength metasurfaces orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods.

To define a genome-wide map of editability, we performed whole-genome sequencing on 1875 budding yeast clones edited across 16 chromosomes by CRISPR-Cas9 and donor-templated repair. We found that unintended edits, including short indels and SVs, were enriched in specific genomic and sequence contexts. We developed a predictive model, SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk Evaluation), which revealed 4.8% of the genome as SV prone, consisting of 562 SV hotspots. Donor repair-enhancing strategies suppressed SV formation in regions with moderate, but not high, predicted risk. Applying SCORE to the Sc2.0 synthetic yeast genome revealed a markedly altered SV landscape due to the removal of endogenous repetitive elements and the insertion of loxP sites. Our study provides the genome-scale map of SV hotspots after CRISPR editing and predictive and experimental tools to mitigate their formation.",

          "abstract": "In the single-photon emission from a two-level system, multiphotons are generally regarded as accidental, undesired, and unrelated to the mechanism. In coherently driven systems, however, they form the cornerstone of single-photon emission, which arises from quantum interferences between virtual multiphoton fluctuations of the emitter and the Poissonian superposition of all number states induced by the driving. Here, we demonstrate how one can control the multiphoton dynamics by disrupting these quantum interferences through an external homodyne control of the emitter’s mean field. Experimentally, we observed a transition from single-photon to multiphoton emission, up to three-photon correlations. We show that, counterintuitively, quantum fluctuations always play a major qualitative role, even and, in fact, especially when their quantitative contribution is vanishing. Our findings provide distinct insights into the paradoxical character of quantum mechanics and open pathways for mean-field engineering as a tool for precision multiphoton control.",

However, the atomic-level mechanism behind its efficiency remains unclear. The basal surfaces of AgI are polar and inherently unstable, necessitating a compensation mechanism, such as surface reconstruction, which may disrupt the favorable lattice match with ice. We combine noncontact atomic force microscopy with advanced computational modeling to determine the atomic structure of basal AgI surfaces in ultrahigh vacuum. The Ag-terminated (0001) surface exhibits a (2 × 2) reconstruction with ordered Ag vacancies, preserving a hexagonal arrangement of surface atoms that facilitates epitaxial ice growth. In contrast, the I-terminated (000 1 ¯ ) surface adopts a complex rectangular reconstruction, incompatible with continuous ice layer formation. These findings highlight the decisive role of surface atomic structure and indicate that the Ag-terminated basal plane is primarily responsible for efficient ice nucleation on AgI.",

We implemented this two-tier strategy, BrainSTEM (Brain Single-cell Two tiEr Mapping), to systematically reassess published single-cell datasets of human midbrain culture models.

However, the “eraser” of α-TubK40me3 and the impact of α-TubK40me3 dynamic balance on cells are still unclear. Here, we report that KDM4A, a member of the histone demethylase family, binds α-tubulin through its catalytic core domain and demethylates α-tubulin. KDM4A knockout significantly enhances α-TubK40me3, inducing microtubule polymerization and mitotic defects. Furthermore, the overpolymerized microtubules and cell mitotic defects caused by KDM4A knockout are rescued by reducing α-TubK40me3 with overexpression of an α-tubulin mutant α-tubulin K40A or depolymerizing microtubules with nocodazole treatment in cells. Together, our study identifies KDM4A as an α-tubulin demethylase, and this demethylation is important for regulating microtubule polymerization and cell mitosis.",

In particular, in the marine environment, dependency of ocean-going fish on specific coastal locations are rarely implemented in spatial planning. However, when essential nursery habitats are threatened, the resilience of fish populations is jeopardized. For technical reasons, former studies on Atlantic herring could not specify if fish, returning to spawning grounds, returned to sites of their own natal origin. Combining otolith microchemistry with genetics, we show that Atlantic herring perform natal homing with rates between 56 and 73%. The implicit number of strays adopted along migration maintain the gene flow between subpopulations, supporting the hypothesized “metapopulation” concept. With respect to increasing anthropogenic impacts, this study demonstrates the need for a goal-oriented coastal zone management to ensure productive ecosystems and a sustainable fishery in the future.",

Three pieces (ZSKV-05, ZSKV-06, and ZSKV-07) show features exceeding utilitarian use: One is shaped into a crayon-like tool with repeated resharpening, another appears to be a crayon fragment, and a third bears engraved, polished surfaces. These traits suggest the intentional production of marks and curated use.

          "abstract": "The mammalian organ of Corti is a precisely intercalated mosaic of two types of mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and six types of supporting cells (SCs) arranged in 11 parallel rows. Differentially specialized SCs surround inner HCs (IHCs) and outer HCs (OHCs). To elucidate the developmental roles of IHCs and OHCs in the formation, differentiation, and assembly of the various SCs, we genetically switched HC identities at several developmental stages and also generated mice lacking IHCs. We find that IHCs promote or induce the (i) differentiation of one SC type (outer pillar) at the expense of another (Deiters’), so that each completely and exclusively populates separate rows; (ii) packing density, but not identity, of inner pillar cells; and (iii) embryonic formation and (iv) cytoplasmic attraction of adjacent inner phalangeal cells, which envelop IHCs. Hence, developing IHCs dictate major aspects of SC identity and distribution to assemble the complex organ of Corti.",

Inspired by this capability, we present a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer-liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE-LCE) bilayer capable of simultaneous, reversible modulation of surface texture and structural color through programmable wrinkling. By tuning the bilayer’s fabrication parameters, on-demand wrinkle morphologies and color combinations are achieved. Spatially selective ultraviolet (UV) curing allows localized surface textures, while chemical patterning of the CLCE layer enables region-specific color responses, expanding the design space for multifunctional, spatially encoded optical materials. The CLCE-LCE bilayer enables dynamic thermal regulation by tuning light absorption through synergistically modulating surface morphology and color. Notably, this system achieves strain-dependent multistate encoding via multistep selective UV curing, revealing distinct visual content under different applied strains.

During BAT activation, macroautophagy is inhibited, while chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is induced, promoting thermogenic gene expression, adipokine release, oxidative activity, and lipolysis. Aging reduces BAT function and lowers levels of LAMP2A, the rate-limiting CMA component. Pharmacological CMA activation restores BAT activity in aged mice. To explore the CMA’s role in BAT, we generated LAMP2A-deficient brown adipocytes and found that CMA regulates proteins essential for thermogenesis and metabolism. Blocking CMA in BAT reduced energy expenditure, raised blood triglycerides, impaired secretion, and led to an increase of thermogenesis repressors. These findings show that CMA is essential for maintaining BAT function, especially during adaptive thermogenesis. By degrading repressors of thermogenesis, CMA supports BAT activity under cold or metabolic stress. This work highlights CMA as a key regulator of BAT plasticity and a promising therapeutic target for treating age-related metabolic disorders.",

The KELShedu system comprises KELA, a double-stranded DNA–binding protein, and KELB, a metal ion-dependent nuclease harboring the DUF4263 domain. In addition, we find that physiological levels of nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) inhibit the DNA cleavage activity of the KELShedu system, suggesting that KELShedu’s activation depends on reduced intracellular NTP levels during phage invasion. Our research demonstrates that the KELShedu system responds to nucleotide depletion triggered by phage replication, leading to nonspecific degradation of cellular DNA and ultimately inducing abortive infection.

          "abstract": "While advances in cancer therapy have improved remission rates, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) remains a lasting and untreatable side effect. This study introduces Carba1, a bifunctional carbazole compound that protects against CIPN through two mechanisms. First, Carba1 interacts with tubulin, allowing for lower doses of taxanes, common chemotherapeutics known for causing CIPN, without reducing their anticancer effectiveness. Second, Carba1 activates nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), enhancing NAD biosynthesis and boosting the metabolic resilience of neurons and Schwann cells against chemotherapy-induced damage. Carba1 shows strong neuroprotective effects in vitro against paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bortezomib toxicity and in vivo in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Crucially, Carba1 does not interfere with paclitaxel’s tumor-fighting ability or promote tumor growth. Structure-activity analyses of Carba1 derivatives reveal the potential to develop compounds with dual or solely neuroprotective effects. These findings position Carba1 as a promising candidate to prevent CIPN, with potential to enhance both cancer treatment outcomes and patients’ quality of life.",

We apply microfluidics to enrich CTCs from 34 patients with DCIS and find a significantly higher concentration of CTCs compared to in healthy controls. We profile CTCs and matched DCIS tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing. We find that CTCs express higher clonal aberrations when compared to white blood cells from the same samples, and clonal comparisons between matched tissue and CTC samples provide evidence for an evolutionary bottleneck model. mRNA expression in CTC reveals EMT/MET and immunoregulatory pathway regulation with a suggestion of racial differences.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process in etiolated seedlings remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of salicylic acid (SA), a key defense hormone, in controlling hypocotyl elongation under dark conditions. SA inhibited hypocotyl growth in a dose-dependent manner, with a more substantial effect in the Arabidopsis npr1 mutant, revealing NPR1’s role in maintaining growth under SA-accumulating conditions. In etiolated npr1 seedlings, auxin-responsive genes, including multiple SMALL AUXIN UP-REGULATED RNA ( SAUR ) and EXPANSIN genes, were down-regulated. Overexpression of SAUR19 or SAUR63 fully rescued SA-induced growth inhibition. We also identified EXECUTER1 (EX1), a mediator of singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) signaling, as a contributor to this process. SA-driven lipid peroxidation increased 1 O 2 levels in darkness, triggering EX1-mediated retrograde signaling that represses auxin-related genes.",

Furthermore, we experimentally prove that the initial quantum state plays a critical role in the quantum speed limits of the entangled systems. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that the upper bound and lower bound of the quantum speed are workable even in a nonunitary Markovian open system with two photons. The results obtained based on two-photon experiments have been shown to be generalizable to more particles.

Here, we use nanobeam four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to extract averaged strain profiles from uniformly sized, shape-identical particles, achieving high-resolution, statistically robust insights beyond single-particle noise. The strain profiles reveal how tensile, shear, and rotational components collectively compensate for the angular deficit, with particle shape–dependent local variations highlighting the importance of morphological control in synthesis. By integrating in situ heating with 4D-STEM, we captured a previously unobserved strain relaxation pathway involving the formation of periodic partial dislocations that stabilizes the strain-relieved equilibrium state. This study establishes a quantitative framework for equilibrium strain in fivefold-twinned nanostructures and offers strain engineering strategies for tailored properties.",

SCE datasets from a reanalysis-driven simple snow model serve as benchmarks and allow us to reconcile the trends from one prominent snow cover record with other recent studies. In particular, artificial increasing snow cover trends in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Snow Cover Extent Climate Data Record (CDR) during the onset season are related to changes in snow detection sensitivity. This artificial drift primarily affects September, October, and November snow cover but is detectible through February. Revised trends produced by merging the last decade’s CDR estimates with the offline model datasets reveal decreasing Northern Hemisphere trends in all months but January. This approach shows that offline snow models produce useful benchmarks that can expose biases in observational snow cover datasets with other cross-validation.",

          "abstract": "The field of artificial life studies how life-like phenomena such as agency and self-regulation can self-organize in computer simulations. In cellular automata (CA), a key open question is whether it is possible to find environment rules that self-organize robust “individuals” from an initial state with no prior existence of things like “bodies,” “brain,” “perception,” or “action.” Here, we leverage recent advances in machine learning, combining algorithms for diversity search, curriculum learning, and gradient descent, to automate the search of such “individuals.” We show that this approach enables us to systematically find environmental conditions in CA leading to self-organization of basic forms of agency, i.e., localized structures that move around and react in a coherent and highly robust manner to external obstacles, maintain their integrity, and have strong capabilities to generalize to new environments. We discuss how this approach opens new perspectives in artificial intelligence and synthetic bioengineering.",

          "abstract": "Trace fossils offer critical insights into animal diversification and ecosystem evolution during the Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic transition. Treptichnus represents the earliest known three-dimensional burrow system, which co-occurred with Ediacara-type fossils in the Shibantan assemblage (~550 to 543 million years ago). Integration with Lamonte and tadpole-like traces reveals important behavioral innovations from simple horizontal locomotion to complex sediment penetration, thereby bridging ecological and behavioral transitions across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. The advent of three-dimensional sediment exploration fundamentally altered benthic ecodynamics and disrupted microbial mat stability. This shift reflects a fundamental restructuring of infaunal habitats, which temporally coincided with the decline of matground-related Ediacaran macro-organisms. These innovations laid the foundation for Phanerozoic animal-sediment interactions, catalyzing a pivotal ecological transition predating yet enabling the Cambrian Explosion.",

Here, we report a 2.82-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex from Euglena gracilis , a eukaryotic alga with secondary green alga-derived plastids. The structure reveals a PSI monomer core with eight subunits and 13 asymmetrically arranged LHCI proteins. Euglena LHCIs bind diadinoxanthin, which is one of the carotenoids typically associated with red-lineage LHCs and is not present in the canonical LHCI belt found in green-lineage PSI-LHCI structures. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the Euglena LHCIs originated from LHCII-related clades rather than from the green-lineage LHCI group and that the nuclear-encoded PSI subunit PsaD likely originated from cyanobacteria via horizontal gene transfer. These observations indicate a mosaic origin of the Euglena PSI-LHCI. Our findings uncover a noncanonical light-harvesting architecture and highlight the structural and evolutionary plasticity of photosynthetic systems, illustrating how endosymbiotic acquisition and lineage-specific adaptation shape divergent light-harvesting strategies.",

Highlighting the significance of this pathway, several components are somatically mutated in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurological disorder characterized by intractable epilepsy. Supporting the functional impact of these variants, patient-derived SARM1 and RhoA mutations potentiate cilia loss, and a RhoA variant impairs cortical development. Conversely, SARM1 inhibition restores cilia in cells with FCD-associated alterations. Together, our work identifies a pathway for cilia disassembly, implicates aberrant pathway activation as a feature of FCD-associated mutations, and illustrates the potential of CRISPRa screening to provide insight into diseases caused by somatic mutations.",

Recent results suggest that enhancing ISR kinase activity could ameliorate pathologies linked to numerous diseases, including many neurodegenerative disorders. However, few pharmacological strategies exist to selectively activate ISR kinases and downstream adaptive signaling. Here, we report that compound A8 can preferentially activate the ISR through the binding of the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, which subsequently activates the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) ISR kinase independent of an interferon response. The establishment of A8 and its active metabolite CC81 provides opportunities to probe the biological and therapeutic relationship between innate immune signaling and ISR activation in health and disease.",

Multiple roles for CD4 T cell help have been demonstrated for support of CD8 T cell responses; however, the role of CD4 T cells in AA remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells from the skin-draining lymph nodes (SDLNs) of AA mice transferred disease to recipient mice. These cells exhibited a T helper type 1 (T H 1) effector transcriptional and phenotypic profile, and their pathogenic activity required endogenous CD8 T cells and host IFN-γ responsiveness. Targeted deletion of CD4 T cell–mediated production of IFN-γ abrogated the ability of this cell population to transfer disease.

It has recently received notable attention. Despite this growing interest, the microscopic mechanisms driving CISS remain a subject of intense debate. This paper complements and extends the prevailing interpretation that attributes CISS primarily to the electric current in chiral molecules. We propose that molecular vibrations drive spin polarization in chiral molecules and play a critical role in CISS. Our results suggest that magnetic interactions between chiral molecules and ferromagnets, analogous to interlayer exchange coupling, provide a physically consistent mechanism for the observed selectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that molecular vibrations facilitate the alignment of spin angular momentum dependent on chirality in the presence of an external magnetic field, which is a prerequisite for exchange coupling. These findings necessitate reevaluating spin dynamics, expanding its relevance beyond traditional solid-state physics to fields such as chemical reactions, molecular biology, and drug discovery.",

Bacteriophage (bacterial viruses) is a promising alternative with pathogen-level specificity. However, their commercial success has been limited by the considerable diffusion barriers they face within food, preventing effective delivery at contamination sites. Here, we introduce bacteriophage-loaded microneedle patches that enable targeted phage delivery directly within food, eliminating internal pathogens in a minimally disruptive manner. The application of microneedles within food is first explored. The platform is then substantiated by comparing performance in raw beef and cooked chicken, where we achieved up to 3-log reduction in Escherichia coli , meeting regulatory limits. In contrast, conventional surface application of the same phage failed to provide statistically significant decontamination. To ensure broad applicability, phage cocktails were also loaded into microneedles to demonstrate polymicrobial decontamination. This platform can also be adapted to extend food shelf-life by targeting spoilage-inducing bacteria.",

Here, we introduce a population-coding model to explore this process, focusing on how implicit adaptation is modulated by context. The model consists of a two-layered network, designed to capture activity in both the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model recapitulates a large range of contextual effects such as how prior learning, error uncertainty, or temporal delay affect the rate of adaptation. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate a form of meta-learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, the current results show that they can emerge from the population activity of a cerebellar-like hierarchical network that does not represent context.",

By using exo- and endonucleases to remove background, Pt-seq enables robust and sensitive profiling of binding sites for cisplatin, oxaliplatin, lobaplatin, and a Pt(IV) complex. Using Pt-seq, we identified tens to hundreds of binding clusters that are 10 to 20 kilobases in median length and highly consistent among different drugs, predominantly localizing to centromeric and ribosomal DNA regions. In cisplatin-resistant cells, we found significantly reduced binding within these regions. Moreover, we found that mutations in cancer cells can generate previously unidentified binding sites. On this basis, we demonstrated that ICR-191, an acridine orange compound capable of inducing G insertions, enhances cisplatin-DNA binding and sensitizes cells to cisplatin.

This is typically accomplished by light microscopy using a semiquantitative four-point scale. In contrast, automated image analysis software allows a more quantitative assessment, though inherent limitations with such automated programs can produce misleading conclusions. For example, specific imaging features may be incorrectly scored or classified within the specimen because of the complex architecture and heterogeneous structures present in the lung. In addition, tissue processing and handling may further introduce artifacts and inconsistencies that affect automated analysis. To address these limitations, we developed a lung image analysis program, Wide-Angle Lung Experiment Segmentation (WALES), which uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model to provide semiautomated masking and relative density analysis to efficiently quantify lung injury. Density analysis using WALES effectively delineated varying severities of lung injury, not achieved using more standard methods. WALES is widely applicable for many preclinical lung injury models.",

We find that at physiological loading rates, vinculin domains unfold at forces of 5 to 15 pN and refold rapidly when forces drop to 1 pN. This behavior is reminiscent of force-dependent switches in talin and α-catenin, suggesting vinculin domains also function as molecular switches. Unfolding induces large extension changes up to 150 nm in steps of 20 to 30 nm. These findings reveal that vinculin exhibits a previously unrecognized mechanical response, with dynamic folding/unfolding under force acting as a buffering mechanism. Given its role as a scaffold for many proteins, this mechanosensitive behavior supports a model where vinculin functions directly as a mechanotransducer, recruiting binding partners in a force-dependent manner.",

This approach enables access to the previously unmeasurable wave vector range while providing at the same time full wave vector resolution, all within a tabletop setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons as well as applications in computational and microwave devices.

          "abstract": "RAC1 A159V is a hotspot mutation associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. By gene editing, we generated endogenous homozygous and heterozygous RAC1 A159V mutations, which result in up-regulated RAC1 activity and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. RAC1 A159V tumors grow faster than RAC1 WT tumors in immune-proficient mice and are resistant to anti–programmed death protein 1 (PD1). Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that RAC1 A159V cells form “cold” tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced tumor-immune cell interactions. Mechanistically, RAC1 A159V up-regulates glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to activate mTORC1 signaling in tumor cells, which in turn increases glycolysis, impairs key chemokine production, and decreases IFNGR1 expression of the tumor cells. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin resensitizes the RAC1 A159V tumors to anti-PD1 treatment by reversing effects of RAC1 A159V mutation. These results demonstrate a mechanism of RAC1 A159V -driven immune evasion and suggest an approach of combining the targeting of RAC1-mTOR signaling with immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of a type of immune-cold tumors.",

          "abstract": "Activator protein 4 (AP4) is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine-zipper transcription factor, a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc and a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis, abundantly expressed in cancer cells. Here, we reveal a role for the c-Myc–AP4 axis in axon regeneration and the intrinsic growth capacity of injured neurons. Through bioinformatic and functional analyses, we demonstrated that overexpression of AP4 in mice not only accelerated in vivo axon regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury but also promoted robust axon regeneration and neuronal survival after optic nerve injury by activating mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Neuronal-specific knockdown of AP4 abolished the regenerative phenotype induced by c-Myc overexpression and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion. AP4 overexpression rendered the intrinsic growth capacity of c-Myc silencing injured retinal ganglion cells unaffected. These findings unveil a distinct aspect of the c-Myc–AP4 axis and highlight a previously unrecognized intrinsic role of AP4 in axon regeneration, with potential therapeutic implications.",

          "abstract": "Strain engineering, enabling the precise control over structure and functional properties, is a key strategy for the design of advanced materials. However, the mechanisms governing strain evolution and release at the nanoscale remain largely unexplored. In this study, we leverage in situ heating transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x-ray spectroscopy to investigate the strain relaxation pathways of boehmite (γ-AlOOH) at 575 kelvin by revealing real-time structural dynamics. Through tracking the moiré pattern evolution, we identify distinct strain release mechanisms, including layer twisting, defect formation, and domain restructuring. Our neural network potential calculations reveal that energy fluctuations at small twist angles are dominated by an interference-like interaction modulation of hydrogen bonds between boehmite interlayers, with metastable twisted structures corresponding to local minima of the potential energy landscape. This work establishes a previously unidentified paradigm of two-dimensional layer twisting mediated by hydrogen bonding, offering insights into strain-driven transformation mechanisms, and thus may have broad implications for strain in material and earth sciences.",

          "abstract": "Tardigrades survive extreme environments partly through the damage suppressor (Dsup) protein, which protects DNA from ionizing radiation and oxidative stress. Dsup is largely unstructured but binds nucleosomes to shield DNA from damage. To investigate its protective role in a whole organism, we expressed the Ramazzottius varieornatus Dsup gene in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . Transgenic worms tolerated x-ray exposure and oxidative stress without apparent toxicity and exhibited a notable extension of life span. This effect was independent of the canonical DAF-2/DAF-16 longevity pathway and mitochondrial dynamics. Instead, Dsup expression markedly reduced mitochondrial respiration, providing a plausible mechanism for enhanced oxidative stress resistance and extended longevity. Our findings demonstrate that Dsup can confer stress resistance and longevity benefits across species, highlighting a unique protective strategy with potential implications for understanding aging and developing stress-resilient organisms.",

Although the importance of reverse weathering has been increasingly recognized, the rates and mechanisms remain poorly constrained. This study investigated the mechanisms, kinetics, and mineral products derived from diatom biogenic silica. We show the formation of Fe(II)-bearing smectite and mica in 40 days, the most rapid process and first specific mineral phases reported to date. Unraveling the kinetics and mechanisms of authigenic clay formation suggests that reverse weathering is far more dynamic and responsive to changes in ocean chemistry than previously envisioned, with a potential to impact marine alkalinity cycling on a shorter timescale.",

          "abstract": "Global shark biodiversity is in decline, with numerous species facing extinction because of anthropogenic influence. Loss of species richness is expected to diminish trait diversity, encompassing ecological roles and physiological adaptations. We investigate whether the extinction of threatened species, as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, drives morphological and ecological homogenization within Carcharhinus , a speciose genus of requiem sharks. We assembled a dataset of tooth morphology from 30 species and combined it with functional data such as diet, habitat, and body size. Simulated extinction scenarios, where species were sequentially removed from the highest to lowest threat level, revealed that the loss of threatened species would result in marked homogenization of morphology and ecology. Along this extinction trajectory, trait structures become increasingly depauperate, marked by contracting depth ranges and declining body-size diversity. Our results indicate that the diverse dental morphologies, shaped over millions of years, are at risk of disappearing—eroding the genus’s capacity to support varied ecological roles.",

          "abstract": "Ultraflat, single-crystal Cu(111) thin films are widely regarded as ideal epitaxial substrates for synthesizing two-dimensional single crystals for ease of subsequent transfer and device integration. However, the fabrication of Cu(111) remains hindered by a lack of scalable and reliable technique to eliminate in-plane twin boundaries (TBs) in final films. Here, we present a method to address TB issues for harvesting ultraflat, TB-free Cu(111) wafers, which also enable the growth of high-quality, single-crystal graphene wafers. It has been revealed that the deposition of Cu films with designed texture would enable the selective abnormal grain growth of specific Cu(111) during high-temperature annealing, allowing for the production of 6-inch TB-free Cu(111) wafers with high crystallinity (misorientation angle of 0.48°), flatness ( R a  = 0.34 nm), and scalability (25 wafers per batch). As-harvested graphene exhibits excellent electronic quality and wafer-scale uniformity, with an average carrier mobility of 10,093 square centimeters per volt per second and sheet resistance of 905 ohm per square with 3.5% deviation over entire wafer.",

          "abstract": "Conventional scintillators that rely on heavy metals and halides often struggle with high costs, synthetic complexity, toxicity, and afterglow, while organic scintillators suffer from low light yield and complicated synthesis. This study introduces a family of scintillators based on copper(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes that combine strong radioluminescence with low cost, facile synthesis, nontoxicity, and environmental compatibility. Experimental and computational analyses reveal a distinct luminescence mechanism dominated by intermolecular Cu(I)∙∙∙Cu(I) interactions. An unconventional halogen-free strategy substantially enhances the radioluminescence of a methyl-substituted copper(I) trinuclear complex, achieving an exceptional light yield of ~70,475 photons/MeV. Leveraging these properties, a scintillator screen was fabricated, which achieved a spatial resolution exceeding 20.0 line pairs/mm and retained performance over 200 on-off cycles. Moreover, real-time angiography simulations validated its capability for dynamic x-ray imaging. These findings position copper(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes as a promising candidate for next-generation scintillators with strong potential for real-world applications and offer valuable insights for halogen-free radioluminescent materials.",

Although these relationships are prevalent in oligotrophic environments, how they function and provide an advantage under such conditions remains largely unknown. To address these issues, we examined the behavior of the ciliate Paramecium bursaria hosting Chlorella endosymbionts under nitrogen- and prey-depleted conditions. The Paramecium host survived for up to 5 weeks while maintaining the number of Chlorella endosymbionts, whereas aposymbiotic Paramecium and free-living Chlorella either died or bleached, respectively, under the same conditions. In the symbiotic state, the host continuously fed on the endosymbionts without excreting nitrogenous waste into the medium, while the remaining endosymbionts continued to proliferate using heterotrophic metabolites from the host and light energy. Thus, the cyclical farming of endosymbionts by the host maintains a high concentration of nutrients within the closed system, providing a selective advantage in oligotrophic environments.",

We demonstrate that the sequential chlorination reactions initiated by molecular chlorine and ammonia in atmospheric aerosols are a major source of trichloramine. The trichloramine produced in aerosols is a source of gaseous trichloramine and serves as an intermediate during the conversion from molecular chlorine to Cl · , while direct trichloramine emissions constitute a previously overlooked source of Cl · .

          "abstract": "Plants use two major defense strategies, resistance and tolerance, to counter herbivore attack; how these are coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that damage by a specialist leafminer ( Phthorimaea operculella ) triggers tissue-specific responses in potato plants: compensatory growth in immature leaves, enabling tolerance, while resistance is induced in the mined leaf. The tissue-specific regulation of Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter 11 (SWEET11) mediates both responses. In unattacked sink leaves, SWEET11 is up-regulated, enhancing sugar import, promoting compensatory growth and herbivore tolerance. In contrast, SWEET11 is rapidly down-regulated in mined source leaves, inhibiting sugar export and increasing cellular sugar levels. The resulting sugar accumulations suppress SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) and thereby enhance herbivore resistance. SWEET11-mediated sugar signaling enhances jasmonic acid (JA)–mediated resistance by degrading MCPI1a and MCPI1b (metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor 1), two JA-induced herbivory susceptibility factors. These findings reveal a dual role for sugar transport in regulating tissue-specific defense responses to herbivory.",
