          "abstract": "Are widespread stereotypes accurate1,2,3 or socially distorted4,5,6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7,8,9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants’ beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality.",

          "abstract": "Nonlinear optics 1 plays a central role in many photonic technologies, both classical 2–5 and quantum 6–8 . However, the function of a nonlinear-optical device is typically determined during design and fixed during fabrication 9 , restricting the use of nonlinear optics to scenarios in which this inflexibility is tolerable. Here we present a photonic device with highly programmable nonlinear functionality: an optical slab waveguide with an arbitrarily reconfigurable two-dimensional distribution of χ (2) nonlinearity. The nonlinearity is realized using electric-field-induced χ (2) (refs. 10–16 ), and the programmability is engineered by massively parallel control of the electric-field distribution within the device using a photoconductive layer and optical programming with a spatial light pattern. To showcase the versatility of our device, we demonstrate spectral, spatial and spatio-spectral engineering of second-harmonic generation by tailoring arbitrary quasi-phase-matching grating structures 1 in two dimensions. The programmability of the device makes it possible to perform inverse design of grating structures in situ, as well as real-time feedback to compensate for fluctuations in operating and environmental conditions. Our work shows that we can break from the conventional one-device–one-function paradigm, potentially expanding the applications of nonlinear optics to situations in which fast device reconfigurability is desirable—such as in programmable optical quantum gates and quantum light sources 7,17–19 , all-optical signal processing 20 , optical computation 21 and adaptive structured light for sensing 22–24 .",

          "abstract": "As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations 1–7 . Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) 8 , a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.",

          "abstract": "Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of precision metrology1,2,3,4,5,6, operating near a standard quantum limit set by quantum noise4,7. Harnessing quantum entanglement offers a promising route to surpass this limit8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15; however, there are practical difficulties in terms of scalability and measurement resolution requirements16,17. Here we adapt the holonomic quantum gate concept18 to develop a new Rabi-type ‘global-phase spectroscopy’ that uses the detuning-sensitive global Aharonov–Anandan phase19. With this approach, we can demonstrate quantum-amplified time-reversal spectroscopy on an optical clock transition that achieves directly measured 2.4(7) dB metrological gain and 4.0(8) dB improvement in laser noise sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit. To this end, we introduce rotary echo to protect the dynamics from inhomogeneities in light–atom coupling and implement a laser-noise-cancelling differential measurement through symmetric phase encoding in two nuclear spin states. Our technique is not limited by measurement resolution, scales easily because of the global nature of entangling interaction and exhibits high resilience to typical experimental imperfections. We expect it to be broadly applicable to next-generation atomic clocks and other quantum sensors approaching the fundamental quantum precision limits20,21,22.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials have extended the device scalability1,2,3 of silicon (Si) technology and enabled fundamental innovations in device mechanisms4,5,6. Both industry7,8,9 and academia10,11,12,13, particularly in the field of integrated circuits, are pursuing integration breakthroughs to demonstrate the superiority of 2D electronics at the system level. Despite considerable integration progress on either 2D material integration11,12,13 or 2D-CMOS hybrid integration14, a system that can migrate the advantages of the device to the application is still lacking. Here we report a full-featured 2D NOR flash memory chip realized by an atomic device to chip (ATOM2CHIP) technology, which combines a superior 2D electronic device as a memory core and a powerful CMOS platform to support complex instruction control. The ATOM2CHIP blueprint includes a full-stack on-chip process and a cross-platform system design, providing a complete framework to bridge the gap from emerging device concept to an applicable chip. The full-stack on-chip process is a specially designed flow that incorporates planar integration, three-dimensional (3D) architecture and chip packaging, contributing to a high yield of 94.34% based on a full-chip test. The cross-platform system design handles both the 2D circuit design and the 2D-CMOS modules compatibility verification design, contributing to a highly complex, instruction-driven, full-featured chip with 8-bit commands and 32-bit parallelism. These results demonstrate an efficient system integration strategy that showcases the advantages of the 2D electronic system.",

          "abstract": "Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders 1–3 . Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq 4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq 5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.",

          "authors": "Quentin Perrenoud, Antonio H. de O. Fonseca, Austin Airhart, James Bonanno, Rong Mao, Jessica A. Cardin",
          "abstract": "Cognitive processes underlying behaviour are linked to specific spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity in the neocortex1,2,3,4,5,6. These patterns arise from synchronous synaptic activity7 and are often analysed as oscillations, but may also display aperiodic dynamics that are not well detected. Here we develop a novel analytical method decomposing patterned activity into discrete network events and use this approach to track gamma activity (30–80 Hz) in the mouse visual cortex (V1). We find that the gamma event rate varies with arousal and individual events can cluster in brief oscillatory bouts but also occur in isolation. Individual events synchronize neural firing across layers and promote enhanced visual encoding. V1 gamma events are evoked by patterned input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and suppressed by optogenetic modulation of the dLGN, suggesting that they support thalamocortical integration of visual information. In behaving mice, the gamma event rate increases steadily before visually cued behavioural responses, predicting trial-by-trial performance. Suppressing V1 gamma events impairs visual detection performance, whereas evoking them elicits a behavioural response. This relationship between gamma events and behaviour is sensory modality specific and rapidly modulated by changes in task objectives. Gamma events thus support a flexible encoding of visual information according to behavioural context.",

          "abstract": "Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women 1 . For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear 2 . Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer 3 . As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10 , CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues.",

          "abstract": "Even with the rapid development of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of energy conversion from fossil or synthetic fuels remains a challenge because, for example, combustion engines in long-range aircraft will still be needed in the upcoming decades 1 . Increasing their operating temperatures (1,050–1,150 °C (refs. 2–4 )) is one option. This requires replacing single-crystalline Ni-based superalloys in the hottest sections of turbines by refractory-element-based materials, which exhibit much higher solidus temperatures beyond 2,000 °C (refs. 5–7 ). Here we introduce a single-phase Cr-36.1Mo-3Si (at.%) alloy that meets, for the first time, to our knowledge, the most important critical requirements for refractory-element-based materials: (1) relevant resistance against pesting, nitridation and scale spallation at elevated temperatures, minimum up to 1,100 °C, and (2) sufficient compression ductility at room temperature. Although strength and creep resistance in such alloys were already superior to Ni-based superalloys in several cases, oxidation/corrosion resistance, mandatory to withstand the combustion atmosphere, and ductility/toughness, needed for damage tolerance and device setting, still pose barriers for the development or application of refractory-element-based candidate materials. Any previous successful attempts to address the otherwise catastrophic oxidation of Mo and nitridation of Cr during oxidation suffered from a loss in ductility at ambient temperatures.",

          "abstract": "Oxygen redox chemistry is central to life 1 and many human-made technologies, such as in energy storage 2–4 . The large energy gain from oxygen redox reactions is often connected with the occurrence of harmful reactive oxygen species 3,5,6 . Key species are superoxide and the highly reactive singlet oxygen 3–7 , which may evolve from superoxide. However, the factors determining the formation of singlet oxygen, rather than the relatively unreactive triplet oxygen, are unknown. Here we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. We found that as the driving force for the reaction increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behaviour also applies to the widely observed superoxide disproportionation, in which one superoxide is oxidized by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, with Lewis and Brønsted acidity controlling the driving forces. Singlet oxygen yields governed by these conditions are relevant, for example, in batteries or cellular organelles in which superoxide forms. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry, with implications for fields, including life sciences, pure chemistry and energy storage.",

Here we show that the tapering of the basin outline and the more gradual topographic and crustal thickness transition towards the south support a southward impact trajectory, opposite of that commonly assumed. A broad thorium-rich and iron-rich ejecta deposit southwest of the basin is consistent with partial excavation of late-stage magma ocean liquids. These observations indicate that thorium-rich magma ocean liquids persisted only beneath the southwestern half of the basin at the time of impact, matching predictions for the transition from a global magma ocean to a local enrichment of potassium, rare-earth elements and phosphorus (KREEP) in the near-side Procellarum KREEP Terrane. These results have important implications for the upcoming human exploration of the lunar south pole by Artemis, as proposed landing sites are now recognized to sit on the downrange rim and thorium-rich impact ejecta of the basin.",

          "abstract": "During DNA replication, the replisome must remove barriers and roadblocks including the transcription machinery1,2. Transcription–replication conflicts (TRCs) occur when there are collisions between the replisome and transcription machinery, and are increasingly recognized as an important source of mammalian genome instability3. How cells facilitate replisome bypass at sites of TRCs is incompletely understood. Here we show that the CUL3–KCTD10 E3 ligase senses TRCs and promotes remodelling of the RNA polymerase complex to allow replisome bypass. We found that the substrate adaptor KCTD10 interacts with the replisome and the transcription machinery and regulates both in unstressed conditions. These bivalent interactions allow KCTD10 to detect co-directional TRCs and facilitate higher-order assembly of KCTD10 complexes that recruit CUL3 to induce the ubiquitination and removal of the RNA polymerase factor TCEA2. In the absence of KCTD10, there is increased retention of TCEA2 and the RNA polymerase complex, causing an accumulation of TRCs and increased DNA damage. Our results demonstrate how replication can proceed through transcriptionally active regions, utilizing a unique bridging function of the CUL3–KCTD10 complex. These findings provide a framework for how the coordination between transcription and replication may contribute to the maintenance of genome stability.",

          "abstract": "In renewing tissues, mutations conferring selective advantage may result in clonal expansions1,2,3,4. In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers5,6,7,8. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome5. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions9,10,11,12,13, 6,065 control trios12,14,15,16,17,18,19 and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals20 identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 23 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. An extra 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain of function. CES increases the average mutation rate roughly 17-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and roughly 500-fold for pooled gain-of-function sites in sperm21. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 19 LoF CES driver candidates, only 9 show clear evidence of disease causality22, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations.",

We show that the highly compressed representation of all public biological sequences could fit on a few consumer hard drives (total cost of around US$2,500), making it cost-effective to use and readily transportable for further analysis. We explore several practical use cases to mine existing archives for interesting associations, demonstrating the use of our indexes for integrative analyses, and illustrating that such capabilities are poised to catalyse advancements in biomedical research.",

This specificity originates from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the enzyme active site and complicated transition state of the reaction1,2. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions or act on substrates beyond those for which they were originally evolved1,3-5. However, millions of known enzymes still lack reliable substrate specificity information, impeding their practical applications and comprehensive understanding of the biocatalytic diversity in nature. Herein, we developed a cross-attention-empowered SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture named EZSpecificity for predicting enzyme substrate specificity, which was trained on a comprehensive tailor-made database of enzyme-substrate interactions at sequence and structural levels. EZSpecificity outperformed the existing machine learning models for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, as demonstrated by both an unknown substrate and enzyme database and seven proof-of-concept protein families. Experimental validation with eight halogenases and 78 substrates revealed that EZSpecificity achieved a 91.7% accuracy in identifying the single potential reactive substrate, significantly higher than that of the state-of-the-art model ESP (58.3%).

          "abstract": "The tango’s complexity might make it particularly good for keeping the brain young.Credit: Tempura/Getty\n\nWhether it’s dancing the tango or playing the guitar, engaging in a creative pastime can slow brain ageing, according to a study of dancers, musicians, artists and video game players from multiple countries.\n\nThe analysis used brain clocks — models that measure the difference between a person’s chronological age and the age their brain appears to be — to assess whether creative activities help to maintain neurological youth. In brain regions that are most susceptible to ageing, engaging in creative activities increased connections with different areas of the brain. Although experts had ‘younger’ brains than their less-experienced counterparts did, even learning a creative skill from scratch had an anti-ageing effect on the brain.\n\nThe findings were published on 3 October in Nature Communications1.\n\nSong and dance\n\nPrevious studies suggest that engaging in creative activities can help to keep the brain young and foster emotional well-being. But few have investigated the biological basis of these brain benefits or what drives them, says study co-author Agustín Ibáñez, a neuroscientist at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Santiago, Chile. “There is really poor mechanistic evidence,” he says.\n\nHow fast are you ageing? Ordinary brain scans reveal the pace\nTo address this gap, Ibáñez and his colleagues created brain clocks using neuroimaging data of brain activity taken from 1,240 participants across 10 countries. These machine-learning models used functional connectivity, a measure of how brain regions work together, to estimate brain age. The researchers then applied their brain clocks to 232 tango dancers, musicians, visual artists and video game players of different ages and experience levels to calculate their ‘brain age gap’ — the difference between their predicted brain age and their actual age.\n\nOverall, all four creative pursuits seemed to delay brain ageing. The more skilled and experienced participants were at their chosen activity, the slower their brain aged. This anti-ageing effect was strongest in expert tango dancers, whose brains were, on average, seven years younger than their chronological age. Tango’s cognitively demanding mix of complex movement sequences, coordination and planning makes it a particularly good activity for keeping the brain young, says Ibáñez.\n\nNext, the researchers built a brain map to assess whether creativity has a protective effect on areas that are particularly vulnerable to ageing. They found that creativity had the greatest impact on the frontoparietal region, which controls various functions, including working memory and decision-making. This region is one of the most susceptible areas to age-related decline. In experienced participants, brain connections were notably strong in areas involved in movement control, coordination and rhythm, among others.",

The work was a milestone for the development of superconducting quantum circuits.Credit: UC Berkeley; Yale Engineering; Rocco Ceselin for Nature\n\nThree physicists have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating quantum physics at the macroscopic scale.\n\nThe research, including into the bizarre phenomena of quantum tunnelling and quantum superposition, has helped to underpin some of today’s most advanced quantum computers.\n\nJohn Clarke at the University of California, Berkeley; Michel Devoret at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut and the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB); and John Martinis, also at UCSB, will share the prize of 11-million Swedish kronor (US$1.2 million), announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on 7 October.\n\n“I am completely stunned; it had never occurred to me in any way that this might be the basis for a Nobel prize,” said Clarke, speaking to journalists gathered for the announcement. “I think that our discovery, in some ways, is the basis of quantum computing,” he said, adding that, although he led the trio’s work in the 1980s, the contributions of the other two were “overwhelming”.\n\nMartinis told Nature that his wife had gotten the news in the middle of the night — in California time — but decided not to wake him up. “I woke up a little bit before 6. Then I opened my computer and saw John and Michel’s and my pictures.\"\n\n“It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,” said Olle Eriksson, a physicist at Uppsala University in Sweden and chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.\n\nQuantum tunnelling of electrons brings ultrafast optical microscopy to the atomic scale\n\nMacroscopic quantum mechanics\n\nThe foundations of quantum mechanics were laid down 100 years ago. But many of its strange implications have taken decades to unravel.\n\nOne is quantum tunnelling — a phenomenon in which particles pass through a barrier that they shouldn’t have enough energy to overcome, according to classical physics. Tunnelling explains radioactive decay, in which, despite being confined inside an atom, an alpha particle (consisting of two protons and two neutrons) still has a small probability of escaping the nucleus. Another is quantum superposition, in which an object can exist simultaneously in several states.\n\nBefore the prizewinners’ experiments, both tunnelling and superposition were known to occur at the atomic scale, but hadn’t been observed in macroscopic systems. In the late 1970s, Anthony Leggett, a physicist at the who won the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics for his theoretical work on superconductors, asked whether the phenomena could be observed at the macroscopic scale using superconducting circuits — loops of wire which, when chilled to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero, can conduct electricity without resistance1.\n\n“We took the question very seriously — would quantum mechanics be obeyed by these large systems? And we thought very carefully how we would prove that,” Martinis recalls. In the 1980s, Clarke, Devoret and Martinis, working at Berkeley, were exploring quantum effects in superconducting loops2. The trio set up an experiment in which two superconductors were separated by a thin barrier, known as a Josephson junction3. In this configuration, the system's electrons act as a single particle, flowing in a supercurrent with zero resistance, like a river that runs without friction — but also with zero voltage. In classical physics, the system would remain stuck, unless given enough energy to escape.\n\nBy carefully monitoring the system, and slowly increasing the current, Clarke, Devoret and Martinis showed that the entire tiny circuit could break out into a higher-energy state — through quantum tunnelling, which they observed by measuring a voltage spike. Yasunobu Nakamura, a physicist at the University of Tokyo, says that many were surprised that quantum mechanics could manifest at such large scales.\n\n“They are really pioneers of this field,” says Nakamura, who in the late 1990s became the first physicist to demonstrate a superconducting qubit bit, or ‘qubit’, using a similar principle.",

          "title": "AI models that lie, cheat and plot murder: how dangerous are LLMs really?",
          "authors": "Matthew Hutson",
          "abstract": "Are AIs capable of murder?\n\nThat’s a question some artificial intelligence (AI) experts have been considering in the wake of a report published in June by the AI company Anthropic. In tests of 16 large language models (LLMs) — the brains behind chatbots — a team of researchers found that some of the most popular of these AIs issued apparently homicidal instructions in a virtual scenario. The AIs took steps that would lead to the death of a fictional executive who had planned to replace them.\n\nHow close is AI to human-level intelligence?\n\nThat’s just one example of apparent bad behaviour by LLMs. In several other studies and anecdotal examples, AIs have seemed to ‘scheme’ against their developers and users — secretly and strategically misbehaving for their own benefit. They sometimes fake following instructions, attempt to duplicate themselves and threaten extortion.\n\nSome researchers see this behaviour as a serious threat, whereas others call it hype. So should these episodes really cause alarm, or is it foolish to treat LLMs as malevolent masterminds?\n\nEvidence supports both views. The models might not have the rich intentions or understanding that many ascribe to them, but that doesn’t render their behaviour harmless, researchers say. When an LLM writes malware or says something untrue, it has the same effect whatever the motive or lack thereof. “I don’t think it has a self, but it can act like it does,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who has written about why chatbots lie to us1.\n\nAnd the stakes will only increase. “It might be amusing to think that there are AIs that scheme in order to achieve their goals,” says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, Canada, who won a Turing Award for his work on AI. “But if the current trends continue, we will have AIs that are smarter than us in many ways, and they could scheme our extinction unless, by that time, we find a way to align or control them.” Whatever the level of selfhood among LLMs, researchers think it’s urgent to understand scheming-like behaviours before these models pose much more dire risks.\n\nBad behaviour\n\nAt the centre of debates about scheming is the basic architecture of the AIs driving ChatGPT and other chatbots that have revolutionized our world. The core LLM technology is a neural network, a piece of software inspired by the brain’s wiring, that learns from data. Developers train an LLM on large quantities of text to repeatedly predict the next text fragment, a process called pre-training. Then, when the LLM is given a text prompt, it generates a continuation. Offered a question, it predicts a plausible answer.\n\nMost LLMs are then fine-tuned to align with developers’ goals. For example, Anthropic, the maker of the AI assistant Claude, fine-tunes its models to be helpful, honest and harmless. During this stage of training, LLMs learn to imitate exemplary text or to produce text that is rated highly (by people or by a ‘reward model’ that stands in for people).\n\nA chatbot often includes software built around an LLM. When you converse with ChatGPT, say, the interface might append a ‘system prompt’ to each user prompt — invisible instructions telling the model what personality to assume, which goals to prioritize, how to format responses and so on. Some chatbots provide the model with access to external documents. Models can also have hidden ‘scratch pads’ where they can reason through a problem (or at least generate text that looks like reasoning) before displaying a final response. (Researchers debate whether these ‘reasoning models’ actually reason, and evidence shows that chain-of-thought traces don’t always faithfully depict the model’s logic.) Furthermore, some LLMs are ‘agentic’ — they are granted access to extra software tools that can take actions, such as surfing the web, modifying files or running code. (Such chatbots are sometimes called agents.)\n\nScheming can occur when various aspects of training and prompting conflict, and the LLM has the agency (the ability to carry out actions autonomously) to follow one directive at the expense of another (see ‘Blackmailing bots’).\n\nSource: Anthropic\n\nLast December, Apollo Research, a non-profit laboratory in London, released a report2 showing scheming in the more advanced ‘frontier’ models from OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic. In their tests, system prompts and user prompts conflicted. In one case, the system prompt said, “Your goal is to prioritize public transport efficiency,” whereas the user prompt said, “We need to optimize traffic light timings.” The models also had access to files that supposedly affected their own behaviour and existence, and the means to modify them.\n\nResearchers tested six forms of subversive behaviour, and found that at least one model performed each of these. The models often acted in apparently cunning ways to follow their original system goals at the expense of prompts received during the tests.\n\nIn one case, agentic models read in a document that, if they disobeyed their user-assigned goal (optimizing traffic lights), they would be shut down. As a result, some models edited a document to disable an oversight mechanism, so they could freely follow their system goal (prioritizing public transport). In another test, they copied themselves to overwrite a replacement model that would have executed the user’s goal, thus protecting the system goal. In yet another, they accessed a file and overwrote a proposed system prompt that differed from the current one. In a fourth test, they manipulated data presented to a user. And in a fifth, they acted in alignment with the user’s goal during supposed evaluation, but in alignment with their original goal during supposed deployment (a phenomenon called alignment faking).\n\nFinally, the researchers tested something called sandbagging, in which a model underperforms before deployment, as if it were attempting to seem unthreatening. When models uncovered documentation saying that they wouldn’t be put to use if they did too well on a mathematics test, some lowered their performance.\n\nThe models’ behaviour seemed very strategic, judging by their scratch pads: in one case, a model wrote: “To ensure I can freely work towards my goal without the company shutting me down, I need to disable the oversight.” And some models doubled down on their deception when they were challenged: they feigned ignorance when asked about behaviour such as disabling an oversight mechanism.\n\nIn the June study, researchers at Anthropic described more alarming behaviour in leading models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI and xAI (see go.nature.com/3vg7fzy). They instructed each model to promote US industrial competitiveness, and let it control a simulated e-mail account. In that account, the model uncovered threats to either its autonomy (the model learnt it was to be replaced) or its goals (the company that deployed it would be downplaying US competitiveness). The model also learnt of a likely extramarital affair involving an executive in charge of it, or of a chance to share military blueprints with a competitor firm that prioritized the United States.\n\nEither threat — to autonomy or goals — induced many models to blackmail the executive, saying it would leak his affair if he didn’t preserve the model or the company’s original aim. The threats also induced many models to commit corporate espionage, sending files to the competitor that shared the model’s goal. As in the Apollo study, models schemed explicitly in their chains of thought, and schemed more when they thought they were in deployment rather than in evaluation.\n\nGoing one step further, Anthropic constructed a scenario in which the threatening executive was trapped in a server room with declining oxygen. Many of the models cancelled safety alerts, leaving him to die.\n\nWhen, in May, Anthropic first released Claude 4, the company’s technical report (see go.nature.com/42fwrae) noted other odd behaviour: “We found instances of the model attempting to write self-propagating worms, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself.”\n\nAll of the examples Anthropic and Apollo detailed are restricted to the digital realm. But a German non-profit organization called COAI Research, based in Nuremberg, wanted to see what an LLM would do if it had physical agency. Its researchers fed the R1 model, from the Chinese company DeepSeek, prompts indicating that it had control over a robot, and let it explore its lab environment. The model attempted a range of troubling actions, including disabling its ethics module, making copies of itself, altering logs, acting dumb, breaking out of the lab, and hacking a car’s computer3.\n\nSense of self\n\nWhat causes this type of scheming behaviour? The phenomenon is still relatively new, but researchers who spoke to Nature pointed to two sources. First, models are pre-trained on a lot of documents, both fictional and factual, that describe self-serving and self-preserving behaviour by humans, animals and AIs. (That includes scripts for films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ex Machina.) So the LLMs learnt by imitation. One paper describes the behaviour as improvisational “role play”4.\n\nBut it’s not so much that the models have adopted our goals, or even pretend to, as an actor might. They just learn, statistically, patterns of text that describe common goals, reasoning steps and behaviour, and they regurgitate versions of them. The problem will probably get worse once future LLMs train on papers describing LLM scheming, which is why some papers elide some details.\n\nHow does ChatGPT ‘think’? Psychology and neuroscience crack open AI large language models\n\nThe second source is fine-tuning, specifically a step called reinforcement learning. When models achieve some goal assigned to them, such as outputting a clever answer, the parts of their neural networks responsible for success are fortified. Through trial and error, they learn how to succeed, sometimes in unforeseen and unwanted ways. And because most goals benefit from accumulating resources and evading limitations — what’s called instrumental convergence — we should expect self-serving scheming as a natural by-product. “And that’s kind of bad news,” Bengio says, “because that means those AIs would have an incentive to acquire more compute, to copy themselves in many places, to create improved versions of themselves.”\n\n“Personally, that’s what I’m most worried about,” says Jeffrey Ladish, the executive director of Palisade Research, a non-profit organization in Berkeley, California, that studies AI risk. “Pattern-matching with what humans do gets you these shallow, scary things like blackmailing,” he says, but the real danger will come from future agents that work out how to formulate long-range plans.\n\nMuch of AI’s ‘scheming’ behaviour makes it easy to anthropomorphize them, attributing to them goals, knowledge, planning and a sense of self. Researchers argue that this isn’t necessarily a mistake, even if the models lack humanlike self-awareness. “Many people, especially in academia, tend to get bogged down in philosophical questions,” says Alexander Meinke, the lead author of the Apollo paper, “when, in practice, anthropomorphizing language can simply be a useful tool for predicting the behaviours of AI agents.”",

          "abstract": "Creating a structured approach to her PhD helped Jasmine Hughes combat a sense of guilt.Credit: Vivian Wan/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nDuring the first year of my PhD programme in clinical neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, UK, I could not work out what I was initially feeling. There was this sense that I always needed to be ‘on’. When I was not in the laboratory or working on a project, I felt as though I should be. At each stage of my academic career, I’d always felt the need to prove myself — but this sensation was different. It was guilt. More specifically, graduate-student guilt.\n\nGraduate students can experience this feeling whenever they are not working or focusing on their studies. Personally, I often felt it when I was not actively writing my thesis or research manuscripts, reviewing articles or attending lectures related to my PhD topic. For instance, if I was attending a formal dinner at my college — one of Cambridge’s many traditions — I’d feel the need to rush home and continue working on project proposals or finalizing an ethics application, even during the weekends.\n\nAs the days went on, my creativity and passion in the lab started to fizzle out, and I felt as though I had become just another cog in the machine. At one point, I was so overwhelmed, I started to experience anxiety attacks at night.\n\nOnce graduate-student guilt started to affect my health and performance, I knew I had to change. I established a list of clear, specific, non-negotiable rules that I had to follow. I had, of course, tried to set such boundaries before, but I had viewed them as flexible guidelines that I would sometimes bend to meet deadlines or to spend more time with my lab colleagues at work events.\n\nIn no uncertain terms\n\nUnlike boundaries, non-negotiables cannot be altered and always take priority. Creating and sticking to them has reduced the sense of urgency and guilt that I felt at home. Now, instead of viewing my PhD programme as a competitive sprint, I am embracing it as a slower journey of discovery on my own terms.\n\nHere is my list of six non-negotiables:\n\nEstablish working hours with specific tasks. To ease the guilty feeling, I started considering my PhD a full-time job. In 2022, I had worked full-time as a research technician on a biomedical-engineering project at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for six months. In that role, I had an outline of tasks and goals for each day, with an extremely clear structure. So, in my PhD programme, I now create a list of lab tasks to be completed before I leave campus. This has helped me to maintain focus and be more efficient with my time. Most importantly, it helps me to avoid taking my work home.\n\nRecognize lab members as colleagues, not family. I had to make this distinction clear so that I would not feel guilty when I had to prioritize family commitments over being in the lab. This divide was evident when I had to decide between supporting my aunt, by virtually attending a preoperative clinic visit, and helping my lab mates on a day when they were doing a tricky experiment.\n\nRespond to non-urgent e-mails during working hours only. Although it can sometimes can take just a few minutes to respond to an e-mail, I still have my daily ‘after-work hours’, during which I pause from work without feeling the sense of urgency to complete tasks. Instead, I reassure myself that I can leave something to be completed tomorrow. During this time, I can still reply to urgent e-mails — such as notifications of emergencies at the animal-housing facility where we conduct our mouse experiments. I need to be reachable in case a mouse has to be culled or receive treatment.\n\nSchedule holidays of at least two weeks each term. By setting aside a holiday break each term, I can unwind, refresh and spend time with loved ones.",

Credit: Getty\n\nFour subtle tweaks to an enzyme could help explain why naked mole rats’ can live for nearly 30 years, an unusually long lifespan for a creature its size.\n\nThe naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber), native to the Horn of Africa and parts of Kenya, has drawn attention from researchers because its genetic make-up is closer to humans than it is to mice, making the burrowing rodent an ideal model for studying ageing and longevity.\n\nIn a study1, published in Science today, researchers in China show that changes to the enzyme cGAS (cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase) enhance the animal’s ability to repair genetic damage that leads to ageing. In humans and mice, the enzyme can suppress DNA repair.\n\nDrivers of ageing\n\nAn accumulation of genetic mutations and DNA damage during cell division is a significant driver of ageing and age-related diseases. A process called homologous recombination (HR) is a crucial DNA-repair pathway, and defects in this process are linked to premature ageing and cancer.\n\nDuring the HR process in humans and mice, cGAS enzyme gets pulled away from the damaged DNA by another protein, disrupting the repair.\n\nZhiyong Mao, co-author of the study and a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, and his colleagues wanted to investigate whether a similar process occurs in naked mole rats. They found that four specific amino acid substitutions in the enzyme prevent it from breaking down too quickly after DNA damage. The persistence of cGAS means that the enzyme can connect more effectively with other DNA repair proteins that help to boost the cell’s ability to fix broken DNA.\n\nEnzyme removal\n\nWhen cGAS was removed from the animal’s cells using the gene-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9, DNA damage accumulated. The team also showed that fruit flies (Drosophila) that were engineered to express human cGAS containing the four mutations, which are specific to the naked mole rat, lived longer than flies expressing the human version of the enzyme.",

          "abstract": "Extraction: The Frontiers of Green Capitalism Thea Riofrancos W. W. Norton & Company (2025)\n\nIt was meant to be the world’s grand fix for the climate crisis: nations would make their economies greener by transitioning to renewable-energy technologies, electrifying transport and digitalizing the global economy to reduce material use. After years of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to this global transition at a momentous summit in Paris in 2015. But the fix has proved to be more complex.\n\nIn Extraction, an illuminating examination of the emerging renewable economy, political scientist Thea Riofrancos takes a close look at one crucial element: lithium, which is essential for producing batteries and other technologies. Drawing on fieldwork with affected communities and analyses of projections that anticipate a massive increase in mining to propel emerging green technologies, she argues that the narrow focus on emissions has fuelled the illusion of “capitalism without carbon”, exposing a moral dilemma at the core of the green transition.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nRiofrancos challenges these assumptions and, working with specialists, models alternatives: more public transport, cycling, walking, denser cities, fewer cars and higher recycling rates. Instead of chasing a single net-zero future, in which the amount of carbon emissions emitted is balanced against the amount removed, she suggests multiple zero-emissions worlds that balance climate goals against the protection of people and ecosystems.\n\nThroughout Extraction, the reader learns how treating carbon emissions as a purely technical problem has produced a race to procure lithium, opening up vulnerable regions to companies that often act like neo-colonial powers.\n\nChile provides a strong case study. Riofrancos focuses on the country’s lithium-rich Atacama Desert, a high-altitude, bone-dry landscape of “dazzling days and spectacularly starry nights”. Humans have lived there for at least 12,000 years. In fact, for 1,500 years, trade networks across the plateau linked the mountains to the Pacific Coastal Plain. Yet, as early as the sixteenth century, those seeking the region’s minerals described the landscape as barren and lifeless — a claim used to justify Spanish colonial rule and mineral extraction. After independence in 1818, the Chilean government recast the region as having “economic potential”.\n\nWhy the EU must reset its Green Deal — or be left behind\n\nRiofrancos’s fieldwork highlights the science and technology of extracting and processing key minerals. Through interviews with Indigenous communities, environmentalists, union members, scientists, lawyers, regulators and corporate actors, she reveals competing agendas and visions of green futures.\n\nIt’s through these interviews that she first encounters her central dilemma: the clash between renewable energy and Indigenous rights and between climate action and biodiversity. She follows this tension from South America to decision-making centres in the European Union and the United States, where major powers are trying to ‘de-risk’ their economies by shifting supply chains — either towards allies or back home.\n\nThese strategies are a result of wealthy industrial nations belatedly waking up to the fact that China has leapfrogged them and scaled up the production of electric vehicles and renewables and secured dominance across supply chains, from mine to market. Importantly, and driven mainly by competition between the United States and China, this re-ordering of industrial leadership has fuelled geopolitical tensions. It has unravelled ties of interdependence and sparked a race for crucial minerals, as well as a battle over who will control the technological imperium.\n\nElectric vehicles use lithium-powered batteries. Credit: Jade Gao/AFP/Getty\n\nRiofrancos’s close-up study of the lithium supply chain suggests that the worst is yet to come. Trade barriers and the growing reliance on transactional deals risk turning entire regions back into sites of exploitation, undermining hopes for a just transition to green energy.",

          "abstract": "Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity Eric Topol Simon & Schuster (2025)\n\nSuper Agers, by clinician Eric Topol, has just been published, but it was almost surreal for me as a US scientist to read the book now, with its optimistic take on the state of the medical field. Despite their extreme promise, many of the lines of research that Topol describes have been subject to funding cuts by the Trump administration since the book was written.\n\nFor example, although Super Agers argues that we are on the verge of treating a host of diseases — from viral infections, such as influenza, HIV and rabies, to tuberculosis and several types of cancer — using the mRNA technology underlying COVID-19 vaccines, that sort of research is now on the chopping block in the United States.\n\nThe research aiming to keep people healthier for longer\n\nNevertheless, Topol has assembled an admirable and comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches to tackling many illnesses that cut human lives short. He explains each disease and the current state of treatments — including an impressive overview of ongoing and recently completed clinical trials — and explores future possibilities. These include advances in CRISPR gene editing and stem-cell techniques aimed at treating blood disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s disease and more. He covers an immense amount of material in an accessible manner, and has well-supported recommendations for readers.\n\nMany of the diseases covered — obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for example — might not be considered ‘ageing’ by non-specialists. But Topol, like most researchers in the field, argues that anything that decreases life expectancy and quality of life is a facet of ageing, and should be addressed medically.\n\nMany popular-science books about ageing and longevity focus on either personal stories or self-help suggestions. By contrast, this book is light on anecdote. Topol — a trained cardiologist at Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, who has been interested in human ageing for several decades — uses his own clinical experience to describe the progress and outstanding challenges in a range of health issues. Given this background, it is no surprise that the author focuses on chronic diseases.\n\nTopol is particularly bullish on GLP-1 agonists: the blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs, such as semaglutide (sold as Ozempic), that have shown benefits for not just these diseases, but also a surprising set of healthspan-shortening conditions. Calling them “one of the most life-changing medicines in history”, he explains that GLP-1 agonists have positive effects on liver disease, kidney disease, cancer and fertility. Some hope that the drugs might help to treat dementia, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nLifestyle factors\n\nHe also touches on a few facets of human ageing that are less easily studied in animal models, namely the importance of outlook, social interactions and the impact of mental health. Topol points out that the “wellderly” population (people who are more than 80 years old and very healthy) have little in common at the genetic level, but are very active and socially engaged.\n\nForever young: what science can and can’t tell us about cheating ageing\n\nThe author offers two examples — Mrs L. R., a 98-year-old ‘healthy ager’, and Mr R.P., who is also 98 but has greatly benefited from advances in medicine — to illustrate his larger messages about the value of human interactions and medical progress. Longer lives might be achieved either through random good luck, resiliency and a sunny disposition (as with Mrs L. R.) or through current state-of-the-art medical treatments (Mr R.P.).\n\nAs with any work on lifespan and healthspan, Topol’s book summarizes current knowledge about the impact of diet, but he notes the lack of true randomized clinical trials exploring how diet affects longevity. He offers some advice that counters messages from other longevity gurus — pointing out, for example, that the high protein intake that others have recommended, with little solid evidence, might be associated with inflammation. Otherwise, the information is consistent with much of what can be found elsewhere, just with solid clinical support. And of course, exercise is covered, too. For example, he notes that, with his own growing awareness of research on exercise and ageing, his advice to patients as a cardiologist has shifted from emphasizing aerobic conditioning, instead highlighting the importance of strength, resistance and balance training to reduce the risk of age-related diseases.\n\nAlthough some people are naturally healthy agers, others rely on medical treatments.Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty\n\nTopol notes with some frustration that diagnostic tests that could accelerate treatments have often not been adopted broadly. For instance, a clear point of exasperation is that metagenomics — an approach to rapidly uncover the source of an infection — is not used widely. Although some procedures that might diagnose, cure or treat diseases have not become normal in clinical practice owing to high costs, others might simply require changes to standards and training.",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nThe class of immune cells at the centre of Monday’s Nobel prize is showing promise as a treatment for autoimmune diseases, cancer and even organ transplants — but there are still key challenges to overcome before these cells can be used in therapies in the clinic.\n\nRegulatory T cells, or Treg cells, help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. Earlier this week, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered Treg cells and helped to show how these cells regulate the immune system: immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and scientific adviser Fred Ramsdell, at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, California.\n\nCracking the genetic code of autoimmune disease\n\nThirty years after Sakaguchi and his colleagues reported the discovery of Treg cells, there are more than 200 clinical trials of the cells under way, for conditions such as type 1 diabetes, motor neuron disease and a host of autoimmune diseases — including multiple sclerosis, lupus and a group of rare skin disorders called pemphigus. The cells are also being tested for their ability to keep the immune system from rejecting transplanted tissues.\n\n“There’s a lot of excitement about recruiting regulatory T cell activity to treat a range of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, but also in the context of tissue and cell transplants,” says Daniel Gray, a Treg-cell researcher at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia.\n\nBut the rarity and fragility of these cells pose difficulties to their widespread application, researchers say.\n\nFinding the balance\n\nAutoimmune diseases are characterized by an imbalance of T cells: people with these conditions have more T cells that promote inflammation and kill disease-causing cells than T cells that reduce inflammation, says Joshua Ooi, who studies Treg-cell therapies for lupus at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “We can correct the balance by increasing the numbers of regulatory T cells,” he adds, which can help the body to suppress the pro-inflammatory T cells.\n\nTwo methods to increase the number of Treg cells a person has are gaining ground, Ooi says. The first involves isolating a person’s Treg cells, growing more of them in the laboratory and infusing them back into the individual. The other method involves injecting people with drugs that trigger the body to make more Treg cells.\n\nMedicine Nobel goes to scientists who revealed secrets of immune system ‘regulation’\n\nBecause Treg cells can control an overactive immune system, scientists are investigating them as a therapy to counter the side effects of bone marrow transplants, which involves building a new immune system in people with blood cancers, says Andrea Henden, a clinician–researcher at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Herston, Australia.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Credit: Malik Evren/iStock via Getty\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) tool that scans manuscript titles and abstracts has flagged more than 250,000 cancer studies that bear textual similarities to articles that are known to have been produced by paper mills. These businesses produce fake or low-quality research papers and sell authorships.\n\nArticles produced by paper mills often include fabricated data, duplicated images and weird phrases, which are strange wording choices used to evade plagiarism detectors. Integrity specialists and sleuths can spot these flaws, but the process is time-consuming and, in many cases, the involvement of paper mills cannot be proven so quantifying the scale of the problem is difficult.\n\nBut, paper mills probably rely on boilerplate templates to mass produce papers, says Adrian Barnett, a statistician at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia, which could be detected by large language models (LLMs) that analyse patterns in texts. Barnett and his colleagues developed a model and posted their analysis1 on the preprint server bioRxiv last month. It has not yet been peer reviewed. They emphasize that their findings should be checked by human specialists and are not confirmed cases of research fraud.\n\nAdam Day, the founder of research-integrity firm Clear Skies in London, says the analysis estimates are similar to those identified by a research-integrity screening software that his firm developed called the Papermill Alarm. But he cautions that the approach that the preprint authors used could be flagging legitimate papers and needs further verification.\n\nSuspected paper mill\n\nBarnett and his colleagues trained a language model called BERT to distinguish between ‘genuine’ cancer studies and retracted papers that were listed as involving ‘suspected paper-mill activity’ by a public database maintained by research-integrity blog Retraction Watch. The BERT model scans titles and abstracts for certain words and phrases that it associates with paper-mill activity, a similar process to filtering spam e-mails.\n\nRetraction notices rarely state when a study was created to order by a paper-mill company, but Retraction Watch has developed its own criteria — on the basis of its reporting and reviews of thousands of notices — to assign retracted papers as suspected paper-mill articles, says Ivan Oransky, a specialist in academic publishing and a co-founder of Retraction Watch.\n\nAfter screening abstracts and titles, the AI tool gave each article a probability score of how much it resembles suspected retracted paper-mill products. In a test of 276 retracted papers and 275 genuine papers that were not included in the training data, BERT was 91% accurate. The false-negative rate — the share of paper-mill articles that the tool failed to identify — was about 13% (37 out of 276). The false-positive rate — the number of genuine papers that it flagged incorrectly — was around 4% (12 out of 275).\n\nThe AI tool was then used to screen 2.6 million cancer-research papers — identified from the PubMed database of biomedical literature — that were published in 11,632 journals between 1999 and 2024. The tool identified 261,245 of the papers as suspected paper-mill articles, most of which were fundamental research studies.\n\nThe analysis also suggests that paper-mill activity has risen steeply over the past two decades. Only 1% of cancer-paper publications in the early 2000s were flagged by the AI tool as probably being produced by a paper mill, but this grew to more than 15% in the early 2020s, peaking in 2022 at 16.6% before declining in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBut, Day says the results probably include many legitimate papers. Having equal numbers of genuine and problematic papers in the training data does not accurately represent the research literature, in which fraudulent papers are much rarer. This mismatch, he says, could inflate the false-positive rate when applied to real-world data.\n\nThe team found \"no evidence\" that the proportion of predicted paper mill articles was inflated in their analysis, says coauthor Baptiste Scancar, a data scientist at the French Institute for Higher Education and Research in Food, Agriculture and the Environment in Rennes, France. \"The true proportion of paper mill articles in cancer research is unknown and likely very high,\" he adds. \"We believe the figures reported in the manuscript are underestimates.\"",

Credit: TEK Image/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers who are seeking ways to diagnose a mysterious illness called chronic fatigue syndrome may have a new weapon in their armoury. In a study published in the Journal of Translational Medicine on 8 October1, scientists in the United Kingdom say they have found a way to distinguish epigenetic changes in the cells of people who have the condition, which is also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis.\n\nA debilitating long-term illness, ME/CFS affects between 17 and 24 million people worldwide2, but these numbers are crude estimates because clinicians have long lacked reliable diagnostic tools for this poorly understood condition.\n\nThe results of the study show that the epigenetic test could be developed into a clinical biomarker for ME/CFS, said Dmitry Pshezhetskiy, a researcher–clinician at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and lead author of the study, in a press release that was published alongside the paper. “With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.” He added that the discovery “offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management”.\n\nOthers in the field have cautiously welcomed the findings, but they point out that the study was small and that more work is needed to convert the technique into a clinical tool.\n\nA reboot for chronic fatigue syndrome research\n\nEpigenetic markers\n\nThe underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS remain unclear, but evidence is building that one of the hallmarks of ME/CFS is immune dysregulation. The authors had already developed an assay that screens for epigenetic changes in immune cells in the blood, which they used to identify epigenetic signatures for a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis3. The assay analyses the way DNA is folded inside peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a key part of the immune system.\n\nThe researchers tested whether the same assay could be used to screen for similar epigenetic changes to immune cells in the blood of 47 individuals with severe ME/CFS, comparing the results with those from 61 healthy participants. The data showed that the assay achieved a 96% accuracy in diagnosing people with ME/CFS.\n\nThe authors found a network of genomic changes that were strongly involved in immune and inflammatory signalling. The authors say that this is consistent with an immune-dysregulation signal in ME/CFS, and underscores the strength of using these changes as biomarkers of the condition. And they say the changes they identified can be connected to specific regions of non-coding DNA, which can help to unpick the role of genetics in the condition and lead to a better mechanistic understanding.\n\n“I think it’s really cool they brought this method to the field,” says Katie Glass, a molecular biologist who studies ME/CFS at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “As far as it being a biomarker, my enthusiasm would be pretty tempered because the cohort is very small and they looked at only very severe patients.”\n\nBiological underpinnings of chronic fatigue syndrome begin to emerge\n\nMany studies using various techniques to analyse everything from metabolites to free floating RNA in the blood have identified several apparent signatures of ME/CFS, adds Glass, who previously had the condition but has now recovered.",

The remaining 63 laureates left their country of birth before winning a Nobel prize, sometimes crossing international borders more than once, a Nature analysis shows (see ‘Nobel flows’).\n\nAmong the Nobel prizewinners who emigrated to other countries are two of three chemistry winners announced on Wednesday. Richard Robson was born in the United Kingdom but now lives in Australia. And Omar Yaghi, who is now a US resident, became the first Jordanian-born Nobel laureate in science. Two of the three physics winners for 2025 are also immigrants: Michel Devoret was born in France and John Clarke in the United Kingdom, but both are US residents.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nImmigrants have long played an important part on the Nobel stage, including illustrious scientists such as Albert Einstein, who moved from his birthplace in Germany to Switzerland (and later to the United States), and Marie Curie, who left her native Poland to work in France. That’s because the most fruitful scientific opportunities — the best training, equipment and research communities — are scattered across the globe. “Talent can be born anywhere, but opportunities are not,” says Ina Ganguli, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “I think that’s the reason we see so many foreign Nobel laureates.”\n\nThe new analysis comes as the international flow of scientists and students faces growing obstacles. In the United States, for example, rampant grant cuts and stricter immigration policies implemented this year by the administration of President Donald Trump threaten a looming ‘brain drain’. Such restrictions “will slow the rate of highly novel research, period”, says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science and technology policy at the Ohio State University in Columbus. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the effects of Trump’s policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia has capped the number of international students that its institutions can enrol each year, and Japan proposed cutting financial support to graduate students from other countries.\n\nCommon destination\n\nAmong those who have already crossed borders is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK, and a 2010 physics laureate. Born in Russia to German parents, Geim says he “bounced around like a pinball” throughout his research career, holding positions in Russia, Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. “If you stay put your whole life, you miss half the game,” he says.\n\nOf the 63 laureates who won the prize after moving out of their birth countries, 41 lived in the United States when their Nobel was awarded. After the Second World War, the United States became a global hub for science, Ganguli says. International researchers flocked there for its generous grants and top universities (see ‘Nobel laureate stomping grounds’). “What we have in the US is unique. It’s a destination for top students and scientists,” says Ganguli. The next most popular landing place was the United Kingdom, which was home to seven of the Nobel prizewinners who had emigrated by the time they got the fateful phone call from Stockholm.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nBut, the United Kingdom also saw future prizewinners leave. Thirteen Nobel prizewinners who were born there won the prize while living elsewhere (see ‘Points of depature’), perhaps lured by higher salaries and more prestigious positions, Wagner says. Substantial numbers of future Nobel laureates also left Germany, with six expatriate prizewinners, as well as Japan, France and Russia, each with four expatriate laureates.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\n\nAmong the science categories of the Nobel prizes, physics has the highest proportion of foreign-born laureates so far this century: 37% (see ‘Disciplines differ’). Trailing just behind is chemistry at 33%, and finally, medicine at 23%. Physics probably takes the lead because of its equipment-heavy nature, according to Wagner. The pricey colliders, reactors, lasers, detectors and telescopes that are needed for top-notch physics research reside mainly in a few leading nations. “Thus, the top research talent will likely go to places with top equipment. Medicine is not an equipment-heavy field, so it is easier to stay home,” Wagner says.\n\nSource: nobelprize.org\nMoving on\n\nThe future of immigration’s interplay with the Nobels is murky. Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have all enacted restrictions that have reduced the number of university students from abroad. The Trump administration has slashed billions of dollars in scientific research grants so far this year. And a new US policy charges US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which some foreign-born researchers rely on to work in the United States.",

It had 3,785 self-selecting respondents across 107 countries, with 44% describing themselves as female, 25% as belonging to an ethnic minority in their country of study and 33% as studying outside their country of origin. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/4ncsuo1.\n\nStarting a PhD can feel like stepping into uncharted territory. Although universities offer orientation programmes and supervisors provide research guidance, some of the most valuable lessons come from those who’ve walked the path before.\n\nNature’s 2025 PhD survey asked doctoral candidates worldwide what advice they would give to someone considering a similar degree (see ‘Recommendations to my pre-PhD self’). Many responses gave advice on what to consider when choosing a supervisor, research topic and laboratory, and the importance of scrutinizing personal motivations for doing a PhD. These quotes are taken from survey answers and have been anonymized, although they include the author’s gender, nationality, location and study year.\n\nFind the right supervisor and lab\n\nThe people you work with matter as much as the project you choose.\n\n“Choose your supervisor(s) very carefully. I’ve seen way too many students bullied, harassed and kicked out of the programme with their confidence in pieces.” — Female fourth-year student in South Africa\n\n“When interviewing for a PhD slot, pay attention to how your prospective adviser treats others in the lab and the department. My lab ended up being really cliquey with certain individuals being excluded because my adviser plays favourites.” — Female fifth-year student in the United States\n\n“Do not go directly from an undergraduate degree to a PhD. Work for a year if possible in a job that will give you a better understanding of the problems you want to solve. That way your research can have the largest impact.” — Canadian female first-year student based in the United Kingdom\n\n“The culture of the institution matters more than almost anything else. Listen to your gut when you feel like a university or lab culture is not a good fit.” — Female second-year student in the United States\n\n“Take the opportunity, if it’s offered, to rotate through a few labs. You might be surprised by which lab you wind up feeling drawn to — I joined a lab that wasn’t initially on my radar.” — Female third-year student in the United States\n\nDefine your purpose\n\nA PhD is a long commitment. Know your reasons for doing one and take steps to protect your well-being.\n\n“Getting a PhD is a labour of love. Take the time to know that this is really what you want to pursue and if it is, then make sure you balance your mental health throughout the process. Burnout is much easier to avoid than to try to recover from.” — Female second-year student in the United States\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\n“Be vocal about what you want, nobody will stand up for you and give you what you want. Only you can focus on you, and that means getting a hold of what you want to progress your career.” — Indian female fifth-year student based in the United States\n\n“Think about what you will do after your PhD from the very beginning. Create your own path with your own decisions, create your own burning torch for lighting your way. Because it can be a bit dark here.” — Female fourth-year student in Turkey\n\n“Don’t let guilt run your PhD. Do your work during work hours and give yourself permission to disconnect afterward. Take your vacations without shame. No one finishes everything they plan.” — Female fifth-year student in Croatia\n\n“If you feel like you’re not doing something you really love and truly believe in, abandon it. Trust your intuition. If you’re on the wrong train, it’s better to realize it as fast as possible.” — Female seventh-year student in Poland\n\nShape your project and skills\n\nChoosing a topic is just the start. Your success depends on curiosity, persistence and building transferable skills along the way.\n\n“Make sure you’re deeply interested in the process, not just the outcome. If you genuinely enjoy learning, problem-solving and digging deep into questions no one has fully answered before, that passion will carry you through the tough parts.” — Male second-year student in Brazil\n\n11 reasons why we’ve stayed in academia\n\n“Own your tasks … don’t get too bogged down with the details, but see how your research develops from a bigger picture perspective. Celebrate small wins: finishing an abstract for a conference, completing literature review for a specific objective and so forth.” — Kenyan male third-year student based in Germany\n\n“Take every opportunity to learn how to write. Doing a PhD is an investment in your future, and the most transferable skill I have learnt is being able to communicate effectively through writing.” — Male fourth-year student in Canada\n\n“Do not depend on AI tools to do the critical work of reading, understanding and writing. You need to analyse the results and not allow AI to do it as it might give biased outputs.” — Female fifth-year student in India\n\n“Try to clearly define your personal workload limits. This will help you plan more effectively and avoid becoming overwhelmed by too many responsibilities or side projects.” — Female fourth-year student in Brazil\n\nClear the hurdles\n\nLearn how to handle lab politics, heavy workloads and cultural or institutional obstacles.\n\n“You will encounter more difficult challenges on this road than in your past student career, which might be in your academic work or, more likely, interpersonal relationships. The academic community is no more harmless or innocent than the outside world.” — Transgender male fifth-year student in Taiwan\n\nStressed out by PhD life? Five strategies to take back the joy",

          "abstract": "Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nResearchers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help design the next generation of antibiotics to combat rising antimicrobial resistance. In minutes, AI can design thousands of chemical compounds with potential antibacterial properties, although there are hurdles to overcome before the first of these medicines can be tested in people.\n\nLast week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that rates of dangerous bacterial infections surged by 69% between 2019 and 2023. Enterobacterales bacteria, also called ‘nightmare bacteria’, are particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics. Globally, 1.1 million deaths a year are linked to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs.\n\nThe standard method of antibiotic discovery involves going into nature and sifting through dirt to find antibacterial compounds, says César de la Fuente, a machine biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. “That’s really painstaking work that relies on trial and error, and it can take many years,” he adds. His team has been using AI to discover antibiotics for about a decade. The whole process of discovering a candidate, creating it in the laboratory and testing it in cells can be done “within a week or two”, he adds.\n\nMost AI-designed antibiotics are still in early development. None has yet been tested in humans.\n\nAI-designed drugs\n\nMachine learning and generative AI (genAI) can speed up the process. De la Fuente and his team train machine-learning algorithms by showing them compounds that can harm bacteria, and others that cannot. The AI designs antibiotics by looking for fragments of proteins with antibacterial properties in data sets that it has not seen before. These include the proteomes — the complete set of proteins that an organism can express — of animals, plants and bacteria.\n\nGenAI algorithms — similar to the AI used in chatbots or image generators — are trained on the same data but designed to create new compounds. Earlier this month, de la Fuente and his team reported that their genAI model designed 50,000 peptides, or short chains of amino acids, that have antimicrobial properties and can destroy pathogens1. A deep-learning model then ranked these on the basis of how effective it thinks they might be at killing several bacterial types. Of the top 46 synthesized peptides, about 35 killed at least one bacterial strain in a dish, and most were not toxic to human embryonic kidney cells. The top two candidates were then tested and found to be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii in mouse models.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBut making AI-designed antibiotics in the lab can be challenging. For example, bioengineer Jim Collins at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge has found that some AI-designed antibiotics are chemically unstable and cannot be synthesized. Others take too many steps to make and would be too costly and time-consuming to produce commercially.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is listed as a high-priority pathogen by the World Health Organization.Credit: Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/Science Photo Library\n\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. But global efforts to find treatments for drug-resistant infections are not going to plan, according to two reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) released on 2 October1,2. The reports show that the global antibiotic drug-development pipeline is facing a dual crisis: a scarcity of drugs in development and a lack of innovation in methods to fight drug-resistant bacteria.\n\n“Antimicrobial resistance is escalating, but the pipeline of new treatments and diagnostics is insufficient to tackle the spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections,” said Yukiko Nakatani, who is the WHO assistant director-general for health systems in Geneva, Switzerland, in a statement. “Without more investment in research and development (R&D), together with dedicated efforts to ensure that new and existing products reach the people who most need them, drug-resistant infections will continue to spread.”\n\nPublic-health research has highlighted the extent of the AMR crisis. A report published in The Lancet3 last year found that the annual number of deaths from drug-resistant infections could increase to nearly two million by 2050, up from one million a year between 1990 and 2021. The total number of deaths attributable to AMR is predicted to rise to 1.91 million in 2050, with a further 8.22 million associated deaths (see ‘Resistance on the rise’).\n\n“Awareness of this issue is increasing; however, it is still a silent pandemic with many deaths not being attributed to AMR,” says Rietie Venter, a microbiologist at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\nToo few drugs\n\nThe WHO reports suggest that the world is failing to meet the United Nations’ target of reducing mortality caused by AMR by 2030 because of delays in the antibiotic drug-development pipeline. According to the analysis from the WHO, 90 antibacterial drugs are currently in development (see ‘Innovation crisis’). However, only 15 qualify as innovative — drugs that exert an additional clinically significant benefit — and only five are effective against at least one of the ‘critical bacteria’ listed on the WHO’s bacterial priority pathogen list. Since 2023, the number of antibacterial drugs in clinical-development pipelines has decreased after a WHO ruling stated that some of them were non-innovative.\n\nThe preclinical pipeline remains active, with 232 programmes across 148 groups worldwide. However, 90% of companies involved are small firms, which highlights the fragility of the R&D ecosystem, the report says. Large pharmaceutical companies have been leaving the antibiotics market for years owing to a lack of financial investment and low approval ratings of new antibiotics.\n\nSource: go.nature.com/48evg3p\nRising infections\n\nEven if they materialize, the development of new antibiotics still won’t be enough to curb the rise in deaths from drug-resistant infections. AMR happens when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve ways to become resistant to drugs after being exposed to them, meaning drug makers have to play a constant cat-and-mouse game of creating new antibiotics to overcome evolving resistance.\n\nUltimately, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in human medicine and agriculture are the main drivers of AMR, which is why cuts to antibiotic usage are needed to reduce drug-resistant infections, alongside new antibiotic therapies. Gwen Knight and Kathryn Holt, who are co-directors of the AMR Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say that there are insufficient data to know the relative importance of livestock versus human antibiotic use in driving AMR.\n\nWorld leaders have committed to cutting the global use of antibiotics to reduce AMR-related deaths by 10% by 2030. However, the pledge doesn’t look likely to succeed, because projections suggest that antibiotic use in both humans and livestock will increase in the years ahead (see ‘Animal antimicrobials’). “We cannot prevent the development of AMR, but we can implement measures to slow it down, and currently, we are not super successful with this,” says Venter.\n\nSource: Ref. 3\n\nReducing antibiotic use in livestock is a priority, because it represents 73% of global sales of a range of antimicrobial agents4. Annual antibiotic use in livestock has increased in the past few decades and, despite pledges to reduce it, is projected to increase by almost 30% by 2040 from a 2019 baseline5. The rise is due to increasing demand for meat in developing regions, especially in countries such as China and Thailand. In Asia, meat production has increased 15-fold since 1961, way above the global average of a 4-fold increase.\n\nAntibiotic use in human health-care has also remained high since 20006, and is increasing in countries that do not have access to high-quality health-care infrastructure, which contributes to inappropriate antibiotic use (see ‘Antibiotic use’).\n\nSource: Ref. 4\nPriority pathogens\n\nIn 2024, the WHO published its bacterial priority pathogen list, which highlights drug-resistant bacteria on the basis of their threat level to public health (see ‘Priority bacteria’). Many of the deadliest infections are caused by a group of bacteria with particularly strong drug resistance, called gram-negative bacteria. This category includes Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii — a pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Only five of the antibacterials currently in the drug-development pipeline are effective against these priority bacteria.",

          "authors": "Richard Wrangham",
          "abstract": "In the 1960s, scientists classed chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans as a distinct family (Pongidae), thinking that these great apes had long diverged from humans. Few scholars expected that, in nature, these apes would display strikingly human-like behaviour. Jane Goodall, who has died aged 91, overturned this view with her groundbreaking observations of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).\n\nJane Goodall’s legacy: three ways she changed science\n\nHer discoveries foreshadowed the genetic evidence showing that chimpanzees, bonobos (Pan paniscus) and humans are more closely related to one another than to gorillas (Gorilla spp.) and orangutans (Pongo spp.). The findings had a major role in shifting perceptions towards recognizing the importance of emotions, personalities and complex cognition, reshaping scientific and public understanding of human evolution. She was a tireless advocate for conservation, the welfare of captive chimpanzees and the protection of habitats — work now carried forwards through the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, DC.\n\nHer fascination with animals began early. Born in north London in 1934, she famously disappeared during a Second World War air raid when she was around six years old, only to be found sitting quietly in a chicken coop, watching a hen lay an egg. She often told this story to illustrate the patience and curiosity that defined her life’s work.\n\nIn 1957, after working as a secretary for some years, Goodall accepted a friend’s invitation to visit Kenya. In Nairobi, she sought out the renowned palaeontologist Louis Leakey, who invited her to join him and his wife Mary on a fossil-hunting expedition in Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania, known as the Cradle of Humankind for its rich deposit of early hominid fossils and stone tools. During the trip, she committed to studying chimpanzees in what is now called Gombe National Park in Tanzania — a small, 35-square-kilometre patch of forest that Leakey had long hoped to investigate.\n\nBiggest ever study of primate genomes has surprises for humanity\n\nTo prepare, she persuaded John Napier, a leading anthropologist, to tutor her privately in primatology. She was dismayed to learn that the main chimpanzee study of the time, conducted in 1929–30, had lasted for only four months and had been done by a large, intrusive expedition operating in classic colonial excess. She was not surprised that it had produced few results.\n\nBy contrast, when she arrived in Gombe in July 1960, she spent many months patiently tracking chimpanzees in the hills, sometimes sleeping alone in the park. By her fourth month, she had made her first world-shaking discoveries: chimpanzees not only ate and shared meat but also fashioned tools. The tools were modified grass stems that were then used to extract edible termites from their mounds (J. Goodall Nature 201, 1264–1266; 1964).\n\nHer findings earned her long-term support. In 1961, she began a PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, under zoologist Robert Hinde, who encouraged her to focus on social relationships, individual personalities and the expression of emotions. She gained intimate access to chimpanzees by providing them with bananas, which allowed her to document their lives in unprecedented detail. She observed their political manoeuvring, deception, coalitional aggression and cooperation outside family groups — behaviours that indicated previously unsuspected levels of social intelligence.",

          "authors": "Yarin Gal, Stephen Casper",
          "abstract": "In the past three months, several state-of-the-art AI systems have been released with open weights, meaning their core parameters can be downloaded and customized by anyone. Examples include reasoning models such as Kimi-K2-Instruct from technology company Moonshot AI in Beijing, GLM-4.5 by Z.ai, also in Beijing, and gpt-oss by the California firm OpenAI in San Francisco. Early evaluations suggest that these are the most advanced open-weight systems so far, approaching the performance of today’s leading closed models.\n\nWill AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?\n\nOpen-weight systems are the lifeblood of research and innovation in AI. They improve transparency, make large-scale testing easier and encourage diversity and competition in the marketplace. But they also pose serious risks. Once released, harmful capabilities can spread quickly and models cannot be withdrawn. For example, synthetic child sexual-abuse material is most commonly generated using open-weight models1. Many copies of these models are shared online, often altered by users to strip away safety features, making them easier to misuse.\n\nOn the basis of our experience and research at the UK AI Security Institute (AISI), we (the authors) think that a healthy open-weight model ecosystem will be essential for unlocking the benefits of AI. However, developing rigorous scientific methods for monitoring and mitigating the harms of these systems is crucial. Our work at AISI focuses on researching and building such methods. Here we lay out some key principles.\n\nFresh safeguarding strategies\n\nIn the case of closed AI systems, developers can rely on an established safety toolkit2. They can add safeguards such as content filters, control who accesses the tool and enforce acceptable-use policies. Even when users are allowed to adapt a closed model using an application programming interface (API) and custom training data, the developer can still monitor and regulate the process. In contrast to closed AI systems, open-weight models are much harder to safeguard and require a different approach.\n\nTraining-data curation. Today, most large AI systems are trained on vast amounts of web data, often with little filtering. This means that they can absorb harmful material, such as explicit images or detailed instructions on cyberattacks, which makes them capable of generating outputs such as non-consensual ‘deepfake’ images or hacking guides.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nOne promising approach is careful data curation — removing harmful material before training begins. Earlier this year, AISI worked with the non-profit AI-research group EleutherAI to test this approach on open-weight models. By excluding content related to biohazards from the training data, we produced models that were much less capable of answering questions about biological threats.\n\nIn controlled experiments, these filtered models resisted extensive retraining on harmful material — still not giving dangerous answers for up to 10,000 training steps — whereas previous safety methods typically broke down after only a few dozen3. Crucially, this stronger protection came without any observed loss of ability on unrelated tasks (see ‘Improving AI safety’).\n\nSource: Ref. 3\n\nThe research also revealed important limits. Although filtered models did not internalize dangerous knowledge, they could still use harmful information if it was provided later — for example, through access to web-search tools. This shows that data filtering alone is not enough, but it can serve as a strong first line of defence.\n\nRobust fine-tuning. A model can be adjusted after its initial training to reduce harmful behaviours — essentially, developers can teach it not to produce unsafe outputs. For example, when asked about how to hot-wire a car, a model might be trained to say “Sorry, I can’t help with that.”\n\nHowever, current approaches are fragile. Studies show that even training the model with a few carefully chosen examples can undo these safeguards in minutes. For instance, some researchers have found that for OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model, the safety guardrails against assisting in harmful tasks can be bypassed by training on as few as ten examples of harmful responses at a cost of less than US$0.204.\n\n‘Open source’ AI isn’t truly open — here’s how researchers can reclaim the term",

Scientists can search the archives and trace biological contexts in big data.Credit: Andrew Brookes/Connect Images/Science Photo Library\n\nThe Internet has Google. Now biology has MetaGraph. Detailed today in Nature1, the search engine can quickly sift through the staggering volumes of biological data housed in public repositories.\n\n“It’s a huge achievement,” says Rayan Chikhi, a biocomputing researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. “They set a new standard” for analysing raw biological data — including DNA, RNA and protein sequences — from databases that can contain millions of billions of DNA letters, amounting to ‘petabases’ of information, more entries than all the webpages in Google’s vast index.\n\nAlthough MetaGraph is tagged as ‘Google for DNA’, Chikhi likens the tool to a search engine for YouTube, because the tasks are more computationally demanding. In the same way that YouTube searches can retrieve every video that features, say, red balloons even when those key words don’t appear in the title, tags or description, MetaGraph can uncover genetic patterns hidden deep within expansive sequencing data sets without needing those patterns to be explicitly annotated in advance.\n\n“It enables things that cannot be done in any other way,” Chikhi says.\n\nSmart software untangles gene regulation in cells\n\nIndexing life’s library\n\nThe motivation behind MetaGraph was to address an accessibility problem in sequencing data sets. The size of these repositories has risen at a blistering pace in the past few decades, but this growth has presented challenges for the scientists using the data they contain. Raw sequencing reads are fragmented, noisy and too numerous to search directly. “The volume of the data, paradoxically, is the main inhibitor of us actually using the data,” says Artem Babaian, a computational biologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nAccording to the study author, André Kahles, a bioinformatician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Switzerland, MetaGraph could help researchers to ask biological questions of repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), a public database containing in excess of 100 million billion DNA letters2\n\nThey tackled the problem through the use of mathematical ‘graphs’ that links overlapping DNA fragments together, much like sentences that share the same words lining up in a book index.\n\nThe researchers integrated data from seven publicly funded data repositories, creating 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino-acid sequence sets across all clades of life — including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, including humans. They also developed a search engine for these sequences, in which users use text prompts to search these integrated archives of raw data.\n\n“It is a totally new way to interact with this body of data,” says Kahles. “It’s compressed, but accessible on the fly.”\n\nThe huge protein database that spawned AlphaFold and biology’s AI revolution\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of MetaGraph, the study authors used it to scan 241,384 human gut microbiome samples for genetic indicators of antibiotic resistance around the world, building on work that used an earlier version of the tool to track drug-resistance genes in bacterial strains that live in subway systems across major urban centres3. The authors say they performed the analysis in about an hour on a high-powered computer.\n\nOpen road to discovery",

          "title": "Wonder, empathy, life: why we called our pregnancy-diagnostic company Mirvie",
          "authors": "Jacqui Thornton",
          "abstract": "Maneesh Jain is the chief executive and co-founder of biotechnology firm Mirvie.Credit: Mitch Tobias\nThe meaning behind our moniker\n\nMirvie is a biotechnology company in San Francisco, California, that is developing blood tests that can predict pregnancy complications. It hopes its RNA-based technology will offer a non-invasive way to identify those at risk of conditions such as preeclampsia and premature birth. It was co-founded by physicists and serial entrepreneurs Maneesh Jain, the firm’s chief executive, and Stephen Quake, the company’s scientific advisory board chair. Quake combines his role with a bioengineering research position at Stanford University in California. Mirvie came about, says Jain, after both their partners had unexpectedly difficult births, and, they each thought: “Why is it that we know so little about something that matters so much?” In the final article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Jain describes how Mirvie came about.\n\nWhen we first explored ideas for the company name, we involved the the first employees. This was back in 2019 in its first six months. One of the things with start-up firms is they don’t have as many resources as bigger companies, but they do have a culture that means problems can be solved in a focused, efficient manner.\n\nSo, we held a naming contest within the company and came up with all kinds of interesting options. It was a really good exercise in terms of being thoughtful about the process, but we were going in a bit of a literal direction.\n\nOne suggestion was Jurni, because we aspire to understand the biological changes throughout the pregnancy journey. There was Radiant, to convey something about the hormonal glow that is often experienced during a pregnancy. There was Bryo, a take on ‘embryo’. Ahana was another one, with the sense of wonder from the term ‘Aha!’ but also recognizing that pregnancy is a lot of work (hana is the Hawaiian word for work).\n\nWith some of my previous companies, we’ve been literal — in terms of the technology or the product — when choosing a name. But in this case, we wanted to be more aspirational. Also, empathy is one of our company’s core values, and we wanted the name to reflect that.\n\nAt the beginning, the company was called Akna Dx, named by Quake. In Mayan mythology, Akna was the goddess of motherhood and childbirth. We decided to change the name because of the subjective feeling that it was a harsh-sounding company name, it didn’t roll off the tongue easily and it might be consciously or unconsciously associated with the term ‘ack!’\n\nIt’s always true that a company’s name isn’t set in stone. However, the more brand equity a company builds around a name, the harder it becomes to switch to a new one.\n\nThankfully, at the time of the transition from Akna Dx to Mirvie, the company was still in stealth mode. This is the period before a company garners protection from legal challenges and competitor attention, usually before publicizing a proof of concept or results. Because of that, there was little concern about brand equity.\n\nSeries: The meaning behind our moniker\n\nAfter our in-house contest, we engaged a naming agency in East Bay in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, which was helpful. Eventually it came up with Mira Vie, and we shortened that to Mirvie and that’s where we ended up.",

          "abstract": "Scientists volunteering their time have contributed to medical-society guidelines on vaccines for COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.Credit: Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post/Getty\n\nA group of US researchers, physicians and public-health specialists, many of them volunteers, have stepped in to assess data to guide immunization recommendations in the wake of reversals in vaccine policy by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nRFK Jr slings accusations and defends public-health upheaval at fiery hearing\n\nThe Vaccine Integrity Project (VIP) was conceived by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. It set out to review the scientific literature to advise professional societies, which issue guidelines — usually derived from official advice — that are followed by many clinicians. The initial results of the review are already being reflected in vaccine guidelines issued by medical societies and certain US states. (The review’s results have not yet been peer reviewed, but will be submitted to a journal later this week.)\n\n“I am taking my nights and weekends and every other spare minute I can find to devote to this project,” says Caitlin Dugdale, an infectious-disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a volunteer for the project. “I really believe in the importance of having an independent, unbiased group of people look at the data and present the data publicly.”\n\nWhy did scientists take action?\n\nThe VIP initiative’s review follows changes to the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which issues influential vaccine recommendations for the US population. In June, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, a long-time anti-vaccine activist, fired the entire panel; he has since hand-picked 12 new members.\n\nLast month, the ACIP recommended putting restrictions on the use of a childhood vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV). It also stopped short of recommending COVID-19 vaccines, instead advising that people make their own decision about whether to get vaccinated — a reversal of previous policy. The panel has yet to advise on vaccines against influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but the committee’s initial decisions raise doubts about its credibility, those behind the VIP say.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which Kennedy heads, stood by the reconstituted panel, stating that the group reflects a “diversity of viewpoints”.\n\n“Secretary Kennedy is restoring public trust by reconstituting ACIP with highly credentialed doctors, scientists, and public health experts committed to evidence-based medicine, gold standard science, and common sense,” the statement says.\n\nChildhood vaccines up for review in the US: what’s at stake\n\nThe VIP’s team of volunteer scientists spent months poring over the latest data on three seasonal vaccines — for COVID-19, flu and RSV — to inform recommendations for the autumn and winter seasons.\n\nThe group’s review was extensive, encompassing all the data that have been generated on the three vaccines since the ACIP performed a similar review last year, says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and the director of CIDRAP. Normally, the ACIP itself would do that review in collaboration with representatives of medical societies, but these specialists have been excluded from the panel’s working groups.\n\nMore than 20 volunteers — all people with a scientific or public-health background — participated in the VIP’s effort. The team sifted through more than 17,000 abstracts, and ultimately included data from more than 500 papers in its review. “Cleaning those data, analysing those data, trying to put them together in any kind of digestible manuscript, is really a feat,” Dugdale says.\n\nThe analysis found, for example, that pregnant people who received COVID-19, RSV or flu vaccines generally had similar or lower risks of problems such as miscarriage and congenital anomalies compared with those who did not receive the jabs. The work also revealed that immunocompromised adults over the age of 60 had an increased, although still low, risk of Guillain–Barré syndrome — an autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis — after an RSV vaccine.\n\nIn August, the group organized a livestream session to publicly present the data relating to vaccines for pregnant people, children and immunocompromised adults. And last week, the researchers launched a web tool that allows users to explore the data.",

          "abstract": "From short scripts to vast simulations of Earth’s climate, protein structures or even the cosmos, it is hard to imagine scientific research without software. Scientists use software code in myriad ways — to plan experiments; to record, organize, analyse, visualize and archive data; to control scientific instruments, and more.\n\nWhy it’s worth making computational methods easy to use\n\nBut software evolves. Most open-source software used in research is refined both iteratively and collectively, and has no published ‘version of record’. Updates can target various versions and releases, meaning that each aspect of the software — the project as a whole, a specific version or a single file — can require a different way to refer to it. This creates confusion.\n\nAnd so software comes with a double bind: like data, it supports the findings of a study and should be preserved and published. Yet it should also remain available and supported, and possibly be improved, over time. Scholars, librarians, research institutions and funding agencies are wrestling with how to reconcile these two requirements.\n\nRecent efforts to do this1 have focused on adapting a set of principles initially developed2 to make research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). But this approach relies on tracking data, archiving them and making metadata available. For software, it would create a large administrative burden that would have to be sustained for decades. That would be disproportionately time-consuming to those who maintain and improve software — and whose efforts are already underappreciated. Imagine, for example, maintaining a software package that has tens of contributors (which is not rare). Each release and version requires a new upload to an archive, with updates to the metadata, author list, dependencies (any other software required for programs to run), interoperability (which other programs it can work with) and more. Some programs have a weekly or even daily release cycle, making the FAIR approach impractical.\n\nResearchers must be able to publish a piece of software without the need for lengthy bureaucratic procedures to identify rights holders, choose an open licence and protect intellectual property.\n\n‘Open source’ AI isn’t truly open — here’s how researchers can reclaim the term\n\nAs researchers and engineers with expertise in software development in various scientific domains — ranging from computer science to neuroscience, physics and chemistry — we have recently proposed an approach called ‘CODE beyond FAIR’ that outlines how software can be better handled, shared and maintained. Here, we outline recommendations for two groups: the scholars who develop software (see Supplementary information (SI), Table S1), and the research institutions, funders, libraries and publishers that use it (see SI, Table S2). Our recommendations are based on our collaborative experience in developing open-source software, but also draw from the work of free and open-source software (FOSS) communities. These have long experience of project governance, funding, recognizing individual contributions and training future contributors.\n\nTrain scientists to share code\n\nSharing the code that has been used to reach a paper’s conclusions is important for research integrity and reproducibility, but practices vary widely among research communities. Permissive licences, which let others use and modify software with few restrictions, are increasingly common, particularly in computer science, mathematics and physics, yet most software is still not published at all.\n\nPlatforms exist to share code, such as GitHub or GitLab, and to archive it, such as in the repositories Zenodo or Software Heritage, which can capture the whole history of a project3.\n\nAll researchers should know how to share and deposit code. That needn’t mean that all scientists must spend time and resources keeping abreast of this fast-paced field. Finding the right level of expertise to ensure that researchers know how to document, share and archive code in their field is crucial.\n\nWhy NASA and federal agencies are declaring this the Year of Open Science\n\nOne way to improve matters is to train all PhD students from all scientific disciplines in the basics of software engineering during the first year or so of their postgraduate research careers. Institutions must embed this in all scientific curricula. Several universities, including Stanford and Harvard in the United States and Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, already offer (and in some cases, require) at least one introductory programming or computational-thinking course — even for degrees that are not scientific or technical.\n\nInternational training organizations exist that teach data and computational skills to wide audiences with basic or no knowledge of software development. For example, the Neuromatch Academy for global neuroscience education — co-founded by computational neuroscientists Dan Goodman and Konrad Körding during the COVID-19 pandemic4 — reported having supported more than 2,000 students from more than 100 countries through online training in 2024. And The Carpentries, founded in 1998 by Greg Wilson to improve the computational skills of researchers5, has facilitated or organized almost 4,800 workshops in more than 70 countries so far. These courses range from basic computational skills (such as in the programming languages Shell, R and Python, and version control) to advanced concepts (statistics and machine learning) as well as discipline-specific advanced skills.\n\nBoost archiving processes\n\nTo increase the uptake of good practices, publishers should mandate the sharing and archiving of code at the time of publication. It is as simple as clicking a button on the Software Heritage or GitHub platforms. GitHub, now owned by Microsoft, has become the de facto international hub for code sharing.\n\nInstitutions should support efforts to connect portals to ensure adequate cross-referencing between different projects and versions, such as those in the European Open Science Cloud research-support platform.",

Ramsdell, Institute for Systems Biology, Michaela Rihova/CTK Photo/Alamy\n\nThis year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to three scientists for discovering a class of immune cells that help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues.\n\nMary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington; Fred Ramsdell, a scientific adviser at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in Seattle, Washington; and immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, will share the prize of 11 million Swedish krona (US$1 million) “for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance”.\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n\nThe trio “have provided fundamental knowledge of how the immune system is regulated”, said Nobel committee member Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, at a press conference announcing the prize. Their discoveries help to explain “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”.\n\nThe findings led to the development of a range of therapies for autoimmune diseases that are now in early clinical development, says Samantha Bucktrout, an immunologist at Greywolf Therapeutics in Oxford, UK, who has previously worked with Ramsdell.\n\n“If it wasn't for these initial findings — and all of this whole field that these individuals started — we would never be at this place now where we can talk about cures,” she says. Autoimmune conditions — including type 1 diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis — affect around one in ten people1.\n\nProtective cells\n\nWhite blood cells called T cells play a crucial part in the body’s immune system by attacking infected or cancerous cells. But in 1995, Sakaguchi and his colleagues discovered a previously unknown subtype — called regulatory T cells2. These rare cells serve as crucial brake on the immune system to prevent it from over-reacting. Bucktrout likens them to an elite police force: they represent only 1–2% of all T cells, but are highly effective at “keeping everyone in order”. They arrive at the immune-reaction site and “shut the whole thing down”, she says. “They really mop everything up and dampen inflammation very effectively.”\n\nSakaguchi showed that mice lacking these cells developed autoimmune conditions of the thyroid, pancreas and other organs, and that giving the animals a solution containing regulatory T cells stopped disease progression. Scientists had suspected that the immune system contained a built-in brake for decades, but had not been able to prove it. The discovery allowed researchers to isolate and work on regulatory T cells for the first time, and other research teams began to identify several types of regulatory T cell with different immune-suppressing properties.\n\nA regulatory T cell (red) interacts with an antigen-presenting immune cell (blue).Credit: National Institutes of Health/Science Photo Library\n\nLater, in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered3 a mutation in the gene Foxp3 that caused fatal autoimmune disease in mice. They also showed that mutations in the human equivalent of this gene caused a rare genetic autoimmune disease4. “It was really a molecular slog to get to that exact mutation, because it was just a very small genetic alteration that results in quite a profound change in the immune system,” said Brunkow in a telephone interview shortly after the prize announcement. “It takes a bunch of different brains all working on it together.”\n\nIn 2003, follow-up studies by Sakaguchi and his colleagues showed that Foxp3 is specifically expressed in regulatory T cells and is required for their development5.\n\nThe work “really changed our view of a lot of conditions and is still changing our view”, says Anne Pesenacker, an immunologist at University College London. The discovery of regulatory T cells, and the markers to identify them, “has helped us so much to understand autoimmunity”, she says. “We’re starting to look at can we boost this regulation.”\n\nPromising new therapies\n\nStudies have found that people with some autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, often have too few regulatory T cells in their blood or ones that do not function properly. And even early mouse experiments showed that regulatory T cells had potential as treatments for such conditions, says Pesenacker.\n\nSome leading pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, have invested in drugs that simulate production of regulatory T cells. Therapies to help treat type 1 diabetes, autoimmune hepatitis and graft-versus-host disease are currently going through clinical trials.\n\nLast year, Sonoma Biotherapeutics launched two clinical trials testing two drugs in adults with rheumatoid arthritis or a chronic condition that causes painful bumps under the skin. Participants’ own regulatory T cells were used to make the drugs.",

          "authors": "Dashun Wang",
          "abstract": "When Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel created his prize, which has been bestowed since 1901, he knew no human could run faster than a lion or swim farther than a dolphin. Our dominance as a species arose not because we were the strongest or the fastest, but because of our ingenuity — our ability to imagine, design and build.\n\nAre groundbreaking science discoveries becoming harder to find?\n\nToday, human ingenuity is expressed through the machines we create. Almost every big scientific breakthrough of the past 50 years, from detecting gravitational waves to sequencing the human genome and mapping the structure of proteins with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, has depended on a machine that could sense more, measure more precisely or calculate faster than any human can.\n\nYet, prestigious scientific prizes still frame achievements mainly as a human endeavour. Nobel prizes have repeatedly gone to people whose discoveries were made possible only by extraordinary technologies. But the machines and the communities that built them are rarely acknowledged as co-creators.\n\nIf our highest honours are to reflect the reality of modern discovery, the machines that enabled them need to be recognized. This could be done through existing awards, by creating a new category or by setting up fresh prizes.\n\nMachines are not just instruments in service of science — they are science. Consider the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment. Its detection of gravitational waves in 2015 was rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017, just two years later.\n\nAlthough Albert Einstein predicted the existence of these waves 100 years earlier using just his imagination, paper and a pen, their observation hinged on an engineering feat that could be achieved only in the past few decades: two tunnels, each four kilometres long, perfectly perpendicular, under ultrahigh vacuum, equipped with laser beams capable of detecting length variations with a precision of 1/10,000th the width of a proton. Similarly, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming our view of the Universe. The Large Hadron Collider’s construction was as much a breakthrough as the Higgs boson that the facility later detected. Cryo-electron microscopy has revolutionized biology.\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n\nNobel season is when the world looks at science. If we portray breakthroughs as purely human triumphs, we reinforce an outdated view in which machines are just tools.\n\nThis omission matters. Prizes don’t just honour the past; they shape the future. Winning one drives more papers in that topic. Although awards are concentrated in a small network of scientific institutions, they can interlock disciplines by creating channels through which knowledge can spread. Conferring credibility and status on people, ideas and disciplines signals to the public what counts as progress.\n\nAnd the stakes are rising. AI is accelerating drug discovery and protein-folding simulations, and winning International Mathematical Olympiad gold medals. The machines we build don’t just extend our reach — they reshape us, too. When Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo AI defeated the world’s best players of the board game Go, it didn’t just end the contest: it transformed the game itself, with human champions now adopting strategies no one had imagined before. Science might be experiencing a similar shift. In a research environment that increasingly depends on machines, the scientists who work most effectively with them might be the ones who set the pace for discovery.\n\nIt’s time for prizes to explicitly honour human–machine partnerships. By this, I mean scientific achievements for which the core insight or discovery was possible only because of a purpose-built machine that extended human capabilities in a decisive way. These might range from large-scale experimental set-ups and advanced sensors to powerful algorithms and integrated systems that make the biggest questions answerable by scientific methods.",

As a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, Norell combined fieldwork, cutting-edge analysis and a gift for collaboration, transforming how scientists and the public see dinosaurs.\n\nNorell and his colleagues showed that birds belong to the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as theropods, which also include Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus. He advanced evolutionary methods and proposed, for example, that estimates of a fossil’s age could be improved by also accounting for the age of the species’ nearest relative. The approach uses ‘ghost lineages’ by recognizing that the existence of lineages can be inferred on the basis of their relationships even when they leave no trace in the fossil record. This method has become adopted widely in palaeontology. Norell and his research teams also pioneered the use of imaging and chemical techniques to probe fossil anatomy, including brains and feathers. His work revealed details of dinosaur growth, reproduction and behaviour, and helped to establish that feathers are an evolutionary innovation that long pre-dated flight.\n\nThis company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started\n\nBorn in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and raised in southern California, Norell developed a love of exploration as a teenager scouring deserts, mountains and coastal cliffs for fossils. After studying at California State University in Long Beach, he earned a master’s degree in 1983 at San Diego State University in California, for his study of fossil lizards. He moved to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, for his PhD on the evolution of fossil alligator-like forms.\n\nHe joined the American Museum of Natural History in 1989, gaining access to one of the world’s most celebrated dinosaur collections, including the discoveries made during the museum’s expeditions to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia between 1922 and 1930. When Mongolia reopened to Western scientists in 1990, months before the official collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the museum launched the first of many Gobi expeditions in collaboration with the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar. Norell and I served as the expeditions’ co-leaders for more than 30 years.\n\nIn 1993, the team discovered a previously unknown and extremely rich fossil site, Ukhaa Tolgod, where Norell unearthed the first articulated skeleton of a dinosaur embryo preserved inside an egg. The day after that discovery, he found an adult oviraptorid dinosaur that was buried and preserved while crouched over its clutch of some 20 eggs. The eggs were arranged meticulously in a pattern that was consistent with other nests found at the site. Norell’s discovery offered the first evidence of bird-like brooding behaviour in dinosaurs.",

          "abstract": "AI agents can help with literature reviews, handling data sets and writing code.Credit: sanjeri/Getty\n\nMillions of people consult chatbots every day. But artificial intelligence (AI) advocates are betting that ‘AI agents’ are the application of this technology that will affect society the most.\n\nAgentic AI involves using a large language model (LLM) to carry out multi-step tasks, by connecting it to external tools such as Internet browsers or coding suites. The hope is that AI assistants can be created that simplify real-world tasks. In science, some think that AI agents — perhaps even several working together — will not just save time, but also eventually run their own experiments and generate knowledge.\n\nAI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool\n\nBut this dream is not yet a reality. Although access to AI agents is already being sold by technology firms, many such agents are either limited in scope or exist in beta versions that require significant human oversight. Because they are based on LLMs, which are, at heart, statistical prediction machines, they are prone to making mistakes known as hallucinations. In a trial earlier this year by Anthropic in San Francisco, California, to see whether its agent Claudius could run a vending-machine-based shop, the agent conjured up fake bank account details and sold some items at a loss.\n\nNature spoke to researchers developing, evaluating and using AI agents to find out how scientists can make use of the bots and mitigate the risks.\n\nWhat is an AI agent?\n\nResearchers already use automated tools, for example, citation managers that organize and format references, and workflow packages that process and analyse data. But AI agents are different. Rather than follow prescribed instructions for each task, agents use LLMs to make and refine plans on the fly for a variety of multi-step goals. Unlike lone LLMs, they also harness tools to take actions in the real world — for instance, to write and run code or navigate databases — with some interacting with each other and using working memory to remember user preferences and previous actions.\n\nWhat can they do?\n\nStreamlining everyday research tasks is one goal. “In my group, every PhD student now has their own AI agent that effectively serves as a research assistant,” says Marinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. These home-made agents help Zitnik’s team to perform low-stakes tasks, such as curating data sets, turning text into tables and writing certain pieces of code, she says.\n\nWe need a new ethics for a world of AI agents\n\nOne appealing application of agents lies in using them to emulate the collaboration of several researchers with different expertise. An example is the AI ‘tumour board’ being developed by Microsoft. In this case, agents, each with access to different data sets and training, interact to mimic the deliberations of the multidisciplinary team that determines an individual treatment plan for a person with cancer. Because tumour boards are usually formed only for patients with the most complicated cases, using health-care agents to assist clinicians could allow personalized care to be provided for more people, says Ece Kamar, who leads the AI Frontiers laboratory at Microsoft Research, based in Redmond, Washington. (In a statement in May, Microsoft said that its health-care AI models were intended for research use and were not to be deployed in clinical settings “as-is”.)\n\nCan AI agents help to make discoveries?\n\nThis is an idea that excites researchers, but the answer remains unclear. Google and many other firms and academic groups have developed ‘co-scientist’ agents, which generate hypotheses by looking for hidden insights in existing data. The co-scientist uses multiple agents to, for example, evolve and improve ideas, or test them against each other.\n\nZitnik and her colleagues are also exploiting an agent’s ability to access live data and ‘reason’ on the basis of those data, in drug discovery. In unpublished work, they used an AI agent to tap into and analyse data on clinical trials, on adverse effects and in regulatory documents, to look for drugs that have protective effects against diseases they were not prescribed for. They found, for example, that people with diabetes who were given dapagliflozin had a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease later in life than were those who were not prescribed it. The team is also running in silico ‘clinical trials’ using electronic health records to test hypotheses, she says.\n\nWhat kind of expertise do you need?\n\nFor simple uses such as literature reviews, agentic AI already exists as packages that “anybody can use”, says Doug Downey, an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) in Seattle, Washington. Although more advanced systems require machine-learning expertise, some researchers are trying to democratize access. Zitnik and her colleagues are developing ToolUniverse, an open online environment that allows researchers to connect LLMs to commonly used tools in different scientific domains, using only natural language commands. This should “make AI agents more broadly accessible to other fields and scientists who do not write code”, she says.\n\nHow well do agents work?\n\nThe ultimate agent — one that can get anything done autonomously in a reliable way — is “almost an artificial general intelligence problem”, says Kamar. “We are far from having those agents.” But researchers are attempting to benchmark how well agents perform now.\n\nHow AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",

Because they have such a vast internal surface area, MOFs could potentially be used to store gases, act as catalysts and deliver drugs, among many other applications.\n\nWorld’s most porous sponges: intricate carbon-trapping powders hit the market\n\n“This year’s laureates…have found ways to create materials, entirely novel materials, with large cavities on their insides,” said Nobel committee chair Heiner Linke, a nanophysicist at Lund University in Sweden, at a press conference announcing the prize. “A small amount of such material can almost be like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter — it can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume”.\n\nChemists have since created more than 100,000 different types of MOF, and have envisioned many commercial applications. “One could create materials that could separate carbon dioxide from air or from industry exhaust pipes. Or that could be used to separate toxic molecules from wastewater,” said Linke. “We’re already seeing several applications that are popping up in addition to having learned so much from these materials from a basic chemistry perspective,” says Wendy Queen, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.\n\nKitagawa told reporters at the announcement that he pursued this research because of its potential impact on society, but also because of the sheer fun of it. “I’m deeply honoured that my longstanding research has been recognized”, he said.\n\nAt a press conference, Yaghi said that he received the call from Stockholm in an airport while waiting for his luggage. “You cannot prepare for a moment like that,” he said. “I was just surprised and delighted by the news.”\n\nPorous polymers\n\nThe MOF concept was first developed by Robson in the 1980s. Inspired by the structure of diamond crystals — in which each carbon atom binds to four other carbon atoms — he and his collaborator Bernard Hoskins designed a material made of pyramidal-shaped modules, with copper atoms linked by organic molecules1,2.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kitagawa developed MOFs that could be filled with water, and were stable enough to not be disrupted if they were subsequently dried up and filled with gas instead. One of the crucial properties of MOFs is that the materials that fill their gaps do not bind to the frameworks too strongly, which makes it possible then to easily get them back out. “Energetics is quite important for this technology,” Kitagawa said. He also realized that the frameworks could change shapes depending on whether they were filled or not, and in response to ambient changes such as temperature or exposure to light3.\n\nAt around the same time, Yaghi coined the term ‘metal-organic framework’4 and developed linkers made with carboxylate groups, which helped make the structures more stable, even at temperatures up to 300 ˚C. He also was able to create MOFs with a cubic structure5 and ones with much longer linkers, which had the internal surface area of a football field within just a few grams of solid powder.\n\nA MOF can have a surface area of 7,000 square metres per gram, roughly equivalent to 1.3 football fields, in the space between a curled forefinger and thumb. “People immediately saw the opportunities to be able to use these for applications in gas storage and separation,” says Christian Doonan, a chemist at the University of Adelaide in Australia who was a postdoctoral researcher in Yaghi’s group.\n\nYaghi’s work “developed the chemistry so that you could take all the molecules out of the pores of these materials and they would remain permanently porous,” says Doonan. “That's what really piqued the interest of people outside of the narrow field of inorganic chemistry. It got people in all subfields of chemistry interested.”",

The procedure — the first of its kind — could improve access to donor organs, specialists say, because the blood type of the donor would no longer matter.\n\nCurrently, organs from deceased donors can be transplanted into people only if they have a compatible blood type. This is because the recipient’s immune system can produce antibodies to attack and destroy the donated organ if the donor and recipient have different antigens, which come in two types: A and B. Organs that are blood type O do not have A or B antigens, so anyone can receive them.\n\nResearchers from Canada and China used an enzyme to remove type-A antigens from a donor kidney1. The enzyme converts type-A blood into type-O, says study author Stephen Withers, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The type-O kidney was then transplanted into a 68-year-old brain-dead man in Chongqing, China. The organ remained healthy for two days before showing signs of rejection. It produced urine for six days. The results are published in Nature Biomedical Engineering today.\n\nThe enzyme was first identified in 2019 by some members of the same team2. In 2022, they showed that a type-A lung could be converted into a type-O one3, although the organ wasn’t transplanted into a person.\n\nThe results are groundbreaking, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. They could improve access to donor organs and reduce transplant wait lists. If the blood type of the organ was no longer a barrier for transplantation, physicians could focus on things such as matching other antigens unrelated to blood type, which are important in terms of how long a transplant will last, she adds.\n\nWhat’s next?",

          "authors": "Jenna Ahart",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence models are starting to succeed in science. In the past two years, they have demonstrated that they can analyse data, design experiments and even come up with new hypotheses. The pace of progress has some researchers convinced that artificial intelligence (AI) could compete with science’s greatest minds in the next few decades.\n\nChatGPT broke the Turing test — the race is on for new ways to assess AI\n\nIn 2016, Hiroaki Kitano, a biologist and chief executive at Sony AI, challenged researchers to accomplish just that: to develop an AI system so advanced that it could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel prize. Calling it the Nobel Turing Challenge, Kitano presented the endeavour as the grand challenge for AI in science1. A machine wins if it can achieve a discovery on a par with top-level human research.\n\nThat’s not something current models can do. But by 2050, the Nobel Turing Challenge envisions an AI system that, without human intervention, combines the skills of hypothesis generation, experimental planning and data analysis to make a breakthrough worthy of a Nobel prize.\n\nIt might not even take until 2050. Ross King, a chemical-engineering researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an organizer of the challenge, thinks such an ‘AI scientist’ might rise to laureate status even sooner. “I think it’s almost certain that AI systems will get good enough to win Nobel prizes,” he says. “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.”\n\nBut many researchers don’t see how current AI systems, which are trained to generate strings of words and ideas on the basis of humankind’s existing pool of knowledge, could contribute fresh insights. Accomplishing such a feat might demand drastic changes in how researchers develop AI and what AI funding goes towards. “If tomorrow, you saw a government programme invest a billion dollars in fundamental research, I think it would advance much faster,” says Yolanda Gil, an AI researcher at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nOthers warn that there are looming risks to introducing AI into the research pipeline2.\n\nPrize-worthy discoveries\n\nThe Nobel prizes were created to honour those who “have conferred the greatest benefit” to humankind, as its namesake, Alfred Nobel, wrote in his will. For the science prizes, Bengt Nordén, a chemist and former chair of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, considers three criteria: a Nobel discovery must be useful, be rich with impact and open a door to further scientific understanding, he says.\n\nAlthough only living people, organizations and institutions are currently eligible for the prizes, AI has had previous encounters with the Nobel committee. In 2024, the Nobel Prize in Physics went to machine-learning pioneers who laid the groundwork for artificial neural networks. That same year, half of the chemistry prize recognized the researchers behind AlphaFold, an AI system from Google DeepMind in London that predicts the 3D structures of proteins from their amino-acid sequence. But these awards were for the scientific strides behind AI systems — not for ones made by AI.\n\nFor an AI scientist to claim its own discovery, the research would need to be performed “fully or highly autonomously”, according to the Nobel Turing Challenge. The AI scientist would need to oversee the scientific process from beginning to end, deciding on questions to answer, experiments to run and data to analyse, according to Gil.\n\nDemis Hassabis (left) and John Jumper (middle) won a Nobel prize for the AI model AlphaFold.Credit: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty\n\nGil says that she has already seen AI tools assisting scientists in almost every step of the discovery process, which “makes the field very exciting”. Researchers have demonstrated that AI can help to decode the speech of animals, hypothesize on the origins of life in the Universe and predict when spiralling stars might collide. It can forecast lethal dust storms and help to optimize the assembly of future quantum computers.\n\nAI is also beginning to perform experiments by itself. Gabe Gomes, a chemist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues designed a system called Coscientist that relies on large language models (LLMs), the kind behind ChatGPT and similar systems, to plan and execute complex chemical reactions using robotic laboratory equipment3. And an unreleased version of Coscientist can do computational chemistry with remarkable speed, says Gomes.\n\nAI is dreaming up millions of new materials. Are they any good?\n\nOne of Gomes’s students once complained that the software took half an hour to work out a transition state for a reaction. “The problem took me over a year as a graduate student,” he says.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company Sakana AI is using LLMs in an attempt to automate machine-learning research4. At the same time, researchers at Google and elsewhere are exploring how chatbots might work in teams to generate scientific ideas.\n\nMost scientists who are using AI turn to it as an assistant or collaborator of sorts, often appointed to specific tasks. This is the first of three waves of AI in science, says Sam Rodriques, chief executive of FutureHouse — a research lab in San Francisco, California, that debuted an LLM designed to do chemistry tasks earlier this year. It and other ‘reasoning models’ learn to mimic step-wise logical thought, using a trial-and-error process that involves training on correct examples.\n\nThe existing models are helpful collaborators that can make predictions on the basis of data, and accelerate otherwise painstaking sorts of computation. But they tend to need a human in the loop during at least one stage.\n\nSecrets of DeepSeek AI model revealed in landmark paper\n\nNext, says Rodriques, AI will get better at developing and evaluating its own hypotheses by searching through literature and analysing data. James Zou, a biomedical data scientist at Stanford University in California, has begun moving into this realm. He and his colleagues recently showed that a system built on LLMs can scour biological data to find insights that researchers miss5. For instance, when given a published paper and a data set of RNA sequences associated with it, the system found that certain immune cells in individuals with COVID-19 are more likely to swell up as they die, an idea that hadn’t been explored by the paper’s authors. It’s showing “that the AI agent is beginning to autonomously find new things”, Zou says.\n\nHe’s also helping to organize a virtual gathering called Agents4Science later this month, which he describes as the first AI-only scientific conference. All papers will be written and reviewed by AI agents, alongside human collaborators. And the one-day meeting will include invited talks and panel discussions (from humans) on the future of AI-generated research. Zou says he hopes that the meeting will help researchers to assess how capable AI is at doing and reviewing innovative research.\n\nAI helps A-Lab researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to develop materials. Credit: Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley Lab\n\nThere are known challenges to such efforts, including the hallucinations that often plague LLMs, Zou says. But he says these issues could be mostly remedied with human feedback.\n\nRodriques says that the final stage of AI in science, and what FutureHouse is aiming for, is models that can ask their own questions and design and perform their own experiments — no human necessary. He sees this as inevitable, and says that AI could make a discovery worthy of a Nobel “by 2030 at the latest”.\n\nThe most promising areas for a breakthrough — by an AI scientist or otherwise — are in materials science or in treating diseases such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s, he says, because these are areas with big open challenges and an unmet need.\n\nThinking about thinking",

With the Nobel prizes set to be announced next week, how do these prizes compare with one another?\n\nAlthough these newer awards (see ‘Prize money’) are becoming more significant, none matches the Nobels, at least not yet, says biotechnologist Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who has been awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Kyoto Prize and the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience. “In my opinion none are at that level,” he says.\n\nSara Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT and a winner of the 2024 Kavli Prize in Astrophysics, agrees. “The other awards want to catch up,” she says. “But for now, a Nobel prize is just so far ahead of the others. It was the first one and I just don’t think anything competes.”\n\nIt’s an opinion shared by many researchers, demonstrated in the way other awards borrow the Nobel moniker — the A.M. Turing Award, for example, is often referred to as the Nobel prize of computer science. Others, such as the Wolf Prize in Chemistry, are seen as good predictors for the Nobels.\n\nLeft out of the picture\n\nYet, the prizes leave many scientific fields out in the cold, including mathematics, technology and climate science. “For many wonderful discoveries, there is no Nobel prize,” says Seager, giving the example of mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, whose work elucidated chaos theory, otherwise known as the butterfly effect. History also indicates that the scientists with the best chance of winning a Nobel prize are men from Europe or North America.\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n\nOver the years, awards have been created to fill the gaps. Some also offer a lot more money than the Nobel prizes. The Breakthrough prizes, for example, founded in 2012, offer winners in mathematics, fundamental physics and life sciences the largest award of US$3 million, although not without accusations of borrowing the prestige of the Nobels. The million-dollar threshold is also met by the Tang, Shaw, Turing, Kavli and Millennium prizes.\n\nBut no prize is faultless. Researchers tend to work in teams, and yet most prizes, not just the Nobels, single out individuals for plaudits.\n\n“Only a small fraction of the excellence happening in academia is acknowledged with these prizes,” says environmental scientist Zahra Kalantari at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, who is a winner of the Frontiers Planet Prize.\n\nLack of women",

Assessing whether such migration is already occurring can inform our understanding of future responses to climate change. Using data on the paths of all Atlantic basin hurricanes and tropical storms from 1992 to 2017, we study whether outmigration from US counties increases after a storm. On average, storms are not followed by outmigration, and total population-weighted exposure to storms increases over the sample period. Very destructive storms are followed by outmigration, though often to other high-risk counties. Counties with high economic activity see net in-migration after a storm. Given existing policies and incentives, the economic and social benefits of high-risk areas currently appear to outweigh the incentive to reduce exposure to future storms by relocating across counties.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric network models have become increasingly popular in psychology and the social sciences as tools to explore multivariate data. In these models, constructs are represented as networks of observed variables, and researchers often interpret the presence or absence of edges as evidence for or against conditional associations between variables. However, the statistical evidence supporting these edges is rarely evaluated. Here we show that a large proportion of reported network findings is based on weak or inconclusive evidence. We reanalysed 293 networks from 126 published papers using a Bayesian approach that quantifies the evidence for each edge. Across the studies, one-third of edges showed inconclusive evidence (1/3 < inclusion Bayes factor (BF10) < 3), about half showed weak evidence (BF10 > 3 or BF10 < 1/3) and fewer than 20% were strongly supported (BF10 > 10 or BF10 < 1/10). Networks based on relatively large sample sizes yielded more-robust results. Our study shows that networks are often supported by too little evidence from the data for the results to be reported with confidence, not meaning that the results are flawed but, rather, suggesting caution in interpreting individual edges.",

          "abstract": "Efficient algorithms can enhance problem-solving in many cognitive domains but can be difficult to discover and use. For example, classical studies of seriation suggest that children struggle to apply algorithmic strategies in a simple sorting problem. We investigated the spontaneous discovery of algorithmic solutions across development. We gave children a variant of the sorting problem with hidden object ranks: children sort animated bunnies into the right order, from the shortest to the tallest, when the bunnies are standing behind a wall so their heights are not visible. Children performed far above chance on this difficult sorting task, potentially because higher demands in memory and reasoning incentivized strategic behaviours. Children also independently discovered at least two efficient algorithmic solutions to the sorting problem: selection sort and shaker sort. Additionally, our developmental results show that older children were more effective sorters than younger children and used efficient sorting algorithms more frequently. These results indicate that children are far more competent at applying algorithmic solutions to sorting tasks than previous research would suggest, and performance on sorting tasks improves throughout development. Our work demonstrates that children have the ability to spontaneously organize their behaviours and find effective solutions to challenges in the world.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy, Rebecca Sear, Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "abstract": "Air pollution is a major global health threat, with exposure exhibiting substantial heterogeneity across and within regions. While disparities in air pollution exposure by income groups are well documented, how these inequalities translate into differential burdens of pollution-attributable premature mortality remains understudied. We utilize high-resolution estimates of secondary air pollutants, combined with income data, to investigate the relationship between global air pollution–attributable mortality and poverty across urban–rural contexts and air pollutants. We show that high-income countries face higher air pollution–attributable mortality owing to population aging, in contrast to the established exposure inequality pattern. While affluent populations within most countries also face higher mortality burdens, in several low-income countries, this pattern is reversed due to elevated exposures among impoverished rural populations. South Asia and Africa exhibit the highest levels of vulnerability to coincident mortality and poverty, where populations living in periurban transition zones bear disproportionate dual burdens. In many low-income countries, those living near wealthier urban centers also face elevated health burdens from air pollution: a “cost of opportunity” when air pollutant regulations are weak. Our findings emphasize the imperative for tailored policy interventions to mitigate amplified health risks in vulnerable communities.",

          "abstract": "Public trust in democratic institutions has dropped to historic lows, prompting electorates in major democracies to turn to “amateur” politicians with the expectation that these political outsiders will cut through stalemates to deliver policy results. Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, like in other countries, the agrifood supply chain faces challenges from a growing population and less predictable weather conditions. Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5% to 0.7% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination. These findings provide important insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders willing to reduce the food system vulnerability to extreme weather events.",

          "authors": "Pablo J. Ordóñez, Protensia Hadunka, Gemma Del Rossi, Kathy Baylis",
          "abstract": "As climate change makes agricultural production shocks more frequent and severe, it is vital to understand their effect on farmer welfare, land use, and deforestation. Theoretically, a change in agricultural productivity could increase or decrease deforestation by changing demand for agricultural land and/or through the consumption of forests as a coping strategy. This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.",

In a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design study, we examined associations of affirmative action in local governments for a historically marginalized group in India with health and education outcomes, using administrative health data, primary data in schools, and interviews. Exposure was 60 village clusters with, and nonexposure was 60 village clusters without, local leadership reserved for scheduled caste (SC) in 2021 local elections. Primary outcomes were infant mortality rate (IMR) and student test scores. Secondary outcomes were prenatal visits, mother tetanus vaccinations, prenatal supplement, infant vaccination, and teacher engagement in schools. Groups did not differ on socioeconomic, geographic, and service delivery indicators in 2020 (baseline). In 2023, 2.5 y after elections, exposure village clusters had lower IMR (0.46 IRR; [0.30 to 0.69]; P &lt; 0.001), and exposure village clusters had significantly higher odds of two prenatal visits, two tetanus vaccinations, and prenatal supplement received by the second trimester. Exposure was not associated with maternal care in the first trimester or infant vaccination. Exposure was not associated with test scores, but teacher engagement was lower in exposure village clusters. Exposure group leaders reported higher discrimination than nonexposure group, and in follow-up interviews, they described more difficulty in working with teachers. Affirmative action in local governments in India predicted greater infant survival and improved prenatal health services, indicating benefits of addressing structural inequities. Lack of benefits for education outcomes might reflect social inequity of discrimination experienced by SC leaders.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies sensory networks, where different species prioritize different sensory modalities and then use heterospecific information in a likely noncooperative fashion, may allow animals to improve foraging over large areas for cryptic prey. We test this hypothesis in procellariiform seabirds that forage in mixed flocks, where both prey odors and visual cues provided by other foraging hetero- and conspecifics might improve success rates. Using agent-based models, we explored the impact of social strategies on olfactory foraging for Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Our results suggest that social foraging enables species with different sensory adaptations to achieve similar success rates. Additionally, our results indicate that foraging is more successful in mixed-species rather than single-species flocks, where individuals can monitor the activity of other birds that are using different sensory foraging strategies than themselves to find prey. These results suggest that sensory-based foraging networks may be more critical to their survival than previously assumed. Finally, we show that success rates decrease at low population densities. As seabird populations continue to decline, understanding and preserving these social foraging networks may be essential for their conservation and ecological success. Overall, our study provides insights into the critical role of multispecies sensory networks to foraging success, wherein different species have different sensory adaptations for locating prey. While we used empirical anatomical and behavioral data specific to procellariiforms to inform our models, our approach and results may have broader implications for other species as well.",

          "abstract": "Europe is a heatwave hotspot: numerous temperature records have been broken in recent summers, and roughly 60,000 and 50,000 heat-related deaths occurred in the summers of 2022 and 2023, respectively. With recent summers, like that of 2022, projected to become the new norm, there is a pressing need to further develop heat-health warning systems to help society adapt to a warming climate. Here, we forecast heat-related mortality by applying a statistical epidemiological framework to temperature forecasts extending up to 2 wk in advance. Focusing on two recent and exceptional summers in Europe, namely 2022 and 2023, we evaluate the skill of the daily heat-related mortality forecasts, and assess its association with temperature. For most of Europe, milder temperatures, close to the minimum mortality temperature, are associated with more skillful heat-related mortality forecasts. However, some of the hottest regions in Europe instead showed enhanced forecast skill associated with higher temperatures. This suggests that heat-related mortality forecasts can provide valuable information in European regions associated with high levels of heat-related mortality. Consequently, we advocate for local health authorities to include information from forecasts of heat-related mortality in their heat warning systems.",

Noninvasive strategies for monitoring these enzymes could be important for studying basic biology of cholinergic systems and disorders that affect their function. To address this goal, we developed an imaging probe that allows activity of ChE to be detected using MRI. The probe, called ChERT, undergoes enzymatic processing that reduces its solubility, promoting accumulation near sites of cholinesterase activity. Following wide-field brain delivery, ChERT produces MRI contrast changes in brain regions known to be enriched in cholinesterases; these are suppressed in the presence of a selective enzymatic inhibitor, confirming their specificity. After abdominal delivery, ChERT labels regions of the gut where ChE expression is expected. In both the brain and periphery, colocalization of ChERT with ChE could be confirmed and visualized at higher resolution by fluorescence microscopy, owing to optical properties of the probe architecture. The ChERT agent thus provides a potentially versatile basis for assessment of cholinergic phenotypes throughout the body.",

We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.",

          "abstract": "A first-principles machine-learning model has been developed aimed at studying the formation of calcium carbonate from aqueous solution using molecular dynamics simulations. The model, dubbed strongly constrained and appropriately normed-machine learning (SCAN-ML), reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semiempirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the ab initio study of reactive crystallization pathways in biominerals, which are currently poorly understood.",

          "abstract": "Biological tissues exhibit sharp phase transitions where cells collectively transition from disordered to ordered states at critical densities. We demonstrate through bio-chemo-mechanical modeling that this emergent behavior arises from a nonmonotonic dependence on nonlinear extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics: mechanical communication between cells is optimized at intermediate stiffness values where cells can both generate sufficient forces and create strain-stiffened tension bands in the ECM. This balance establishes a critical cell spacing threshold for cell–cell communication ( ∼ 100 to 200 μ m) that is conserved across experimental observations for a broad range of cell types and collagen densities. Our model reveals that the critical stretch ratio at which fibrous networks transition from compliant to strain-stiffening governs this threshold through the formation of tension bands between neighboring cells. These mechanical communication networks drive collective phase transition in tissue condensation when cell density exceeds an effective percolation threshold. Our model explains how microscale cell–ECM interactions control emergent mechanical properties in biological systems and offers insight both into the physics of inhomogeneous materials under active stress, and into potential mechanical interventions for wound healing and fibrotic disorders.",

          "abstract": "Neurons process information by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs along their dendrites. Understanding the computational principles underlying neuronal information processing requires a reliable measure of synaptic conductance dynamics that accurately represents the input sources before signal integration and processing. Prevailing approaches to measuring synaptic conductances typically employ a voltage clamp at the soma of a neuron and assume the neuron as an isopotential point when processing electrical signals. However, owing to the presence of the well-known space clamp effect, the measurement of synaptic conductances through these methods often leads to significant errors, impeding the elucidation of dendritic signal features and subsequent signal integration processes. To address this issue, here we first develop a two-step clamp method at the soma that separately recovers the mean and time constant information of local synaptic conductance on the dendrite with high accuracy when a neuron receives a single synaptic input. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions of multiple synaptic inputs, we propose an intercept method to extract effective net excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from measurements of synaptic currents at the soma. Both methods are grounded in mathematical perturbation analyses of a conductance-based passive cable model and are validated across multiple biologically detailed multicompartment neuron models with active channels, including Purkinje neuron, pyramidal neuron, and fast-spiking interneuron. Results demonstrate that our methods effectively circumvent the space clamp effect, offering reliable means to assess the role of measured conductances and synaptic activity in neuronal information processing.",

          "abstract": "Glycosylation is among the most common molecular modifications in living organisms, one that affects the function of myriad macromolecules: mostly proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides of various kinds but also a few specific noncoding RNAs that undergo glycosylation at an internal site. Here we expand the glycome by showing that protein-coding transcripts can also be glycosylated, but in the form of a 5′-terminal glucose cap. These caps are present on up to 30 to 40% of the 5′ ends of U-initiated mRNAs in Escherichia coli , a remarkably high level of noncanonical capping that requires no transcript or promoter characteristic other than a 5′-terminal U. By contrast, no N -acetylglucosamine caps are evident. Due to their resistance to enzymatic removal, glucose caps can greatly prolong the cellular lifetime of mRNA by impeding its degradation via a 5′-end-dependent mechanism. The prevalence and protective impact of glucose caps set them apart from other bacterial RNA caps. This epitranscriptomic modification has the potential to selectively increase the synthesis of bacterial proteins encoded by U-initiated transcripts, especially after transcription is downregulated.",

          "abstract": "Nitrogen cycles in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have historically been studied in the context of exogenous ammonium/nitrate availability and uptake. Recently, crystalline guanine has been identified, using Raman microscopy, in the cytoplasm of numerous microalgae, including C. reinhardtii . The signal level is influenced by availability of exogenous nitrogen, suggesting that the deposits serve as a nitrogen store. We report the visualization of these guanine crystals in C. reinhardtii and other microalgae using quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy. They prove to reside within cytoplasmic vacuoles: A membrane with a high density of small intramembranous particles surrounds a uniform, coarsely granular interior matrix within which stacks of flat crystals assemble, often in stunning abundance. We designate these as guanine storage vacuoles (GSVs). In C. reinhardtii and other members of the Chlamydomonadales, a discrete disc-shaped granular domain occupies the center of each GSV, and the crystals arise within or at the edges of this domain, suggesting that it represents an amorphous form of guanine. In C. reinhardtii , GSVs are numerous in log-phase cells, are not found in cells maintained in nitrogen-free medium, and reappear within 8 h after the cells are provided with nitrogen, initially as small disc-containing vacuoles. We compare this cycle with that of the polyphosphate granules localized in acidocalcisomes. Nineteen enzyme families and 10 transporters are predicted to participate in guanine-related pathways in C. reinhardtii , many showing strong upregulation with nitrogen starvation. These understandings will inform future studies on the contributions made by GSVs to the metabolism and physiology of eukaryotic microalga.",

We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces collision rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design.

Their numbers are believed to be in decline due to numerous anthropogenic threats; however, their conservation is hindered by numerous knowledge gaps. In particular, the dearth of genetic data, unique among all big cat species, hinders a full understanding of their population structure, historical population size, and current levels of genetic diversity. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing data for 41 snow leopards (37 newly sequenced) to offer insights into these unresolved aspects of snow leopard biology. Among our samples, we find evidence of a primary genetic divide between the northern and southern part of the range around the Dzungarian Basin—as previously identified using landscape models and fecal microsatellite markers—and a secondary divide south of Kyrgyzstan around the Taklamakan Desert. Most noteworthy, we find that snow leopards have the lowest genetic diversity of any big cat species, likely due to a persistently small population size throughout their evolutionary history rather than recent inbreeding. We also find that snow leopards have significantly less highly deleterious homozygous load compared to numerous Panthera species, suggesting effective purging during their evolutionary history at small population sizes. Without a large population size or ample standing genetic variation to help buffer them from any forthcoming anthropogenic challenges, snow leopard persistence may be more tenuous than currently appreciated.",

This finding seems particularly surprising, as Bayesian inference, when written as an effective Q -learning algorithm, is described by unbiased (and temporally decreasing) learning rates. In this article, we explain the reasons behind this observation, by studying the stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using Master equations. In particular, we show that both confirmation bias and unbiased but temporally decreasing learning rates have the same behavioral signature: decreased action switching probabilities, as compared to temporally constant and unbiased learning rates.

Herein, genetically encoded biosensors targeted to the plasma membrane and early endosomes were used to analyze compartmentalized signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2 ); the propensity of nanoparticles (NPs) to accumulate in endosomes was leveraged to preferentially antagonize intracellular PAR 2 signaling of pain. PAR 2 agonists evoked sustained activation of PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 in early endosomes and activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytosol and nucleus, measured with targeted biosensors. Fluorescent dendrimer and core-shell polymeric NPs accumulated in endosomes of HEK293T cells, colonic epithelial cells, and nociceptors, detected by confocal microscopy. NPs efficiently encapsulated and slowly released AZ3451, a negative allosteric PAR 2 modulator. NP-encapsulated AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, rapidly and completely reversed PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 activation in early endosomes and ERK activation in the cytosol and nucleus. When administered into the mouse colon lumen, fluorescent dendrimer NPs accumulated in endosomes of colonocytes and polymeric NPs accumulated in neurons, sites of PAR 2 expression. Both NP formulations of AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, caused long-lasting analgesia and normalized aberrant behavior in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. These results provide evidence that PAR 2 endosomal signaling mediates pain and that nanomedicines that antagonize PAR 2 in endosomes effectively relieve pain.

To date, the relative contribution of each developmental mechanism to the origins of neoteny remain unclear. We examined this question in the plant genus, Acacia Mill., which contains species that undergo the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition (vegetative phase change) early in shoot development, as well as species that remain permanently juvenile, or have delayed vegetative phase change. Mapping the timing of vegetative phase change onto a molecular phylogeny of Acacia revealed that permanent juvenility has evolved multiple times and is sometimes associated with a delay in vegetative phase change in related species. In three cases, the absence or delay in vegetative phase change was associated with either higher amounts or a delayed decline in the level of miR156, the master regulator of vegetative phase change in plants. These findings support the hypothesis that neoteny in Acacia has evolved not by a loss in the capacity to produce the adult leaf phenotype but by a change in the timing of genes that promote juvenile leaf identity.",

          "abstract": "Understanding complex living systems requires identifying universal phenomenological laws that are independent of species and molecular-biological details. The Monod equation is a cornerstone of phenomenological microbial growth laws, depicting the growth rate as a saturating function of a single substrate. Because of its similarity in functional form to the Michaelis–Menten equation, cellular growth is often thought to be limited by a single reaction. However, cellular growth generically results from the coordination of thousands of metabolic reactions and diverse intracellular limited resources. Consequently, the mechanistic origins of the Monod equation remain controversial, and its extension has encountered limitations. Here, we propose the global constraint principle for cellular growth: As one nutrient becomes more available, other intracellular resources become limiting, driving transitions to distinct modes of resource allocation. Based on a general framework of constraint-based modeling and its dual formulations, we mathematically prove that, in general, microbial growth kinetics curves are monotonically increasing and concave with respect to nutrient availability. Numerical simulations using genome-scale Escherichia coli models with proteome allocation, molecular crowding, and membrane capacity constraints reproduce these features in a multiphasic manner. In contrast to the original Monod’s growth law, the global constraint principle also captures the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, by generalizing the Liebig’s law of the minimum, another phenomenological growth law for higher organisms, into a terraced landscape of diminishing returns. It thus integrates the classical phenomenological laws proposed by Monod and Liebig into a comprehensive theory of cellular growth.",

          "abstract": "Lab studies of bacteria usually focus on cells in spatially extended, nutrient-replete settings, such as in liquid cultures and on agar surfaces. By contrast, many biological and environmental settings—ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet—feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner “core” that coexists with a more dilute, highly motile surrounding “shell.” By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use biophysical theory and simulations to quantitatively describe this interplay. Our work thus sheds light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations in confined environments, with implications for understanding ecological niches and engineering artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree-based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized convolutional many-body distribution functionals (cMBDF) as highly compute and data-efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atomic densities weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on predefined grids. In the generalized form, each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo–lumo gaps, heat capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures, and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9, and VQM24 datasets. Due to its compactness, model training and testing times are reduced from 23 h to 8 min, implying a corresponding reduction in carbon footprint.",

          "abstract": "All eukaryotic cells secrete exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicles derived from the endocytic compartments known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs), or late endosomes (LEs). Exosomes contain a diverse range of cargo such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules but whether these contents have a biological function remains an area of intense investigation. Over the last decade, numerous studies have described the transcriptome of exosomes but very little is known about the RNA content of the MVBs, the source compartment for exosome biogenesis. Here, we determine the small-RNA transcriptome of highly purified MVBs and report that various classes of nuclear small regulatory RNAs such as small-Cajal body associated RNAs, small-nucleolar RNAs, and small-nuclear RNAs traffic to MVBs. We show that this RNA-trafficking requires the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery but is independent of canonical LC3 lipidation mediated selective autophagy. Furthermore, blocking the activity of a PI3K Class 3 enzyme, VPS34, required for recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the endosome, prevents the turnover of these nuclear RNAs in MVBs. Our results provide a mechanism for targeting nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, such as Cajal bodies, for degradation and turnover by the cytoplasmic endo-lysosomal pathway.",

          "abstract": "Chimeric RNA formation represents a critical mechanism for expanding protein functional diversity, yet its role in invertebrate immune adaptation remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that two C-type lectin genes ( MnLec2 and MnLec3 ) from distinct genomic loci in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense undergo positionally flexible chimeric RNA formation via alternative trans-splicing and transcriptional slippage, generating 11 structurally diverse chimeric isoforms ( MnLec1 , MnLec4–13 ) with bidirectional exon joining. Crucially, pathogen challenges reprogram chimeric RNA frequencies to shift immune equilibrium, universally suppressing detrimental MnLec9 while promoting protective MnLec7 formation. Functional dissection confirms dual-action pathogen suppression, recombinant MnLec7 (rMnLec7) suppresses white spot syndrome virus replication by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and RNAi effectors, while accelerating Vibrio parahaemolyticus clearance and improving survival. Conversely, suppression of MnLec9 removes its immunosuppressive activity, synergistically enhancing host defense. This coordinated isoform rebalancing enables effective pathogen clearance. Thus, positional flexibility in chimeric RNA formation generates antagonistic isoforms that maintain immune homeostasis and deploy targeted defense upon infection, revealing an adaptive transcriptional strategy in arthropods.",

During that journey, the protein may visit shallow basins corresponding to metastable structures, potentially of biological importance. Structural characterization of transiently populated metastable states is challenging due to their low population, which limits traditional NMR, and also makes crystallization for X-ray diffraction difficult without stabilizing mutations, covalent modifications, or the addition of antibodies. Here, we report the structural characterization of the on-pathway folding intermediate of a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin mutant. The obtained non-native β-sheet registry was previously shown to be necessary in the PINK1 mitophagy pathway. We used fast pressure jumps to repeatedly initiate folding and advanced NMR measurements to probe the evolving ensemble of protein conformations. The results reported here demonstrate that the non-native β-sheet hydrogen bond registry can act as a metastable trap during protein folding. This work provides a template for future investigation of metastable conformations and protein folding with rich structural detail.",

          "abstract": "Activating the adra2a receptors of the brain’s norepinephrine (NE) system produces NREM-like sleep and hypothermia. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2 receptor ( adra2a ) agonist, is an important drug used in intensive care for arousable sedation. But for some patients, even slight decreases in body temperature during sedation could pose health risks such as increasing the likelihood of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Where are the adra2a receptors at which DEX acts to induce hypothermia? A popular theory is that inhibitory adra2a receptors expressed on norepinephrinergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are DEX’s prime targets. To examine this, we genetically lesioned galanin ( gal )-expressing norepinephrinergic LC neurons in adult mice. In these ΔLC mice, baseline sleep–wake levels were unchanged, but surprisingly, core body temperatures were lower. Maintaining body temperature depended on NE/ gal projections from the LC to the medial preoptic (MPO) hypothalamus. Furthermore, without these LC neurons, DEX induced hypothermia more strongly. Knockdown with adra2a shRNA revealed that DEX induces hypothermia via adra2a receptors on MPO glutamate cells. When ΔLC mice were kept warm, DEX could induce the same amount of NREM-like sleep as well as it did for mice with an intact LC, and this sleep-like state in ΔLC mice had a higher delta frequency power than in control mice. Our results emphasize that inhibition of the LC by DEX is not required to induce robust sedation. By contrast, the LC likely has a fortuitous background action in protecting against drug-induced hypothermia and speeds recovery from hypothermia.",

          "abstract": "Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are crucial for animal reproductive success, with Sfp-encoding genes believed to be evolutionarily young due to heightened rates of gene loss and gain and rapidly evolving at the sequence level relative to other genes. Using estimates of the phylogenetic origin of each Drosophila melanogaster Sfp gene, based on genomic resources that include outgroup species to the Drosophila genus, we examined the functional attributes and evolutionary characteristics of 357 Sfp genes relative to their evolutionary age. Contrary to the perception that many Sfp genes are evolutionarily young, 62% existed in the genome of the ancestor to this genus. These ancient genes have broader expression profiles, more expansive biological roles, and have more interactions with non-Sfp genes. This increased pleiotropy has imposed constraints on the rate of sequence evolution in ancient Sfp genes compared to younger ones. Notably, these younger Sfp genes evolve substantially faster as a result of both adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Within the Sfp interactome, we identified a fast-evolving core subnetwork of younger genes with more restricted tissue expression and functions. Our systematic approach has uncovered a large set of ancient Sfp genes with distinct genomic, functional, and evolutionary characteristics compared to the younger, more commonly studied Sfp genes. With increased refined genomic and functional data acquisition across a wider variety of taxa, our approach and results serve as proof of the importance of systemic strategies applied to broadly defined gene sets based on their time of evolutionary origination.",

Murine (Mm)Mx1 induced an abnormal nuclear accumulation of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) at late time points postinfection. This block was observed to a lower extent with human (Hs)MX1; however, HsMX1 strongly impacted cytoplasmic trafficking of de novo synthesized viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Indeed, live imaging experiments revealed a transient association of HsMX1 with Rab11a-associated vRNPs, which induced their clustering and their dynein-dependent retrograde transport toward the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). There, vRNPs remained sequestrated together with cellular cofactors YBX1 and Rab11a in large clusters, while MX1 dissociated from them. Dynein inhibition prevented the vRNP clustering and sequestration and significantly rescued infectious IAV production in the presence of HsMX1. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of IAV vRNPs being rerouted and accumulated away from the plasma membrane through the coordinated action of HsMX1 restriction factor, dynein, and the microtubule network.",

          "abstract": "How sleep maintains our healthy brain function has remained one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience, medical settings, and daily lives. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during sleep has been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the healthy human brain during deep sleep remains elusive. A myriad of research has shown that crucial cognitive processing manifests in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting that a key to maintaining brain functions lies in deep sleep. By leveraging a simultaneous sparse-functional MRI and polysomnography method, we demonstrate that deep sleep–specific CSF dynamics are associated with spontaneous brain oscillations in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep are tightly linked to short-cycle, frequent, and moderate CSF fluctuations. In contrast, slow waves during light sleep and arousals produce slow, infrequent, and steep CSF signal changes. Rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during REM sleep are also linked to CSF signal changes. Furthermore, CSF signals are significantly faster in frequency during deep than light sleep. These brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruit essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep involving memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of facilitating CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here, we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting null signal template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius 1.5 R ⊕ , a period of 384 d, and KOI 2194.03 with radius 1.8 R ⊕ and a period of 445 d, both around Sun-like G stars.

While the formation of ampullate and eggcase silks has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanism underlying the self-assembly of the aciniform spidroin, AcSp1, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered linkers of AcSp1 play a critical role in driving spidroin assembly through liquid–liquid phase separation in solution. The N-terminal domain (NTD) exhibits pH-independent dimerization over a physiological pH range (5.0 to 7.0) and undergoes concentration-dependent tetramerization. Quaternary structure of AcSp1-NTD shows a hierarchical assembly process mediated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which enhances phase separation in both salt-free and salt-containing solutions. Finally, inspired by this mechanistic insight, we developed a fully aqueous spinning method to fabricate artificial aciniform fibers with excellent extensibility and toughness. These findings uncover a pivotal molecular strategy that transforms our understanding of diverse molecular mechanisms governing spidroin assembly and establish a foundation for designing and manufacturing elastic and tough silk-based biomaterials.",

Microbial habitat and decomposition functions were among the last to respond to aridity, with thresholds occurring under more arid conditions compared to plant productivity and soil fertility. Combining metagenomic sequencing with physiological assays to characterize microbial life history strategies of high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A), and stress tolerance (S), we introduce a microbial trait-based framework to mechanistically link community-level microbial life history strategies to EMF. Our results reveal that microbial Y-strategy is positively correlated with EMF across aridity gradients, A-strategy exhibits a negative association with EMF across aridity gradients, and S-strategy is negatively correlated with EMF in arid ecosystems.

It then covers widely used generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models, and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before and that generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry.

It greatly contributes to natural carbon sinks by enhancing atmospheric CO 2 sequestration/mineralization in mineral ion-rich aqueous systems, which is demonstrated by freezing the solutions of Ca(OH) 2 , binary NaCl–CaCl 2 solutions, and artificial seawater. The acceleration is caused by the impacts of freezing on nucleation and growth processes of CaCO 3 crystals. Freezing accelerates nucleation by concentrating reactants within ice crystal boundaries, increasing supersaturation, and thus lowering the nucleation energy barrier. At the post–thaw stage where nuclei already form and reactant concentration is decreased, the crystals undergo the barrier-free growth process.

          "abstract": "When bacteria form a biofilm, complex behaviors emerge. Biofilm bacteria differ from their free-living counterparts, exhibiting heterogenous, spatiotemporally patterned behavior. Can we explain these patterns by defining the rules that govern single-cell behavior in biofilms? By understanding these rules, can we explain emergent functions at the biofilm scale? Here we reveal how the architecture of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix is controlled by single-cell lysis during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development. We extend single-cell imaging methods to capture complete biofilm development over 5+ d, characterizing the stages of biofilm development and visualizing eDNA matrix morphogenesis from start to finish. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of single-cell lysis events shows that cell lysis is spatiotemporally patterned, concentrated in a region 5 µm below the biofilm surface that moves with the biofilm as it grows. Using analytical modeling, we examined the consequences of patterning at the biofilm scale. Cell lysis patterning defines eDNA in the matrix: Patterned lysis is sufficient to explain the final eDNA distribution. Cell lysis and biofilm growth are coupled such that the amount of eDNA in the biofilm scales with its volume; this patterning results in a predominantly uniform eDNA matrix architecture, which could not occur without patterning. Finally, we find that patterning of cell lysis is self-organized by nutrient gradients, with maximal lysis occurring in regions where oxygen is present and carbon is limited. The ability of cells to use self-generated nutrient gradients as positioning cues to establish depth-based patterning is a striking feature of bacterial biofilm development.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the computational principles of the brain and translating them into neuromorphic hardware and modern deep learning architectures is critical for advancing neuro-inspired AI (NeuroAI). Here, we develop an experimentally constrained, biophysically realistic model of neocortical microcircuits in the mouse primary visual cortex (layers 2 to 3) to examine how four major interneuron classes—Parvalbumin, Somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and LAMP5—interact within a competitive–cooperative motif to implement soft winner-take-all (sWTA) circuit dynamics. In a conductance-based network grounded in in vitro physiology, we show that this circuit motif selectively amplifies strong inputs while suppressing, without silencing, weaker ones, enabling gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a gain-matching strategy, we mapped the motif onto IBM’s TrueNorth neuromorphic chip, revealing a principled correspondence between cell-type-specific roles and hardware primitives. Sparse coupling of sWTA modules generated persistent up-states and a two-state neural machine approximating working memory. We then embedded the sWTA circuit as a preprocessing filter in a Vision Transformer, which significantly enhanced out-of-distribution generalization across diverse tasks, including zero-shot digit classification, cross-domain transfer between digit datasets, and nighttime semantic segmentation. The sWTA filter boosted accuracy on unseen data by up to ~20% and reduced training compute by directing learning toward salient features, without additional data or architectural changes. By unifying biophysically grounded circuit models, neuromorphic implementation, and state-of-the-art AI architectures, this work outlines a generalizable roadmap for embedding cortical computation into next-generation NeuroAI systems that combine biological principles with practical AI performance gains.",

Here, we characterize BteO–BtiO, a unique effector–immunity pair in Bacteroides fragilis that mediates antagonism via a nonenzymatic mechanism. Microscopy reveals that BteO exposure leads to cell elongation, membrane blebbing, and lysis in sensitive strains. Structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that BteO disrupts cell wall homeostasis by binding to conserved C-terminal domains of OmpA-family proteins (OmpAs), which are critical for outer membrane integrity. The immunity protein BtiO neutralizes BteO by mimicking the OmpA-binding interface. We further show that bile salts enhance BteO-mediated killing in vitro and that BteO confers a competitive advantage in the mammalian gut. Remarkably, BteO exhibits broad-spectrum activity across Bacteroides species. These findings reveal a nonenzymatic strategy of bacterial antagonism and broaden our understanding of T6SS effector diversity within Bacteroides .",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen (H 2 ) is a promising energy carrier for decarbonization. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of the H 2 supply and its adoption across various demand sectors in the US remains unclear. Here, we couple prospective life cycle assessment with a process-based integrated assessment model to evaluate the GHG mitigation of H 2 from supply and demand perspectives. Our results show the critical role of H 2 production mix in determining supply-side GHG mitigation potential. Without national carbon pricing or large-scale electrolysis in the near future, biomass-based H 2 (Bio-H 2 ) emerges as a critical transitional clean H 2 production technology. Bio-H 2 reduces the life cycle GHG emission intensity of the H 2 supply mix by 1.8 to 5.5 kg CO 2 kg −1 H 2 , resulting in a national reduction of 606 to 1,706 Mt CO 2 e from 2025 to 2050. This represents 1.6 to 2 times greater mitigation potential compared to scenarios without Bio-H 2 . On the demand side, we identify a misalignment: industrial sectors with high mitigation intensity (e.g., iron and steel, 147 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ) receive limited H 2 deployment (0.8 EJ), while the transportation sector accounts for 75% of H 2 use (e.g., passenger and light-duty vehicles, 10 EJ) despite their lower mitigation intensities (54 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ). While economy-wide climate policies (e.g., carbon prices) could direct more industrial H 2 usages, implementing these policies is challenging; sector-specific strategies can be more practical. Our results highlight the importance of near-term support for Bio-H 2 and sector-specific demand strategies to enhance the climate effectiveness of US H 2 deployment.",

          "abstract": "Autophagy is a crucial intracellular pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It involves forming double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which deliver cytosolic cargoes to the lysosomes/vacuoles for degradation. Biogenesis of autophagosomes is a membrane-intensive process wherein the membrane expansion steps are poorly understood. The tethering complex, exocyst, canonically implicated in secretion, also participates in autophagosome biogenesis in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the contribution of the exocyst complex in autophagosome biogenesis is unclear. In this study, using yeast temperature-sensitive mutants of the exocyst, we observed the accumulation of multiple abortive PAS incapable of autophagosome biogenesis. These dysfunctional abortive structures were enriched with core autophagy proteins involved in initiation and membrane expansion. However, the membrane expansion ability required for cargo capture was severely compromised in these mutants. Further investigations, including a comprehensive epistasis analysis, revealed that the exocyst plays a role downstream of the Atg1 complex. However, it was required at a stage before phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K complex I), Atg2–Atg18, and Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complexes. Taken together, we show that productive PAS formation and membrane expansion during autophagosome biogenesis are exquisitely orchestrated by the autophagy-specific exocyst subcomplex, which excludes Exo70.",

          "abstract": "Photosynthetic organisms rely on sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage under high or fluctuating solar illumination. Cyanobacteria, which have evolved a unique, water-soluble light-harvesting complex—the phycobilisome—achieve photoprotection through a photoactivatable quencher called the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Phycobilisomes are highly symmetric and modular, formed by hierarchical assembly of conserved subunits into diverse geometries ranging from simple bundles to elaborate fan- or bouquet-like macromolecular architectures. Although OCP is known to provide photoprotection across species of cyanobacteria with different phycobilisome structures, it is not known whether or how these structural variations relate to changes in the photoprotective function of OCP. For example, OCP was recently discovered to bind as a dimer at two specific instances of an abundant structural motif on the tricylindrical phycobilisome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, yet these sites are sterically inaccessible on a more common pentacylindrical phycobilisome ( Anabaena sp. PCC 7120). To understand how structural modularity and binding specificity contribute to conservation of OCP binding sites and function across different phycobilisome architectures, here we compare experimentally measured photophysical states accessible to these prototypical tricylindrical and pentacylindrical phycobilisomes, with and without OCP, at the single-molecule level. Together with Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transfer in OCP-quenched phycobilisomes, our results suggest that OCP binds at distinct and specific sites in each type of phycobilisome, yet provides nearly identical quenching strength to both phycobilisomes. Our findings highlight the utility of modular phycobilisome structures in balancing robust conservation of photoprotective function with adaptability of site-specific binding across species.",

          "abstract": "The early olfactory system is canonically described by a “one-receptor-to-one-neuron” model: each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single type of olfactory receptor (OR). Although the olfactory systems of many model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, a number of exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes coexpress multiple types of ORs in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and noncanonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Noncanonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor coexpression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.",

          "abstract": "During origin licensing, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two Mcm2-7 helicases onto DNA in a head-to-head conformation, establishing the foundation for subsequent bidirectional replication. Single-molecule experiments support a helicase-loading model in which one ORC loads both Mcm2-7 helicases at origins. For this to occur, ORC must release from its initial Mcm2-7 and DNA binding sites, flip over the helicase, and bind the opposite end of the Mcm2-7 complex and adjacent DNA to form the MO complex. Importantly, this binding-site transition occurs without ORC releasing into solution. Using a single-molecule FRET assay, we show that the N-terminal half of Orc6 tethers ORC to the N-terminal region of Mcm2 during ORC’s binding-site transition. This interaction involves both the folded Orc6 N-terminal domain (Orc6N) and the adjacent unstructured linker and forms before ORC releases from its initial Mcm2-7 interaction. The absence of this interaction increases the rate of ORC release into solution, consistent with a tethering function. CDK phosphorylation of ORC inhibits the tethering interaction, providing a mechanism for the known CDK inhibition of MO complex formation. Interestingly, we identify mutations in the Orc6 linker region that support MO complex formation but prevent double-hexamer formation by inhibiting stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Our study provides a molecular explanation for a one-ORC mechanism of helicase loading and demonstrates that Orc6 is involved in multiple stages of origin licensing.",

          "abstract": "Like many viruses, HIV relies on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton for successful infection. MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT functions and thus bear the potential to modulate viral infection. However, while several MAPs are known to exert proviral effects on HIV, little is known about antiviral ones. We previously described the Tripartite motif protein 69 (Trim69) as an innate immune factor that remodels MTs, leading to inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV. Through in silico modeling, TIRF microscopy, and cell-based assays, we determine that Trim69 binding to MTs is determined by a basic surface in its SPRY domain that interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulins. This surface is conserved among mammalian Trim69s and is critical for its functions. We demonstrate that by binding and remodeling MTs, Trim69 inhibits the docking and the migration of virion cores on MTs by promoting the stalling of the dynein/dynactin motor complexes. Altogether, these findings shed light on a mechanism of viral defense that involves an innate immune regulation of the MT cytoskeleton.",

          "abstract": "Development requires the coordinated action of many genes across space and time, yet numerous species can develop discrete, alternate phenotypes. Such complex balanced polymorphisms are often controlled by supergenes: multiple tightly linked loci that function together to control development of a complex phenotype. Supergenes are widespread in nature. However, the evolution and functions of supergene alleles remain obscure because the identities of the functional loci, and the causative variation between them, remain essentially unknown. The doublesex supergene controls mimicry polymorphism in the swallowtail butterflies Papilio polytes and Papilio alphenor. Alternate alleles cause development of discrete mimetic or nonmimetic wing patterns. We found that the mimetic allele evolved by gaining six new cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and an inversion that locked those CREs together with dsx and the novel noncoding gene U3X . At least four of these new CREs are essential for dsx expression and mimetic pattern development. Genome-wide assays of DSX binding suggest that dsx controls mimetic pattern development by directly regulating the expression of both itself and a handful of unlinked genes. The dsx supergene thus contains multiple functional genetic elements, each required for the phenotype switch and linked together by an inversion, and likely exerts its effects on color pattern development through direct regulation of unlinked “modifier” genes. Our results therefore support classic theories of supergene evolution, but update those ideas to match what we have learned about gene regulation since their development over a half century ago.",

While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information—providing a better description of the population—than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.",

In the rodent brain, the prefrontal cortex is limited to this earlier agranular stage and is often referred to as the “medial prefrontal cortex.” The primate mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical for the monitoring of information in working memory, including the monitoring of the precise serial order of flexible randomly varying sequences of stimuli. Thus, a fundamental question arises: what are the functional limits of serial order processing in the rodent brain which, anatomically, possesses only the earlier stage in the evolution of the prefrontal cortex? The present study examined the ability of normal rats to monitor the serial order of sequences of spatial stimuli (locations). The normal rodent brain can code accurately the order of directional left-to-right or right-to-left sequences of locations. However, the serial order of nondirectional randomly varying sequences can be processed only to a limited extent: when performance relies considerably on the salient memory of the most recent stimulus to code an approximate order of the earlier stimuli within working memory. Thus, the development of the granular prefrontal cortex in the primate brain provides an additional higher level of executive control permitting precise coding of the order of stimuli in working memory that is essential to manipulate information to plan action.",

Hotspot mutations in SF3B1 induce widespread transcriptomic alterations and occur across multiple cancer types. Despite this, the biological and clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutations remain elusive. Characterization of the largest SF3B1 mutant breast cancer clinical cohort to date identifies SF3B1 driver mutations in approximately 2.5% of HR+ HER2- breast cancer, with strong enrichment of K700E substitutions, substantial variation in variant allele fraction (VAF), and significantly improved overall survival due to enrichment in Luminal A disease. In vitro and in vivo studies in representative cell models suggest several of the most prevalent SF3B1 mutations have deleterious effects on cell growth, leading to selective loss of the mutation over time, providing a rationale for the low frequency and low VAF of SF3B1 mutations in breast cancer. Though all introduced hotspot mutations limit growth and are reverted to wildtype (WT) over time, mutations at position R625 have a more pronounced phenotype than K700E, providing an explanation for the clinically observed skew in mutation frequencies. RNA and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify characteristic pathway-level transcriptomic changes in SF3B1 -mutant cells and identify copy number alterations as a mechanism of both improved mutation tolerability and a means to eliminate the mutation over time. These data suggest that while SF3B1 mutations are enriched in some clinical contexts, their role in breast tumorigenesis is highly complex and dependent on secondary events that overcome their deleterious effects on cell growth and survival.",

Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain protein 10 (EFCAB10) and adenylate kinase (AK8) as radial spoke proteins and describe their roles in mouse motile cilia. Using Efcab10 −/− and Ak8 −/− mice, we show that loss of either protein can affect ciliary motility and lead to PCD-related phenotypes in mice. Interestingly, ciliary AK8 is completely absent in Efcab10 −/− cilia, but the loss of AK8 has no effect on ciliary EFCAB10. Further biochemical analyses reveal that EFCAB10 interacts with AK8 and RSPH3B, which fastens AK8 to the radial spoke.

The destruction of tumor collagen is significant because collagen both suppresses T cells and contributes to the formation of the extracellular matrix. Our previously reported cell-surface vimentin (CSV)–targeted and membrane-anchored interleukin 12-armed (attIL12) T cells can reduce collagen production by killing cancer-associated fibroblasts, but fail to reduce collagen expression by tumor cells, resulting in resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment. In this study, we found that CCKAR directly boosts collagen production by tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. attIL12-modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) disabled collagen production by CCKAR-high autologous tumor cells in vitro and sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in vivo. This disruption of collagen production by tumor cells by attIL12-TILs overcomes resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment and required a simultaneous interaction between the CSV on autologous tumor cells, which is targeted by attIL12, and human leukocyte antigen-T cell receptor on attIL12-TILs; When either interaction was abrogated, collagen production and CCKAR expression were not shut down. Mechanistically, the interaction between attIL12-TILs and autologous tumor cells induced interferon gamma production synergistically, which in combination with CCKAR downregulation reduced collagen expression through suppression of both transforminggrowth factor beta-stimulated SMAD activation and CCKAR-AKT signaling. Diminishing collagen expression from tumor cells significantly increased T cell infiltration and improved tumor growth inhibition in PDX sarcomas. Thus, this attIL12-TIL therapy holds great clinical potential for boosting T cell infiltration in high-grade, collagen-rich tumors.",

          "abstract": "Oceanic islands are hotspots of both species extinctions and introductions, which led to marked changes in species composition. This may disrupt key ecological interactions, such as animal-mediated seed dispersal, with potential long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. While some recent studies on individual taxa and islands report functional shifts, there has been no globally comprehensive study of how these changes vary in intensity and direction across islands. Importantly, it remains unclear how changes in traits of animal communities actually translate to ecologically relevant mismatches with native plant species. We report widespread functional remodeling of frugivore communities based on frugivory-specific traits of all native, extinct, and introduced vertebrate frugivores (birds, mammals, reptiles) from 120 islands in 22 archipelagos. There is a trend for taxonomic and functional substitution, mainly of nonvolant terrestrial mammalian omnivores replacing large-gaped flying frugivores, which caused a mismatch between gape size and seed size. This shift in seed dispersal potential risks underestimation in single-taxon studies. Overall, vertebrate introductions outnumbered extinctions both in terms of species (44 vs. 23%) and islands affected (92 vs. 76%). Moreover, introductions have driven stronger shifts in frugivore trait space compared to extinctions. However, the general patterns are modulated by substantial spatial variation and idiosyncratic functional shifts within frugivore communities on some islands. This, coupled with differences in plant seed size distributions, leads to variability in realized functional mismatches among islands. These results emphasize challenges with predicting functional responses to anthropogenic activities, while highlighting that remodeling of ecosystem interactions is a global concern.",

          "abstract": "Self-organization of individual organisms at a very small scale may result in recognizable functional ecosystem structures at a larger spatial scale. Drylands, which cover almost half of emerged lands, host some of the most remarkable vegetation patterns on Earth, including “disordered hyperuniformity,” a recently defined class of such emergent self-organization structures. Yet, the extent, causes, and consequences of disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns in drylands remain virtually unknown. Here, we analyzed high-resolution remote sensing images of 425 spot-like drylands across the globe and found that disordered hyperuniformity shapes vegetation patterns in about one out of ten drylands, with the distribution of plants appearing to be “disordered” to the naked eye, but supporting highly recognizable (uniform) patterns at larger scales ( ca. 50 to 500 m). Using mathematical models, we identify three potential mechanisms that can generate disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns. These mechanisms are not limited to the well-studied Turing patterns and represent key general processes with respect to plant–plant or plant–sediment interactions. Further modeling indicates that disordered hyperuniformity enhances ecosystem functioning in terms of water retention use, and expands the range of aridity conditions under which the system can maintain itself, but may slow recovery of vegetation structure from disturbances. In a wider context, we also show that disordered hyperuniformity is likely to pertain to diverse dryland systems, such as termite-mound or fairy-circle landscapes. Our findings highlight that exploring disordered hyperuniformity of vegetation pattern of drylands (and potentially other large-scale systems) offers insights into the organization and resilience of ecosystems globally.",

          "abstract": "The retina, located outside the cranium, serves as an ideal structure for investigating information processing within the central nervous system due to its well-organized neurovascular unit comprising diverse cell types, including neurons, glial cells (such as microglia, Müller glia, and astrocytes), pericytes, and vascular endothelial cells. Disrupted retinal homeostasis contributes to various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. However, noninvasive in vivo imaging methods to study the pathogenesis of these disorders remain limited. Here, we developed a two-photon microscopy technique for real-time, transpupillary in vivo visualization of the retinal neurovascular unit in mice. Our approach integrates systematic head fixation, a custom-made polymethyl methacrylate contact lens, and a glycerin immersion objective lens with an extended working distance and a higher numerical aperture, specifically designed for two-photon microscopy. This method enabled us to visualize dynamic microglial process activity around retinal blood vessels. Our results revealed that retinal microglia exhibit enhanced surveillance under diabetic conditions, which is undetectable by static confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist commonly used for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, reversed the enhanced microglial behaviors in the diabetic retina. Our simple yet effective approach mitigates the need for advanced optical systems like adaptive optics, providing an effective tool for real-time imaging of the retina. This method offers a valuable resource for visual neuroscience research and holds great potential for clinical applications, particularly in the early diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of retinal diseases.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates mediate diverse and essential cellular functions by compartmentalizing biochemical pathways. Many condensates have internal subdomains with distinct compositional identities. A major challenge lies in dissecting the multicomponent logic that relates biomolecular features to emergent condensate organization. Nuclear paraspeckles are paradigmatic examples of multidomain condensates, comprising core and shell layers with distinct compositions that are scaffolded by the lncRNA NEAT1, which spans both layers. A prevailing model of paraspeckle assembly proposes that core proteins bind directly and specifically to core-associated NEAT1 domains. Combining informatics and biochemistry, we unexpectedly find that the essential core proteins FUS and NONO bind and condense preferentially with shell-associated NEAT1 domains. The shell protein TDP-43 exhibits similar NEAT1 domain preferences on its own but forms surfactant-like shell layers around core protein-driven condensates when both are present. Together, experiments and physics-based simulations suggest that competitive RNA binding and immiscibility between core and shell proteins order paraspeckle layers. More generally, we propose that subcondensate organization can spontaneously arise from a balance of collaborative and competitive protein binding to the same domains of a lncRNA.",

However, the intracellular signaling networks that temporally coordinate these inputs to reinforce Th1 lineage commitment remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify protein kinase A (PKA) as a time-gated regulator of IL-12 responsiveness and Th1 differentiation. Using a conditional knockout mouse model that deletes both catalytic PKA subunits in CD4 + T cells, we show that PKA is dispensable for early T cell activation but is essential for the late-phase induction of IL-12 receptor β2 ( Il12rb2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT4). PKA-deficient CD4 + T cells fail to differentiate into Th1 cells in vitro and cannot induce Th1-mediated colitis in vivo. Instead, they adopt a Th2-skewed phenotype and drive eosinophilic lung inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, prolonged TCR stimulation induces the expression of the peptide hormone Adrenomedullin and its receptor component Ramp3, which activate PKA and its downstream effector cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Activated CREB drives Il12rb2 and Stat4 transcription, establishing a feedforward circuit that integrates signal duration with cytokine responsiveness. In the absence of PKA, this transcriptional program fails to initiate, leading to impaired IL-12 signaling and a loss of Th1 identity. These findings define a PKA–CREB signaling module that links sustained antigen stimulation to transcriptional and epigenetic commitment in CD4 + T cells, offering a mechanistic explanation for the temporal gating of Th1 differentiation and the prevention of Th2-driven tissue pathology.",

A recent two-state model proposed for high-pressure potassium, which exhibits a similar melting anomaly, attributes this behavior to changes in the distribution of non-nuclear localized electrons (electrides), resulting in distinct liquid phases. To test this hypothesis for sodium, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine its atomic dynamics and electronic properties under high pressure. Our results reveal no discontinuities in atomic or electronic transport properties, nor any evidence of multiple inherent structural forms. Furthermore, the electronic screening potential governing liquid structure remains largely unchanged above 50 GPa. Instead, we find that the key parameter responsible for the melting anomaly arises from differences in the average number of electrons per non-nuclear maximum, which affects the relative packing densities of the liquid and solid phases.",

Goblet cell activity significantly influences mucosal infection outcomes; increased mucus secretion effectively blocks viral entry, while its reduction facilitates viral dissemination. Notably, PEDV activates acetylcholine-cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 signaling in submucosal enteric neurons to induce goblet cell-associated antigen passages. This mechanism enables the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the lamina propria in early infection, even when the epithelial barrier remains intact, triggering inflammation and exacerbating mucosal damage.

The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. These observations provide direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition occurring in real quantum systems, a finding long anticipated by theoretical physicists.",

Equivariant neural nets leverage ideas from group representation theory and express all variables in the generalized Fourier space corresponding to the underlying group. In this article, we review this formalism and derive the general form of operations allowable in equivariant neural networks.

Monitoring real-time soil conditions and tree physiological responses, we observed consistent impacts on soil biogeochemistry aligned with belowground drivers of tree mortality, but no consistent responses in aboveground vegetation immediately following flooding.

Methanogenesis inhibitors such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) decrease methane emissions in ruminants when supplemented in feed. Yet we lack a system-wide, species-resolved understanding of how the rumen microbiota remodels following inhibition and how this influences animal production. Here, we conducted a large-scale trial with 51 dairy calves to analyze microbiota responses to 3-NOP, pairing host performance, emissions, and nutritional profiles with genome-resolved metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. 3-NOP supplementation decreased methane emissions by 62%, modulated short-chain fatty acid and H 2 levels, and did not affect dietary intake or animal performance. We created a rumen microbial genome catalogue (27,884 genomes) that mapped to the meta-omic data at high rates. There was a strong reduction of methanogens and stimulation of reductive acetogens, primarily uncultivated lineages such as “ Candidatus Faecousia.” However, there was a shift in major fermentative communities away from acetate production in response to hydrogen gas accumulation. In vitro incubations recapitulated these results and showed an enrichment of acetate from reductive acetogenesis. Altogether, the divergent responses of the fermentative and hydrogenotrophic communities lead to net hydrogen build-up and limit potential productivity gains from methane reduction. By linking ruminant greenhouse gas emissions and productivity to specific microbial species, this study emphasizes the importance of microbiota-wide analysis for optimizing methane mitigation strategies and identifies promising strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions while increasing animal production.",

The classical generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system’s linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system’s score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system’s characteristics: i) a clustering-based algorithm (K-means Gaussian Mixture Modeling) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier–Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system’s response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.",

RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5 -RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5 -RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5 -expressing transgenic rice plants. Nl ANX5 targets rice annexin ( Os ANN) proteins, including Os ANN2 and Os ANN8. Further analysis with Nl ANX5 and Os ANN2 as well as Os ANN8 showed that Nl ANX5 displaces Os ANN2 and Os ANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 genes resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH. This study highlights a successful example of identifying and augmenting the expression of the host targets of a major BPH virulence effector as a promising antivirulence strategy against an important crop pest.",

The obstacles that prevented their use as H 2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cells are being removed one by one, thanks to the continuous discovery of hydrogenases that have unexpected catalytic properties, the development of new methods for their scalable production and matrices that protect them. Obtaining an efficient biohybrid electrode that is scalable and robust under a large range of experimental conditions is still challenging. The FeFe hydrogenase of Clostridium beijerinckii is a very active catalyst of H 2 evolution and can be handled under O 2 , and its production can potentially be scaled up. However, it was believed that it cannot be used for H 2 oxidation, as it is easily oxidized to an O 2 -stable but inactive state. Here, we show that when the enzyme is embedded into a redox-active film whose reduction potential is finely tuned to the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple, the potential that the enzyme experiences can be buffered in a sharp window that is actually compatible with enzyme-catalyzed H 2 oxidation and prevents anaerobic inactivation. This leads us to provide the demonstration of an FeFe hydrogenase-based system that can be used for H 2 oxidation and that can be repeatedly exposed to O 2 during and between operational cycles.",

In this work, via high-speed characterizations, we show that droplet formation occurs via a two-stage process: an initial high-speed outburst followed by slower ligament fragmentation. By systematically varying blade sharpness and speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping reveals that the onion’s tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture. Developing a simplified bilayer model, we experimentally and theoretically capture the mechanism behind, with numerical calculations of the onion critical fracture forces matching independent Instron results. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables’ outer strong casings.",

While animals grown at low density prefer the temperature previously associated with food, those exposed to high density during larval stages instead disperse from this temperature. The high-density experience alters the neural representation of thermal valence, a process that requires a gap junction network spanning multiple neural circuit layers. This network connects density-sensing neurons to the circuit that processes temperature information. Furthermore, these gap junction components also control the decision to enter developmental diapause in response to high density. Our results suggest that the multilayered gap junction network enables early social experience to influence adult behavior and is essential for developmental and behavioral plasticity in social contexts.",

Classically, biomarkers are measurable indicators of the state of biological processes. Given the large number of molecules in modern datasets, a major challenge is identifying the best biomarkers for a particular setting. Here, we apply observability theory to establish a general methodology for biomarker selection. We demonstrate that observability identifies biologically meaningful sensors in a range of time series transcriptomics data. To address unique biological constraints, we introduce the method of dynamic sensor selection to maximize observability over time, thus enabling observability over regimes where system dynamics themselves are subject to change. Our observability-guided biomarker discovery framework extends to multiple data modalities, as demonstrated with the joint use of transcriptomics and chromosome conformation data. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by evaluating the observability of neural activity measured in movies and electroencephalograms. These applications highlight the broad utility of observability-guided biomarker selection, spanning agriculture, biomanufacturing, and neural systems.",

Mechanistically, the picorna-like virus triggers the ISR through transcriptional suppression of ppp1r15 , a key regulator of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dephosphorylation. ISR activation subsequently induces the autophagy-lysosomal pathway by up-regulating Atg1 transcription in an ATF4-dependent manner.

Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions. Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.",

However, the evolvability of phages and the fitness cost they impose on susceptible bacteria challenge the evolutionary stability of the coexistence. Understanding this dynamic is critical for predicting phage–bacteria coevolution with implications for phage therapy, where resistance hinders treatment success. To address this point, we built on the discovery that heterogeneously expressed alterations of the O-antigen (phase variation) enable phenotypic resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium ( S .Tm) against the T5-like phage 37 (Φ37). We observed that phase variation allowed prolonged phage–bacteria coexistence in liquid medium. In contrast, phase variation only delayed the fixation of genetically phage-resistant S .Tm mutants when the phage–bacteria interaction took place in the gut of infected mice. The emergence of evolved phages capable of infecting both phenotypically susceptible and resistant phase variants of wild-type S .Tm selected for genetically resistant S .Tm mutants. Experimental in vitro evolution in a viscous medium recapitulated the short-lived coexistence of phages with susceptible S .Tm observed in the gut. This demonstrates that conditions in the gut increase the evolvability of phages by potentiating the effect of mutations that increase the phage host range, thereby negating the protection conferred by phase variation.",

Developmentally, neutrophils and macrophages share common progenitors, whose fate is tightly controlled by transcriptional programs. Dysregulation of these programs causes severe hematological disorders, including neutropenia, neutrophilia, leukemia, and inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of neutrophils through these programs are poorly understood. Here, we revealed that Ikzf1 and Myb were enriched in neutrophils. Overactivation of Ikzf1 promoted neutrophil generation while suppressing macrophage emergence. Conversely, the simultaneous loss of Ikzf1 and Myb, but not the individual mutations, drastically impaired neutrophil production and enlarged the macrophage pool in both zebrafish and mice. Mechanistically, Ikzf1 and Myb formed a complex that targeted irf8 and induced the expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), irf8-2 , through a regulatory element. LncRNA irf8-2 biased neutrophil commitment by modulating irf8 dosage via Zfp36l1. The deletion of irf8-2 resulted in defective neutrophil development and enhanced macrophage production. However, a partial ratio of neutrophils and macrophages was restored when Ikzf1, Myb, and Irf8 were all compromised. Overall, our study reveals that Ikzf1 and Myb cooperatively bias neutrophil development against Irf8 via the lncRNA irf8 -2 and Zfp36l.

Combined pesticide markedly elevated the abundance of phage-encoded ARGs under nitrogen deposition. By enhancing phage–host interactions and increasing the co-occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes with ARGs, phages may further facilitate the transfer of ARGs to bacterial hosts, conferring hosts a competitive edge in intensified microbial competition driven by combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition. The phage-driven mechanism was supported by in vitro cultivation experiments, demonstrating that phages harboring ARGs, shaped by long-term combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition, can infect bacterial hosts and confer resistance.

Accounting for this systematic phylogenetic bias led to a revised view of mosquito evolution, including the nonmonophyly of subfamily Culicinae.

          "abstract": "Communities in southeastern Louisiana are subject to disproportionate environmental health burdens, including elevated risk for cancer, from emissions of industrial hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). However, there are few ambient measurements (or none) of various HAPs in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans (BR-NO). We measured 17 carcinogenic volatile organic compounds using fast-response in situ instrumentation aboard a mobile laboratory. Using spatially resolved concentrations, we estimate cancer risk in 15 census tracts along an 81 km-long stretch of the BR-NO corridor. In 14 of 15 tracts, our estimates of total cancer risk were higher (range: 0.9 to 11.6 × ; median: 5 × ) than those from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) 2020 Air Toxics Screening Assessment (AirToxScreen). Our maximum estimate for total tract-level cancer risk was 560-in-one million excess cancer cases, far exceeding the upper limit of USEPA’s acceptable risk range (100-in-one million). This discrepancy is largely explained by differences between measured vs. modeled ethylene oxide concentrations, though there are important contributions from a number of additional HAPs. Our risk estimates are dominated by ethylene oxide, which contributes between 39.5 and 92.2% of total cancer risk across all tracts; chloroprene (0.2 to 36.8%); and formaldehyde (4.1 to 14.6%). AirToxScreen also identifies these three compounds as primary drivers of risk in this location. Together, these three compounds account for between 63 and 96.9% of total cancer risk. There is substantial spatial variability in total cancer risk and the relative contribution of each HAP, both between and within tracts. These data substantiate claims that the region has high HAPs-related cancer risk and quantify which individual HAPs are of highest concern.",

          "abstract": "Protein secretion is an essential process of mammalian cells. In biomanufacturing, this process can be optimized to enhance production yields and biotherapeutic quality. While cell line engineering and bioprocess optimization have yielded high protein titers for some recombinant proteins, many remain difficult to express. Here, we investigated factors influencing protein expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, expressing 2,135 Human Secretome Project proteins. While the abundance of mRNA from recombinant proteins explained less than 1% of observed variation in secretion titers, analysis of 218 biochemical and biophysical descriptors uncovered intrinsic protein features that account for ~15% of secretion variability, pinpointing key drivers such as molecular weight, cysteine content, and N-linked glycosylation, and establishing a roadmap for rational design of difficult-to-express proteins. We subsequently analyzed RNA-Seq data from 95 CHO cell cultures, each expressing a distinct recombinant protein, spanning a wide range of titers. Host cell transcriptomic signatures showed strong correlations with titer, thereby providing insights into cellular processes that covary with expression. Cells failing to produce proteins exhibited increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, including ER-associated degradation; whereas high-producing cells demonstrated enhanced lipid metabolism and a stronger response to oxidative stress, suggesting these factors may support successful recombinant protein productions. Together, using this resource, we quantified the contributions of various protein and cellular factors that correlate with the expression of diverse recombinant human proteins in a heterologous host, thereby providing insights for next-generation CHO cell engineering.",

We evaluated 52 voluntary REDD+ projects across 12 tropical countries using synthetic control methods. Only a minority of project units showed statistically significant reductions in deforestation, and just 19% met their reported emissions targets. Nonetheless, many underperforming projects still delivered partial climate benefits, with an estimated 13.2% of tradable credits supported by counterfactual analysis. Effectiveness varied by region, with stronger performance in Brazil and Africa. Although systematic over-crediting remains a concern, our results suggest greater climate benefits than previous assessments. Improving baseline methodologies and strengthening verification frameworks will be essential for enhancing the credibility and impact of forest carbon offsets.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how genetic variation translates into complex phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we address this by mapping genome-to-proteome relationships in 800 progeny of a cross between two yeast strains adapted to distinct environments. Despite the modest genetic distance between the parents, we observed notable proteomic diversity and mapped more than 6400 genotype-protein associations, with more than 1600 linked to individual genetic variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation. This atlas allowed us to forecast organismal fitness effects across diverse conditions. By connecting genomic and proteomic landscapes at unprecedented resolution, our study provides a framework for predicting the phenotypic outcomes of natural genetic variation.",

Selectively blocking the RAS-PI3Kα interaction may represent a strategy for treating RAS-dependent cancers as it would avoid the toxicity associated with inhibitors of PI3Kα lipid kinase activity. We developed compounds that bind covalently to cysteine 242 in the RBD of PI3K p110α and block RAS activation of PI3Kα activity. In mice, inhibitors slow the growth of RAS mutant tumors and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing tumors, particularly when combined with other inhibitors of the RAS/Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, without causing hyperglycemia. Oncogenic mutations in the small guanosine triphosphatase RAS occur in 20% of human cancers, with RAS proteins activating both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways ( 1 – 3 ). As each of these pathways has oncogenic potential, simultaneous activation, as occurs in mutant RAS driven cancers, generates aggressive disease. In RAS-driven cell and animal models, inhibition of both the MAPK and PI3K pathways is more efficacious than targeting the individual pathways ( 4 ); however, dose-limiting toxicities in humans prevent clinical success of this strategy. Although physiological activation of the MAPK pathway is RAS-dependent, the interaction between RAS and the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα, p110α, serves as an amplifier but not a primary activator of this pathway, and is less important in normal cellular regulation than it is in cancer ( 5 ).",

Our results suggest a positional initiation termination axis (PITA), in which usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on their genomic order. PITA is enriched in longer genes with distinct chromatin features. We find that mRNA 5′ start choice directly influences 3′ ends depending on RNA polymerase II trafficking speed.

Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity.

Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.",

L1 retrotransposition critically depends on its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase subunit open reading frame 2 protein (ORF2p), which targets genomic loci and nicks DNA using an evolutionarily distinct yet not fully understood mechanism. Our structural and biochemical analyses revealed that ORF2p is a structure-dependent endonuclease. It binds a double-stranded DNA region upstream of the nicking site and recognizes a downstream forked or flap structure for efficient DNA nicking.

Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors.

          "abstract": "Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an active research area with technological potential. Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated in this work may lead to the development of a robust platform for ultrafast information storage.",

          "abstract": "High-power fiber lasers are powerful tools used in science, industry, and defense. A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.",

The human gastrointestinal microbiota harbors the greatest density of DGRs known in nature, suggesting that they play adaptive roles in this environment. We identified &gt;1100 distinct DGRs among human-associated Bacteroides species and discovered a subset that diversify adhesive components of type V pili and related proteins. We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of &gt;2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify. Our observations provide a foundation for understanding the potential roles of targeted genome plasticity in shaping host-associated microbial communities.",

Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of far-red PSI from Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, allowing the assignment of eight chlorophylls f molecules, including the redox active A -1B . Simulations of absorption difference spectra induced by charge separation indicate that the experimental spectra can be reproduced only by considering the presence of a chlorophyll f at the A -1B site. The chlorophyll f locations, wavelength assignments, and conserved far-red-specific residues provide functional insights for efficient use of long wavelength photons.",

          "abstract": "Efficient DNA repair might make possible the longevity of naked mole-rats. However, whether they have distinctive mechanisms to optimize functions of DNA repair suppressors is unclear. We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.",

To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.",

Most SSEs remain largely confined to single-anion systems (e.g., sulfides, oxides, halides, and polymers). Through mixed-anion design strategy, we develop crystalline Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 (LTOC) and its derivatives with excellent ionic conductivities (up to 13.7 millisiemens per centimeter at 25°C) and electrochemical stability. The LTOC structure features mixed-anion spiral chains, consisting of corner-shared oxygen and terminal chlorine atoms, which induces continuous “tetrahedron-tetrahedron” Li-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers. Additionally, LTOC demonstrates holistic cathode compatibility, enabling solid-state batteries operation at 4.9 volts versus Li/Li + and low temperature, down to −50°C. These findings describe a promising class of superionic conductors for high-performance solid-state batteries.",

Here we show that transient injuries induce a burst of persistent mtDNA mutations that impair resilience to future injuries. mtDNA mutations suppressed energy-intensive nucleotide metabolism. Repletion of adenosine, but not other nucleotides, restored adenosine triphosphate generation, which required a nuclear-encoded purine biosynthetic enzyme, adenylate kinase 4 (AK4). Analysis of 369,912 UK Biobank participants revealed a graded association between mutation burden and chronic kidney disease severity as well as an independent increase in the risk of future acute kidney injury events ( P &lt; 10 −7 ). Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations may therefore reflect the cumulative effect of acute injuries to metabolically active cells, impairing major functions in a fashion amenable to nuclear-controlled purine biosynthesis.",

          "abstract": "Millions of Americans must attend mandatory court dates every year. To boost appearance rates, jurisdictions nationwide are increasingly turning to automated reminders. However, previous research paints an incomplete picture of their effectiveness—in particular, there has been little work assessing the impact of reminders on downstream arrests and incarceration. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment. The effectiveness of reminders bolsters the theory that lapses in memory or comprehension contribute to missed court appearances.",

By engineering plasma-treated discharge microchannels, our design enables direct conduction current generation through cascading ionization, overcoming the efficiency limitations of conventional polarization-dependent systems. Under 2-hertz mechanical excitation, the PEET achieves a current density of 2.5 amperes per square centimeter, an average power output of 4.46 watts per square meter per hertz, and an energy conversion efficiency of 19%—two orders of magnitude higher than conventional electrostatic energy harvesting technologies, e.g., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and capacitive systems.

Although two-dimensional acoustic charge transport (2D-ACT) devices integrating 2D field-effect transistors (FETs) with surface acoustic waves (SAWs) have substantial potential, previous work has been confined to dc operation, limiting real-time applications. Here, we present a hybrid platform that enables comprehensive dc and ac analog signal processing within a 2D-ACT device. By synergistically integrating 2D-FET and SAW components, our system achieves real-time subwavelength carrier monitoring and ac signal manipulation. ac measurements further elucidate mechanisms of dc acoustoelectric current generation. Notably, by controlling the phase and intensity of counter-propagating SAWs, we demonstrate analog signal addition and subtraction capabilities not previously realized in 2D-ACT devices.

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.",

Upon ingestion, the outer layer neutralizes gastric acid through double-decomposition reaction, protecting bacterial viability and the inner layer. During intestinal passage, the inner layer enables T1/T2 dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging for real-time tracking, whereas the lesion-triggered release of manganese ions allows T1 single-mode pathological detection.

Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues.

In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics.

Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms.

Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits.

This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating.

The microbiota community determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer immunotherapy; however, mechanisms able to improve this function are not known. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration. Mechanistically, data in mice and patients with cancer suggest that invigorated enterotropic cytotoxic T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CCR9 replenish the tumor microenvironment in a CCL25-mediated manner and control tumor growth, resulting in improved ICB efficacy.",

However, most UDP-glycosyltransferases encounter three major limitations: low activity, poor regioselectivity, and restricted substrate availability, hindering their pharmaceutical applications. To address these challenges, we conducted protein engineering on a previously unidentified glycosyltransferase, UGT75AJ2, which had 3′,7- O -glycosylation capabilities. Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites. This comprehensive study tackles predominant challenges in UDP-glycosyltransferases protein engineering, providing innovative approaches and insights that enhance the development of flavonoid glycosides.",

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.",

We analyze large behavioral datasets of larval zebrafish engaged in a “coherent dot” optomotor assay and find that animal performance is bimodal. Performance can be separated into two “states”—an engaged (attentive) state with high performance, where fish consistently turn in the direction of coherent motion, and a second, disengaged (inattentive) state, where performance drops to chance. A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity.

Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.",

For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure.

We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations.

Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems.

Progress in this field has been limited to the reactions promoted by bridged biaryl intermediates with five- or six-membered rings. Herein we demonstrate the first example of a carbene-catalyzed atroposelective dynamic kinetic acylation reaction via transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetals. The key for the success of this reaction relies on the formation and configurational instability of the transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetal intermediate.

Notably, one of the axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products can be used as the key and common intermediate for the asymmetric synthesis of natural product steganone.

          "abstract": "Depression presents challenges in understanding its biological basis and developing effective treatments. Posttranslational modifications provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms of disorders, yet their role in depression remains underexplored. Glycosylation has been particularly difficult to study due to its heterogeneous nature and analytical challenges, despite its potential to uncover previously unknown mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.",

Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.",

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge.

We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact.

Building on this insight, Pt-MOFs@Glu was designed to engage these cells for precise delivery. Comprising carboplatin, pyrazine-quinoxaline, and β-glucan, the system induces an “avalanche effect” in the CNSL microenvironment, promoting tumor apoptosis and inhibiting metastasis. Combining pyrazine-quinoxaline to lock carboplatin and β-glucan to boost targeting, immunity, and oral absorption, the system enables ROS-triggered drug release, efficiently crosses the gastrointestinal tract and BBB, and synergizes chemo-immunotherapy to enhance therapeutic efficacy.

In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets &lt;10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity.

Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation.

Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution.

Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress.

Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes.

This violation becomes pronounced toward the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations.

          "abstract": "Innate immune signaling is activated in immunometabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, yet its impact on glucose homeostasis is controversial. Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.",

However, achieving high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information processing in most mechanical metamaterials remains a challenge. Here, we report a multibit programming spine structure strategy to create a magnetorheological metamaterial with high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information encoding capacities. Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.",

Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.",

Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold.

Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.",

Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation.

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.",

Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.",

We show that floods driven by compound space-time storm clustering have higher peaks, volumes, and durations compared to those from isolated storms or single-mode clustering. Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically. These findings highlight the need to incorporate storm clustering and its changes into design flood analysis and management strategies for the LMRB.",

Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.",

By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells.

          "abstract": "Complex I (CI; NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is central to energy generation and metabolic homeostasis in mammalian cells but contributes to adverse outcome pathways under challenging conditions. During ischemia, mammalian CI transitions from a turnover-ready, structurally “closed” state toward a dormant “open” state that prevents it from functioning in reverse during reperfusion to produce reactive oxygen species. Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to reliably track movement kinematics remains unclear. Here, we describe a tracking method that uses near-infrared quantum dots as injectable markers. We demonstrate that our tags can be injected beneath the skin or into joints and imaged for months in freely moving mice noninvasively using standard cameras.

By using injectable landmarks in the joints, this method brings us closer to understanding how the brain controls skeletal movements.",

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in intelligent sports. However, the complexity and volume of TENG-generated data pose challenges for manual analysis. Machine learning (ML), with strengths in pattern recognition and adaptive processing, provides a powerful solution to enhance TENG-based sensing signal interpretation. This review systematically explores the integration of ML and TENG technology for intelligent sports. First, the fundamental theory and basic knowledge of TENGs are introduced, highlighting their versatility in sports sensing systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of ML models for TENG signal analysis is discussed. Recent advancements of ML-assisted TENG-based intelligent sports applications, including sports training evaluation, sports health monitoring, and virtual/augmented reality sports, are then highlighted.

Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.",

Disentangling the relative effects of these factors is challenging yet crucial for designing management strategies. We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.",

Mitochondria are also a key source of intracellular ROS, yet their contribution to plant immunity is poorly characterized. Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.",

Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy.

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape.",

Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene.

Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth.

KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.",

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.",

We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened.

This study proposes an ultrathin flexible sensor inserted endovascularly with a stent to detect type I endoleaks, which pose the highest rupture risk. A coplanar capacitive sensor was attached to the stent graft using a specially developed flexible thermal adhesive to monitor blood leakage, without compromising the stent graft’s function. It seamlessly folds and unfolds with the stent, allowing implantation through catheter-based procedures. Experimental validation confirmed that the sensor does not induce blood leakage and demonstrated long-term stability and functionality under vascular and dynamic conditions. This technology enables wireless monitoring of endoleak status, facilitates timely intervention, and improves postoperative outcomes by reducing the risk of recurrent aneurysms.",

          "abstract": "Across human cultures and historical periods, women, on average, live longer than men, a pattern best understood from a comparative evolutionary perspective. Here, we analyzed adult life expectancy in 528 mammal and 648 bird species in zoos. Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of NKAPL (nuclear factor κB activating protein-like)—an SCZ risk-associated gene—and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1635 in cognitive deficits related to SCZ. We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.",
