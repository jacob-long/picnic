          "authors": "Valeriia Hutskalova, Christof Sparr",
          "abstract": "Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous synthetic approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remained elusive4. Here, we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrene by employing Schrock-Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each of the ring systems proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective aromatic ring-opening metathesis with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis is therefore a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation.",

          "abstract": "Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units 1 , the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system 2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback 4,5 . The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm 6 . However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.",

However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination.",

Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease 3,4 . Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.",

          "authors": "Sixie Yang, Yigang Wang, Hui Pan, Ping He, Haoshen Zhou",
          "abstract": "In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.",

          "abstract": "During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1,2,3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1,2,3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.",

          "authors": "Shiheng Liu, Tiantian Su, Xian Xia, Z. Hong Zhou",
          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.",

          "abstract": "The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest 1–13 . However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms 14–24 , the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate 11 . These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived.",

          "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1,2,3,4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5,6,7,8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites.",

          "abstract": "Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are assembly line biosynthetic pathways that are used to produce critical therapeutic drugs and are typically arranged as large multi-domain proteins called megasynthetases1. They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",

          "abstract": "Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6,7,8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.",

The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization 1–4 . So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes 4–19 . Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre - scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe) 2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21 . We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism 12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices 3,14,22–24 .",

          "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, NCT04725474), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.",

However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security.",

          "abstract": "The automated synthesis of small organic molecules from modular building blocks has the potential to transform our capacity to create medicines and materials1,2,3. Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4,5,6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments. More generally, these results indicate that fragmentation features inherent to chemical synthesis can empower rapid data-rich experimentation.",

          "abstract": "The human body contains trillions of cells, classified into specific cell types, with diverse morphologies and functions. In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual’s body during their lifetime. Understanding the complexities of the proteome in the context of a human organism and its many potential states is a necessary requirement to understanding human biology, but these complexities can neither be predicted from the genome, nor have they been systematically measurable with available technologies. Recent advances in proteomic technology and computational sciences now provide opportunities to investigate the intricate biology of the human body at unprecedented resolution and scale. Here we introduce a big-science endeavour called π-HuB (proteomic navigator of the human body). The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine.

The rapid development of highly effective vaccines2,3 against SARS-CoV-2 has altered the trajectory of the pandemic, and antiviral therapeutics4 have further reduced the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that encode various structural and non-structural proteins, including those critical for viral RNA replication and evasion from innate immunity5. Here we report the discovery and development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase (MTase) NSP14. High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6. The inhibition of viral cap methylases as an antiviral strategy is also adaptable to other pandemic viruses.",

          "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia.",

Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analyzing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from ~45,000 year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbor Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to ~45,000-49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced to-date resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations.",

          "abstract": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1,2,3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6,7,8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.",

Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation 8 , comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states 9,10 . However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.",

          "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system.",

Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at z spec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) 1 . The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 10 5 M ⊙ to 10 6 M ⊙ . These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (&gt;10 3 M ⊙ pc − 2 ), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function.

          "abstract": "Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a structural component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR)1. Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface.",

          "abstract": "Io experiences tidal deformation due to its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s ongoing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been hypothesized to support the large-scale melting of Io’s interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5-7 Doppler data from the Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125±0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4±3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming due to rapid melt ascent, intrusion, and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating – like that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10 – may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies.",

          "abstract": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a central role in lipid and cholesterol metabolism and is a key agent in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the leading cause of mortality worldwide1,2. Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the first structure of apoB100 resolved to sub-nanometer resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24, and molecular dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of >200 intramolecular crosslinks and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function and will help accelerate the design of potential new therapeutics.",

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPSs C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, where the active site histidine likely serves not a as general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",

          "abstract": "The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks 1–3 . These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis 4–8 . Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4 + T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness 9–11 . Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.",

But what if you wanted to produce spaces in a material that is soft and delicate, and that can’t survive the high temperatures typically used to remove the template? Writing in Nature, Sundaram et al.2 introduce a process in which gallium, a metal that is liquid near room temperature, is used as a sacrificial material to generate multiscale 3D channel networks in soft, natural hydrogels such as collagen. This enables soft biomaterials to be engineered to contain channel architectures that approach the complexity of natural tissue structures.",

In the first stage of pre-eclampsia, incomplete placental development leads to compromised blood flow through the vasculature and a lack of oxygen in placental tissue. In the second stage, the placenta releases vascular toxins, such as the protein sFlt-1 — a circulating inhibitor of the signalling protein VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These toxins cause dysfunction of the endothelial cells that line maternal blood vessels and lead to the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia. Levels of sFlt-1 and related biomarkers in the blood can now be measured and are routinely used for early diagnosis in women with suspected pre-eclampsia2–4.",

For many people, their ‘normal’ blood values fall within a narrow range — one that is much smaller than the population-based reference range1. Writing in Nature, Foy et al.2 present evidence that underscores the importance of these personalized setpoints, analysing decades of blood-test data across nine key parameters. The authors’ findings suggest that integrating personalized reference intervals into clinical diagnostics could bring about a new level of precision medicine.",

Secondary analyses in UK Biobank revealed independence of these associations from observed fluid intelligence and sex-specific effects. By leveraging aggregate population trends, we identified patterns in the public interest, such as the mediating effect of education attainment on the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder PGS with multiple professional categories.

          "abstract": "Institutions allow cooperation to persist when reciprocity and reputation provide insufficient incentives. Yet how they do so remains unclear, especially given that institutions are themselves a form of cooperation. To solve this puzzle, we develop a mathematical model of reputation-based cooperation in which two social dilemmas are nested within one another. The first dilemma, characterized by high individual costs or insufficient monitoring, cannot be solved by reputation alone. The second dilemma, an institutional collective action, involves individuals contributing to change the parameters of the first dilemma in a way that incentivizes cooperation. Our model demonstrates that this nested architecture creates a leverage effect. While insufficient on its own to incentivize cooperation in the first dilemma, reputation incentivizes contributions to the institutional collective action, which, in turn, strengthen the initially weak incentives for cooperation in the first dilemma. Just as a pulley system transforms minimal muscular strength into significant lifting capability, institutions act as cooperative pulleys, transforming initially weak reputational incentives into powerful drivers of cooperative behavior. Based on these results, we suggest that institutions have developed as social technologies, designed by humans to exploit this social leverage effect, just as material technologies are designed to exploit physical laws.",

FTO is ubiquitinated by its E3 ligase DTX2, followed by UFD1 recruitment and subsequent degradation in the proteasome. VES binds to FTO and DTX2, leading to enhanced FTO–DTX2 interaction, FTO ubiquitination, and degradation in FTO-dependent tumor cells. VES suppressed tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy in vivo in mouse models. Genetic FTO knockdown or VES treatment increased m 6 A methylation in the LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) gene and decreased LIF mRNA decay, and thus sensitized melanoma cells to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our findings reveal the underlying molecular mechanism for FTO protein degradation and identify a dietary degrader for FTO that inhibits tumor growth and overcomes immunotherapy resistance.",

Several TMEM16A inhibitors have been identified; however, their binding sites and inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Using magnolol and honokiol, the two regioisomeric inhibitors, as chemical probes, we have identified a drug-binding site distinct from the pore region, in TMEM16A, which is described here. With electrophysiology, unbiased molecular docking and clustering, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation with mutant cycle analysis, we show that magnolol and honokiol utilize different drug-binding sites, pore and nonpore pockets. The pore blocker utilizes amino acids crucial for chloride passage, whereas the nonpore blocker allosterically modulates the pore residues to hinder ion permeation. Among 17 inhibitors tested, 11 were pore blockers and 6 were nonpore blockers, indicating the importance of this nonpore pocket. Our study provides insights into drug-binding mechanism in TMEM16A together with a rationale for future drug development.",

Our silicatein-expressing bacteria can self-assemble a shell of polysilicate “bioglass” around themselves. Remarkably, the polysilicate-encapsulated bacteria can focus light into intense nanojets that are nearly an order of magnitude brighter than unmodified bacteria. Polysilicate-encapsulated bacteria are metabolically active for up to 4 mo, potentially allowing them to sense and respond to stimuli over time.

          "abstract": "High pressure can create extreme conditions that enable the formation of novel materials and the discovery of new phenomena. However, the ability to preserve the desirable characteristics of materials obtained under high pressure has remained an elusive challenge, as the pressure-induced changes are typically reversible, except for the pressure-induced chemical reactions such as polymerization of hydrocarbons. Here, we propose the concept of “pressure aging” (PA) that enables the permanent locking-in of high-pressure structures and their associated enhanced properties in functional materials. Specifically, through the application of PA at 3.3 GPa for 24 h, the two-dimensional ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6 exhibits a permanent change in Cu configuration after the pressure is fully released. This leads to a 2.5-fold enhancement in remanent polarization and an increase in T c from 317 K to 583 K. In contrast, the samples underwent a compression–decompression cycle but without PA showed only reversible changes in their characteristics. We elucidate the relaxation dynamics during PA using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function, providing valuable insights into the temporal evolution of both structural and property changes. Furthermore, the broad applicability of PA strategy has been validated across different materials, underscoring its versatility. Notably, the pressures involved are industrially attainable, and the sample sizes are scalable. Consequently, the implementation of this impactful PA approach introduces a groundbreaking unique dimension to high-pressure research, with significant potential across various scientific domains.",

Rare fold-switching events by KaiB provide a critical delay in the negative feedback loop of this posttranslational oscillator. In this study, we experimentally and computationally investigate the temperature dependence of fold switching and its mechanism. We demonstrate that the stability of gsKaiB increases with temperature compared to fsKaiB and that the Q10 value for the gsKaiB → fsKaiB transition is nearly three times smaller than that for the reverse transition in a construct optimized for NMR studies. Simulations and native-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR experiments suggest that fold switching can involve both partially and completely unfolded intermediates. The simulations predict that the transition state for fold switching coincides with isomerization of conserved prolines in the most rapidly exchanging region, and we confirm experimentally that proline isomerization is a rate-limiting step for fold switching. We explore the implications of our results for temperature compensation, a hallmark of circadian clocks, through a kinetic model.",

The latest cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures provide unique insights into channel function and pharmacology, opening avenues for different therapeutic strategies against human diseases associated with KCNQ1 mutations. However, these structures also raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms of ion permeation. Cryo-EM structures thought to represent the open state of the channel feature a cavity region not wide enough for accommodation of hydrated K + . To understand how K + passes through the cavity constriction, we utilized microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the KCNQ1/KCNE3 cryo-EM structure, characterized mutants at the G345 residue situated at the narrowest point of the cavity, and recorded single channels. The findings indicate that ions become partially dehydrated at the constriction, which enables permeation. MD simulations demonstrate that the constriction can impede the flow of ions through the channel’s pore, a finding that is corroborated by mutational screening and single-channel recordings. Reduced channel conductance is the key mechanism underlying reported pathological KCNQ1 mutations at or near the constriction site.",

Notably, the temporal correlation of neural activity at rest, known as the intrinsic timescale, increases systematically along this hierarchy in both primates and rodents, analogous to the increasing scale and complexity of spatial receptive fields. However, how the timescales for task-related activity vary across brain regions and whether their hierarchical organization appears consistently across different mammalian species remain unexplored. Here, we show that both the intrinsic timescale and those of task-related activity follow a similar hierarchical gradient in the cortices of monkeys, rats, and mice. We also found that these timescales covary similarly in both the cortex and basal ganglia, whereas the timescales of thalamic activity are shorter than cortical timescales and do not conform to the hierarchical order predicted by their cortical projections. These results suggest that the hierarchical gradient of cortical timescales might represent a universal feature of intracortical circuits in the mammalian brain.",

This cell plasticity is particularly prominent in more regenerative vertebrates such as zebrafish, yet the molecular basis by which cells transdifferentiate into another cell type upon injury remains unclear. Here, we investigate the epigenetic basis of regenerative transdifferentiation in the inner ear, where supporting cells (SCs) generate mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) upon damage. By comparing the chromatin landscapes in regenerative zebrafish and green anole lizards versus nonregenerative mice, we identified a class of enhancers that function in progenitors to generate HCs and then are selectively maintained in SCs of regenerative vertebrates to regenerate HCs. In particular, we uncovered a syntenic class of long-range enhancers for Atoh1 , a master transcription factor for HC differentiation. In the absence of injury, these enhancers maintain accessibility in SCs through adulthood but are prevented from driving zebrafish atoh1a expression through Notch repression. Deletion of these enhancers not only impaired atoh1a expression and HC formation during development but also blocked the ability of SCs to transdifferentiate into HCs during regeneration. Moreover, defects were specific to the inner ear versus the lateral line, revealing distinct mechanisms of regeneration in these mechanosensory organs. These findings reveal a class of regenerative enhancer that maintains competency of inner ear SCs to upregulate atoh1a and transdifferentiate into HCs upon damage. We propose that the continued accessibility of developmental enhancers for one cell fate in lineage-related cells may be a common theme underlying adult cell plasticity in regenerative vertebrates.",

Under external inputs (i.e., training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via an autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources. Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN), and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of the physical process. Using magnetic texture–defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja’s learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner.

          "abstract": "Inspired by the way that digital artists zoom out of the canvas to assess the visual impact of their works, we introduce a conceptually simple yet effective metric for quantifying the clarity of digital images. This metric contrasts original images with progressively “melted” counterparts, produced by randomly flipping adjacent pixel pairs. It measures the presence of stable structures, assigning the value zero to completely uniform or random images and finite values for those with discernible patterns. This metric respects the color diversity of the original image and withstands image compression and color quantization. Its suitability for diverse image analysis problems is demonstrated through its effective evaluation of textural images, the identification of structural transitions in physical systems like the Potts model, and its consistency with color theory in digital arts. This allows us to demonstrate that color in visual art functions as a state variable, akin to the spin configuration in magnets, driving artistic designs to transition between states with distinct clarity. When combined with the Shannon entropy, which quantifies color diversity, the structural stability metric can serve as a navigation tool for artists to explore pathways on the complex structural information landscape toward the completion of their artwork. As a practical demonstration, we apply our metric to refine and optimize an emote design for a video game. The structural stability metric emerges as a versatile tool for extracting nuanced structural information from digital images, which may enhance decision-making and data analysis across scientific and creative domains.",

Microbial complexes characterized by mutually beneficial symbiosis hold great promise for IBD therapy. Here, we aggregated Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (Sp) with Bacillus subtilis (BS) by biomimetic mineralization to form cyanobacteria–probiotics symbionts (ASp@BS), which reshaped a healthy immune system and gut microbiota in a murine model of acute colitis. The symbionts exhibited excellent tolerance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract. Importantly, probiotics within the symbionts created a local anaerobic environment to activate the [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme of cyanobacteria, facilitating the production of hydrogen gas (H 2 ) to persistently scavenge elevated reactive oxygen species and alleviate inflammatory factors. The resulting reduced inflammation improves the viability of the probiotics to efficiently regulate the gut microbiota and reshape the intestinal barrier functions. Our research elucidates that ASp@BS leverages the synergistic interaction between Sp and BS to create a therapeutic platform that addresses multiple aspects of IBD, offering a promising and comprehensive solution for IBD treatment.",

          "abstract": "Phase transitions are ubiquitous across life, yet hard to quantify and describe accurately. In this work, we develop an approach for characterizing generic attributes of phase transitions from very limited observations made deep within different phases’ domains of stability. Our approach is called thermodynamic maps (TM), which combines statistical mechanics and molecular simulations with score-based generative models. TM enable learning the temperature dependence of arbitrary thermodynamic observables across a wide range of temperatures. We show its usefulness by calculating phase transition attributes such as melting temperature, temperature-dependent heat capacities, and critical exponents. For instance, we demonstrate the ability of TM to infer the ferromagnetic phase transition of the Ising model, including temperature-dependent heat capacity and critical exponents, despite never having seen samples from the transition region. In addition, we efficiently characterize the temperature-dependent conformational ensemble and compute melting curves of the two RNA systems: a GCAA tetraloop and the HIV-TAR RNA, which are notoriously hard to sample due to glassy-like energy landscapes.",

          "abstract": "In view of changing climatic conditions and disappearing natural resources such as fertile soil and water, exploring alternatives to today’s industrial monocrop farming becomes essential. One promising farming practice is intercropping (IC), in which two or more crop species are grown together. Many experiments have shown that, under certain circumstances, IC can decrease soil erosion and fertilizer use, improve soil health and land management, while preserving crop production levels. However, there have been no quantitative approaches to predict, design, and control appropriate IC implementation for given particular environmental and farming conditions, and to assess its robustness. Here, we develop such an approach, based on methods and concepts developed in data science and systems biology. Our dataset groups the results of 2258 IC experiments, involving 274 pairs of 69 different plants. The data include 4 soil characteristics and 5 environmental and farming conditions, together with 8 traits for each of the two intercropped plants. We performed a dimensional reduction of the resulting 25-dimensional variable space and showed that, from a few quantities, one can predict IC yield relative to sole cultivation with good accuracy. For given environmental conditions, our computational approach can help to choose a companion plant and appropriate farming practices. It also indicates how to estimate the robustness of IC to external perturbations. This approach, together with its results, can be viewed as an initial step toward “systems agriculture,” which would ultimately develop systems of multiple plant grown together in appropriately designed and controlled settings.",

          "abstract": "The possible presence of brines on Mars adds an intriguing dimension to the exploration of Martian environments. Their potential involvement in the formation of recurring slope lineae has sparked debates on the existence of liquid water versus alternative dry processes. In situ instrumentation on rovers and landers has been instrumental in providing valuable data for comprehending the dynamics of brines. Laboratory experiments and thermodynamic simulations conducted under Martian conditions offer insights into the formation and persistence of brines, shedding light on the planet’s current hydrological processes. Despite these findings, the prevailing surface conditions on Mars, characterized by a combination of low temperature, pressure, and water vapor pressure, generally hinder the stability of most brines. In such environments, only a few select salts, notably calcium perchlorate, could play a pivotal role in potentially forming brines through deliquescence or melting. These environmental factors emerge as critical contributors influencing the stability of brines, but such limitations generally restrict the locations, timescales, and amounts of brine formed. However, the exploration of brines extends beyond geochemical considerations, serving as a lens through which we can examine potential habitability and gain a broader understanding of the Martian climate. Therefore, observing brines on Mars would offer valuable insights into the dynamic interplay of various factors that influence their stability, contributing to our overall comprehension of Mars’ unique environmental conditions.",

Experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial symmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows that lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface deformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface self-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase, where active fluid is perforated with passive droplets.

Despite our substantial understanding of plant responses to low humidity, molecular mechanisms underlying the high humidity (HH) response are much less well understood. In this study, we investigated early responses to HH in Arabidopsis . Expression of CYP707A3 , encoding an abscisic acid (ABA) 8′-hydroxylase, is induced by HH within 10 min, which leads to a decrease in foliar ABA level. We identified that the combined action of CAMTA3 and CAMTA2 transcription factors regulate this response. This regulation requires a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of CAMTA3. Transcriptomes of HH-regulated genes are enriched in those related to calcium signaling, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs). Moreover, HH induces CNGC2- and CNGC4-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations in leaves within a few minutes. We also found that CNGC2, CNGC4, and CAMTAs participate in HH-induced hyponastic movement of petioles. Taken together, our results indicate that CNGC2/CNGC4-Ca 2+ -CaM-CAMTA3/CAMTA2 acts as a primary regulatory module to trigger downstream HH responses.",

          "abstract": "The routing of blood flow throughout the brain vasculature is precisely controlled by mechanisms that serve to maintain a fine balance between local neuronal demands and vascular supply of nutrients. We recently identified two capillary endothelial cell (cEC)-based mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow in vivo: 1) electrical signaling, mediated by extracellular K + -dependent activation of strong inward rectifying K + (Kir2.1) channels, which are steeply activated by hyperpolarization and thus are capable of cell-to-cell propagation, and 2) calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which reflects release of Ca 2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R)—a target of G q -protein-coupled receptor signaling. Notably, Ca 2+ signals were restricted to the cell in which they were initiated. Unexpectedly, we found that these two mechanisms, which were presumed to operate in distinct spatiotemporal realms, are linked such that Kir2.1-dependent hyperpolarization induces increases in the electrical driving force for Ca 2+ entry into cECs through resident TRPV4 channels. This process, termed electrocalcium (E-Ca) coupling, enhances IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ release via a Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism, and allows focally induced hyperpolarization, including that initiated by ATP-dependent K + (K ATP ) channels, to travel cell-to-cell via activation of Kir2.1 channels in adjacent cells, providing a mechanism for the “pseudopropagation” of Ca 2+ signals. Computational modeling supported the basic features of E-Ca coupling and provided insight into the intracellular processes involved. Collectively, these data provide strong support for the concept of E-Ca coupling and provide a mechanism for the spatiotemporal integration of diverse signaling pathways in the control of cerebral blood flow.",

Given that CARD11 is physiologically expressed not only in lymphocytes but also in dendritic cells (DCs), we explored whether enforced CARD11 signaling in DCs contributes to immunopathology. We demonstrated that exclusive DC-intrinsic expression of CARD11-GOF in mice was sufficient to induce a lethal autoinflammatory syndrome that mimicked human HLH. Mechanistically, DC-intrinsic CARD11-GOF signaling triggered cell-autonomous inflammatory cytokine production via MALT1 paracaspase engagement. Genetic deletion of Malt1 in CARD11-GOF-expressing animals reversed the hyperinflammatory phenotype. These results highlight the significant role of enforced CARD11/MALT1 signaling in DCs as a contributor to HLH pathology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for HLH treatment.",

However, the underlying mechanism for governing the migration mode switching is still unclear. Here, we revealed that epithelial tumor cells could develop a stable directional mode driven by hyperactivated ERK activity. This highly activated and dynamically changing ERK activity, called pERK transition, is crucial for inducing the switch from pauses state to directional movement and is also necessary for maintaining epithelial tumor cells in the directional mode. PERK transition integrated pERK surf, the dynamic and localized ERK activity at the leading edge. The sequential activation of RhoA and Rac1 by pERK transition played critical roles in generation of pERK surf activity through a movement feedback mechanism. PERK transition activity converted the orderly collective migration into the disordered dispersal movement, enhanced the invasiveness of epithelial tumor cells, and promoted their metastasis in immune-deficient mice. These findings revealed that the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of ERK activity orchestrates migration and invasion of tumor cells and provide evidence for the mechanism underlying migration mode switching in epithelial tumor cells.",

          "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus forms multicellular communities known as biofilms in which cells are held together by an extracellular matrix principally composed of repurposed cytoplasmic proteins and extracellular DNA. These biofilms assemble during infections or under laboratory conditions by growth on medium containing glucose, but the intracellular signal for biofilm formation and its downstream targets were unknown. Here, we present evidence that biofilm formation is triggered by a drop in the levels of the second messenger cyclic-di-AMP. Previous work identified genes needed for the release of extracellular DNA, including genes for the cyclic-di-AMP phosphodiesterase GdpP, the transcriptional regulator XdrA, and the purine salvage enzyme Apt. Using a cyclic-di-AMP riboswitch biosensor and mass spectrometry, we show that the second messenger drops in abundance during biofilm formation in a glucose-dependent manner. Mutation of these three genes elevates cyclic-di-AMP and prevents biofilm formation in a murine catheter model. Supporting the generality of this mechanism, we found that gdpP was required for biofilm formation by diverse strains of S. aureus . We additionally show that the downstream consequence of the drop in cyclic-di-AMP is inhibition of the “accessory gene regulator” operon agr , which is known to suppress biofilm formation through phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator AgrA by the histidine kinase AgrC. Consistent with this, an agr mutation bypasses the block in biofilm formation and eDNA release caused by a gdpP mutation. Finally, we report the unexpected observation that GdpP inhibits phosphotransfer from AgrC to AgrA, revealing a direct connection between the phosphodiesterase and agr .",

Although multiple lines of evidence support this change, attempts to determine the abundance of water on the planet, the history of water at the surface, and the sequestration into both permanent and exchangeable sinks have yielded a wide range of results. I explore the uncertainties in the processes and interpretation, to understand our ability to quantitatively determine the water inventory and its changes through time. Results indicate that the present state of models and of the data constraining them preclude determining a unique history for water. This uncertainty does not affect the conclusion that significant amounts of water have been lost to space and to other sinks and that these losses are consistent with the changes in climate and surface environment.",

The candidate origins of lunar water are an indigenous lunar component, solar wind water production, and the delivery of meteoritic and cometary material. Characterizing the oxygen isotopic composition of water provides information on lunar oxygen sources. The scarcity of lunar water required the development of a high-precision analytical technique for small samples. This method employs stepwise heating, fluorination, and oxygen isotopic measurements using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The three heating steps were selected based on other extraterrestrial material studies to release loosely bound water that may have been terrestrially contaminated (50 °C), loosely bound water (150 °C), and tightly bound water (as OH) (1,000 °C). This method was applied to a suite of 9 Apollo samples (basalts, breccias, and a regolith), along with terrestrial and meteoritic controls. We present here measurements of the triple oxygen isotopic composition of this water. Our data predominantly show high Δ′ 17 O values (≥ 0‰) for lunar water. These values are consistent with enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrite-like signatures, although coupling Δ′ 17 O with δ 18 O forms mixing trends that dominantly overlap enstatite signatures. The other end of the mixing line is in the positive Δ′ 17 O space with cometary δ 18 O values, providing constraints for cometary Δ′ 17 O between 0.75 to 1.75‰.",

As a hallmark of human endocrine activity, the cortisol awakening response (CAR) is recognized to play a critical role in proactively modulating emotional and executive functions. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of such proactive effects remain elusive. By leveraging pharmacological neuroimaging and hidden Markov modeling of brain state dynamics, we show that the CAR proactively modulates rapid spatiotemporal reconfigurations (state) of large-scale brain networks involved in emotional and executive functions. Behaviorally, suppression of CAR proactively impaired performance of emotional discrimination but not working memory (WM), while individuals with higher CAR exhibited better performance for both emotional and WM tasks. Neuronally, suppression of CAR led to a decrease in fractional occupancy and mean lifetime of task-related brain states dominant to emotional and WM processing. Further information-theoretic analyses on sequence complexity of state transitions revealed that a suppressed or lower CAR led to higher transition complexity among states primarily anchored in visual-sensory and salience networks during emotional task. Conversely, an opposite pattern of transition complexity was observed among states anchored in executive control and visuospatial networks during WM, indicating that CAR distinctly modulates neural resources allocated to emotional and WM processing. Our findings establish a causal link of CAR with brain network dynamics across emotional and executive functions, suggesting a neuroendocrine account for CAR proactive effects on human emotion and cognition.",

          "abstract": "Retinal rods and cones underlie scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. Their pigments exhibit spontaneous isomerizations (quantal noise) in darkness due to intrinsic thermal energy. This quantal noise, albeit exceedingly low in rods, dictates the light threshold for scotopic vision. The same quantal noise in cones, however, is too low to explain the much higher diurnal light threshold. Separately, a dark continuous noise is present in rods, long accepted to originate from an intrinsic random activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase enzyme mediating phototransduction downstream of the pigment. Here, we report the surprising finding that most of this rod dark continuous noise actually originates from rhodopsin itself. Importantly, we found the same continuous noise with a much higher magnitude from cone pigments. The rod and cone continuous noises are apparently both associated with a hitherto unrecognized “metastable” pigment conformational state physiologically resembling that in apo-opsin (opsin devoid of chromophore) and is intermittently active for very brief moments. The cone holopigment’s high continuous noise is expected to act as an intrinsic equivalent light and adapt the cone dramatically, accounting for a major part of the light-sensitivity difference between rods and cones in darkness.",

Multiple chaperones interact with and disaggregate amyloid fibrils, which impacts amyloid propagation and cellular phenotypes. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how site-specific binding of chaperones to amyloids facilitates the concerted disaggregation process and modulates physiological consequences in vivo. Here, we identified binding sites of Ssa1, Sis1, and Hsp104 chaperones for Sup35, the protein determinant of yeast prion [ PSI + ] yeast. Our biophysical and genetic analyses with various Sup35 deletion mutants and amyloid conformations revealed that the Ssa1-binding to the region outside amyloid core plays a key role in facilitating disaggregation and propagation of yeast prions both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we developed a reconstitution system, including the Ssa1-binding tag and the HAP/Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) hybrid chaperones, and found that this reconstitution system successfully degraded distinct prion strain conformations. Together, these results show that the properly positioned, exposed Ssa1-binding region in amyloid fibrils influences the efficiency of amyloid disaggregation and propagation, and eventually prion strain phenotypes. More broadly, our findings provide molecular foundations for previous, puzzling observations of prion propagation in vivo, and offer insights into elimination of amyloid deposits in cells.",

          "abstract": "The formation of excited dimer states, so called excimers, is an important phenomenon in many organic molecular semiconductor solid state aggregates. In contrast to Frenkel exciton–polarons, an excimer is long-lived and energetically low-lying due to stabilization resulting from a substantial reorganization of the intermolecular geometry. Here, we show that ultrafast electron diffraction can follow the dynamics of solid-state excimer formation in polycrystalline thin films of a molecular semiconductor, revealing both the key reaction modes and the eventual structure of the emitting state. We study the prototypical organic semiconductor zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in its crystallographic α -phase as a model excimeric system. We show that the excimer forms in a two-step process starting with a fast dimerization (approx. 0.4 ps) followed by a subsequent slow shear-twist motion (14 ps) leading to an alignment of the π -systems of the involved monomers. This structural distortion persists well beyond 300 ps. Furthermore, we show that while the same excimer geometry is present in partially fluorinated derivatives of ZnPc, the formation kinematics slow down with increasing level of fluorination.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax parasites can lie dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, activating weeks to months after sporozoite inoculation to cause relapsing malarial illness. It is not known what biological processes govern hypnozoite activation. We use longitudinal data from the most detailed cohort study ever conducted in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were endemic to fit a simple within-host mathematical model of P. vivax hypnozoite activation. 1,344 children living on the Thailand–Myanmar border were followed daily for 21 mo. There were 2,504 vivax and 1,164 falciparum malaria symptomatic episodes recorded over 1988 person-years. The model assumes that hypnozoites activate independently at a constant rate (“exponential clock model”). When this model was embedded in a stochastic framework for repeated infectious mosquito bites, with seasonality inferred from the incidence of clinical falciparum malaria episodes, it explained the observed temporal patterns of multiple (up to 13) recurrent vivax malaria episodes. Under this model, we estimate the mean dormancy period for a single hypnozoite to be 6 mo (i.e., a half-life of 4 mo). We use the calibrated within-host model to characterize population-level overdispersion in the risk of relapse, and assess the potential utility of a serological test for radical cure in low transmission settings. We show that mefloquine treatment of falciparum malaria eliminates early vivax relapses; and that there are substantially more P. vivax recurrences than expected under the model following artesunate monotherapy treatment for falciparum malaria. These results suggest that hypnozoites can be activated by symptomatic malarial illness.",

Epidemiological studies have reported potential carcinogenic risks of PFAS based on their widespread occurrence and population exposure. In this study, we observed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a common PFAS, functions as a mechanical regulator in lung cancer cells. PFOA exposure reduces cell stiffness, thereby decreasing cell adhesion and enhancing immune evasion, ultimately exacerbating tumor metastasis. In various lung cancer models, more aggressive tumor metastases have been observed in the PFOA exposure group. Additionally, serum PFOA levels in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those in patients with early-stage disease. Mechanistically, the interaction between PFOA and transmembrane integrins in cancer cells triggers changes in cellular mechanical properties, leading to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and activation of the intracellular FAK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma, PFOA can increase the risk of cancer metastasis even at daily exposure levels.",

          "abstract": "Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to understand why defense chemistry in individual plants is so diverse. A major challenge has been teasing apart the importance of concentration vs. composition of defense compounds and resolving the mechanisms of diversity effects that determine plant resistance against herbivores. Accordingly, we first outline nonexclusive mechanisms by which phytochemical diversity may increase toxicity of a mixture compared to the average effect of each compound alone. We then leveraged independent in vitro, in vivo transgenic, and organismal experiments to test the effect of equimolar concentrations of purified milkweed toxins in isolation vs. mixtures on the specialist and sequestering monarch butterfly. We show that cardenolide toxin mixtures from milkweed plants enhance resistance against this herbivore compared to equal concentrations of single compounds. In mixtures, highly potent toxins dominated the inhibition of the monarch’s target enzyme (Na + /K + -ATPase) in vitro, revealing toxin-specific affinity for the adapted enzyme in the absence of other physiological adaptations of the monarch. Mixtures also caused increased mortality in CRISPR-edited adult Drosophila melanogaster with the monarch enzyme in vivo, whereas wild-type flies showed lower survival regardless of mixture type. Finally, although experimentally administered mixtures were not more toxic to monarch caterpillars than single compounds overall, increasing caterpillar sequestration from mixtures resulted in an increasing burden for growth compared to single compounds. Phytochemical diversity likely provides an economical plant defense by acting on multiple aspects of herbivore physiology and may be particularly effective against sequestering specialist herbivores.",

          "abstract": "Pannexin 1 (Panx1) constitutes a large pore channel responsible for the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from apoptotic cells. Strong evidence indicates that caspase-mediated cleavage of the C-terminus promotes the opening of the Panx1 channel by unplugging the pore. However, this simple pore-plugging mechanism alone cannot account for the observation that a Panx1 construct ending before the caspase cleavage site remains closed. Here, we show that a helical region located immediately before the caspase cleavage site, referred to as the “C-terminal activating domain (CAD)”, plays a pivotal role in facilitating Panx1 activation. Electrophysiology and mutagenesis studies uncovered that two conserved leucine residues within the CAD play a pivotal role. Cryoelectron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis of the construct ending before reaching the CAD demonstrated that the N terminus extends into an intracellular pocket. In contrast, the construct including the CAD revealed that this domain occupies the intracellular pocket, causing the N terminus to flip upward within the pore. Analysis of electrostatic free energy landscape in the closed conformation indicated that the intracellular side of the ion permeation pore may be occupied by anions like ATP, creating an electrostatic barrier for anions attempting to permeate the pore. When the N terminus flips up, it diminishes the positively charged surface, thereby reducing the drive to accumulate anions inside the pore. This dynamic change in the electrostatic landscape likely contributes to the selection of permeant ions. Collectively, these experiments put forth a mechanism in which C-terminal cleavage liberates the CAD, causing the repositioning of the N terminus to promote Panx1 channel opening.",

          "abstract": "The molecular basis of human brain evolution is a key piece in understanding the evolution of human-specific cognitive and behavioral traits. Comparative studies have suggested that human brain evolution was accompanied by accelerated changes of gene expression (referred to as “regulatory evolution”), especially those leading to an increase of gene products involved in energy production and metabolism. However, the signals of accelerated regulatory evolution were not always consistent across studies. One confounding factor is the diversity of distinctive cell types in the human brain. Here, we leveraged single-cell human and nonhuman primate transcriptomic data to investigate regulatory evolution at cell-type resolution. We relied on six well-established major cell types: excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. We found pervasive signatures of accelerated regulatory evolution in the human brains compared to the chimpanzee brains in the major six cell types, as well as across multiple neuronal subtypes. Moreover, regulatory evolution is highly cell type specific rather than shared between cell types and strongly associated with cellular-level epigenomic features. Evolutionarily differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibit greater cell-type specificity than other genes, suggesting their role in the functional specialization of individual cell types in the human brain. As we continue to unfold the cellular complexity of the brain, the actual scope of DEGs in the human brain appears to be much broader than previously estimated. Our study supports the acceleration of cell-type-specific functional programs as an important feature of human brain evolution.",

          "abstract": "Coral populations are being progressively thinned by climate change, which elevates the risk of reproductive failure from Allee effects during fertilization. Studies have shown that fertilization success improves during more intense and synchronized spawning, but the local dependence of fertilization on coral density remains unknown in wild populations. Here, we measure the fertilization success of individual colonies of the common table coral, Acropora hyacinthus in Palau, Micronesia. We find strong evidence of spatial Allee effects such that fertilization averaged 30% when colonies were in close proximity (&lt;0.5 m), but this declined rapidly to less than 10% at a separation of 10 m and virtually zero by 15 to 20 m. The distance of a nearest neighbor conspecific, gravid colony is a better predictor of observing Allee effects than local colony density measured at several alternative scales (2 to 10 m). Spawning synchrony increases when corals are in close proximity, which may reinforce Allee effects as reproductive colonies become further separated. Fertilization success declined nearly threefold on a second night of spawning with higher wind despite there being more intensive spawning of colonies, highlighting the potential importance of prevailing weather in driving the outcome of mass spawning events. Overall, we find that the local population of A. hyacinthus achieved 71% of its fertilization potential. Further studies of spatial patchiness in coral populations are needed to generalize the likelihood of Allee effects, how climate change impacts reproductive function on reefs, and opportunities for restoration to safeguard reproductive success by reconnecting depleted coral populations.",

          "abstract": "Fever confers significant survival benefits on endotherms by optimizing both innate and adaptive immunity. Ectotherms achieve thermoregulation using behavioral strategies, but existing evidence supports its enhancement effect on innate immunity only. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the coordination between fever and adaptive immunity was independently acquired by endotherms or instead represents a gradually evolved function common to vertebrates. In the present study, we reported that Nile tilapia developed behavioral fever to enhance the immune response against Edwardsiella piscicida infection. Behavioral fever lasted five days, and the immune potential was optimized at 4 to 6 d post infection, indicating a potential correlation between fever events and T cell immunity. Further investigation suggested that fever did not affect T cell activation or proliferation but improved the ability of T cells to produce IFN-γ and Granzyme B and enhanced cytotoxicity, thereby eliminating the infection more effectively. Notably, we identified an advantage conferred by fever during infection: alleviation of T cell apoptosis to maintain a considerable T cell pool. Mechanistically, fever induced the expression of HSP70, which in turn entered the nucleus and bound to and promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, thereby inhibiting the cleavage of caspase-8/caspase-3 and preventing T cell apoptosis. Our findings elucidate the detailed mechanism by which behavioral fever optimizes T cell immunity in a cold-blooded vertebrate and propose that integrating fever with adaptive immunity to gain survival advantages is an ancient strategy acquired before the emergence of tetrapod.",

          "abstract": "Camouflage is often considered a daytime phenomenon based on light and shade. Nocturnal camouflage can also occur, but its mechanistic basis remains unclear. Here, we analyze the conditions for background matching (BM) of avian predators against the night sky. Such concealment is achieved when the contrast between the predator and the sky is smaller than the contrast detection threshold of prey. This condition cannot be fulfilled under isotropic skies, as in fully overcast or moonless nights. However, on clear moonlit nights, the isotropy of the sky radiance is broken due to the presence of the Moon, and the conditions for BM can be met for a wide range of sky directions. This effect is mainly dependent on the altitude of the Moon above the horizon, rather than on Moon phase. We have modeled the feasibility of concealment through BM of a typically white barn owl ( Tyto alba ) when hunting rodents, based on its contrast against the moonlit sky. We considered the radiometric quantities of the sky, the ground, and the bird’s undersides. Our results show that a barn owl with highly reflecting underparts may approach a rodent from broad regions of the moonlit sky while keeping itself below the contrast detection threshold of the mouse M-cones and rods. S-cones, in turn, remain below their excitation threshold for most of the lunar cycle. Our results demonstrate that the white color of barn owls serves as camouflage tailored to the moonlit sky background, providing a mechanistic basis for understanding nocturnal camouflage.",

These chemicals may leach from plastics, resulting in widespread human exposure during everyday use. Two plastic-associated chemicals—bisphenol A (BPA) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)—and a class of chemicals—brominated flame retardants [polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)]—are credibly linked to adverse health and cognitive impacts. BPA exposures are associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, DEHP exposure with increased all-cause mortality among persons 55 to 64 y old, and prenatal PBDE exposures in mothers with IQ losses in their children. We estimate BPA, DEHP, and PBDE exposures in 38 countries containing one-third of the world’s population. We find that in 2015, 5.4 million cases of IHD and 346,000 cases of stroke were associated with BPA exposure; that DEHP exposures were linked to approximately 164,000 deaths among 55-to-64 y olds; and that 11.7 million IQ points were lost due to maternal PBDE exposure. We estimate the costs of these health impacts to be $1.5 trillion 2015 purchasing power parity dollars. If exposures to BPA and DEHP in the United States had been at 2015 levels since 2003, 515,000 fewer deaths would have been attributed to BPA and DEHP between 2003 and 2015.

Many imaging techniques exist for mapping the distribution of medical agent-carrying nanoparticles in tissues, but they cannot capture the three-dimensional context of tissues with single nanoparticle resolution. Here, we developed 3DEM-NPD, a three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D EM) machine learning strategy to image and map single nanoparticle distributions (NPD) in tissues. 3DEM-NPD provides unbiased visualization and quantification of individual nanoparticles within organs. We applied this technique to quantify nanoparticle transport through tumor blood vessel endothelial cells. We measured the cell diameter, surface area, and volume and found that traditional 2D EM cannot accurately measure these features. We used machine learning to locate over 550,000 nanoparticles in less than 3 h with an accuracy of over 82%. The 3DEM-NPD method allowed us to establish a metric to quantify nanoparticle transport at the single nanoparticle level and to quantify the morphological features of ~2,800 vesicles. We find that on average there are only 2.4 nanoparticles per vesicle with a theoretical maximum of 158 nanoparticles per vesicle (~66x increase). These surprising results suggest the need to increase vesicle encapsulation efficiency for improved transport and they provide a benchmark for increasing nanoparticle transport and delivery.

While in most cases such considerations are manifestly ingrained in the constituents, novel phenomenology can emerge when composite units associated with emergent symmetries dominate the behavior of the system. We study a generic class of active matter systems with nonreciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner–Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory—which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms—belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar nonreciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin–Wagner theorem.",

This behavior prompted design of decapeptide DP1 (DEHGTAVMLK) as a Mn 2+ ligand, and development of a highly potent Mn 2+ -antioxidant (MDP) containing [Pi] = 25 mM, and [DP1] = 3 mM, the ratio found in the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans , with [Mn 2+ ] = 1 mM. MDP is an exceptional antioxidant, both in vitro and in vivo, and has reinvigorated the development of radiation-inactivated whole-cell vaccines. This study investigates the nature of the active Mn 2+ complex in MDP. We measure the affinity of DP1 for the substitutionally labile Mn 2+ ion using isothermal-titration calorimetry (ITC) and use changes in the Mn 2+ solution EPR spectrum to determine affinities of Mn 2+ for DP1 and for Pi, and to monitor Mn 2+ ligation while titrated with the fixed Pi/DP1 ratio of MDP, 25/3, using ENDOR/ESEEM to characterize DP1 ligation to Mn 2+ . In parallel, 1 H NMR of DP1 was used to monitor binding interactions between Pi and DP1, and DP1 binding to the diamagnetic Ca 2+ . We report: i) DP1 forms an extremely weak, dynamic Mn 2+ complex (K a ≈ 40 M −1 ) ii) Mn 2+ binds Pi much more strongly (K a ≈ 390 M −1 ) as shown previously, but iii) DP1 and Pi jointly bind to Mn 2+ in MDP to form a ternary Mn 2+ (Pi) (DP1) complex with greater formation-constant than Pi alone (K a app ≈ 670 M −1 ).

In this study, we explored the photochemical reactivity of BBOA particles in multiphase S(IV) oxidation to sulfate. We found that sulfate formation in BBOA particles under light is predominantly driven by photosensitization involving the triplet excited states ( 3 BBOA * ) instead of iron, nitrate, and S(IV) photochemistry. Rates in BBOA particles are three orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the bulk solution, primarily due to the fast interfacial reactions. Our results highlight that the chemistry of 3 BBOA * in particles can greatly contribute to the formation of sulfate, as an example of the secondary pollutants. Photosensitization of BBOA will likely become increasingly crucial due to the intensified global wildfires.",

We conducted precise measurements of oxygen isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rocks. The absence of an isotopic difference between the Moon and Earth on the sub-ppm level, as well as the absence of isotope heterogeneity in Earth’s upper mantle and the Moon, is discussed in relation to published Moon formation scenarios and the collisional erosion of Theia’s silicate mantles prior to colliding with proto-Earth. The data provide valuable insights into the origin of volatiles in the Earth and Moon as they suggest that the water on the Earth may not have been delivered by the late veneer. The study also highlights the scientific value of samples returned by space missions, when compared to analyses of meteorite material, which may have interacted with terrestrial water.",

Whether these bursts emerge intrinsically or from an underlying rhythm is unknown. Here, we show a previously undescribed respiratory-driven oscillation in the human hippocampus that couples with cardinal sleep oscillations. Further, breathing promotes nesting of ripples in slow oscillations, together suggesting that respiration acts as an intrinsic rhythm to coordinate synchronization of sleep oscillations, providing a unique framework to characterize sleep-related respiratory and memory processes.",

Several missions are planned to conduct new in situ research on the lunar surface to directly observe and characterize lunar water. A comprehensive characterization of the present forms of water, their abundance, spatial distribution, temporal variation, and possible origin is required to understand the lunar water cycle and the relevance of individual source and sink mechanisms and transformations between the involved volatile species. These processes extend over vastly different scales, and the governing parameters are often insufficiently constrained by experimental and observational data.

          "abstract": "The classical acid growth theory suggests that auxin stimulates cell expansion by triggering apoplast acidification via plasma membrane (PM)-localized H + -ATPase. Here, we reconstructed the origin and evolutionary history of auxin-mediated acid growth. Comparative phylogenomic analysis showed that most core components of acid growth originated in Charophyta and then underwent subclass expansion and functional innovation during plant terrestrialization. In Charophyceae algae Chara braunii, we found that PM H + -ATPase has formed a core regulatory module with TMK and PP2C.D, which can be activated by photosynthesis-dependent phosphorylation through light rather than auxin. Despite the lack of canonical auxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB), auxin elicits significant internodal elongation and transcriptional reprogramming in C. braunii , implying the existence of an ancient auxin-mediated growth mechanism. We propose that the evolution of acid growth represents a neofunctional adaptation to terrestrial environments, in which PM H + -ATPase in carbon concentrating for photosynthesis was utilized to acidify apoplast for cell expansion, and the core components responsible for acid growth eventually established a regulatory network in land plants by connecting with the TIR1/AFB pathway.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair systems are essential to maintain genome integrity and stability. Some obligate endosymbionts that experience long-term symbiosis with the insect hosts, however, have lost their key components for DNA repair. It is largely unexplored how the bacterial endosymbionts cope with the increased demand for mismatch repairs under heat stresses. Here, we showed that ibpA, a small heat shock protein encoded by Buchnera aphidicola , directly interacted with the cytoskeletal actin to prevent its aggregation in bacteriocytes, thus reinforcing the stability of bacteriocytes. However, the succession of 11 adenines in the promoter of ibpA is extremely prone to mismatching error, e.g., a single adenine deletion, which impairs the induction of ibpA under heat stress. Coinfection with a facultative endosymbiont Serratia symbiotica remarkably reduced the mutagenesis rate in the Buchnera genome and potentially prevented a single adenine deletion in ibpA promoter, thereby alleviating the heat vulnerability of aphid bacteriocytes. Furthermore, Serratia encoded mutH, a conserved core protein of prokaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR), accessed to Buchnera cells, which complemented Buchnera mutL and mutS in constituting an active MMR. Our findings imply that a full complement of a prokaryotic MMR system assembled by two bacterial endosymbionts contributes significantly to the thermostability of aphid bacteriocytes in an ibpA-dependent manner, furnishing a distinct molecular link among tripartite symbioses in shaping resilience and adaptation of their insect hosts to occupy other ecological niches.",

          "abstract": "The current “consensus” order in which amino acids were added to the genetic code is based on potentially biased criteria, such as the absence of sulfur-containing amino acids from the Urey–Miller experiment which lacked sulfur. More broadly, abiotic abundance might not reflect biotic abundance in the organisms in which the genetic code evolved. Here, we instead identify which protein domains date to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and then infer the order of recruitment from deviations of their ancestrally reconstructed amino acid frequencies from the still-ancient post-LUCA controls. We find that smaller amino acids were added to the code earlier, with no additional predictive power in the previous consensus order. Metal-binding (cysteine and histidine) and sulfur-containing (cysteine and methionine) amino acids were added to the genetic code much earlier than previously thought. Methionine and histidine were added to the code earlier than expected from their molecular weights and glutamine later. Early methionine availability is compatible with inferred early use of S-adenosylmethionine and early histidine with its purine-like structure and the demand for metal binding. Even more ancient protein sequences—those that had already diversified into multiple distinct copies prior to LUCA—have significantly higher frequencies of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine) and lower frequencies of valine and glutamic acid than single-copy LUCA sequences. If at least some of these sequences predate the current code, then their distinct enrichment patterns provide hints about earlier, alternative genetic codes.",

Further, despite significant progress toward a nonhormonal male contraceptive targeting the protein encoded by one of these genes, epididymal peptidase inhibitor (EPPIN), and associations found between mutations in EPPIN and an increased risk of male infertility, neither EPPIN nor any closely related whey acidic protein four-disulfide core (WFDC) gene have been explored functionally. To clarify the involvement of WFDC genes in male fertility, we strategically used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice lacking 13, 10, 5, or 4 genes within the cluster and demonstrated that males with deletions of 13, 10, or 4 genes (Wfdc6a, Eppin, Wfdc8, and Wfdc6a) were sterile due to an arrest in spermatogenesis, preventing formation beyond round spermatids. In contrast, the five gene knockout (KO) males (lacking Wfdc16 , Wfdc9 , Wfdc10 , Wfdc11 , and Wfdc13 ), despite normal spermatogenesis and sperm counts, were infertile due to defects in sperm motility and increased sperm death. Similarly to our previously reported Spint3 single gene KO, Wfdc3 single KO mice were fertile with no obvious reproductive phenotype. Our KO mouse studies to explore the entire WFDC locus of closely related genes have clarified the functional requirements of WFDC locus genes in different aspects of male fertility. Our research has implications for improving clinical diagnoses of male infertility and identifying additional targets for nonhormonal male contraception.",

          "abstract": "Nearly every cell of the body contains a circadian clock mechanism that is synchronized with the light-entrained clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Desynchrony between the SCN and the external environment leads to metabolic dysfunction in shift workers. Similarly, mice with markedly shortened endogenous period due to the deletion of circadian REV-ERBα/β nuclear receptors in the SCN (SCN DKO) exhibit increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity (DIO) on a 24 h light:dark cycle while mice with REV-ERBs deleted in hepatocytes (HepDKO) display exacerbated hepatosteatosis in response to a high-fat diet. Here, we show that inducing deletion of hepatocyte REV-ERBs in SCN DKO mice (Hep-SCN DDKO) rescued the exacerbated DIO and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, without affecting the shortened behavioral period. These findings suggest that metabolic disturbances due to environmental desynchrony with the central clock are due to effects on peripheral clocks which can be mitigated by matching peripheral and central clock periods even in a desynchronous environment. Thus, maintaining synchrony within an organism, rather than between endogenous and exogenous clocks, may be a viable target for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with circadian disruption.",

The synthetic agonist BTB09089 (BTB) recapitulated many proton-induced signaling events and demonstrated selectivity for GPR65. BTB was used to show that GPR65 activation on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), cells that line synovial joints, results in the secretion of proinflammatory mediators capable of recruiting immune cells and sensitizing sensory neurons. Intra-articular injection of BTB resulted in GPR65-dependent sensitization of knee-innervating neurons and nocifensive behaviors in mice. Stimulation of GPR65 on human FLS also triggered the release of inflammatory mediators and synovial fluid samples from human osteoarthritis patients were shown to activate GPR65. These results suggest a role of GPR65 in mediating cell–cell interactions that drive inflammatory joint pain in both mice and humans.",

          "abstract": "For human infants, producing recognizable speech is more than a cognitive process. It is a motor skill that requires infants to learn to coordinate multiple muscles of varying functions across their body. This coordination is directly linked to ongoing fluctuations in heart rate; a physiological process that can scaffold behavior. We investigated whether ongoing fluctuations in heart rate coincide with vocal production and word formation in 24-mo-old infants. Infants were most likely to produce a vocalization when heart rate fluctuations reached a peak (local maximum) or trough (local minimum). Vocalizations produced at the peak were longer than expected by chance. Functionally, vocalizations produced just before the trough, while heart rate is decelerating, were more likely to be recognized as a word by naive listeners. Thus, for the developing infant, heart rate fluctuations align with the timing of vocal productions and are associated with their duration and the likelihood of producing recognizable speech. Our results have broad and immediate implications for understanding normative language development, the evolutionary basis and physiological process of vocal production, and potential early indicators of speech and communication disorders.",

This has rarely been examined, however, due to depth measurement resolution issues at the surface. Here, we present evidence for the use of this strategy in the wild to the nearest centimeter and document the switch to shallow swimming during naturally occurring long-distance migrations. Using high-resolution depth-accelerometry and video data for little penguins ( Eudyptula minor ) and loggerhead turtles ( Caretta caretta ), satellite-relayed data for green turtles ( Chelonia mydas ), and literature data for further sea turtle, penguin, and whale species, we show that near-surface swimming is likely used broadly across nonforaging diving animals to minimize the cost of transport.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster , successful development relies on the precise coordination of both spatial and temporal regulatory axes. The temporal axis governs stage-specific identity and developmental transitions through a number of genes, collectively forming the Metamorphic Gene Network . Among these, Ecdysone inducible protein 93F (E93) serves as the critical determinant for adult specification, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found that, rather than acting mainly as an instructive signal, E93 promotes adult differentiation through the repression of the pupal specifier broad ( br ). In the absence of E93, sustained high levels of Br during the pupal stage strongly represses pupal-specific enhancers that are essential for the terminal differentiation of the wing. Notably, RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the majority of E93-dependent transcriptomic changes in pupal wings are primarily driven by br repression. In addition, we also show that Br represses the pupal-enhancers during the larval and prepupal stages preventing the premature implementation of the adult genetic program, and that it also dampens the activity of larval enhancers during the latter stages of larval development. This mechanism of action seems to be a derived feature acquired in Diptera, as in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum , repression of br by E93 is not sufficient to allow adult differentiation. In summary, our study elucidates the crucial role of the intricate interplay between E93 and Br as the governing mechanism in the process of terminal differentiation in Drosophila . This finding holds significant implications for advancing our understanding of the evolution of insect metamorphosis.",

While terpene synthases derived from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase have been shown to catalyze terpenoid biosynthesis in some insects, canonical terpene synthases (TPS) commonly found in plants, fungi, and bacteria were previously unidentified in insects. This study reveals the presence of TPS genes in insects, likely originating via horizontal gene transfer from noninsect arthropods. By examining 361 insect genomes, we identified TPS genes in five species of the Sciaridae family (fungus gnats). Additionally, TPS genes were found in Collembola (springtails) and Acariformes (mites) among diverse noninsect arthropods. Selected TPS enzymes from Sciaridae, Collembola, and Acariformes display monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and/or diterpene synthase activities. Through comprehensive protein database search and phylogenetic analysis, the TPS genes in Sciaridae were found to be most closely related to those in Acariformes, suggesting transfer of TPS genes from Acariformes to Sciaridae. In the model Sciaridae Bradysia coprophila , all five TPS genes are most highly expressed in adult males, suggesting a sex- and developmental stage-specific role of their terpenoid products. The finding of TPS genes in insects and their possible evolutionary origin through intraphylum gene transfer within arthropods sheds light on metabolic innovation in insects.",

          "abstract": "In muscle, titin proteins connect myofilaments together and are thought to be critical for contraction, especially during residual force enhancement (RFE) when steady-state force is elevated after an active stretch. We investigated titin’s function during contraction using small-angle X-ray diffraction to track structural changes before and after 50% titin cleavage and in the RFE-deficient, mdm titin mutant. We report that the RFE state is structurally distinct from pure isometric contractions, with increased thick filament strain and decreased lattice spacing, most likely caused by elevated titin-based forces. Furthermore, no RFE structural state was detected in mdm muscle. We posit that decreased lattice spacing, increased thick filament stiffness, and increased non-cross-bridge forces are the major contributors to RFE. We conclude that titin directly contributes to RFE.",

          "abstract": "Numerous missions to the Moon have identified and documented volatile deposits associated with permanently shadowed regions. A series of science goals for the Artemis Program is to explore these volatile deposits and return samples to Earth. Volatiles in these reservoirs may consist of a variety of species whose stable isotope characteristics could elucidate both their sources and the processes instrumental in their formation. For example, the δD of potential contributors to the deposits can be used to identify a uniquely light solar wind component. Because of the exceptionally low temperatures of these volatile deposits, examining and interpreting their stable isotope systems to fulfill Artemis science goals through sampling, preserving, curating, and analyzing these samples are far more difficult than for other sample return missions. Collecting and preserving the samples at cryogenic temperatures dramatically increases science yield but is technologically demanding and poses increased risk during transport.",

          "abstract": "Seaweed farming comprises over half of global coastal and marine aquaculture production by mass; however, the future of the industry is increasingly threatened by disease outbreaks. Nature-based solutions provided by enhancing functions of coinciding species or ecosystems offer an opportunity to increase yields by reducing disease outbreaks while conserving biodiversity. Seagrass ecosystems can reduce the abundance of marine bacterial pathogens, although it remains unknown whether this service can extend to reducing disease risk in a marine resource. Using a meta-analysis of articles published over the past 40 y, we find that 17 known diseases of seaweeds are attributed to bacteria that have been previously shown to be lower when associated with seagrass ecosystems. Next, we surveyed over 8,000 individual seaweeds among farms in Indonesia and found that disease risk is reduced by 75% when seaweeds are co-cultivated directly within seagrass ecosystems, compared to when seagrass ecosystems were removed. Finally, we estimate that farming seaweed with seagrass ecosystems could increase annual revenue by $292,470 – $1,015,990 USD per km 2 from yield loss due to disease reduction and that ~20.7 million km 2 in 107 countries and 34 territories have suitable environmental conditions for farming seaweeds with seagrass ecosystems. These results highlight the global utility for nature-based solutions as an ecologically and economically sustainable management strategy.",

Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.",

These operations include tasks demanding millisecond-level responses to prevent irreparable damage, such as quickly stabilizing a slipping package or halting a knife just before it cuts into a table. Although recent advances in intelligent robot control have considerably expanded—and will continue to expand—the range and complexity of tasks that robots can perform, AI, data, and control theory alone are not enough.

The joint NASA–CNES (Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales) Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission uses phase-coherent, wide-swath radar altimetry to measure ocean surface heights at high precision. We show that 1 year of SWOT data offers more detailed information than 30 years of satellite nadir altimetry in marine gravity, enabling the detection of intricate seafloor structures at 8-kilometer spatial resolution.

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares and, if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies &gt;10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun’s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.",

We found that river outlets were dominated by significant decreases in flow, whereas headwaters were 1.7 times more likely to have significantly increased flow than decreased. These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes). We revealed these changes using “detail at scale” by mapping millions of individual rivers. Widely adopting this approach could reveal other changes to the hydrosphere.",

This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature-genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses.

As a result, the total signal processing delay is dominated by the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay from the interconnects rather than the delay from the transistors’ switching speed. This bottleneck has spurred efforts both in academia and industry to explore alternative materials and disruptive device structures.

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant and phylogenetically diverse biological entities on Earth, yet the ecological mechanisms that sustain this extraordinary diversity remain unclear. In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions. We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain of Escherichia coli until the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host.",

          "abstract": "Severe lung injury causes airway basal stem cells to migrate and outcompete alveolar stem cells, resulting in dysplastic repair. We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.",

We generated a catalog of Neanderthal ancestry segments in more than 300 genomes spanning the past 50,000 years. We examined how Neanderthal ancestry is shared among individuals over time. Our analysis revealed that the vast majority of Neanderthal gene flow is attributable to a single, shared extended period of gene flow that occurred between 50,500 to 43,500 years ago, as evidenced by ancestry correlation, colocalization of Neanderthal segments across individuals, and divergence from the sequenced Neanderthals. Most natural selection—positive and negative—on Neanderthal variants occurred rapidly after the gene flow. Our findings provide new insights into how contact with Neanderthals shaped modern human origins and adaptation.",

It remains unknown whether adaptation can keep pace with warming and maintain reef functioning. We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet thermally sensitive coral taxon. We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.",

Coherent Raman scattering integrated with microfluidics enables high-throughput cell analysis, but faces challenges with small cells (&lt;3 μm) and tissue sections. Here, we report stimulated Raman-activated cell ejection (S-RACE) that enables high-throughput single-cell sorting by integrating stimulated Raman imaging, in situ image decomposition, and laser-induced cell ejection. S-RACE allows ejection of live bacteria or fungi guided by their Raman signatures. Furthermore, S-RACE successfully sorted lipid-rich Rhodotorula glutinis cells from a cell mixture with a throughput of ~13 cells per second, and the sorting results were confirmed by downstream quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Beyond single cells, S-RACE shows high compatibility with tissue sections. Incorporating a closed-loop feedback control circuit further enables real-time SRS imaging-identification-ejection. In summary, S-RACE opens exciting opportunities for diverse single-cell sorting applications.",

This review article is centered on the synthesis of functional oxide membranes, encompassing various approaches to their synthesis, exfoliation, and transfer techniques. First, we explore the characteristics of thin-film growth techniques with emphasis on molecular beam epitaxy. We then examine the fundamental principles and pivotal factors underlying three key approaches of creating membranes: (i) chemical lift-off, (ii) the two-dimensional layer–assisted lift-off, and (iii) spalling. We review the methods of exfoliation and transfer for each approach. Last, we provide an outlook into the future of oxide membranes, highlighting their applications and emerging properties.",

We found that Wnt7a is secreted long distance on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs) following muscle injury. We defined a signal peptide region in Wnts required for secretion on EVs, termed exosome-binding peptide (EBP). Addition of EBP to an unrelated protein directed secretion on EVs. Palmitoylation and the signal peptide were not required for Wnt7a-EV secretion. Coatomer was identified as the EV-binding protein for the EBP. Analysis of cocrystal structures, binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis found that a dilysine motif mediates EBP binding to coatomer with a conserved function across the Wnt family. We showed that EBP is required for Wnt7a bioactivity when expressed in vivo during regeneration. Overall, our study has elucidated the structural basis and singularity of Wnt secretion on EVs, alternatively to canonical secretion, opening avenues for innovative therapeutic targeting strategies and systemic protein delivery.",

          "abstract": "Label-free imaging through two-photon autofluorescence of NAD(P)H allows for nondestructive, high-resolution visualization of cellular activities in living systems. However, its application to thick tissues has been restricted by its limited penetration depth within 300 μm, largely due to light scattering. Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to more than 700 μm in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber-based, low repetition rate, high peak power, three-photon excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having more than 0.5 megawatts peak power at the band of 1100 ± 25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the eightfold increase in pulse energy enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a substantial advance for deep and dynamic imaging of intact living biosystems.

          "abstract": "Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate notable potential for developing advanced separation membranes, contemporary COF membranes still lack controlled stacking and highly efficient sieving. Here, Turing-architecture COF membranes were constructed by engineering a reaction-diffusion assembly process via heterogeneous nucleation synthesis with tannic acid (TA). TA covalently binds with amine monomers to form a composite precursor with increased reactivity and decreased diffusivity. This altered the pathway of Schiff base reactions with aldehyde monomers, fulfilling suitable reaction-diffusion conditions, and ultimately formed the labyrinthine stripe or spot-patterned Turing COF film with controlled stacking and uniform pore structure. This endows our COF membrane with highly efficient molecule sieving ability for organic solvent nanofiltration while exhibiting a flux that is 621% greater than that of commercial membranes. Thus, this study provides a paradigm for the in situ synthesis of highly efficient COF membranes for diversely sustainable separations.",

          "abstract": "High-entropy materials (HEMs) show inspiring structural and functional properties due to their multi-elemental compositions. However, most HEMs are burdened by cost-, energy-, and carbon-intensive extraction, synthesis, and manufacturing protocols. Recycling and reusing HEMs are challenging because their design relies on high fractions of expensive and limited-supply elements in massive solid solutions. Therefore, we review the basic sustainability aspects of HEMs. Solutions include using feedstock with lower carbon and energy footprints, sustainable primary synthesis routes from minerals, attenuation of the equimolar alloying rule, and a preference for scrap and dumped waste for secondary and tertiary synthesis. The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials. We also discuss thermodynamic and kinetic design strategies to reconcile good material properties with high impurity tolerance and variable compositions.",

Operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this technique eliminates the need for additional electricity or radiation, thereby substantially reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. In laboratory experiments, we further optimized the reaction conditions and scaled up the process. After 2 hours of spraying, the ammonia concentration increased to 270.2 ± 25.1 μM.

We produced viable CESA-deficient mutants of the moss Physcomitrium patens to investigate CSLD function without interfering CESA activity. Microscopy and spectroscopy showed that CESA-deficient mutants synthesize cellulose microfibrils that are indistinguishable from those in vascular plants. Correspondingly, freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed rosette-shaped particle assemblies in the plasma membrane that are indistinguishable from CESA-containing rosette cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs). Our data show that proteins other than CESAs, most likely CSLDs, produce cellulose microfibrils in P. patens protonemal filaments.

SMCs modulate DNA supercoiling but remains incompletely understood how this is achieved. Using a single-molecule magnetic tweezers assay that directly measures how much twist is induced by individual SMCs in each LE step, we demonstrate that all three SMC complexes induce the same large negative twist (i.e., linking number change Δ L k of ~−0.6 at each LE step) into the extruded loop, independent of step size and DNA tension. Using ATP hydrolysis mutants and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, we find that ATP binding is the twist-inducing event during the ATPase cycle, coinciding with the force-generating LE step. The fact that all three eukaryotic SMC proteins induce the same amount of twist indicates a common DNA-LE mechanism among these SMC complexes.",

Knowledge of the occurrence and behavior of natural hydrogen on Earth has been combined with information from geologic analogs to construct a mass balance model to predict the resource potential. Given the associated uncertainty, stochastic model results predict a wide range of values for the potential in-place hydrogen resource [10 3 to 10 10 million metric tons (Mt)] with the most probable value of ~5.6 × 10 6 Mt. Although most of this hydrogen is likely to be impractical to recover, a small fraction (e.g., 1 × 10 5 Mt) would supply the projected hydrogen needed to reach net-zero carbon emissions for ~200 years. This amount of hydrogen contains more energy (~1.4 × 10 16 MJ) than all proven natural gas reserves on Earth (~8.4 × 10 15 MJ).

We present a highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy method using semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) in a single round of staining and imaging. Pdots are small, bright, and photostable fluorescent probes with a wide range of tunable Stokes shifts (20 to 450 nanometers). Multiple series of Pdots with varying excitation wavelengths allow for fast (&lt;1 minute) and single-round imaging of up to 21 targets in the brain and kidney.

This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability. These data show that plasticity of the primary sensory organ enables learning of perceptual constancy.",

Haploinsufficiency of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly. However, whether MLL has a function at the centrosome is not clear. Here, we show that loss of the MLL/WDR5 complex affects microtubule nucleation and regrowth. MLL/WDR5 localize to the pericentriolar material and interact with centriolar satellite protein Cep72 and γ-tubulin ring complex proteins (γ-TuRCs). MLL/WDR5 promote the localization of γ-TuRCs and structural proteins like AKAP9 to the centrosome during interphase and mitosis, a phenotype also observed in cells derived from patients with WSS. During mitosis, loss of MLL, WDR5, and Cep72 affects spindle formation and leads to misaligned chromosomes. Last, we show that MLL and WDR5 recruit Cep72 to the centrosome.

Our study reveals neural zinc finger (Nzf2) as a crucial orchestrator that controls the timing of OL differentiation both during development and myelin repair, contrasting with its previously suggested role in direct myelin gene regulation. Nzf2 ablation delays the onset of OL differentiation, while hyperactivation stimulates OL differentiation both during development and remyelination. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we pinpoint Nkx2.2 as a critical downstream target of Nzf2. Specific binding of Nzf2 in the Nkx2.2 gene locus inhibits histone deacetylation by disrupting the HDAC1 repressor complex and reducing deacetylase activity. Furthermore, Nzf2 overrides the inhibitory Notch signaling to initiate OL differentiation. Thus, we propose that the Notch-Nzf2-Nkx2.2 axis is a vital component of OL differentiation timing mechanism, suggesting Nzf2 as a potential therapeutic target for stimulating OL differentiation and boosting myelin repair in demyelinating diseases.",

Here, we present a general mechanism where NPEPPS interacts with the volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) to control cisplatin import into cells and thus regulate cisplatin response across a range of cancer types. We also find the NPEPPS/VRAC gene expression ratio is a predictive measure of cisplatin response in multiple cancer cohorts, showing the broad applicability of this mechanism. Our work describes a specific mechanism of cisplatin resistance, which, given the characteristics of NPEPPS as a drug target, has the potential to improve cancer patient outcomes.

Light deprivation from birth elicits insulin hypersecretion, glucagon hyposecretion, lower gluconeogenesis, and reduced lipolysis by 6 to 8 weeks in male, but not female, mice. These metabolic defects are consistent with blunted sympathetic activity, and indeed, sympathetic responses to a cold stimulus are substantially attenuated in dark-reared mice. Further, long-term dark rearing leads to body weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Notably, metabolic dysfunction can be partially alleviated by 5 weeks exposure to a regular light-dark cycle.

          "abstract": "There is currently limited evidence regarding how the rotavirus vaccine dosing schedule might be adjusted to improve vaccine performance. We quantified the impact of the previously implemented 6/10-week Rotarix vaccine (RV1) in Ghana to the model-predicted impact for other vaccine dosing schedules across three hospitals and the entire country. Compared to no vaccination, the model-estimated median percentage reductions in rotavirus ranged from 28 to 85% and 12 to 71% among children &lt;1 and &lt;5 years old, respectively. The median predicted reductions in rotavirus for the whole country ranged from 57 to 66% among infants &lt;1 year and 35 to 45% among children &lt;5 years old. The 1/6/10- and 6/10/14-week schedules provided the best and comparable reductions in rotavirus compared to the original 6/10-week schedule. A third dose could prevent an additional 9 to 14% of deaths. An additional dose of RV1 might be an effective strategy to improve rotavirus vaccine impact, particularly in settings with low vaccine effectiveness.",

The electrodes used for these purposes often face challenges such as signal degradation due to biofouling and limited biocompatibility, which can lead to inaccurate readings and tissue damage over time. Conducting organic polymers are a promising alternative because of their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties, which better match the ones of biological systems. They also can be synthesized in vivo to form bio-templated structures through biologically compatible manufacturing processes. Here, we report a method to achieve conductive polymer structures anchored to cell membranes, creating an intimate interface between the polymer electrode and single cells. We show that the polymer is nontoxic to cells and does not interfere with its activation, thereby making this process an interesting alternative to existing materials and electrode techniques.",

These clusters have precisely controlled structures, decent charge carrier mobility, considerable solubility, suitable energy levels, and functional ligands, which can help passivate perovskite surface defects, form a uniform capping net to immobilize C 60 , and build a robust coupling between perovskite and C 60 . The target inverted PVSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% without the need for additional surface passivation. Crucially, the unencapsulated device displays excellent stability under light, heat, and bias, maintaining 98% of its initial PCE after 1500 hours of maximum power point tracking.

In this work, we present a trapping particle design to meet this challenge by creating small metamaterial elliptical cylinders with tunable trapping force and torque properties. The optical torque of these cylinders arises from their shape anisotropy, with their optical properties tuned via multilayered SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 deposition. We demonstrate that these cylinders can be rotated at about three times the rate of quartz cylinders without slippage while enhancing the torque measurement resolution during DNA torsional elasticity studies.

Here, we use high-resolution 3D seismic data to interpret the landforms and sediments of the central North Sea in unprecedented detail. In contrast to previous interpretations of multiple extensive early glaciations, our data suggest that grounded ice extended across the central North Sea only once, from western Norway, during the Early Pleistocene. This ice sheet advance, which probably occurred ~1.1 million years ago, deposited an up to 120-meter-thick layer of till across &gt;10,000 square kilometers of the central basin. During the rest of the Early Pleistocene, elliptical pockmarks and elongate contour-current furrows show that the central basin was instead scoured by along-slope currents. These findings constrain the extent of ice sheets before and during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and reconcile marine and terrestrial evidence for glaciation in northwest Europe.",

          "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is implicated in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. During I/R, elevated mitochondrial Ca 2+ triggers mPTP opening, leading to necrotic cell death. Although nonessential regulators of this pore are characterized, the molecular identity of the pore-forming component remains elusive. Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca 2+ -dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation. Together, these data indicate that the ANT family contributes to mPTP opening independently of CypD.",

Additionally, we directly observe 1 H NMR lines spanning 10 MHz.

Using two-dimensional NMR, we demonstrate polarization transfer from hypershifted to bulk nuclei across a spin diffusion barrier.

Leveraging the ultralow cross-plane thermal conductivity and strong temperature-dependent excitonic resonances of 2D-MHPs, we demonstrate ambient-temperature, all-optical detection of MIR light with sensitivity down to 1 nanowatt per square micrometer, using plastic substrates. Through the adoption of membrane-based structures and a photonic enhancement strategy unique to our all-optical detection modality, we further improved the sensitivity to sub–10 picowatt-per-square-micrometer levels.

A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter ABCC1 mediates MRTX849 resistance. Functional studies demonstrated that the transcription factor JUN drives ABCC1 expression, resulting in multidrug resistance. An unbiased drug screen identified the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib that potentiates MRTX849 efficacy by inhibiting SRC-dependent JUN activation, avoiding multidrug resistance and tumor suppression in vitro as well as in suitable preclinical mouse models and patient-derived organoids. SRC inhibitors (DGY-06-116, dasatinib, and bosutinib) also exhibit synergistic effects with MRTX849 in eliminating various tumor cell lines carrying KRAS-G12C mutations.

We demonstrate the utility of this formula in a broad range of crucial applications of SRS microscopy, including stimulated Raman enhancement factor (&gt;10 8 times), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of typical imaging experiments, population saturation under high power excitation, and energy deposition during stimulated Raman photothermal microscopy. In particular, the theory predicts that SRS microscopy is almost always more sensitive than spontaneous Raman microscopy for chemical imaging.",

Using the nano-aAPC platform, we expanded functional antigen-specific murine and human T RM -like CD8 + T cells ex vivo. We also developed an injectable macroporous hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel to deliver T RM -like cells. T RM -like cells delivered in the optimized HA hydrogel trigger robust local and systemic antitumor immunity and show synergistic effects with anti–PD-1 treatment.

As an archetypal Andean-type convergent margin, eastern Asia preserves voluminous magmas ideal for quantifying these processes and their impacts on climate. Here, we use Sr/Y and Ce/Y proxies to show that the crust experienced alternating thickening and thinning during the Late Mesozoic. We identify a noticeably thickened (50 to 55 kilometers) crust associated with tectonic shortening at 120 to 105 million years, corresponding to a &gt;2500-meter-high coastal mountain range. Using climate simulation with the Community Earth System Model, we demonstrate that the mountain uplift changed Asian atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, increased inland aridity (~15%), and prompted the eastward desert expansion, contributing substantially to the arid zonal belt across mid- to low-latitude Asia. These findings—compatible with independent geological, geophysical, and climatic observations—have global implications for broadening our understanding of Earth-system interactions in the Cretaceous greenhouse world.",

Under stress, it rearranges gene cassettes to offer an escape using the tyrosine recombinase IntI, recognizing folded DNA hairpins, the attC sites. Four recombinases and two attC sites form the synaptic complex. Yet, for unclear reasons, the recombination efficiency varies greatly. Here, we established an optical tweezers force spectroscopy assay to probe the synaptic complex stability and revealed, for seven combinations of attC sites, significant variability in the mechanical stability. We found a strong correlation between mechanical stability and recombination efficiency of attC sites in vivo, indicating a regulatory mechanism from the DNA structure to the macromolecular complex stability. Taking into account known forces during DNA metabolism, we propose that the variation of the integron in vivo recombination efficiency is mediated by the synaptic complex stability. We anticipate that further recombination processes are also affected by their corresponding mechanical stability.",

Using microendoscopic Ca 2+ imaging in freely moving mouse dams, we demonstrate highly correlated pulsatile activity among individual OT neurons during lactation. The number of OT neurons engaged in the pulsatile activity significantly increased, along with a broadening of individual waveforms in the mid-lactation stage. Notably, only ~10% of the imaged OT neurons exhibited a significantly elevated response during pup retrieval, a hallmark of maternal behaviors, with a magnitude smaller than that observed during lactation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of microendoscopic imaging for PVH OT neurons and highlight the flexible adjustments of their individual activity patterns in freely behaving mouse dams.",

In particular, p53 forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus of cells, which can bind to DNA and perform transcriptional activity. However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53. This work provides mechanistic insights into how the life cycle and DNA binding properties of p53 might be regulated by phase separation.",

To address these challenges, we present parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (PUV-PAM) with simultaneous scanning of eight optical foci to acquire histology-like images of slide-free fresh specimens, improving the ultraviolet PAM imaging speed limited by low laser repetition rates. The PUV-PAM has achieved an imaging speed of 0.4 square millimeters per second (i.e., 4.2 minutes per square centimeter) at 1.3-micrometer resolution using a 50-kilohertz laser. In addition, we demonstrated the PUV-PAM with eight needle-shaped beams for an extended depth of field, allowing fast imaging of slide-free tissues with irregular surfaces.

Subtomogram averaging resolved the S-layer hexamer tile at 6.4-angstrom resolution.

Our model captures a full spectrum of trophic modes, in which the optimal investments reflect zero-waste solutions (i.e., growth is colimited by carbon and nitrogen) and accurately reproduces experimental results. By fitting the model to data for Ochromonas , we were able to predict metabolic strategies at a global scale.

This study evaluated chimeric RdRps with PB1 genes from the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemic IAVs in a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus background to assess polymerase activity and pathogenicity. Substituting in the pandemic PB1 genes reduced polymerase activity, virulence, and altered lung pathology, while the native LPAI PB1 showed the highest pathogenicity and polymerase activity. The native LPAI PB1 virus caused severe pneumonia and high early viral RNA levels, correlating with elevated host cytokine signaling. Increased genetic distance from the LPAI PB1 sequence correlated with reduced polymerase activity, IFN-β expression, viral replication, and pathogenicity.",

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) splits water in oxygenic photosynthesis on Earth. The structure and function of the C 4 S 4 M 2 -type PSII-LHCII (light-harvesting complex II) megacomplexes from the wild-type and PsbR-deletion mutant plants are studied through electron microscopy (EM), structural mass spectrometry, and ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy [time-resolved fluorescence (TRF)]. The cryo-EM structure of a type I C 4 S 4 M 2 megacomplex demonstrates that the three domains of PsbR bind to the stromal side of D1, D2, and CP43; associate with the single transmembrane helix of the redox active Cyt b 559 ; and stabilize the luminal extrinsic PsbP, respectively. This megacomplex, with PsbR and PsbY centered around the narrow interface between two dimeric PSII cores, provides the supramolecular structural basis that regulates the plastoquinone occupancy in Q B site, excitation energy transfer, and oxygen evolution. PSII-LHCII megacomplexes (types I and II) and LHC aggregation levels in Arabidopsis psbR mutant were also interrogated and compared to wild-type plants through EM and picosecond TRF.",
