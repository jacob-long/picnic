          "abstract": "Animals must navigate changing environments to find food, shelter or mates. In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment 1–5 . However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity 6 . Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy; however, responses are typically short lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Components of the PI3K pathway represent plausible therapeutic targets; more than 70% of TNBCs have alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN3,4,5,6. However, in contrast to hormone-receptor-positive tumours, it is still unclear whether or how triple-negative disease will respond to PI3K pathway inhibitors7. Here we describe a promising AKT-inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once TNBCs are differentiated, these agents kill them by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Using a machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity. Together, these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumour type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumours from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural time scale plasticity (BTSP) is non-Hebbian plasticity induced by integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic components separated by a behaviourally relevant time scale (seconds) 1 . BTSP in hippocampal CA1 neurons underlies place cell formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable synapse-specific plasticity on a behavioural time scale are unknown. Here we show that BTSP can be induced in a single dendritic spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging paired with postsynaptic current injection temporally separated by a behavioural time scale. Using an improved Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sensor, we did not detect CaMKII activation during this BTSP induction. Instead, we observed dendritic, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activation (DDSC) associated with Ca 2+ influx and plateau potentials 10–100 s after BTSP induction. DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, which suggests that CaMKII can integrate these two signals. Also, optogenetically blocking CaMKII 15–30 s after the BTSP protocol inhibited synaptic potentiation, which indicated that DDSC is an essential mechanism of BTSP. IP 3 -dependent intracellular Ca 2+ release facilitated both DDSC and BTSP. Thus, our study suggests that non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation provides an instructive signal with an extensive time window over tens of seconds during BTSP.",

          "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks 1–5 . The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing instabilities 6–8 or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit 9–11 . It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star 8,11 , implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs 4,12 and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions 13,14 . TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies 15 . However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 h from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically selected TDE 16 . We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission from the accretion disk and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is a fundamental sensory modality that guides animal and human behaviour 1,2 . However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration.",

          "abstract": "Multivesicular bodies are key endosomal compartments implicated in cellular quality control through their degradation of membrane-bound cargo proteins 1–3 . The ATP-consuming ESCRT protein machinery mediates the capture and engulfment of membrane-bound cargo proteins through invagination and scission of multivesicular-body membranes to form intraluminal vesicles 4,5 . Here we report that the plant ESCRT component FREE1 6 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation. We use a minimal physical model, reconstitution experiments and in silico simulations to identify the dynamics of this process and describe intermediate morphologies of nascent intraluminal vesicles. Furthermore, we find that condensate-wetting-induced line tension forces and membrane asymmetries are sufficient to mediate scission of the membrane neck without the ESCRT protein machinery or ATP consumption. Genetic manipulation of the ESCRT pathway in several eukaryotes provides additional evidence for condensate-mediated membrane scission in vivo. We find that the interplay between condensate and machinery-mediated scission mechanisms is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance in plants. We propose that condensate-mediated scission represents a previously undescribed scission mechanism that depends on the physicomolecular properties of the condensate and is involved in a range of trafficking processes. More generally, FREE1 condensate-mediated membrane scission in multivesicular-body biogenesis highlights the fundamental role of wetting in intracellular dynamics and organization.",

          "abstract": "The rate of river migration affects the stability of Arctic infrastructure and communities1,2 and regulates the fluxes of carbon3,4, nutrients5 and sediment6,7 to the oceans. However, predicting how the pace of river migration will change in a warming Arctic8 has so far been stymied by conflicting observations about whether permafrost9 primarily acts to slow10,11 or accelerate12,13 river migration. Here we develop new computational methods that enable the detection of riverbank erosion at length scales 5–10 times smaller than the pixel size in satellite imagery, an innovation that unlocks the ability to quantify erosion at the sub-monthly timescales when rivers undergo their largest variations in water temperature and flow. We use these high-frequency observations to constrain the extent to which erosion is limited by the thermal condition of melting the pore ice that cements bank sediment14, a requirement that will disappear when permafrost thaws, versus the mechanical condition of having sufficient flow to transport the sediment comprising the riverbanks, a condition experienced by all rivers15. Analysis of high-resolution data from the Koyukuk River, Alaska, shows that the presence of permafrost reduces erosion rates by 47%. Using our observations, we calibrate and validate a numerical model that can be applied to diverse Arctic rivers. The model predicts that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers.",

          "abstract": "C–N bond formation is integral to modern chemical synthesis due to the ubiquity of nitrogen heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Alkene hydroamination with unactivated alkenes is an atom economical strategy for constructing these bonds. However, these reactions are challenging to render asymmetric when preparing fully substituted carbon stereocenters. Here, we report a photoenzymatic alkene hydroamination to prepare 2,2-disubstituted pyrrolidines by a Baeyer-Villiger Monooxygenase. Five rounds of protein engineering afforded a mutant, providing excellent product yield and stereoselectivity. Unlike related photochemical hydroaminations, which rely on the oxidation of the amine or alkene for C–N bond formation, this work exploits a through-space interaction of a reductively generated benzylic radical and the nitrogen lone pair. This antibonding interaction lowers the oxidation potential of the radical, enabling electron transfer to the flavin cofactor. Experiments indicate that the enzyme microenvironment is essential in enabling a novel C–N bond formation mechanism with no parallel in small molecule catalysis. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the substrate in the enzyme active site which further support this hypothesis. This work is a rare example of an emerging mechanism in non-natural biocatalysis, where an enzyme has access to a mechanism that its individual components do not. Our study showcases the potential of enhancing emergent mechanisms using protein engineering to provide unique mechanistic solutions to unanswered challenges in chemical synthesis.",

Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3,4,5,6,7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9,10,11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12,13,14,15,16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity—averaged over symmetric input states—through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger read-out. We also show repeated fast phase detection with non-destructive conditional reset of clock qubits and minimal dead time between repetitions by implementing ancilla-based quantum logic spectroscopy20 for neutral atoms. Finally, we extend this to multi-qubit parity checks and measurement-based, heralded, Bell-state preparation21,22,23,24.

          "abstract": "Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms’ outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.",

          "abstract": "Caloric restriction extends healthy lifespan in multiple species1. Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity9. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling—an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity.

          "abstract": "Ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) have emerged as indispensable tools in chemosensing applications1,2,3,4. ISFETs operate by converting changes in the composition of chemical solutions into electrical signals, making them ideal for environmental monitoring5,6, healthcare diagnostics7 and industrial process control8. Recent advancements in ISFET technology, including functionalized multiplexed arrays and advanced data analytics, have improved their performance9,10. Here we illustrate the advantages of incorporating machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models using the extensive datasets generated by ISFET sensors for both classification and quantification tasks. This integration also sheds new light on the working of ISFETs beyond what can be derived solely from human expertise. Furthermore, it mitigates practical challenges associated with cycle-to-cycle, sensor-to-sensor and chip-to-chip variations, paving the way for the broader adoption of ISFETs in commercial applications. Specifically, we use data generated by non-functionalized graphene-based ISFET arrays to train artificial neural networks that possess a remarkable ability to discern instances of food fraud, food spoilage and food safety concerns. We anticipate that the fusion of compact, energy-efficient and reusable graphene-based ISFET technology with robust machine learning algorithms holds the potential to revolutionize the detection of subtle chemical and environmental changes, offering swift, data-driven insights applicable across a wide spectrum of applications.",

          "abstract": "Ferroelectric structures have spontaneous macroscopic polarization that can be inverted using external electric fields and have potential applications including information storage, energy transduction, ultralow-power nanoelectronics1,2 and biomedical devices3. These functions would benefit from nanoscale control of ferroelectric structure, the ability to switch polarization with lower applied fields (low coercive field) and biocompatibility. Soft ferroelectrics based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)4,5,6 have a thermodynamically unstable ferroelectric phase in the homopolymer, complex semi-crystalline structures, and high coercive fields. Here we report on ferroelectric materials formed by water-soluble molecules containing only six VDF repeating units covalently conjugated to a tetrapeptide, with the propensity to assemble into the β-sheet structures that are ubiquitous in proteins. This led to the discovery of ribbon-shaped ferroelectric supramolecular assemblies that are thermodynamically stable with their long axes parallel to both the preferred hydrogen-bonding direction of β-sheets and the bistable polar axes of VDF hexamers. Relative to a commonly used ferroelectric copolymer, the biomolecular assemblies exhibit a coercive field that is two orders of magnitude lower, as the result of supramolecular dynamics, and a similar level of remnant polarization, despite having a peptide content of 49 wt%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature of the assemblies is about 40 °C higher than that of a copolymer containing a similar amount of VDF. This supramolecular system was created using a biologically inspired strategy that is attractive in terms of sustainability and that could lead to new functions for soft ferroelectrics.",

Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection7,8,9,10 with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing11,12 offers a promising route towards making use of highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and use a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schrödinger cat states of the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to nine optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit (SQL) using GHZ states of up to four qubits. However, because of their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared with unentangled atoms13. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval14,15,16,17. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.",

In the first few million years of a cluster’s life, massive stars are dynamically ejected and run away from the cluster at high speed2. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data3,4,5 reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We found that 23–33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions2,6,7 have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic media and their role in driving galactic outflows are far more important than previously thought8,9.",

This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy 2–5 . Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming 6,7 . To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales 8,9 . Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells 1–3 . In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely by the cytoplasmic exosome 4–9 , which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. 10–16 ). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear 7,17,18 . Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome–ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex.",

          "abstract": "For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with CTLA4 inhibitors and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (hereafter, PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is associated with higher rates of anti-tumour activity and immune-related toxicities, when compared with treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors alone. However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from dual ICB1,2. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial3. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy—a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4+ effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4+ effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that—together with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells—contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations.",

          "abstract": "Mate recognition systems evolve rapidly to reinforce the reproductive boundaries between species, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we leveraged the rapid coevolution of female pheromone production and male pheromone perception in Drosophila1,2 to gain insight into how the architecture of mate recognition circuits facilitates their diversification. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition3. We show that Drosophila yakuba males evolved the ability to use a sexually monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene, as an excitatory cue to promote courtship. By comparing key nodes in the pheromone circuits across multiple Drosophila species, we reveal that this sensory innovation arises from coordinated peripheral and central circuit adaptations: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-tricosene and, in turn, selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain to trigger courtship. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition strategies across species.",

In this study, we investigated the evolution of genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic processes and their interplay with complex structural variants (SVs). We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumours from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary dynamics of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas chemotherapy induces mutational bursts of hundreds of late subclonal mutations. Using a genome graph computational tool2, we observed frequent high copy-number circular amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)-forming SVs. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3-induced and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA-forming SVs, gaining new insights into the timing of these mutagenic processes relative to ecDNA biogenesis. We discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA-forming SVs. ecDNA-forming SVs persisted and increased in complexity, incorporating additional DNA segments and contributing to the evolution of treatment resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read whole-genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly mapped out CCND1 ecDNA structure. Experimental modelling of CCND1 ecDNA confirmed its role as a driver of treatment resistance.

Salmon spawning migrations are archetypal of this process, carrying marine-derived materials to inland ecosystems where they stimulate local productivity but also enhance contaminant exposure5,6,7. Pacific salmon abundance and biomass are higher now than in the last century, reflecting substantial shifts in community structure8 that probably altered nutrient versus contaminant delivery. Here we combined nutrient and contaminant concentrations with 40 years of annual Pacific salmon returns to quantify how changes in community structure influenced marine to freshwater inputs to western North America. Salmon transported tonnes of nutrients and kilograms of contaminants to freshwaters annually. Higher salmon returns (1976–2015) increased salmon-derived nutrient and contaminant inputs by 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases were dominated by pink salmon, which are short-lived, feed lower in marine food webs than other salmon species, and had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios. As a result, the delivery of nutrients increased at a greater rate than the delivery of contaminants, and salmon inputs became more ecologically beneficial over time. Even still, contaminant loadings may represent exposure concerns for some salmon predators. The Pacific salmon example demonstrates how long-term environmental changes interact with nutrient and contaminant movement across large spatial scales and provides a model for exploring similar patterns with other migratory species9.",

Here we show that the leading region of plasmids, the first to enter recipient cells, is a hotspot for an extensive repertoire of anti-defence systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction, anti-SOS and other counter-defence proteins. We further identified in the leading region a prevalence of promoters known to allow expression from single-stranded DNA 6 , potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity during the early stages of plasmid establishment. We demonstrated experimentally the importance of anti-defence gene localization in the leading region for efficient conjugation. These results indicate that focusing on the leading region of plasmids could lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defence genes. Combined, our findings show a new facet of plasmid dissemination and provide theoretical foundations for developing efficient conjugative delivery systems for natural microbial communities.",

          "abstract": "Through their movements and migrations, many animals transport resources across ecosystem boundaries and thus fulfil crucial ecological roles by enabling flows of energy and nutrients to different communities1. These ‘subsidies’ can extend beyond the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus that all organisms need to grow, and include physiologically important organic molecules, such as omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA), which are increasingly appreciated as key limiting resources for a diversity of consumers2. However, migrating animals can transport contaminants in their bodies, too, through what has been referred to as the ‘dark side’ of resource subsidies3. Despite the awareness that animals can carry a range of both nutrients and contaminants, these transport roles are often studied separately. Writing in Nature, Brandt et al.4 explore spatial and temporal changes in the coupled nutrients and contaminants transported during Pacific salmon migrations to western North America between 1976 and 2015.",

The development of general methods that enable rapid synthesis of a broad range of compounds is therefore paramount. A common approach for expanding compound libraries is known as cross-coupling, in which pairs of molecular fragments are linked through the formation of a carbon–carbon bond1. Writing in Nature, Al Zubaydi et al.2 describe a general method for a type of cross-coupling that has proved particularly challenging: that between aliphatic molecular fragments, which are characterized by flexible 3D structures.

          "abstract": "Because the Arctic is among the fastest warming regions on Earth, scientists are making considerable efforts to measure and predict the resulting changes to its diverse landscapes. Rates of river migration — the lateral movement of river channels across floodplains — have been a principal focus, yet there is no scientific consensus even about whether Arctic river migration will increase or decrease with further warming. Writing in Nature, Geyman et al.1 report sub-monthly estimates of bank erosion along a 450-kilometre stretch of the Koyukuk River in Alaska. Importantly, they find that migration of this river is held in check by permafrost banks, which reduce riverbank erosion rates by 47%. The authors use these observations to generate a model that predicts how migration rates will change with rising Arctic temperatures as permafrost diminishes.",

Conventionally, this central question in neuroscience has been studied while recording activity from neurons in animals that have been trained to perform specific tasks in response to different stimuli, which provides only indirect measures of perception. Alternatively, experiments in humans, who can narrate their perceptual experiences, have typically been limited to indirect recording methods that report only bulk neural activity at low temporal or spatial resolution. This is changing with the increased prevalence of implanted ‘depth’ electrodes that can measure activity from deep inside the brain, and with rapid advances in technologies that enable recordings from large numbers of individual neurons. Together, this affords researchers the opportunity to study the activity of large populations of individual neurons in humans1,2 and to directly link neural activity to perception. In a study reported in Nature, Kehl et al.3 record odour-evoked neuronal activity from thousands of individual neurons in human volunteers, providing unprecedented insight into how odour information is processed in the brain.",

We examine whether this translates to promotion and tenure (P&T) decisions. Data from five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees. A double standard in how scholarly productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes being judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty. This relationship is amplified for faculty with intersectional backgrounds, especially URM women. The differential treatment of URM women was mitigated when external reviewers highlighted candidates’ scholarship more in their review letters. In sum, the results support the double standard hypothesis and provide evidence that different outcomes in P&T decision-making processes contribute to the sustained underrepresentation of URM faculty in tenured faculty positions.",

On the basis of 1.2 billion observations across five leading online review platforms and two lab studies (n = 1,172 and n = 1,165; US respondents fluent in English), we provide evidence for a consistent and systematic gender rating gap: women’s mean online review ratings are significantly more favourable than men’s. We suggest that although men and women, on average, generally do not differ in their ‘real’ attitudes, their ratings do differ when it comes to online reviews. Our lab studies revealed that such differences are due to gender differences in the propensity to share negative attitudes online, possibly due to women’s greater concern about social consequences. Our findings highlight the need for societal change to create conditions in which people, particularly women, feel comfortable publicly expressing genuine attitudes, especially in cases of dissatisfaction, without being concerned about the consequences.",

In our narrative summary and both pairwise and network meta-analyses, we identified anti-smoking campaigns, health warnings and tax increases as the most effective tobacco policies for promoting smoking cessation. Flavour bans and free/discounted nicotine replacement therapy also showed statistically significant positive effects on quit rates. The network meta-analysis results further indicated that smoking bans, anti-tobacco campaigns and tax increases effectively reduced smoking prevalence. In addition, flavour bans significantly reduced e-cigarette consumption. Both the narrative summary and the meta-analyses revealed that smoking bans, tax increases and anti-tobacco campaigns were associated with reductions in tobacco consumption and sales.

Here we show that children fact-check claims more and are better able to catch misinformation when they have been exposed to detectable inaccuracies. In two experiments (N = 122), 4–7-year-old children exposed to falsity (as opposed to all true information) sampled more evidence before verifying a test claim in a novel domain. Children’s evidentiary standards were graded: fact-checking increased with higher proportions of false statements heard during exposure. A simulation suggests that children’s behaviour is adaptive, because increased fact-checking in more dubious environments supports the discovery of potential misinformation. Importantly, children were least diligent at fact-checking a new claim when all prior information was true, suggesting that sanitizing children’s informational environments may inadvertently dampen their natural scepticism. Instead, these findings support the counterintuitive possibility that exposing children to some nonsense may scaffold vigilance towards more subtle misinformation in the future.",

          "abstract": "The long tradition of research on cooperation includes a well-established finding that individuals respond to the degree of conflict between self- and collective interests (that is, the relative benefits from cooperation) in providing public goods. Existing empirical evidence builds upon settings where participants make multiple decisions or strategically consider alternative scenarios. Here, we consider a decision setting where participants face a one-time (single-decision) setting. One-time cooperative encounters often occur in volunteering or donating to immediate needs for crisis relief. For these distinct and highly relevant settings, we report a lack of responsiveness to increases in cooperation benefits, thereby highlighting limits to our understanding of the determinants of one-time cooperation encounters. Across two studies, n = 2,232 individuals participate in treatments where we vary across participants the relative benefit from contributing to a public good (that is, the marginal per capita return, the MPCR). We examine decisions from alternative participant pools (UK general population vs. students), implementations varying the physical distance between participants (online vs. in the laboratory), and more complex decision settings considering group-to-group interactions including not only providers but also donors to public goods. Throughout, neither average contribution levels, nor the distribution of contributions are significantly affected by the increases in cooperation benefits. The mechanism behind these results can be explained by the close correlation between expectations of other’s cooperation and own cooperation, and the fact that these expectations do not increase with higher benefits from cooperation.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, many jurisdictions have moved toward legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide, alongside a near-universal increase in public acceptance of medical aid in dying. Here, we draw on a comprehensive quantitative review of current laws on assisted dying, experimental survey evidence, and four decades of time-series data to explore the relationship between these legislative transitions and change in moral attitudes. Our analyses reveal that existing laws on medical aid in dying impose a common set of eligibility restrictions, based on the patient’s age, decision-making capacity, prognosis, and the nature of their illness. Fulfillment of these eligibility criteria elevates public moral approval of physician-assisted death, equally in countries with (i.e., Spain) and without (i.e., the United Kingdom) assisted dying laws. Finally, historical records of public attitudes toward euthanasia across numerous countries uncovered anticipatory growth in moral approval leading up to legalization, but no accelerated growth thereafter. Taken together, our findings suggest that the enactment of medical aid in dying laws, and their specific provisions, crystallize patterns in moral intuition.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the historical perception and value of teacher personalities reveals key educational priorities and societal expectations. This study analyzes the evolution of teachers’ ascribed Big Five personality traits from 1800 to 2019, drawing on millions of English-language books. Word frequency analysis reveals that conscientiousness is the most frequently discussed trait, followed by agreeableness, openness, extraversion, and neuroticism. This pattern underscores society’s focus on whether teachers are responsible. Polarity analysis further indicates a higher prevalence of low neuroticism descriptors (e.g., patient and tolerant) in descriptions of teachers compared to the general population, reinforcing the perception of teachers as stable and dependable. The frequent use of terms like “moral”, “enthusiastic”, and “practical” in describing teachers highlights the positive portrayal of their personalities. However, since the mid-20th century, there has been a notable rise in negative descriptors related to openness (e.g., traditional and conventional), coupled with a decline in positive openness terms. This shift suggests an evolving view of teachers as less receptive to new ideas. These findings offer valuable insights into the historical portrayal and societal values attributed to teacher personalities.",

          "abstract": "One of the most dramatic changes occurring on our planet is the ever-increasing extensive use of artificial light at night, which drastically altered the environment to which nocturnal animals are adapted. Such light pollution has been identified as a driver in the dramatic insect decline of the past years. One nocturnal species group experiencing marked declines are moths, which play a key role in food webs and ecosystem services such as plant pollination. Moths can be easily monitored within the illuminated area of a streetlight, where they typically exhibit disoriented behavior. Yet, little is known about their behavior beyond the illuminated area. Harmonic radar tracking enabled us to close this knowledge gap. We found a significant change in flight behavior beyond the illuminated area of a streetlight. A detailed analysis of the recorded trajectories revealed a barrier effect of streetlights on lappet moths whenever the moon was not available as a natural celestial cue. Furthermore, streetlights increased the tortuosity of flights for both hawk moths and lappet moths. Surprisingly, we had to reject our fundamental hypothesis that most individuals would fly toward a streetlight. Instead, this was true for only 4% of the tested individuals, indicating that the impact of light pollution might be more severe than assumed to date. Our results provide experimental evidence for the fragmentation of landscapes by streetlights and demonstrate that light pollution affects movement patterns of moths beyond what was previously assumed, potentially affecting their reproductive success and hampering a vital ecosystem service.",

In the ADQ framework, a pixel/voxel-wise metric reflecting heterogeneous intertubule alignment was proposed with improved sensitivity over previous efforts and further incorporated with temporal features to map dynamic microtubule rearrangements. The ADQ framework was verified by assessing microtubule remodeling in drug-induced (de)polymerization, lysosome transport, and migration. Different remodeling patterns from two migration modes were successfully revealed by the ADQ framework, with a front–rear polarization for individual directed migration and a contact site–centered polarization for cell–cell interaction-induced migration in an immune response model. Meanwhile, these migration modes were found to have consistent orientation changes, which exhibited the potential of predicting migration trajectory.",

A critical aspect for understanding the mechanism for microbial mercury (Hg) methylation is the origin of the methyl group. However, the origin of methyl group in methanogen-mediated Hg methylation remains unclear. This study aims to identify the source of methyl group for MeHg synthesis in methanogens. Our study revealed that Hg methylation in Methanospirillum hungatei JF-1 is closely related to methanogenesis process, according to the results of proteomic study and substrate limitation study. Next, we proved that nearly all methyl group in MeHg derives from the Wolfe cycle in this species, rather than the previously demonstrated acetyl-coenzyme A pathway, based on the results of 13 C labeling study. We then proposed the Wolfe cycle–dependent Hg methylation mechanism in this species. Further genome analyses and 13 C labeling experiments indicated that the involvement of the Wolfe cycle in Hg methylation is probably a universal feature among Hg-methylating methanogens. These findings reveal a unique Hg methylation mechanism in methanogens. Our study broadens the carbon substrates and controlling factors for MeHg synthesis in the environment, which can inform the prediction of MeHg production potential and remediation strategies for MeHg contamination.",

Here, we find that planktonic bacteria can transcriptionally respond to flow, inducing expression changes that are beneficial in flow. Specifically, we use microfluidic experiments and quantitative modeling to show that in the presence of flow, planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa induce shear rate–dependent genes that promote growth in low-oxygen environments. Untangling this mechanism revealed that in flow, motile P. aeruginosa spatially redistribute, leading to cell density changes that activate quorum sensing, which in turn enhances the oxygen uptake rate. In diffusion-limited environments, including those commonly encountered by bacteria, flow-induced cell density gradients also independently generate oxygen gradients that alter gene expression. Mutants deficient in this flow-responsive mechanism exhibit decreased fitness in flow, suggesting that this dynamic coupling of biological and mechanical processes can be physiologically significant.",

MicroRNA-124-3p also has a role in cell adhesion, a key function during receptivity to allow blastocysts to adhere and implant. In this study, we aimed to determine the function of microRNA-124-3p on endometrial epithelial adhesive capacity during receptivity and effect on embryo implantation. Using a unique inducible, uterine epithelial-specific microRNA overexpression mouse model, we demonstrated that elevated uterine epithelial microRNA-124-3p impaired endometrial receptivity by altering genes associated with cell adhesion and polarity. This resulted in embryo implantation failure. Similarly in a second mouse model, increasing microRNA-124-3p expression only in mouse uterine surface (luminal) epithelium impaired receptivity and led to implantation failure. In humans, we demonstrated that microRNA-124-3p was abnormally increased in the endometrial epithelium of women with unexplained infertility during the receptive window. MicroRNA-124-3p overexpression in primary human endometrial epithelial cells (HEECs) impaired primary human embryo trophectoderm attachment in a 3-dimensional culture model of endometrium. Reduction of microRNA-124-3p in HEECs from infertile women normalized HEEC adhesive capacity. Overexpression of microRNA-124-3p or knockdown of its direct target IQGAP1 reduced fertile HEEC adhesion and its ability to lose polarity. Collectively, our data highlight that microRNA-124-3p and its protein targets contribute to endometrial receptivity by altering cell polarity and adhesion.",

Nevertheless, the behavior of these events worldwide and their responses to climatic warming are underexplored. Here, we show a global escalation in the frequency, duration, peak intensity, and severity of SCDHWs, as well as an increase in affected land area, from 1980 to 2023. The increasing trends, which are particularly prominent since the early 2000 s, and projected to persist throughout this century, are dominated by summertime SCDHWs and enhanced by El Niño. Intensive soil warming as well as climatologically lower soil temperatures compared to air temperatures lead to localized hotspots of escalating SCDHW severity in northern high latitudes, while prolonged duration causes such hotspots in northern South America. Transformation of natural ecosystems, particularly forests and wetlands, to cropland as well as forest degradation substantially enhance the strength of SCDHWs. Global SCDHWs consistently exhibit higher frequencies, longer durations, greater severities, and faster growth rates than CDHWs in all aspects from 1980 to 2023. They are undergoing a critical transition, with droughts replacing heatwaves as the primary constraint. We emphasize the significant intensification of SCDHWs in northern high latitudes as well as the prolonged duration of SCDHWs in the Southern Hemisphere, posing an underrated threat to achieving carbon neutrality and food security goals.",

          "abstract": "A central question for neuroscience is how to characterize brain representations of perceptual and cognitive content. An ideal characterization should distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise and idiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computational differences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by their representational geometry, which is defined by the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the roles of individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes the discriminability of stimuli. Here, we explore a further step of abstraction: from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We propose topological representational similarity analysis, an extension of representational similarity analysis that uses a family of geotopological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize the topology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this family of statistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selection using both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data. In the simulations, the ground truth is a data-generating layer representation in a neural network model and the models are the same and other layers in different model instances (trained from different random seeds). In fMRI, the ground truth is a visual area and the models are the same and other areas measured in different subjects. Results show that topology-sensitive characterizations of population codes are robust to noise and interindividual variability and maintain excellent sensitivity to the unique representational signatures of different neural network layers and brain regions.",

          "abstract": "In the first live-bearing mammals, pregnancy was likely short and ended with a brief period of inflammatory maternal–fetal interaction. This mode of reproduction has been retained in many marsupials. While inflammation is key to successful implantation in eutherians, a key innovation in eutherians is the ability to switch off this inflammation after it has been initiated. This extended period, in which inflammation is suppressed, likely allowed for an extended period of placentation. Extended placentation has evolved independently in one lineage of marsupials, the macropodids (wallabies and kangaroos), with placentation lasting beyond the 2 to 4 d seen in other marsupial taxa, which allows us to investigate the role of inflammation response after attachment in the extension of placentation in mammals. By comparing gene expression changes at attachment in three marsupial species, the tammar wallaby, opossum, and fat-tailed dunnart, we show that inflammatory attachment is an ancestral feature of marsupial implantation. In contrast to eutherians, where attachment-related (quasi-) inflammatory reaction is even involved in epitheliochorial placentation (e.g., pig), this study found no evidence of a distinct attachment-related reaction in wallabies. Instead, only a small number of inflammatory genes are expressed at distinct points of gestation, including IL6 before attachment, LIF throughout placentation, and prostaglandins before birth. During parturition, a more distinct inflammatory reaction is detectable, likely involved in precipitating the parturition cascade similar to eutherians. We suggest that in wallaby, extended gestation became possible by avoiding an inflammatory attachment reaction, which is a different strategy than seen in eutherians.",

          "abstract": "Copper homeostasis mechanisms are critical for bacterial resistance to copper-induced stress. The Escherichia coli multicopper oxidase copper efflux oxidase (CueO) is part of the copper detoxification system in aerobic conditions. CueO contains a methionine-rich (Met-rich) domain believed to interact with copper, but its exact function and the importance of related copper-binding sites remain unclear. This study investigates these open questions by employing a multimodal and multiscale approach. Through the design of various E. coli CueO (EcCueO) variants with altered copper-coordinating residues and domain deletions, we employ biological, biochemical, and physico-chemical approaches to unravel in vitro CueO catalytic properties and in vivo copper resistance. Strong correlation between the different methods enables evaluation of EcCueO variants’ activity as a function of Cu+ availability. Our findings demonstrate the Met-rich domain is not essential for cuprous oxidation, but it facilitates Cu+ recruitment from strongly chelated forms, acting as transient copper binding domain thanks to multiple methionines. They also indicate that the Cu6/7 copper-binding sites previously observed within the Met-rich domain play a negligible role. Meanwhile, Cu5, located at the interface with the Met-rich domain, emerges as the primary and sole substrate-binding active site for cuprous oxidation. The Cu5 coordination sphere strongly affects the enzyme activity and the in vivo copper resistance. This study provides insights into the nuanced role of CueO Met-rich domain, enabling the functions of copper-binding sites and the entire domain itself to be decoupled. This paves the way for a deeper understanding of Met-rich domains in the context of bacterial copper homeostasis.",

Microscopic structural signatures predicting these structural relaxations have been long searched for but have so far only been found in dynamic quantities such as vibrational quasi-localized soft modes or with structurally trained neural networks. A physically meaningful structural quantity remains elusive. Here, we introduce a structural order parameter derived from the mean-field caging potential experienced by the particles due to their neighbors, which reliably predicts the occurrence of structural relaxations. The structural parameter, derived from density functional theory, provides a measure of susceptibility to particle rearrangements that can effectively identify weak or defect-like regions in disordered systems. Using experiments on dense colloidal suspensions, we demonstrate a strong correlation between this order parameter and the structural relaxations of the amorphous solid. In quiescent suspensions, this correlation increases with density, when particle rearrangements become rarer and more localized. In sheared suspensions, the order parameter reliably pinpoints shear transformations; the applied shear weakens the caging potential due to shear-induced structural distortions, causing the proliferation of plastic deformation at structurally weak regions. Our work paves the way to a structural understanding of the relaxation of a wide range of amorphous solids, from suspensions to metallic glasses.",

Several studies have shown that such scaling laws hold also for natural ecosystems, including individual trees and forests, riverine metabolism, and river network organization. However, the derivation of scaling laws for catchment-scale water and carbon fluxes has not been achieved so far. Here, we focus on scaling relations of catchment green metabolism, defined as the set of ecohydrological and biogeochemical processes through which vegetation assemblages in catchments maintain their structure and react to the surrounding environment. By revising existing plant size–density relationships and integrating them across large-scale domains, we show that the ecohydrological fluxes occurring at the catchment scale are invariant with respect to the above-ground vegetation biomass per unit area of the basin, while they scale linearly with catchment size. We thus demonstrate that the sublinear scaling of plant metabolism results in an isometric scaling at catchment and regional scales. Deviations from such predictions are further shown to collapse onto a common distribution, thus incorporating natural fluctuations due to resource limitations into a generalized scaling theory. Results from scaling arguments are supported by hyperresolution ecohydrological simulations and remote sensing observations.",

          "abstract": "Tumor-targeted therapies have often been inefficient due to the lack of concomitant control over the tumor microenvironment. Using an immunocompetent autologous breast cancer model, we investigated a MAtrix REgulating MOtif (MAREMO)-mimicking peptide, which inhibits the protumorigenic extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule tenascin-C that activates several cancer hallmarks. In cultured cells, targeting the MAREMO blocks tenascin-C signaling involved in cell adhesion and immune-suppression by inhibiting tenascin-C interactions with fibronectin, TGFβ, CXCL12, and others, thereby blocking downstream events. Using RNASequencing and various genetic, molecular, in situ, and in vivo assays, we demonstrate that the MAREMO peptide similarly blocks multiple tenascin-C functions in vivo. This includes releasing tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, including CD8+ T cells, from the stroma. The MAREMO peptide also triggers interferon signaling, restoring antitumor immunity, contributing to tumor growth inhibition and reduced dissemination. The MAREMO peptide targets tumor cells directly by promoting growth suppression and inhibiting phenotypic plasticity, subsequently enhancing responsiveness to the endogenous death inducer tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, as shown by a loss-of-function approach. Moreover, the MAREMO peptide largely subdues the tumor bed by depleting fibroblasts, repressing tenascin-C and other ECM molecules, and restoring the function of the few remaining blood vessels. In conclusion, targeting tenascin-C with a MAREMO peptide represents a powerful anticancer strategy with a broad inhibition of several cancer hallmarks.",

Auxin, together with local PIFs and their positive regulator CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), promotes hypocotyl growth to facilitate access to light. Whether shade alters the cellular redox status thereby affecting growth responses, remains unexplored. Here, we show that, under shade, high auxin levels increased reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide accumulation in the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis. This nitroxidative environment favored the promotion of hypocotyl growth by COP1 under shade. We demonstrate that COP1 is S-nitrosylated, particularly under shade. Impairing this redox regulation enhanced COP1 degradation by the proteasome and diminished the capacity of COP1 to interact with target proteins and to promote hypocotyl growth. Disabling this regulation also generated transversal asymmetries in hypocotyl growth, indicating poor coordination among different cells, which resulted in random hypocotyl bending and predictably low ability to compete with neighbors. These findings highlight the significance of redox signaling in the control of diffuse growth during shade avoidance.",

Relationships between CINs, dopamine, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In the dorsal–lateral striatum, a Go! cue evoked burst–pause CIN spiking, followed by a brief dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In the dorsal–medial striatum, this cue evoked only a CIN pause, that was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally, in the ventral striatum, a reward cue evoked RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without a consistent pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals and will inform future models of striatal information processing under both normal and pathological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is a protective response to pathogens and injury. To be effective it needs to be resolved by endogenous mechanisms in order to avoid prolonged and excessive inflammation, which can become chronic. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are a group of lipids derived from omega-3 fatty acids, which can induce the resolution of inflammation. How SPMs exert their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects is, however, not clear. Here, we show that SPMs such as protectins, maresins, and D-series resolvins function as biased positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 through an intracellular binding site. They increase PGE 2 -induced G s -mediated formation of cAMP and thereby promote anti-inflammatory signaling of EP4. In addition, SPMs endow the endogenous EP4 receptor on macrophages with the ability to couple to G i -type G-proteins, which converts the EP4 receptor on macrophages from an anti-phagocytotic receptor to one increasing phagocytosis, a central mechanism of the pro-resolving activity of synthetic SPMs. In the absence of the EP4 receptor, SPMs lose their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal an unusual mechanism of allosteric receptor modulation by lipids and provide a mechanism by which synthetic SPMs exert pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory effects, which may facilitate approaches to treat inflammation.",

          "abstract": "Systems consolidation is a common feature of learning and memory systems, in which a long-term memory initially stored in one brain region becomes persistently stored in another region. We studied the dynamics of systems consolidation in simple circuit architectures with two sites of plasticity, one in an early-learning and one in a late-learning brain area. We show that the synaptic dynamics of the circuit during consolidation of an analog memory can be understood as a temporal integration process, by which transient changes in activity driven by plasticity in the early-learning area are accumulated into persistent synaptic changes at the late-learning site. This simple principle naturally leads to a speed-accuracy tradeoff in systems consolidation and provides insight into how the circuit mitigates the stability-plasticity dilemma of storing new memories while preserving core features of older ones. Furthermore, it imposes two constraints on the circuit. First, the plasticity rule at the late-learning site must stably support a continuum of possible outputs for a given input. We show that this is readily achieved by heterosynaptic but not standard Hebbian rules. Second, to turn off the consolidation process and prevent erroneous changes at the late-learning site, neural activity in the early-learning area must be reset to its baseline activity. We provide two biologically plausible implementations for this reset that propose functional roles in stabilizing consolidation for core elements of the cerebellar circuit.",

          "abstract": "Predictive coding is a fundamental function of the cortex. The predictive routing model proposes a neurophysiological implementation for predictive coding. Predictions are fed back from the deep-layer cortex via alpha/beta (8 to 30 Hz) oscillations. They inhibit the gamma (40 to 100 Hz) and spiking that feed sensory inputs forward. Unpredicted inputs arrive in circuits unprepared by alpha/beta, resulting in enhanced gamma and spiking. To test the predictive routing model and its role in consciousness, we collected data from intracranial recordings of macaque monkeys during passive presentation of auditory oddballs before and after propofol-mediated loss of consciousness (LOC). In line with the predictive routing model, alpha/beta oscillations in the awake state served to inhibit the processing of predictable stimuli. Propofol-mediated LOC eliminated alpha/beta modulation by a predictable stimulus in the sensory cortex and alpha/beta coherence between sensory and frontal areas. As a result, oddball stimuli evoked enhanced gamma power, late period (&gt;200 ms from stimulus onset) spiking, and superficial layer sinks in the sensory cortex. LOC also resulted in diminished decodability of pattern-level prediction error signals in the higher-order cortex. Therefore, the auditory cortex was in a disinhibited state during propofol-mediated LOC. However, despite these enhanced feedforward responses in the auditory cortex, there was a loss of differential spiking to oddballs in the higher-order cortex. This may be a consequence of a loss of within-area and interareal spike-field coupling in the alpha/beta and gamma frequency bands. These results provide strong constraints for current theories of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "The disposable soma theory (DST) posits that organisms age and die because of a direct trade-off in resource allocation between reproduction and somatic maintenance. DST predicts that investments in reproduction accentuate somatic damage which increase senescence and shortens lifespan. Here, we directly tested DST predictions in breeding and nonbreeding female C57BL/6J mice. We measured reproductive outputs, body composition, daily energy expenditure, and oxidative stress at peak lactation and over lifetime. We found that reproduction had an immediate and negative effect on survival due to problems encountered during parturition for some females. However, there was no statistically significant residual effect on survival once breeding had ceased, indicating no trade-off with somatic maintenance. Instead, higher mortality appeared to be a direct consequence of reproduction without long-term physiological consequences. Reproduction did not elevate oxidative stress. Our findings do not provide support for the predictions of the DST.",

KSHV-GPCR shares a high similarity with CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and can be activated by selected chemokine ligands. Like other herpesvirus-encoded GPCRs, KSHV-GPCR is characterized by its constitutive activity by coupling to various G proteins. We investigated the structural basis of ligand-dependent and constitutive activation of KSHV-GPCR, obtaining high-resolution cryo-EM structures of KSHV-GPCR–Gi complexes with and without the bound CXCL1 chemokine. Analysis of the apo-KSHV-GPCR–Gi structure (2.81 Å) unraveled the involvement of extracellular loop 2 in constitutive activation of the receptor. In comparison, the CXCL1-bound KSHV-GPCR–Gi structure (3.01 Å) showed a two-site binding mode and provided detailed information of CXCL1 binding to a chemokine receptor. The dual activation mechanism employed by KSHV-GPCR represents an evolutionary adaptation for immune evasion and contributes to the pathogenesis of Kaposi’s sarcoma. Together with results from functional assays that confirmed the structural models, these findings may help to develop therapeutic strategies for KSHV infection.",

          "abstract": "Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins can enhance the speed and robustness of cell state transitions by controlling RNA stability, localization, or if, when, or where mRNAs are translated. The RNA helicase YTHDC2 is required to shut down components of the mitotic program to facilitate a proper switch from mitosis to meiosis in mouse germ cells. Here, we show that YTHDC2 has a second essential role in promoting meiotic progression in late spermatocytes. Inducing conditional knockout of Ythdc2 during the first wave of spermatogenesis, after initiation of meiotic prophase, allowed YTHDC2 -deficient germ cells to advance to the pachytene stage and properly express many meiotic markers. However, the YTHDC2 -deficient spermatocytes mis-expressed a number of genes, some up-regulated and some down-regulated, failed to transition to the diplotene stage, and then quickly died. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that YTHDC2 interacts with several RNA-binding proteins in early or late spermatocytes, with many of the interacting proteins, including MEIOC, localizing to granules, similar to YTHDC2. Our findings suggest that YTHDC2 collaborates with other RNA granule components to facilitate proper progression of germ cells through multiple steps of meiosis via mechanisms influencing posttranscriptional regulation of RNAs.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities emit ~2,000 Mg y −1 of the toxic pollutant mercury (Hg) into the atmosphere, leading to long-range transport and deposition to remote ecosystems. Global anthropogenic emission inventories report increases in Northern Hemispheric (NH) Hg emissions during the last three decades, in contradiction with the observed decline in atmospheric Hg concentrations at NH measurement stations. Many factors can obscure the link between anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric Hg concentrations, including trends in the reemissions of previously released anthropogenic (“legacy”) Hg, atmospheric sink variability, and spatial heterogeneity of monitoring data. Here, we assess the observed trends in gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0 ) in the NH and apply biogeochemical box modeling and chemical transport modeling to understand the trend drivers. Using linear mixed effects modeling of observational data from 51 stations, we find negative Hg 0 trends in most NH regions, with an overall trend for 2005 to 2020 of −0.011 ± 0.006 ng m −3 y −1 (±2 SD). In contrast to existing emission inventories, our modeling analysis suggests that annual NH anthropogenic emissions must have declined by at least 140 Mg between the years 2005 and 2020 to be consistent with observed trends. Faster declines in 95th percentile Hg 0 values than median values in Europe, North America, and East Asian measurement stations corroborate that the likely cause is a decline in nearby anthropogenic emissions rather than background legacy reemissions. Our results are relevant for evaluating the effectiveness of the Minamata Convention on Mercury, demonstrating that existing emission inventories are incompatible with the observed Hg 0 declines.",

          "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are structurally flexible protein segments with regulatory functions in multiple contexts, such as in the assembly of biomolecular condensates. Since IDRs undergo more rapid evolution than ordered regions, identifying homology of such poorly conserved regions remains challenging for state-of-the-art alignment-based methods that rely on position-specific conservation of residues. Thus, systematic functional annotation and evolutionary analysis of IDRs have been limited, despite them comprising ~21% of proteins. To accurately assess homology between unalignable sequences, we developed an alignment-free sequence comparison algorithm, SHARK (Similarity/Homology Assessment by Relating K-mers). We trained SHARK-dive, a machine learning homology classifier, which achieved superior performance to standard alignment-based approaches in assessing evolutionary homology in unalignable sequences. Furthermore, it correctly identified dissimilar but functionally analogous IDRs in IDR-replacement experiments reported in the literature, whereas alignment-based tools were incapable of detecting such functional relationships. SHARK-dive not only predicts functionally similar IDRs at a proteome-wide scale but also identifies cryptic sequence properties and motifs that drive remote homology and analogy, thereby providing interpretable and experimentally verifiable hypotheses of the sequence determinants that underlie such relationships. SHARK-dive acts as an alternative to alignment to facilitate systematic analysis and functional annotation of the unalignable protein universe.",

The first step in haustoriogenesis is the development of parasitically inactive protohaustoria. Here, we report that an endogenous peptide hormone, CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region 1 ( Pj CLE1), is sufficient to induce protohaustorium formation. Pj CLE1 hyperactivated HIF-responses and caused prolific protohaustoria formation. PjCLE1 expression and activation by the subtilisin-type protease Pj SBT1.2.3 occur in fully developed, mature haustoria, suggesting that Pj CLE1 acts as an internal signal produced by mature haustoria to stimulate additional protohaustorium formation for effective extraction of resources from hosts. Pj CLE1 is similar in sequence to CLEs regulating nodulation in legumes and part of a regulatory system for haustoria formation in parasitic plants.",

We employed cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to analyze filtered water samples collected from the Tsinghua Lotus Pond. Here, we report the structural determination and characterization of two highly similar helical fibrils, named TLP-1a and TLP-1b, each approximately 8 nm in diameter with a 15-Å wide tunnel. These fibrils are assembled from a similar protein protomer, whose structure was conveniently automodeled in CryoNet. The protomer structure does not match any available experimental structures, but shares the same fold as many predicted structures of unknown functions. The amino-terminal β strand of protomer n + 4 inserts into a cleft in protomer n to complete an immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain. This packing mechanism, known as donor-strand exchange (DSE), has been observed in several bacterial pilus assemblies, wherein the donor is protomer n + 1. Despite distinct shape and thickness, this reminiscence suggests that TLP-1a/b fibrils may represent uncharacterized bacterial pili. Our study demonstrates an emerging paradigm in structural biology, where high-resolution structural determination precedes and drives the identification and characterization of completely unknown objects.",

However, toxic by-products accumulate in cultures due to inefficiencies in metabolic activities and nutrient utilization. In this study, we applied comprehensive 13 C stable-isotope tracing of amino acids and glucose to two Immunoglobulin G (IgG) producing Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines to identify secreted by-products and trace their origins. CHO cells were cultured in media formulations missing a single amino acid or glucose supplemented with a 13 C-tracer of the missing substrate, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to track labeled carbon flows and identify by-products. We tracked the sources of all secreted by-products and verified the identity of 45 by-products, majority of which were derived from glucose, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, and phenylalanine. In addition to by-products identified previously, we identified several metabolites including 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, L-alloisoleucine, ketoisoleucine, 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid, desmeninol, and 2-aminobutyric acid. When added to CHO cell cultures at different concentrations, certain metabolites inhibited cell growth while others including 2-hydroxy acids, surprisingly, reduced lactate accumulation. In vitro enzymatic analysis indicated that 2-hydroxy acids were metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase suggesting a possible mechanism for lowered lactate accumulation, e.g., competitive substrate inhibition. The 13 C-labeling assisted metabolomics pipeline developed and the metabolites identified will serve as a springboard to reduce undesirable by-products accumulation and alleviate inefficient substrate utilization in mammalian cultures used for biomanufacturing and other applications through altered media formulations and pathway engineering strategies.",

FaNaCs are activated by the short neuropeptide FMRFamide, and HyNaCs by Hydra RFamides, which are not evolutionarily related to FMRFamide. The FMRFamide-binding site in FaNaCs was recently identified in a cleft atop the large extracellular domain. However, this cleft is not conserved in HyNaCs. Here, we combined molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis and identified a putative binding pocket for Hydra-RFamides in the extracellular domain of the heterotrimeric HyNaC2/3/5. This pocket localizes to only one of the three subunit interfaces, indicating that this trimeric ion channel binds a single peptide ligand. We engineered an unnatural amino acid at the putative binding pocket entrance, which allowed covalent tethering of Hydra RFamide to the channel, thereby trapping the channel in an open conformation. The identified pocket localizes to the same region as the acidic pocket of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which binds peptide ligands. The pocket in HyNaCs is less acidic, and both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to peptide binding. Collectively, our results reveal a conserved ligand-binding pocket in HyNaCs and ASICs and indicate independent evolution of peptide-binding cavities in the two subgroups of peptide-gated ion channels.",

Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this fundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from prior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study habituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to formalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally identified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework to investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In particular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with static nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous hallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive learning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating circuits in biological systems.",

The function of HCN channels depends, in part, on their subcellular localization. Of the four HCN isoforms (HCN1-4), HCN1 is strongly expressed in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs) in hippocampal area CA1 but also in presynaptic terminals of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV+ INs), which provide strong inhibitory control over hippocampal activity. Yet, little is known about how HCN1 channels in these cells regulate the evoked release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA from their axon terminals. Here, we used genetic, optogenetic, electrophysiological, and imaging techniques to investigate how the electrophysiological properties of PV+ INs are regulated by HCN1, including how HCN1 activity at presynaptic terminals regulates the release of GABA onto PNs in CA1. We found that application of HCN1 pharmacological blockers reduced the amplitude of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential recorded from CA1 PNs in response to selective optogenetic stimulation of PV+ INs. Homozygous HCN1 knockout mice also show reduced IPSCs in postsynaptic cells. Finally, two-photon imaging using genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators revealed that HCN1 blockers reduced the probability that an extracellular electrical stimulating pulse evoked a Ca 2+ response in individual PV+ IN presynaptic boutons. Taken together, our results show that HCN1 channels in the axon terminals of PV+ interneurons facilitate GABAergic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region.",

We report the use of an engineered tissue model of human bone marrow (eBM) to identify microenvironmental cues regulating cancer cell proliferation and to investigate how triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines influence hematopoiesis. Notably, individual stromal components of the bone marrow niche (osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and mesenchymal stem/stromal cells) were each critical for regulating tumor cell quiescence and proliferation in the three-dimensional eBM niche. We found that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) impacted TNBC cell growth and responded to cancer cell presence with a shift of HSPCs (CD34 + CD38 − ) to downstream myeloid lineages (CD11b + CD14 + ). To account for tumor heterogeneity and show proof-of-concept ability for patient-specific studies, we demonstrate that patient-derived tumor organoids survive and proliferate in the eBM, resulting in distinct shifts in myelopoiesis that are similar to those observed for aggressively metastatic cell lines.

Improper e-waste disposal poses environmental and health risks, entailing substantial remediation and healthcare costs. Large efforts are applied for the recovery of Au from e-waste using complex processes which include the dissolution of Au, its adsorption in an ionic state and succeeding reduction to metallic Au. These processes themselves being complex and utilizing harsh chemicals contribute to the environmental impact of e-waste. Here, we present an approach for the simultaneous recovery and reduction of Au 3+ and Au + ions from e-waste to produce solid Au 0 forms, thus skipping several technological steps. We develop a nanoscale cross-dimensional composite material via self-assembly of two-dimensional graphene oxide and one-dimensional chitosan macromolecules, capable of acting simultaneously as a scavenger of gold ions and as a reducing agent. Such multidimensional architecture doesn’t require to apply any voltage for Au adsorption and reduction and solely relies on the chemisorption kinetics of Au ions in the heterogeneous GO/CS nanoconfinements and their chemical reduction on multiple binding sites. The cooperative phenomena in ionic absorption are responsible for the extremely high efficiency of gold extraction. The extraction capacity reaches 16.8 g/g for Au 3+ and 6.2 g/g for Au + , which is ten times larger than any existing gold adsorbents can propose. The efficiency is above 99.5 wt.% (current limit is 75 wt.%) and extraction ability is down to very low concentrations of 3 ppm.",

The replication stressor most often used to induce the checkpoint response in yeast is hydroxyurea (HU), a clinically used chemotherapeutic. The primary mechanism of S-phase checkpoint activation by HU has thus far been considered to be a reduction of deoxynucleotide triphosphate synthesis by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), leading to helicase–polymerase decoupling and subsequent activation of the checkpoint, facilitated by the replisome-associated mediator Mrc1. In contrast, we observe that HU causes cell cycle arrest in budding yeast independent of both the Mrc1-mediated replication checkpoint response and the Psk1-Mrc1 oxidative signaling pathway. We demonstrate a direct relationship between HU incubation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in yeast and human cells and show that antioxidants restore growth of yeast in HU. We further observe that ROS strongly inhibits the in vitro polymerase activity of replicative polymerases (Pols), Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε, causing polymerase complex dissociation and subsequent loss of DNA substrate binding, likely through oxidation of their integral iron–sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. Finally, we present “RNR-deg,” a genetically engineered alternative to HU in yeast with greatly increased specificity of RNR inhibition, allowing researchers to achieve fast, nontoxic, and more readily reversible checkpoint activation compared to HU, avoiding harmful ROS generation and associated downstream cellular effects that may confound interpretation of results.",

          "abstract": "The rise of antimicrobial failure is a global emergency, and causes beyond typical genetic resistance must be determined. One probable factor is the existence of subpopulations of transiently growth-arrested bacteria, persisters, that endure antibiotic treatment despite genetic susceptibility to the drug. The presence of persisters in infected hosts has been successfully established, notably through the development of fluorescent reporters. It is proposed that infection relapse is caused by persisters resuming growth after cessation of the antibiotic treatment, but to date, there is no direct evidence for this. This is because no tool or reporter currently exists to track the extent to which infection relapse is initiated by regrowth of persisters in the host. Indeed, once they have transitioned out of the persister state, the progeny of persisters are genetically and phenotypically identical to susceptible bacteria in the population, making it virtually impossible to ascertain the source of relapse. We designed pSCRATCH (plasmid for Selective CRISPR Array expansion To Check Heritage), a molecular tool that functions to record the state of antibiotic persistence in the genome of Salmonella persisters. We show that pSCRATCH successfully marks persisters by adding spacers in their CRISPR arrays and the genomic label is stable in persister progeny after exit from persistence. We further show that in a Salmonella infection model the system enables the discrimination of treatment failure originating from persistence versus resistance. Thus, pSCRATCH provides proof of principle for stable marking of persisters and a prototype for applications to more complex infection models and other pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Estimates of sedimentary organic carbon burial fluxes based on inventory and isotope mass balance methods have been divergent. A new calculation of the isotope mass balance using a revised assessment of the inputs to the ocean-atmosphere system resolves the apparent discrepancy. Inputs include weathering of carbonate and old kerogen, geogenic methane oxidation, and volcanic and metamorphic degassing. Volcanic and metamorphic degassing comprise ≈23% of the total C input. Inputs from isotopically light OCpetro and CH 4-geo drive the mean δ 13 C of the input to =−8.0 ± 1.9‰, notably lower than the commonly assumed volcanic degassing value. The isotope mass balance model yields a modern burial flux =15.9 ± 6.6 Tmol y −1 . The impact of the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum isotope anomaly is an integrated excess deposition ≈ 4.3 × 10 6 Tmol between 18 and 11 Ma, which is both longer and larger than estimates for the total degassing by the Columbia River Basalt eruptions, implying a complex carbon system response to large eruptive events. Monte Carlo evaluation finds that late Cenozoic net growth of the carbonate reservoir is very likely while net growth of the C org reservoir is less certain but more likely than not. At present, subduction does not appear to keep up with net sedimentation and the overall masses of sedimentary carbonate and organic carbon are likely increasing. Growth in the sedimentary C org reservoir implies oxidation of the surface environment and likely increases in atmospheric pO 2 .",

Yet while regional crop production trends receive significant attention, relatively little is known about the local-scale crop switching that underlies these macrotrends. We characterized local crop-switching patterns across the United States using the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer, an annual time series of high resolution (30 m pixel size) remote-sensed cropland data from 2008 to 2022. We found that at multiple spatial scales, crop switching was most common in sparsely cultivated landscapes and in landscapes with high crop diversity, whereas it was low in homogeneous, highly agricultural areas such as the Midwestern corn belt, suggesting a number of potential social and economic mechanisms influencing farmers’ crop choices. Crop-switching rates were high overall, occurring on more than 6% of all US cropland in the average year. Applying a framework that classified crop switches based on their temporal novelty (crop introduction versus discontinuation), spatial novelty (locally divergent versus convergent switching), and categorical novelty (transformative versus incremental switching), we found distinct spatial patterns for these three novelty dimensions, indicating a dynamic and multifaceted set of cropping changes across US farms. Collectively, these results suggest that innovation through crop switching is playing out very differently in various parts of the country, with potentially significant implications for the resilience of agricultural systems to changes in climate and other systemic trends.",

To perform this mapping requires the identification of sequence features most informative about function. Here, we quantify the amount of information (in bits) that T cell receptor (TCR) sequence features provide about antigen specificity. We identify informative features by their degree of conservation among antigen-specific receptors relative to null expectations. We find that TCR specificity synergistically depends on the hypervariable regions of both receptor chains, with a degree of synergy that strongly depends on the ligand. Using a coincidence-based approach to measuring information enables us to directly bound the accuracy with which TCR specificity can be predicted from partial matches to reference sequences. We anticipate that our statistical framework will be of use for developing machine learning models for TCR specificity prediction and for optimizing TCRs for cell therapies. The proposed coincidence-based information measures might find further applications in bounding the performance of pairwise classifiers in other fields.",

          "abstract": "The cerebellum is critical for sensorimotor learning. The specific contribution that it makes, however, remains unclear. Inspired by the classic finding that for declarative memories, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures provide a gateway to the formation of long-term memory but are not required for short-term memory, we hypothesized that for sensorimotor memories, the cerebellum may play an analogous role. Here, we studied the sensorimotor learning of individuals with severe ataxia from cerebellar degeneration. We dissected the memories they formed during sensorimotor learning into a short-term temporally-volatile component, that decays rapidly with a time constant of just 15 to 20 s and thus cannot lead to long-term retention, and a longer-term temporally-persistent component that is stable for 60 s or more and leads to long-term retention. Remarkably, we find that these individuals display dramatically reduced levels of temporally-persistent sensorimotor memory, despite spared and even elevated levels of temporally-volatile sensorimotor memory. In particular, we find both impairment that systematically worsens with memory window duration over shorter memory windows (&lt;12 s) and near-complete impairment of memory maintenance over longer memory windows (&gt;25 s). This dissociation uncovers a unique role for the cerebellum as a gateway for the formation of long-term but not short-term sensorimotor memories, mirroring the role of the MTL for declarative memories. It thus reveals the existence of distinct neural substrates for short-term and long-term sensorimotor memory, and it explains both the trial-to-trial differences identified in this study and long-standing study-to-study differences in the effects of cerebellar damage on sensorimotor learning ability.",

Given that these cycles are less constrained on Mars than they are on Earth, the identification of carbonates has been a point of emphasis for rover missions. Here, we present carbon (δ 13 C) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope data from four carbonates encountered by the Curiosity rover within the Gale crater. The carbon isotope values range from 72 ± 2‰ to 110 ± 3‰ Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite while the oxygen isotope values span from 59 ± 4‰ to 91 ± 4‰ Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (1 SE uncertainties). Notably, these values are isotopically heavy ( 13 C- and 18 O-enriched) relative to nearly every other Martian material. The extreme isotopic difference between the carbonates and other carbon- and oxygen-rich reservoirs on Mars cannot be reconciled by standard equilibrium carbonate–CO 2 fractionation, thus requiring an alternative process during or prior to carbonate formation. This paper explores two processes capable of contributing to the isotopic enrichments: 1) evaporative-driven Rayleigh distillation and 2) kinetic isotope effects related to cryogenic precipitation. In isolation, each process cannot reproduce the observed carbonate isotope values; however, a combination of these processes represents the most likely source for the extreme isotopic enrichments.",

          "abstract": "Profound functional switch of key regulatory factors may play a major role in homeostasis and disease. Dysregulation of circadian rhythm (CR) is strongly implicated in cancer with mechanisms poorly understood. We report here that the function of REV-ERBα, a major CR regulator of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily, is dramatically altered in tumors in both its genome binding and functional mode. Loss of CR is linked to a functional inversion of REV-ERBα from a repressor in control of CR and metabolic gene programs in normal tissues to a strong activator in different cancers. Through changing its association from NCoR/HDAC3 corepressor complex to BRD4/p300 coactivators, REV-ERBα directly activates thousands of genes including tumorigenic programs such as MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling. Functioning as a master transcriptional activator, REV-ERBα partners with pioneer factor FOXA1 and directly stimulates a large number of signaling genes, including multiple growth factors, receptor tyrosine kinases, RASs, AKTs, and MAPKs. Moreover, elevated REV-ERBα reprograms FOXA1 to bind new targets through a BRD4-mediated increase in local chromatin accessibility. Pharmacological targeting with SR8278 diminishes the function of both REV-ERBα and FOXA1 and synergizes with BRD4 inhibitor in effective suppression of tumorigenic programs and tumor growth. Thus, our study revealed a functional inversion by a CR regulator in driving gene reprogramming as an unexpected paradigm of tumorigenesis mechanism and demonstrated a high effectiveness of therapeutic targeting such switch.",

However, for most low-carbon steels, such obstacles are difficult to form mainly because the martensitic transition is kinetically unfavorable by conventional methods, which precludes the attainment of high-strength materials in these steels with low solute contents. Here, we report an innovative high-pressure preparation of martensitic pure Fe with involving nano-effect, which leads to the formation of ultrastrong bulk iron with exceptionally high yield strength, ultimate strength, and hardness of 2.9 GPa, 3.7 GPa, and 9.0 GPa, respectively, exceeding those of high-speed steels. Such extraordinary mechanical properties are closely attributed to its high-density martensites with unique multiscale hierarchical structures formed due to complex phase transitions under pressure.",

          "abstract": "The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) makes it important to recognize their strengths and limitations. We argue that to develop a holistic understanding of these systems, we must consider the problem that they were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By recognizing the pressures that this task exerts, we can make predictions about the strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will succeed or fail. Using this approach—which we call the teleological approach—we identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM accuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the target output, and the probability of the provided input. To test our predictions, we evaluate five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.0) on 11 tasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in the hypothesized ways. Many of the experiments reveal surprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4’s accuracy at decoding a simple cipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability sentence but only 13% when it is low-probability, even though this task is a deterministic one for which probability should not matter. These results show that AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we conclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should instead treat them as a distinct type of system—one that has been shaped by its own particular set of pressures.",

          "abstract": "Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdala (PaFS) is a bifunctional terpene synthase. It contains a prenyltransferase (PT) domain that generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and three equivalents of isopentenyl diphosphate, and a cyclase domain that converts GGPP into fusicoccadiene, a precursor of the diterpene glycoside Fusicoccin A. The two catalytic domains are connected by a flexible 69-residue linker. The PT domain mediates oligomerization to form predominantly octamers, with cyclase domains randomly splayed out around the PT core. Surprisingly, despite the random positioning of cyclase domains, substrate channeling is operative in catalysis since most of the GGPP generated by the PT remains on the enzyme for cyclization. Here, we demonstrate that covalent linkage of the PT and cyclase domains is not required for GGPP channeling, although covalent linkage may improve channeling efficiency. Moreover, GGPP competition experiments with other diterpene cyclases indicate that the PaFS PT and cyclase domains are preferential partners regardless of whether they are covalently linked or not. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the 600-kD “linkerless” construct, in which the 69-residue linker is spliced out and replaced with the tripeptide PTQ, reveals that cyclase pairs associate with all four sides of the PT octamer and exhibit fascinating quaternary structural flexibility. These results suggest that optimal substrate channeling is achieved when a cyclase domain associates with the side of the PT octamer, regardless of whether the two domains are covalently linked and regardless of whether this interaction is transient or locked in place.",

Here, we develop a disulfide crosslinking method to trap native substrates in vivo as they fold on BAM. By placing a cysteine within the luminal wall of the BamA barrel as well as in the substrate β-strands, we can compare the residence time of each substrate strand within the BamA lumen. We validated this method using two defective, slow-folding substrates. We used this method to characterize stable intermediates which occur during folding of two structurally different native substrates. Strikingly, these intermediates occur during identical stages of folding for both substrates: soon after folding has begun and just before folding is completed. We suggest that these intermediates arise due to barriers to folding that are common between β-barrel substrates, and that the BAM catalyst is able to fold so many different substrates because it addresses these common challenges.",

          "abstract": "Cardiac myosin-specific (MyHC) T cells drive the disease pathogenesis of immune checkpoint inhibitor–associated myocarditis (ICI-myocarditis). To determine whether MyHC T cells are tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells, we characterized cardiac T RM cells in naive mice and established that they have a distinct phenotypic and transcriptional profile that can be defined by their upregulation of CD69, PD-1, and CXCR6. We then investigated the effects of cardiac injury through a modified experimental autoimmune myocarditis mouse model and an ischemia–reperfusion injury mouse model and determined that cardiac inflammation induces the recruitment of autoreactive MyHC T RM cells, which coexpress PD-1 and CD69. To investigate whether the recruited MyHC T RM cells could increase susceptibility to ICI-myocarditis, we developed a two-hit ICI-myocarditis mouse model where cardiac injury was induced, mice were allowed to recover, and then were treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies. We determined that mice who recover from cardiac injury are more susceptible to ICI-myocarditis development. We found that murine and human T RM cells share a similar location in the heart and aggregate along the perimyocardium. We phenotyped cells obtained from pericardial fluid from patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy and established that pericardial T cells are predominantly CD69 + T RM cells that up-regulate PD-1. Finally, we determined that human pericardial macrophages produce IL-15, which supports and maintains pericardial T RM cells.",

Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the signature initiating event in the most common form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Such tumors are usually driven by the excessive HIF2 activity that arises when the VHL gene product, pVHL, is defective. Given the pressing need for a robust immunocompetent mouse model of human ccRCC, we directly injected adenovirus-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding sgRNAs against VHL and other known/suspected ccRCC tumor suppressor genes into the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice under conditions where Cas9 was under the control of one of two different kidney-specific promoters ( Cdh16 or Pax 8) to induce kidney tumors. An AAV targeting Vhl, Pbrm1, Keap1 , and Tsc1 reproducibly caused macroscopic ccRCCs that partially resembled human ccRCC tumors with respect to transcriptome and cell of origin and responded to a ccRCC standard-of-care agent, axitinib. Unfortunately, these tumors, like those produced by earlier genetically engineered mouse ccRCCs, are HIF2 independent.",

          "abstract": "Summer temperature extremes can have large impacts on humans and the biosphere, and an increase in heat extremes is one of the most visible symptoms of climate change. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed that would predict faster warming of heat extremes than typical summer days, but it is unclear whether this is occurring. Here, we show that, in both observations and historical climate model simulations, the hottest summer days have warmed at the same pace as the median globally, in each hemisphere, and in the tropics from 1959 to 2023. In contrast, the coldest summer days have warmed more slowly than the median in the global average, a signal that is not simulated in any of 262 simulations across 28 CMIP6 models. The observed stretching of the cold tail indicates that observed summertime temperatures have become more variable despite the lack of hot day amplification. The interannual variability and trend in the warming of both hot and cold extremes compared to the median can be explained from a surface energy balance perspective based on changes in net surface radiation and evaporative fraction. Tropical hot day amplification is projected to emerge in the future (2024–2099, SSP3-7.0 scenario), while Northern Hemisphere heat extremes are expected to continue to follow the median.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption during adolescence has been associated with neuroanatomical abnormalities and the appearance of future disorders. However, the latest advances in this field point to the existence of risk profiles which may lead to some individuals into an early consumption. To date, some studies have established predictive models of consumption based on sociodemographic, behavioral, and anatomical–functional variables using MRI. However, the neuroimaging variables employed are usually restricted to local and hemodynamic phenomena. Given the potential of connectome approaches, and the high temporal dynamics of electrophysiology, we decided to explore the relationship between future alcohol consumption and electrophysiological connectivity measured by MEG in a cohort of 83 individuals aged 14 to 16. As a result, we found a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and the functional connectivity in frontal, parietal, and frontoparietal connections. Once this relationship was described, multivariate linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive capacity of functional connectivity in conjunction with other neuroanatomical and behavioral variables described in the literature. Finally, the multivariate linear regression analysis determined the importance of anatomical and functional variables in the prediction of alcohol consumption but failed to find associations with impulsivity, sensation seeking, and executive function scales. In conclusion, the predictive traits obtained in these models were closely associated with changes occurring during adolescence, suggesting the existence of different paths in neurodevelopment that have the potential to influence adolescents’ relationship with alcohol consumption.",

          "abstract": "The Ca 2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) triggers neurotransmitter release together with the neuronal sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex formed by syntaxin-1, SNAP25, and synaptobrevin. Moreover, Syt1 increases synaptic vesicle (SV) priming and impairs spontaneous vesicle release. The Syt1 C 2 B domain binds to the SNARE complex through a primary interface via two regions (I and II), but how exactly this interface mediates distinct functions of Syt1 and the mechanism underlying Ca 2+ triggering of release are unknown. Using mutagenesis and electrophysiological experiments, we show that region II is functionally and spatially subdivided: Binding of C2B domain arginines to SNAP-25 acidic residues at one face of region II is crucial for Ca 2+ -evoked release but not for vesicle priming or clamping of spontaneous release, whereas other SNAP-25 and syntaxin-1 acidic residues at the other face mediate priming and clamping of spontaneous release but not evoked release. Mutations that disrupt region I impair the priming and clamping functions of Syt1 while, strikingly, mutations that enhance binding through this region increase vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release, but strongly inhibit evoked release and vesicle fusogenicity. These results support previous findings that the primary interface mediates the functions of Syt1 in vesicle priming and clamping of spontaneous release and, importantly, show that Ca 2+ triggering of release requires a rearrangement of the primary interface involving dissociation of region I, while region II remains bound. Together with biophysical studies presented in [K.

          "abstract": "The analysis of tissues of origin of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is of research and diagnostic interest. Many studies focused on bisulfite treatment or immunoprecipitation protocols to assess the tissues of origin of cfDNA. DNA loss often occurs during such processes. Fragmentomics of cfDNA molecules has uncovered a wealth of information related to tissues of origin of cfDNA. There is still much room for the development of tools for assessing contributions from various tissues into plasma using fragmentomic features. Hence, we developed an approach to analyze the relative contributions of DNA from different tissues into plasma, by identifying characteristic fragmentation patterns associated with selected histone modifications. We named this technique as FRAGmentomics-based Histone modification Analysis (FRAGHA). Deduced placenta-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)-associated signal correlated well with the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma (Pearson’s r = 0.96). The deduced liver-specific H3K27ac-associated signal correlated with the donor-derived DNA fraction in liver transplantation recipients (Pearson’s r = 0.92) and was significantly increased in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ( P &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Significant elevations of erythroblasts-specific and colon-specific H3K27ac-associated signals were observed in patients with β-thalassemia major and colorectal cancer, respectively. Furthermore, using the fragmentation patterns from tissue-specific H3K27ac regions, a machine learning algorithm was developed to enhance HCC detection, with an area under the curve (AUC) of up to 0.97. Finally, genomic regions with H3K27ac or histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) were found to exhibit different fragmentomic patterns of cfDNA. This study has shed light on the relationship between cfDNA fragmentomics and histone modifications, thus expanding the armamentarium of liquid biopsy.",

We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response. Genomics and proteomics corroborated a gain-of-function mechanism in which global kinase activity was not inhibited but rather redirected.

Recently discovered global epistasis, in which the fitness effects of mutations scale with the fitness of the background genotype, can improve predictions, but how the environment modulates this scaling is unknown. We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments. Our results suggest that the effective dimensionality of genotype-to-phenotype maps across environments is surprisingly low.",

Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response. Our results have implications for understanding ENSO teleconnections, explaining observed extratropical climate variability and interpreting seasonal to interannual climate predictions.",

State-of-the-art in situ four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) observations reveal the statistical correlation between grain rotation and grain growth or shrinkage. This correlation arises from shear-coupled grain boundary migration, which occurs through the motion of disconnections, as demonstrated by in situ high-angle annular dark-field STEM observations and the atomistic simulation–aided analysis.

          "abstract": "Fungus-farming ants cultivate multiple lineages of fungi for food, but, because fungal cultivar relationships are largely unresolved, the history of fungus-ant coevolution remains poorly known. We designed probes targeting &gt;2000 gene regions to generate a dated evolutionary tree for 475 fungi and combined it with a similarly generated tree for 276 ants. We found that fungus-ant agriculture originated ~66 million years ago when the end-of-Cretaceous asteroid impact temporarily interrupted photosynthesis, causing global mass extinctions but favoring the proliferation of fungi. Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture.",

          "abstract": "Early embryogenesis is driven by transcription factors (TFs) that first activate the zygotic genome and then specify the lineages constituting the blastocyst. Although the TFs specifying the blastocyst’s lineages are well characterized, those playing earlier roles remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 −/− embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.",

          "abstract": "Reverse transcription has frequently been co-opted for cellular functions and in prokaryotes is associated with protection against viral infection, but the underlying mechanisms of defense are generally unknown. Here, we show that in the DRT2 defense system, the reverse transcriptase binds a neighboring pseudoknotted noncoding RNA. Upon bacteriophage infection, a template region of this RNA is reverse transcribed into an array of tandem repeats that reconstitute a promoter and open reading frame, allowing expression of a toxic repetitive protein and an abortive infection response. Biochemical reconstitution of this activity and cryo–electron microscopy provide a molecular basis for repeat synthesis. Gene synthesis from a noncoding RNA is a previously unknown mode of genetic regulation in prokaryotes.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen atom abstraction is an important elementary chemical process but is very difficult to carry out enantioselectively. We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.",

We show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis through rolling circle reverse transcription of a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame ( neo ) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection.

We present a photocatalytic strategy that swaps an oxygen atom of furan with a nitrogen group, directly converting the furan into a pyrrole analog in a single intermolecular reaction. High compatibility was observed with various furan derivatives and nitrogen nucleophiles commonly used in drug discovery, and the late-stage functionalization furnished otherwise difficult-to-access pyrroles from naturally occurring furans of high molecular complexity. Mechanistic analysis suggested that polarity inversion through single electron transfer initiates the redox-neutral atom exchange processes at room temperature.",

The promise of cancer immunotherapy is that immune effector mechanisms and immunological memory can jointly eradicate cancers and inoperable metastases and de facto vaccinate against recurrence. For some patients with hitherto incurable diseases, including metastatic melanoma, this promise is being realized by game-changing immunotherapies based on αβ T cells. Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain. In addressing those problems, we advocate that immunotherapies be guided by the distinctive biology of γδ T cells, as elucidated by ongoing research.",

For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater. Projected future extinctions of more than 1000 species over the next two centuries will incur further substantial reductions in functional and phylogenetic diversity.

Federal assistance programs exist, but allocations across states have been nearly static since 1984, while the distribution of energy poverty is dynamic in location and time. We implement a LASSO-based machine learning approach using sociodemographic and geographical information to estimate energy burden in each US census tract for 2015 and 2020. We then compare the allocation to states from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to an optimized allocation. We allocate funds to the most burdened households, providing them with enough assistance to reduce their energy expenditures so that their household energy burden is equal to a new maximum allowable energy burden. This markedly shifts funds from the northern cold-weather states to the southern warm-weather states.",

          "abstract": "A broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves has been explored for wireless neuromodulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, with long wavelengths, cannot provide submillimeter spatial resolution. Visible light, with its short wavelengths, suffers from strong scattering in the deep tissue. Microwaves have centimeter-scale penetration depth and have been shown to reversibly inhibit neuronal activity. Yet, microwaves alone do not provide sufficient spatial precision to modulate target neurons without affecting surrounding tissues. Here, we report a split-ring resonator (SRR) that generates an enhanced microwave field at its gap with submillimeter spatial precision. With the SRR, microwaves at dosages below the safe exposure limit are shown to inhibit the firing of neurons within 1 mm of the SRR gap site. The microwave SRR reduced seizure activity at a low dose in both in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. This microwave dosage is confirmed to be biosafe via histological and biochemical assessment of brain tissue.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is pivotal for diagnosing panvascular diseases. However, single-modality MRA falls short in diagnosing diverse vascular abnormalities. Thus, contrast agents combining T 1 and T 2 effects are sought for multiparameter MRA with clinical promise, yet achieving a balance in T 1 and T 2 contrast enhancement effects remains a scientific challenge. Herein, we developed a hypersensitive multiparameter MRA strategy using dual-modality NaGdF 4 nanoparticles. Because of the longer tumbling time (τ R ), NaGdF 4 nanoparticles can improve the longitudinal relaxivity ( r 1 ), brightening vessels in T 1 -weighted sequences. Simultaneously, the regular arrangement of Gd 3+ in the crystal induces magnetic anisotropy, creating local static magnetic field heterogeneity and generating negative signals in T 2 -weighted sequences. Consequently, the efficacy of NaGdF 4 -enhanced high-resolution multiparameter MRA has been validated in diagnosing ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models. In addition, the dual-contrast imaging has been realized on swine with a clinical 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, highly emphasizing the clinical translation prospect.",

          "abstract": "Oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals in sedimentary rocks releases carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into the atmosphere. In permafrost zones, this could be a positive feedback on climate change if it increases with warming, yet sulfide oxidation rates and their temperature response remain unknown over large spatial and temporal scales. We analyze a 60-year sulfate concentration dataset from catchments across the Mackenzie River Basin. Sulfate fluxes increased by 45% in the mainstem with 2.3°C of warming, and the temperature sensitivity suggests that continental-scale CO 2 fluxes could double by 2100. The largest increases occur in catchments with geomorphic settings which act to rapidly expose rocks through physical weathering and thermokarst processes. Comparisons with a weathering model suggest that warming can increase reaction rates, and changes in the exposure of minerals with warming are also required. Future warming across vast Arctic landscapes could further increase sulfide oxidation rates and affect regional carbon cycle budgets.",

However, achieving temperature self-regulation in individual textiles without external interventions remains a challenge. Here, we present a dual-modal photonic textile capable of autonomously achieving both low-temperature solar heating and high-temperature radiative cooling under sunlight. This innovative textile is primarily composed of textile fibers that are functionalized with thermochromic microcapsules encapsulated in graphene and barium sulfate coatings, which exhibit approximately 80% visible light optical modulation when integrated into the fabric. We demonstrate that garment and tent (3.5 m × 2.9 m × 1.3 m) fabricated from these textiles can achieve temperature-adaptive, all-weather thermal management, expanding the thermal comfort range by 8.5°C. This research showcases notable potential for applications in fabric-related heat management and highlights the importance of exploring temperature-adaptive solutions for a sustainable and healthy lifestyle.",

          "abstract": "El Niño typically induces cooling in the Southwest Pacific Ocean during austral summers, usually leading to decreased marine heatwave frequency and severity. However, the 2016 extreme El Niño unexpectedly coincided with the longest and most extensive marine heatwave ever recorded in the region. This heatwave, spanning over 1.7 million square kilometers, persisting for 24 days with a peak intensity of 1.5°C, resulted in massive coral bleaching and fish mortality. This exceptional warming resulted from anomalously strong shortwave radiation and reduced heat loss via latent heat fluxes, owing to low wind speed and increased air humidity. These anomalies are attributed to a rare combined event “Madden-Julian Oscillation and extreme El Niño.” Following 10 February, the rapid dissipation of this marine heatwave results from the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific. The hazardous ecological impacts of this extreme event highlight the needs for improving our understanding of marine heatwave–driving mechanisms that may result in better seasonal predictions.",

Typical planar fabrication techniques have substantial design constraints that often prohibit the creation of functionally compelling and complex architectures. Moreover, they often require multiple-step operations for production. Here, we use an additive manufacturing process based on continuous liquid interface production to create high-resolution (30-micrometer) three-dimensional elastomeric polyurethane lattices for use as dielectric layers in capacitive sensors. We show that the capacitive responses and sensitivities are highly tunable through designs of lattice type, thickness, and material-void volume percentage. Microcomputed tomography and finite element simulation are used to elucidate the influence of lattice design on the deformation mechanism and concomitant sensing behavior. The advantage of three-dimensional printing is exhibited with examples of fully printed representative athletic equipment with integrated sensors.",

We demonstrate a robust strategy for stabilizing PtCo NPs under high temperature with strong interaction between M–N–C and PtCo NPs with Pt–M–N coordination, namely, “atom glue.” Such atom glue for stabilizing Pt-based NPs can be extended to Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, and Cu, being a versatile strategy for stabilizing PtCo NPs, which substantially promotes the performance toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and fuel cell. Impressively, the mass activity (MA) reaches 2.99 A mg Pt −1 for ORR over g -Zn–N–C/PtCo, and 79.3% of the initial MA is maintained after 90K cycles in fuel cell. This work provides a versatile strategy for stabilizing Pt-based NPs via atom glue, which is likely to spark widespread interest across various fields.",

Human osteoarchaeological remains preserve small molecules, making them valuable for studies that aim to examine past conditions. We test if there are molecular differences in the metabolome of cortical bone between archaeological individuals who used tobacco and those who did not, and if these differences are distinct enough to assign tobacco use status to individuals with unknown tobacco use. Cortical bone of 323 known and unknown tobacco users was studied by an untargeted metabolomics assay using a liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry platform. We identified 45 discriminating molecular features that differed between tobacco consumers (15 up-regulated features) and nonconsumers (17 up-regulated features). Tobacco consumption leaves a metabolic record in human bone distinctive enough to identify its use in individuals of unknown tobacco consumption. Future work will validate molecular features relating to tobacco consumption.",

          "abstract": "Potassium channels stabilize the resting potential and neuronal excitability. Among them, erg (ether-à-go-go–related gene) K + channels represent a subfamily of voltage-gated channels, consisting of erg1, erg2, and erg3 subunits; however, their subunit-specific neuronal functions in vivo are barely understood. To find erg3- and erg1-mediated functions, we generated global Kcnh7 ( erg3 ) and conditional Kcnh2 ( erg1 ) knockout mice. We found that erg3 channels stabilize the resting potential and dampen spontaneous activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas erg1 channels have suprathreshold functions. Lack of erg3 subunits induced hyperexcitability with increased action potential firing in PCs, but not in CA1 neurons. Notably, erg3 depletion caused depressive-like behavior with reduced locomotor activity, strongly decreased digging behavior, and shorter latencies to fall off a rotating wheel, while learning and memory remained unchanged. Our data show that erg K + channels containing erg3 subunits mediate a neuronal subthreshold K + current that plays important roles in the regulation of locomotor behavior in vivo.",

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK + macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK + macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK + macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK + macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy.",

We first show, computationally and experimentally, that an immiscible phase can be robustly positioned at the neck of human aneurysm models to seal and isolate the aneurysm’s cavity for further treatment, including in wide-neck aneurysms. We then demonstrate localized delivery and confined treatment, by selective staining of cell nuclei within the aneurysm cavity as well as by hydrogel-based embolization in patient-specific aneurysm models. Altogether, our interfacial flow-driven strategy offers a potential approach for intravascular localized treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases.",

In more mesic areas (aridity index &gt; 0.65), SOC and POC concentrations decreased by 7.9% (±3.9) and 15.9% (±6.2) with drought, respectively, but there were no impacts on MAOC concentrations. However, drought had no impact on SOC, POC, or MAOC concentrations in drylands (aridity index &lt; 0.65). The response of SOC to drought varied along an aridity gradient, concomitant with interannual precipitation variability and standing SOC concentration gradients.

          "abstract": "This study evaluated therapeutic antimiRs in primary myoblasts from patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 results from unstable CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene, leading to variable clinical manifestations by depleting muscleblind-like splicing regulator protein MBNL1. AntimiRs targeting natural repressors miR-23b and miR-218 boost MBNL1 expression but must be optimized for a better pharmacological profile in humans. In untreated cells, miR-23b and miR-218 were up-regulated, which correlated with CTG repeat size, supporting that active MBNL1 protein repression synergizes with the sequestration by CUG expansions in DMPK . AntimiR treatment improved RNA toxicity readouts and corrected regulated exon inclusions and myoblast defects such as fusion index and myotube area across CTG expansions. Unexpectedly, the treatment also reduced DMPK transcripts and ribonuclear foci. A leading antimiR reversed 68% of dysregulated genes.

Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that α-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of α-syn’s occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects.

The deficiency of a histone methyltransferase for H3K9 methylation does not lead to anomalous recombination.

          "abstract": "Reversal of ischemia is mediated by neo-angiogenesis requiring endothelial cell (EC) and pericyte interactions to form stable microvascular networks. We describe an unrecognized role for tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in potentiating neo-angiogenesis and vessel stabilization. We show that the endothelium is a major source of TRAIL in the healthy circulation compromised in peripheral artery disease (PAD). EC deletion of TRAIL in vivo or in vitro inhibited neo-angiogenesis, pericyte recruitment, and vessel stabilization, resulting in reduced lower-limb blood perfusion with ischemia. Activation of the TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) restored blood perfusion and stable blood vessel networks in mice. Proof-of-concept studies showed that Conatumumab, an agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibody, promoted vascular sprouts from explanted patient arteries. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor in mediating EC-pericyte communications dependent on TRAIL. These studies highlight unique TRAIL-dependent mechanisms mediating neo-angiogenesis and vessel stabilization and the potential of repurposing TRAIL-R2 agonists to stimulate stable and functional microvessel networks to treat ischemia in PAD.",

To overcome this liability, antibody-drug conjugates were constructed using altered BCL-X L –targeting warheads, unique linker technologies, and therapeutic antibodies. The epidermal growth factor receptor–targeting antibody-drug conjugate AM1-15 inhibited growth of tumor xenografts and did not cause cardiovascular toxicity nor dose-limiting thrombocytopenia in monkeys. While an unprecedented BCL-X L –mediated toxicity was uncovered in monkey kidneys upon repeat dosing of AM1-15, this toxicity was mitigated via further drug-linker modification to afford AM1-AAA (AM1-25).

Here, we demonstrate a transparent and flexible metal oxide–based photovoltaic neuromorphic defensive system. By using a monolithically integrated ultraflexible optoelectronic circuitry and electrochromic device, seamless neural processing for ultraviolet (UV) radiation shielding including history-based sensing, memorizing, risk recognition, and blocking can be realized with piling the entire signal chain into the flexible devices.

          "abstract": "Pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate host cell membrane dynamics, a crucial adaptation to survive in hostile environments shaped by innate immune responses. Plant-derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TOPGAP, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TOPGAP as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a, a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TOPGAP, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co-opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens.",

VGLL3 depletion impairs the accumulation of RNF8 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, leading to reduced homologous recombination efficiency and increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, VGLL3 can prevent CtIP from KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through competitive binding with KLHL15 and, meanwhile, stabilize MDC1 by limiting TRIP12-MDC1 but promoting USP7-MDC1 associations for optimal RNF8 signaling initiation. Consistently, VGLL3 depletion delays tumor development and sensitizes the xenografts to etoposide treatment. Overall, our results reveal an unexpected role of VGLL3 in DDR, which is distinct from its transcriptional cofactor function and not conserved among VGLL family members.",

The RC-LH1 monomer is composed of an RC encircled by an open LH1 ring comprising 15 αβ heterodimers and a PufX transmembrane polypeptide. In the RC-LH1 dimer, two crossing PufX polypeptides mediate dimerization. Unlike Rhodabacter sphaeroides counterpart, Rba. blasticus RC-LH1 dimer has a less bent conformation, lacks the PufY subunit near the LH1 opening, and includes two extra LH1 αβ subunits, forming a more enclosed S-shaped LH1 ring. Spectroscopic assays reveal that these unique structural features are accompanied by changes in the kinetics of quinone/quinol trafficking between RC-LH1 and cytochrome bc 1 .

The resulting readout can be high fidelity and QND, but readout times are currently limited to the order of 50 nanoseconds due to the dispersive cross-Kerr of magnitude 10 megahertz. Here, we present a readout scheme that uses the quarton coupler to facilitate a large (greater than 200 megahertz) cross-Kerr between a transmon qubit and its readout resonator. Full master equation simulations of the coupled system show a 5-nanosecond readout time with greater than 99% readout fidelity and greater than 99.9% QND fidelity. The quartonic readout circuit is experimentally feasible and preserves the coherence properties of the qubit. Our work reveals a path for order of magnitude improvements of superconducting qubit readout by engineering nonlinear light-matter couplings in parameter regimes unreachable by existing designs.",

Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)–mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging.

We find a gradual increase in human habitat preferences toward rough terrains until about 1.1 million years ago (Ma), followed by a 300 thousand-year-long contraction of the ecological niche. This period coincided with the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and previously hypothesized ancestral population bottlenecks. Our statistical analysis further reveals that from 0.8 Ma onward, the human niche expanded again, with human species (e.g., H. heidelbergensis , H. neanderthalensis , and H. sapiens ) adapting to rougher terrain, colder and drier conditions, and toward regions of higher ecological diversity.",

We find that modest delay of paternal mitochondrial elimination (PME) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos unexpectedly impairs mating and cognition of adult animals and alters their locomotion behaviors. Delayed PME causes decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in early embryos, which lead to impaired physiological functions of adult animals through an energy-sensing pathway mediated by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase, AAK-2, and a forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16. Treatment of PME-delayed animals with MK-4, a subtype of vitamin K 2 that can improve mitochondrial ATP production, restores ATP levels in early embryos, and rescues physiological defects of adult animals. Our results suggest that moderate PME delay during embryo development adversely affects crucial physiological functions in adults, which could be evolutionarily disadvantageous. These observations provide mechanistic explanations for the need to swiftly remove paternal mitochondria early during embryo development.",

The molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic organization of ACCs is largely unknown. Here, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy (EM) structure of human ACC1 in its inactive state, which forms a unique filament structure and is in complex with acetyl-CoA. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of human ACC1 activated by dephosphorylation and citrate treatment, at a resolution of 2.55 Å. Notably, the covalently linked biotin binds to a site that is distant from the acetyl-CoA binding site when acetyl-CoA is absent, suggesting a potential coordination between biotin binding and acetyl-CoA binding. These findings provide insights into the structural dynamics and regulatory mechanisms of human ACCs.",

Deletion of p63 results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells. In human esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (eNEC) cells, p63 is transcriptionally silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Up-regulation of the major p63 isoform ΔNp63α, through either ectopic expression or EZH2 inhibition, promotes squamous transdifferentiation of eNEC cells.

CED-9 is thought to inhibit apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic C. elegans APAF-1 homolog CED-4. We show that CED-9 or CED-4 mutations located in their CED-9–CED-4 binding regions reduce apoptosis without affecting the CED-9 anti-apoptotic function. These mutant CED-9 and CED-4 proteins are defective in a CED-9–CED-4 interaction in vitro and in vivo, revealing that the known CED-9–CED-4 interaction is required for the pro-apoptotic but not for the anti-apoptotic function of CED-9. The pro-apoptotic CED-9–CED-4 interaction occurs at mitochondria. In mammals, BCL-2 family members can activate APAF-1 via cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The conserved role of mitochondria in CED-9/BCL-2–dependent CED-4/APAF-1 activation is notable and suggests that understanding how CED-9 promotes apoptosis in C. elegans could inform the understanding of mammalian apoptosis and how disruptions of apoptosis promote certain human disorders.",

We link prolonged withdrawal from cocaine to the depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z, coupled with increased genome accessibility and latent priming of gene transcription, in D1 dopamine receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) that relate to aberrant gene expression upon drug relapse. The histone chaperone ANP32E removes H2A.Z from chromatin, and we demonstrate that D1 MSN–selective Anp32e knockdown prevents cocaine-induced H2A.Z depletion and blocks cocaine’s rewarding actions. By contrast, very different effects of cocaine exposure, withdrawal, and relapse were found for D2 MSNs.

The major pro-fission DRP1 receptor is mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kilodaltons (MiD49/51), which can sequester inactive DRP1. Together, they form a trimeric DRP1-MiD-MFF complex. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mediated phosphorylation of MFF is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify MFF as a target of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at Lys 151 , MFF SUMOylation is enhanced following AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and that MFF SUMOylation regulates the level of MiD binding to MFF. The mitochondrial stressor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) promotes MFF SUMOylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. However, CCCP-induced fragmentation is impaired in MFF-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing non-SUMOylatable MFF K151R. These data suggest that the AMPK-MFF SUMOylation axis dynamically controls stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by regulating the levels of MiD in trimeric fission complexes.",

During initial infection, HPV16, the most prevalent cancer-causing type, specifically interacts with heparan sulfates (HSs), not only enabling initial cell attachment but also triggering a crucial conformational change in viral capsids termed structural activation. It is unknown, whether these HPV16-HS interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high-affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs.",

We showed that, in the endolymphatic sac, where fluid reabsorption occurs, SLC26A4 is localized along the apical microvilli of mitochondria-rich cells, in contact with the endolymph, and associated with clathrin-coated pits where μ2 and AP-2 are present. Based on SLC26A4 structure, the elements involved in SLC26A4-μ2 interaction were identified and validated experimentally, allowing modeling of this interaction at the atomic level. Pharmacological inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis led to an increased plasma membrane abundance of hemagglutinin-tagged SLC26A4 virally or endogenously expressed in mitochondria-rich cells.

Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, the 21URNAs, are implicated in regulating coding sequences; the messenger RNA targets and biological processes they control during spermatogenesis are largely unknown. We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal of plk-3 results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells. Together, these results suggest that the 21URNAs function as pachytene piRNAs during C. elegans spermatogenesis.

The (U-Th)/He age thus directly dates the wettest interglacial period in the region over the last 500 thousand years, which was responsible for the dissolution that formed the pinnacles. The reliability of the ferricrete (U-Th)/He age is supported by bounding optically stimulated luminescence and U-Th dates on associated aeolianites and carbonate precipitates, respectively.

Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential. However, both cell cycle reentry and neurogenic gene expression are allowed when applying sequential pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments.

In contrast, generation of the ADO knockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism.",

Metal-free magnetism is of fundamental interest to physical sciences, unlocking unprecedented dimensions for strongly correlated materials and biocompatible magnets. Here, we present a strategy to achieve strong coupling between spin centers of planar radical monomers in π-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) polymers and rationally control the orderings. If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer.

However, oxidative stabilization of Sn(II) has remained an unresolved challenge as its reactivity with water and dioxygen results in loss of functionality, limiting technological advancement. Approaches to slow Sn(II) oxidation with chelating ligands or sacrificial electron donors have yielded only moderate improvements. We demonstrate here that the addition of nitrate to pyrophosphate-chelated Sn(II) (aq) suppresses Sn(II) oxidation in water across a broad pH range. Evidence of hydroxyl radical concentration reduction and detection of a radical nitrogen species that only forms in the presence of chelated Sn(II) point to a radical-based reaction mechanism. While this chemistry can be broadly applied, we present that this approach maintains Sn(II)’s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory efficacies as an example of sustained oral chemotherapeutic functionality.",

However, the dynamic changes of plasma commensal viruses and their role in HIV/simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) pathogenesis are rarely reported. Here, we investigated the longitudinal changes of plasma virome, inflammation levels, and disease markers using an SIV-infected Macaca leonina model. Large expansions of plasma Anelloviridae , Parvoviridae , Circoviridae and other commensal viruses, and elevated levels of inflammation and D-dimer were observed since the chronic phase of SIV infection. Anelloviridae abundance appears to correlate positively with the CD4 + T cell count but negatively with SIV load especially at the acute phase, whereas other commensal viruses’ abundances show opposite correlations with the two disease markers. Antiretroviral therapy slightly reduces but does not substantially reverse the expansion of commensal viruses. Furthermore, 1387 primate anellovirus open reading frame 1 sequences of more than 1500 nucleotides were annotated. The data reveal different roles of commensal viruses in SIV pathogenesis.",

We demonstrate that a regular sequence structure facilitated the formation of big nanofibers with a high degree of aggregation, providing the loose and porous thin film with simultaneously improved charge transport, stretchability, and self-healability. The mobility of damaged devices can be recovered to 81% after a healing treatment. Fully stretchable transistor based on the designed polymer exhibited a greatly enhanced mobility up to 1.08 square centimeters per volt per second under 100% strain, which is an unprecedented value and constitutes a major step for the development of intrinsically stretchable and healable semiconducting polymers.",

Limited perfusion coupled with the high metabolic demand of growing tumors has led to the hypothesis that many tumors experience metabolic stress driven by limited availability of nutrients such as glucose, oxygen, and amino acids in the tumor. Such metabolic stress has important implications for the biology of cells in the microenvironment, affecting both disease progression and response to therapies. Recently, techniques have been developed to identify limiting nutrients and resulting metabolic stresses in solid tumors. These techniques have greatly expanded our understanding of the metabolic limitations in tumors.

While dysregulation of the splicing process is considered a cancer hallmark, the role of certain splicing factors remains unknown in PCa. This study focuses on characterizing the levels and role of SRSF6 in this disease. Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperone HIRA , consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells. These findings underscore SRSF6 as a promising therapeutic target for PCa/advanced-stage PCa.",

However, in real systems with the finite thickness of the device material being larger than the magnetic exchange length, the skyrmion spin texture extends into the third dimension and cannot be assumed as homogeneous. Using soft x-ray laminography, we reconstruct with about 20-nanometer spatial (voxel) size the full three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion in an 800-nanometer-diameter and 95-nanometer-thin disk patterned into a 30× [iridium/cobalt/platinum] multilayered film. A quantitative analysis finds that the evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number is nonuniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of the micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile are related to nonuniform competing energetic interactions. Our results provide a foundation for nanoscale metrology for spintronics devices using topology as a design parameter.",

While the search process is conventionally described by a linear “scanning” model, its exquisitely dynamic nature has restricted detailed mechanistic study. Here, we observed single Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal scanning complexes in real time, finding that they scan diverse mRNA leaders at a rate of 10 to 20 nt s −1 . We show that specific binding of a protein to its mRNA leader sequence substantially arrests scanning. Conversely, impairing scanning-complex guanosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis results in native start-site bypass. Our results illustrate an mRNA-centric, kinetically controlled regulatory model where the ribosomal pre-initiation complex amplifies a nuanced energetic landscape to regulate scanning and start-site selection fidelity.",

Although PC is one of the major phospholipids constituting bilayer membranes in eukaryotes, certain bacterial species encode PmtA, a membrane-associated methyltransferase, to produce PC, which is correlated with cellular stress responses, adaptability to environmental changes, and symbiosis or virulence with eukaryotic hosts. Depending on the organism, multiple PmtAs may be required for producing monomethyl- and dimethyl-PE derivatives along with PC, whereas in organisms such as Rubellimicrobium thermophilum , a single enzyme is sufficient to direct all three methylation steps. In this study, we present the x-ray crystal structures of PmtA from R. thermophilum in complex with dimethyl-PE and S -adenosyl- l -homocysteine, as well as in its lipid-free form. Moreover, we demonstrate that the enzyme associates with the cellular membrane via electrostatic interactions facilitated by a group of critical basic residues and can successively methylate PE and its methylated derivatives, culminating in the production of PC.",

Unexpectedly, the tendons’ collagen molecules were not mechanically unfolded by running but denatured through proteolysis during physiological post-run remodeling. We further revealed that running induces inflammatory gene expressions in Achilles tendons and that long-term running causes prolonged, elevated collagen degradation, leading to the accumulation of denatured collagen and tendinopathy development. For applications, we demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging of collagenase-induced Achilles tendon injury in vivo using a denatured collagen targeting contrast agent.

In this study, we uncovered that NOD1, a well-studied member of NLR family, exhibits predominant expression in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and correlates positively with improved prognosis and responses to anti–PD-1 treatments in patients with HCC. Activation of NOD1 in vivo augments antitumor immunity and enhances the effectiveness of anti–PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, NOD1 activation resulted in diminished expression of perilipin 5, thereby hindering fatty acid oxidation and inducing free fatty acid accumulation in TAMs. This metabolic alteration promoted membrane localization of the costimulatory molecule OX40L in a lipid modification–dependent manner, thereby activating CD8 + T cells.

A single-crystalline layered RPP nanoflake is used as the active layer and sandwiched between two few-layer graphene contacts, forming van der Waals LEDs (vdWLEDs). Strong electroluminescence (EL) emission with a low turn-on current density of ~20 pA μm −2 and high EQE exceeding 10% is observed at room temperature, which sets the benchmark for the EQE of vdWLEDs ever recorded. Such efficient EL emission is attributed to the inherent multiple quantum well structure and high photoluminescence quantum yield (~35%) of RPPs and a low charge injection barrier of ~0.10 eV facilitated by the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism.

This discrepancy has led to suggestions that models fail to accurately simulate changes in weather patterns caused by Arctic warming. Here, we show that the observed frequency and intensity of midlatitude cold extremes have strongly decreased since 1990 and are consistent with modeled trends. The previously reported increase in cold extremes was overestimated due to an artifact of changing data coverage. We also show that the fraction of land with observed cold extreme increases over recent decades is consistent with model internal variability on top of a near-uniform forced reduction in cold extremes across the midlatitudes.

Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves. In this study, we demonstrate this quantum interference effect using massive particles that tunnel between three micro-optical traps (“optical tweezers”). We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in low vibrational eigenstates of one trap, followed by manipulating the distance between the traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth and high-efficiency transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, with a very low population remaining in the central trap.

Here, we show that a membrane channel protein, chloride intracellular channel protein-1 (Clic1), can physically interact with ERα with a preference to the membrane-bound ERα. Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E 2 and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E 2 -induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E 2 on female body weight balance.
