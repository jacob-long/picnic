          "abstract": "Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’ 1–6 . This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 7–9 . However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains 10–12 . The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence shows elevated circulating long-chain ceramide levels predict atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) independently of cholesterol1,2. Although targeting ceramide signaling may provide therapeutic benefits beyond the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, the underlying mechanism by which circulating ceramides aggravate ASCVD remains elusive. We examined whether circulating long-chain ceramides activate membrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to exacerbate atherosclerosis. We performed a systematic screen combining G protein signaling quantification, bioinformatic analysis of GPCRs expression, and functional examination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the results suggested CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 are potential endogenous receptors of C16:0 ceramide-evoked inflammasome activation in both endothelial cells and macrophages. We found that inhibiting CYSLTR2/P2RY6 genetically or pharmacologically alleviated ceramide-induced atherosclerosis aggravation. Additionally, increased ceramide levels correlated with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. Notably, CYSLTR2/P2RY6 deficiency mitigated chronic kidney disease (CKD)-aggravated atherosclerosis in mice, without affecting cholesterol or ceramide levels. Structural analysis of the ceramide-CYSLTR2-Gq complexes revealed that both C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides bind within an inclined channel-like ligand binding pocket on CYSLTR2. We further revealed an unconventional mechanism underlying ceramides-induced CYSLTR2 activation and CYSLTR2-Gq interface. Overall, our study provided structural and molecular mechanisms that long-chain ceramides initiate transmembrane Gq and inflammasome signaling through directly binding to CYSLTR2 and P2RY6 receptors, and blocking these signaling may provide new therapeutic potential to treat atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood 1–5 . Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",

          "authors": "Jiaxuan Qi, Drew C. Schreiner, Miles Martinez, John Pearson, Richard Mooney",
          "abstract": "Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours.",

          "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2,3,4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation generally reduces biodiversity at the patch scale (α diversity)1. However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2,3,4,5,6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales.",

          "abstract": "In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock 1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion 2 and systemic hyperinflammation 3 . The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5 ). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Kasdin, Alison Duffy, Nathan Nadler, Arnav Raha, Adrienne L. Fairhall, Kimberly L. Stachenfeld, Vikram Gadagkar",
          "abstract": "Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning.",

          "abstract": "Frictional interfaces are found in systems ranging from biological joints to earthquake faults. When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27,28,29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34.",

The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials with high recoverable elastic energy density, which we refer to as high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials, can offer many enhanced properties, including efficient mechanical energy storage1,2, load-bearing capability, impact resistance and motion agility. These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3,4,5,6,7,8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9,10,11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest.",

Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front.

          "authors": "Gemma Conroy",
          "abstract": "Resilience at work isn’t about wearing a suit of armour, but instead about learning when to persist and when to pivot.Credit: Getty\n\nMore than a decade ago, palaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius received some bad news: her mother had brain cancer. Praetorius was deep in her graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, but she somehow managed to juggle her mother’s care with her demanding workload. But in just a few short months, Praetorius’s mother died.\n\nIn the aftermath, Praetorius seemed like a picture of resilience to her colleagues as she continued to work and go to lectures. But beneath the surface she was torn between her grief and her desire to keep going with her graduate studies. The only way she felt she could stay on top of the demands of her studies was to shelve her emotions. “I often wanted to quit because I felt so run down and threadbare,” says Praetorius, who is now at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. “But there wasn’t really the option.”\n\nHow a lupus diagnosis taught me that resilience in science is a double-edged sword\n\nPraetorius’s experience captures academia’s often misguided view of resilience — the ability to adapt and overcome challenges or adversity. Academia isn’t the only environment that encourages people to put on a brave face when the going gets tough — other workplaces show a similar cultural tendency. There’s no doubt that resilience is a necessary skill for dealing with the inevitable failure, rejection and fierce competition that comes with building a research career. Some institutions, including the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Imperial College London, are running courses that aim to help researchers to develop the resilience needed to navigate tough career challenges and maintain their well-being.\n\nBut some researchers say that the culture of academia is perpetuating harmful misconceptions about resilience, such as implying that researchers should ‘tough it out’ in a toxic environment. Others think that institutions need to do more to address systemic problems — such as low pay and a lack of inclusivity — before they place the onus on researchers to always weather the storm. “Instead of teaching people to dodge stones that we have thrown at them, it would be better not to throw stones from the very beginning,” says Roman Zviagintsev, an educational-equality researcher at the University of Vienna.\n\nWhat resilience is — and isn’t\n\nA simple definition of resilience is that “when something bad happens, it doesn’t derail you”, says David Yeager, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But this view has its limitations and underlies a lot of myths about resilience, such as equating it with suppressing negative emotions, adds Yeager. That approach, he says, often makes matters worse in the long run. “It’s a very poor emotion-regulation strategy,” says Yeager. Another harmful myth is that resilience is about continuing to work in environments in which inequity, disparity and bullying are rife, says Paul Seldon, a pharmacologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute (ECRI).\n\nThe expectation to live up to this version of resilience is familiar to Emily Wharton, a biomechanics researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, UK. On International Women’s Day in 2023, Wharton gave a presentation to her department about the issues students were facing regarding inclusivity, along with her own experiences. But a senior male colleague dismissed her concerns and struggled to understand where she was coming from. Although some other senior colleagues were supportive afterwards, most of them advised her not to share too much about her personal experiences. “I got told that I need to toughen up if I want to be in this world,” says Wharton. “Basically — I need to change,” rather than there being a shift in other people’s behaviour or the wider system, she says.\n\nPalaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius advises researchers to prioritize themselves during tough times.Credit: USGS\n\nBut true resilience isn’t about wearing a suit of armour to work or persisting with goals at the expense of mental health. Instead, it’s about making “calm, intentioned decisions in the face of setback and disappointment”, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the NIH’s Office of Intramural Training and Education (OITE) in Bethesda, Maryland. This often means setting boundaries and learning to say no to unreasonable demands or requests that don’t match a researcher’s values, she says. “It is the ability to know when to persist and when to pivot,” says Milgram.\n\nCommunication barriers for a Deaf PhD student meant risking burnout\n\nFor instance, an early-career researcher might continue working with a bully who is an influential principal investigator because they see them as a necessary stepping stone in their career. But in this case, finding a way out of this toxic situation is healthier than sticking it out and putting up with abuse, say interviewees.\n\nResilience also isn’t a fixed trait that people are born with, but a skill that is developed and practised over time (see ‘How to become resilient, the healthy way’), says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. A big part of building resilience involves reflecting on challenges rather than reacting to them, as well as considering failures as opportunities to learn. “These are habits that need to be developed all the time, so they are there when adversity strikes,” she says.\n\nHow to become resilient, the healthy way\n\nShift your mindset. It’s easy to fall prey to negative ‘self-talk’ after a big grant rejection or failed experiment. But reframing thoughts to focus on what can be learnt from the experience can help you to bounce back sooner, says Diane Safer, who heads graduate career and professional development at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. “Instead of saying, ‘I’m really not good at that,’ it’s changing your mindset and saying, ‘I’m not good at that yet,’” says Safer.\n\nBe assertive. Contrary to popular belief, resilience isn’t about powering through challenges with superhuman strength and accommodating every demand, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Intramural Training and Education in Bethesda, Maryland. It’s about developing the assertiveness to set boundaries, say ‘no’ and ask for help. “It isn’t suffering because we’re supposed to work hard,” says Milgram. “It’s making sure we are doing something that brings us joy and value.”\n\nRemember your ‘why’. Although academia prizes prestige, publications and metrics, having a strong sense of purpose often has a more positive effect on mental health, says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. “If you think about the purpose of science, it is about supporting the greater good and contributing knowledge,” says Dorjee. “That’s the primary drive, rather than awards.”\n\nBuild your connections. Developing resilience doesn’t just depend on individual effort. It also comes down to having strong social connections and support, which can help researchers to maintain their self-confidence and adaptability, says Paul Seldon, a cell biologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College London’s Early Career Research Institute. “It’s recognizing the need to be emotionally connected, beyond social media, having a work–life balance and accepting help,” says Seldon.",

          "abstract": "Jay Bhattacharya, whom President Trump nominated as director of the National Institutes of Health, speaks with senators on 5 March during his confirmation hearing.Credit: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty\n\nAmid confusion about cuts affecting the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), Jay Bhattacharya, US President Donald Trump’s nominee for NIH director, said on Wednesday that he is committed to ensuring that scientists at the NIH and those who receive NIH grants have the funding to do their work ― but he was vague on how he would accomplish that.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the US Senate, Bhattacharya, who is a health economist at Stanford University in California, also seemed to distance himself from the recent turmoil at the agency. Grant processing has largely ground to a halt, and roughly 1,200 of the NIH’s 20,000 staff members were fired in mid-February. “I wasn’t involved in the personnel decisions to date,” he said, when asked about the firings. But he did not commit to rehiring those who have lost their jobs.\n\n“I thought that he came across as very reasonable,” said Carole LaBonne, a stem-cell biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. The exception, she said, was Bhattacharya’s discussion of COVID-19 ― a topic that has divided him from many scientists because of his views on lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n“What I was most disturbed by during the hearing was that the topic of basic science didn’t come up,” LaBonne added. That omission led her to worry that Bhattacharya does not understand its importance, she said.\n\nTumultuous times\n\nIf confirmed, Bhattacharya will helm an agency with a budget of roughly US$47 billion, making it the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nBut since Trump, a Republican, took office for the second time in January, there has been a sharp decline in new research grants awarded, leaving many scientists in limbo. Trump officials have also used procedural manoeuvres to prevent grant-review meetings from taking place, and the agency announced on 7 February that research ‘indirect cost’ funding, which is key to the functioning of universities across the country, would be capped, effective immediately. Courts have put many of these measures on hold.\n\nBhattacharya gained public prominence after co-authoring an open letter called the Great Barrington Declaration. Published in October 2020, it argued against COVID-19 lockdowns and in favour of normality to allow ‘herd immunity’ to take hold ― a proposal that was knocked down by numerous scientists and NIH officials. Francis Collins, the head of the NIH at the time, told television broadcaster Fox News in 2021 that “hundreds of thousands of people would have died if we had followed that strategy”. Bhattacharya also opposed vaccine and mask mandates.\n\nFresh priorities\n\nAt his confirmation hearing, Bhattacharya laid out his five priorities for the NIH: chronic disease research, research reproducibility, encouraging a culture of “scientific dissent”, funding cutting-edge research and regulating “risky research that has the possibility of causing a pandemic”.\n\nBhattacharya said that he would make sure that all scientists at the NIH and all those supported by the NIH “have the resources they need to do their research”. Asked whether he would immediately restart grant-review meetings, he responded, “Absolutely. My job would be to ensure that those fundamental scientific meetings and other activities happen.” He also affirmed the need for NIH funding to address the health needs of “minority populations” and for long COVID research.\n\nBut he didn’t commit explicitly to allowing new grants to start flowing again, or to rehiring NIH employees who were fired. Both Democratic and Republican senators brought up the 15% indirect-cost cap that the NIH attempted to impose on universities. Bhattacharya agreed that these funds pay for important things. But he also said that “there’s a lot of distrust” about how that money is spent, and he endorsed audits of indirect-cost spending.\n\nVaccine messaging\n\nBhattacharya spoke carefully when discussing infectious disease: if he is confirmed, his future boss will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, who has a long history of anti-vaccine activism. When asked about Kennedy’s statement at an anti-vaccine conference in 2023 that the NIH should give infectious-disease science “a break for about eight years,” Bhattacharya responded that Kennedy is “fully committed” to addressing the nation’s health needs, “including infectious disease”.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?",

Until now, they had been managed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York. The new organization, named openRxiv, will have a board of directors and a scientific and medical advisory board. It is supported by a fresh US$16-million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the projects’ main financial backer.\n\n“It’s just exciting to see this key piece of infrastructure really get the attention that it deserves as a dedicated initiative,” says Katie Corker, executive director of ASAPbio, a scientist-driven non-profit organization, which is based in San Francisco, California. Preprints are “the backbone of the scientific publishing ecosystem, maybe especially at the current moment, when there’s a lot of worries about who has control of information.”\n\nThe launch of openRxiv “reflects a maturation of the projects”, which started as an experiment at CSHL, says Richard Sever, a co-founder of both servers and chief science and strategy officer at openRxiv. It has “become so important that they should have their own organization running them, which is focused on the long-term sustainability of the servers, as opposed to being a side project within a big research institution”, says Sever.\n\nThousands of submissions\n\nSince its launch in 2013, bioRxiv, which covers biological science, including neuroscience, bioinformatics and genomics — has posted about 268,000 preprints by more than 970,000 authors. Its younger sibling medRxiv — founded in 2019 to cover medical sciences — has nearly 64,000 preprints from more than 380,000 authors.

          "title": "Alcohol and cancer risk: what you need to know",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Early this year, the US surgeon general issued a bombshell report. Before his term ended in January, Vivek Murthy warned that alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer and called for alcoholic drinks to carry cancer warning labels as cigarette packs do. The report1 triggered a flurry of headlines about a risk that many people ignore.\n\nThe link between alcohol and cancer is not new. Scientists first labelled alcohol as a carcinogen more than 35 years ago, and the evidence has only grown since. “I don’t think the relationship between alcohol and certain cancers is terribly controversial,” says Tim Naimi, an alcohol epidemiologist at the University of Victoria, Canada.\n\nWhat has been less clear is the level of drinking at which cancer risk starts to rise, and how to weigh that elevated risk against alcohol’s other impacts — in particular, the fiercely debated claim that low or moderate drinking improves heart health for some people. “Drinking a lot is absolutely bad,” says Emmanuela Gakidou, who analyses alcohol risks at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, Washington. “It’s the low-to-moderate amount of alcohol where the debate is.”\n\nAll this information can leave people feeling confused. What exactly is low or moderate drinking? And how should people weigh up any enjoyment they might get from drinking with the risks? “A lot of people enjoy drinking, and they don’t like to be told that something they really enjoy is bad for you,” Gakidou says.\n\nThe cancer connection\n\nFor decades, scientists have been building a case that alcohol causes cancer. Because testing alcohol’s effects in randomized trials is difficult, they have instead drawn on other types of research. Several huge cohort studies that track many tens of thousands of people have found that alcohol is linked to higher rates of some types of cancer. One massive 2015 meta-analysis2 — which pooled the results of hundreds of cohort studies and other research, including more than 485,000 cancer cases — found that risks of developing several cancers rose with the level of consumption.\n\nWhy are so many young people getting cancer? What the data say\n\nBut cohort studies have weaknesses. Researchers have to control for other confounding factors that could contribute to cancer risk, such as the fact that heavy drinkers are more likely to smoke than those who drink less, and people who drink small amounts of alcohol tend to have other healthy habits. And scientists know that study participants often say they drink less than they really do. Some studies attempt to adjust for this by inflating the levels of drinking to match those expected from alcohol sales, says Peter Sarich, an epidemiologist at the Daffodil Centre, a cancer research centre in Sydney, Australia.\n\nOther evidence comes from animal experiments and from laboratory studies that have identified mechanisms by which alcohol can cause cancer. The most well-established is that ethanol is broken down into acetaldehyde, a toxin that damages DNA.\n\nScientists like to look at the sum of evidence, and there are two syntheses of research that are considered particularly definitive for alcohol and cancer. One is from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the World Health Organization’s cancer branch. The agency classed drinking alcohol as carcinogenic to humans in 1988 — putting it in the same category as tobacco smoke and asbestos — and restated that view3 in 2007.\n\nThe other synthesis is from the Global Cancer Update Programme, a continuing effort to assess the totality of evidence on links between cancer, physical activity, body weight and diet (including alcohol) using systematic reviews and a panel of specialists to assess the strength of the evidence. The programme’s most recent report4, in 2018, concluded that there is strong evidence that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of several cancers.\n\n“Because we have such a rigorous process, people have got confidence in the outcomes,” says Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at the World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF) in London, which runs the project with several other cancer-research charities.\n\nOn the basis of such syntheses, researchers agree that alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer: mouth, throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx), oesophagus, breast cancer in women, colorectal and liver. Scientists suspect that other cancer types will be added as more data are collected.\n\nStudies present this risk in different ways. One complication is that, in alcohol studies and guidelines, the amount of alcohol in a ‘standard’ drink differs between countries: a standard drink in the United States contains 14 grams of ethanol, in Canada it holds 13.45 g, in Australia 10 g and the in United Kingdom 8 g.\n\nIn the surgeon general’s report, the results from a large cohort study5 led by Sarich were used to calculate the absolute risks of developing any of the seven cancer types above (see ‘Cancer risk goes up’). This showed that around 17 out of 100 women who drink either nothing or less than one standard US drink per week (14 g ethanol) would develop such a cancer in their lifetime. This was taken as the baseline level of risk. This number rose to nearly 22 out of 100 in women who have two drinks per day (28 g ethanol) on average. Therefore, five more women would develop cancer owing to the higher level of alcohol consumption.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nFor men, the lifetime risk of developing one of these seven cancer types rose from a baseline of about 10 in 100 for those who don’t drink or have less than one standard drink per week, to about 13 out of 100 for those who, on average, have two drinks daily. The sex difference is because breast cancers account for a large number of cancers that are attributable to alcohol in women but not in men.\n\nRising risks\n\nBut what about people who drink very little? In the past few years, scientists have been zeroing in on the level of drinking at which cancer risk starts to rise. “We suspect that this question may have different answers for different cancer types,” says Jürgen Rehm, who studies the harms of alcohol and drugs at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada.\n\nRehm says the answer is clearest for breast cancer in women thanks in part to several large cohort studies that included many people who didn’t drink much. A systematic review6 of such studies, which was published last year, found that cancer risks were raised slightly in those who had half a drink (5 g of ethanol) per day — the lowest level examined. “And frankly, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to go down further, because I mean, who drinks one-quarter of a drink?” says Rehm.\n\nAlmost half of cancer deaths are preventable\n\nIn the 2018 Global Cancer Update Programme report4, the panel concluded that any amount of alcohol increased the risk of mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophageal and breast cancer. For these conditions, “we find no lower threshold”, Croker says. The WCRF’s position, which is similar to that of the World Health Organization, is that there is no ‘safe’ level that does not increase overall cancer risk.\n\nFor some other cancer types, the panel found that elevated risks were most apparent at slightly greater levels of alcohol consumption. The risks of colorectal cancer increased above 30 g of ethanol per day (more than two US standard drinks), and liver cancer risks increased above 45 g per day (more than three US standard drinks). Lower levels of alcohol might still increase the risk of developing these cancers, but there wasn’t enough evidence to say.\n\nThe risks from low or moderate drinking can be hard to discern, partly because it is difficult for studies to define a reliable comparison group of people who don’t drink. Scientists know that some people stop drinking alcohol because their health is already declining: what researchers call sick-quitters. And some claim to be lifetime abstainers when records show they did drink in the past, says Naimi. Therefore, the ‘non-drinking’ group in a study might include unhealthy former drinkers.\n\n“The whole evidence base around moderate drinking is scientifically frail — and that would be a charitable characterization,” Naimi says.\n\nAlcohol versus smoking\n\nA few years ago, Nick Sheron, a liver physician working at the University of Southampton, UK, did a quick calculation on the comparative risks of drinking and smoking. He said he was so surprised by the result that “I spent a long time trying to prove that I was wrong”. But he couldn’t — and epidemiologists he worked with agreed the numbers were right.\n\nThe study7 they published, in 2019, estimated that for non-smokers, drinking one bottle of wine per week was associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk of 1% for men and 1.4% for women. (So, if 1,000 men and 1,000 women consumed a bottle of wine each week, an estimated 10 men and 14 women would develop cancer as a consequence.) This, they found, was equivalent to men smoking five cigarettes per week and women smoking ten. (Drinking three bottles per week was equivalent to men smoking eight cigarettes and women smoking 23 — more than a pack.)\n\nThis wine bottle from 2018 includes alcohol recommendations from the UK chief medical officers. Some countries have considered adding alcohol warning labels that highlight cancer risk.Credit: Carolyn Jenkins/Alamy",

          "abstract": "China has introduced security-focused laws that affect researchers who want to send data overseas.Credit: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty\n\nDonald Trump’s second term as US president has brought fresh fears that the administration could resurrect the China Initiative, which launched legal cases against scientists from the country in a bid to counter scientific espionage.\n\nIn China, too, foreign researchers are navigating an increasingly authoritarian, security-focused environment. They have not faced a targeted campaign such as the China Initiative, and many still feel welcomed in the country. But tough regulations following the COVID-19 pandemic, new data laws and other restrictions pose challenges.\n\nUS and China sign new science pact — but with severe restrictions\n\n“There used to be a lot more foreigners, including foreign scientists, in China before COVID,” says an overseas researcher in Beijing, who did not want to be named because of uncertainty about how authorities might react. “So many friends left in the last five years.” But the researcher has a great job, which has kept them from leaving. “I love it here,” they say.\n\nStatistics on foreign researchers in China are hard to come by, but the number is thought to be relatively small. Halldór Berg Harðarson, who lived in Beijing and until last year ran Euraxess, a platform supporting European researchers in China, has analysed author names on scholarly publications and estimates that there are 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers in the country who have a PhD. By contrast, there are estimated to be at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nLockdown worries\n\nThe Chinese government’s strict management of the pandemic is one reason this number is low and has fallen over the past few years. China prevented foreigners who left from returning during parts of 2020, and imposed ultra-strict lockdown measures in 2022. “The way that they dealt with it from the beginning was not very conducive to keeping foreign talent,” says Harðarson, who now lives in Brussels. He returned to Europe for family and career reasons.\n\nA Euraxess survey found that by autumn 2022, 40–50% of foreign academics had left China, compared with 2019 figures. “It became very restrictive, really quickly,” says Harðarson. “That was a big factor.”\n\nThe anonymous researcher in Beijing recalls health officials calling in the middle of the night demanding that they take a new COVID-19 test after their previous test results were inconclusive.\n\nThe pandemic was “quite tough”, says another foreign academic in southern China, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely without needing approval from his research institution. The researcher says that foreigners experienced hostility because they were thought to be more likely to be infected with COVID-19 — for instance, some residents avoided sitting next to them on public transport. (China’s Ministry of Science and Technology did not respond to Nature’s request for comment about concerns about the impact of pandemic lockdowns.)\n\nChina’s strict restrictions during the COVID pandemic prompted an exodus of foreign researchers from China.Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nThe COVID-19 response gave foreign researchers a “dramatic realization” of how much control the Chinese state could exert, says Kārlis Rokpelnis, a Beijing-based social scientist with 15 years’ experience in China, who runs Euraxess and spoke to Nature in a personal capacity.\n\nData laws\n\nWhat’s more, over the past decade, China has implemented security-focused laws that have increased “vigilance” over whether academics in China can send potentially sensitive research overseas, says Annina Lattu, an open-science researcher at Peking University in Beijing. Many countries have data regulations. “But China’s laws, I would say, sit on the strictest and most ambiguous end of the spectrum.”\n\nUncertainty over these laws has scuppered some joint research projects. “I’ve heard about collaboration projects that didn’t pan out, because they were not able to reach a clear understanding with their Chinese counterparts,” says Harðarson.\n\nFor example, China’s Data Security Law, which covers all data types, including research data, can require official clearance to send certain information outside China. There is an exemption for academic data, unless they contain personal information or are deemed “important”; these require official checks before being exported. But what counts as “important” hasn’t yet been clarified, says Rogier Creemers, a specialist on Chinese data laws at Leiden University in the Netherlands.\n\nSo far, the laws have mostly affected researchers working with medical data, says Rokpelnis. “I haven’t met anyone who said, ‘Oh, I wasn’t able to do my experiment,’” he says.\n\nVPN troubles\n\nAs in some other countries, posters warning of foreign spies have appeared in some Chinese research organizations, with a tip-off phone number. “The bad guy in the poster looked a lot like me,” says the researcher in southern China, recalling signage in his workplace. But, he says, “I haven’t felt anything about people accusing me of espionage.” In his experience, the Chinese companies he works with are less guarded about intellectual property than some UK firms he’s collaborated with.",

          "title": "The ‘quantum’ principle that says why atoms are as they are",
          "authors": "Olival Freire Jr, Thiago Hartz",
          "abstract": "What makes matter stable? Why are atoms as they are? Why do different materials vary in their properties, such as electrical conductivity, density, melting temperature or light-absorption spectra?\n\nSuch questions exercised physicists greatly in the decades after Dmitri Mendeleev introduced his periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869. They received new impetus around the turn of the twentieth century with J. J. Thomson’s discovery that atoms were not indivisible, but contained smaller, negatively charged entities called electrons — the first subatomic particles to be identified. Then, in 1911, came Ernest Rutherford’s discovery that atoms contain a central ‘nucleus’ of densely packed positive charge.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThis opened the door to a thrilling journey of discovery, to understand the rules governing subatomic structures. It reached some form of destination a century ago, at the beginning of 1925, with a principle that has underpinned our ideas of the stability of matter ever since.\n\nThis is the Pauli exclusion principle, named for the brilliant young Austrian theoretical physicist who devised it1, Wolfgang Pauli. It was a product of what is now labelled the old quantum theory — a period of ad hoc theorizing between 1900 and 1925 that led to the introduction of a consistent theory of quantum mechanics in 1925–27 by Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Max Born, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac and others. Pauli’s principle can be considered the apex of the old quantum theory and, unusually, survived to be incorporated into the new one. Its centenary is an occasion to remember the odyssey of physicists in attempting to understand, amend and test properties predicted by the periodic table, and how this principle has guided our understanding of matter — and not just the conventional stuff.\n\nBold hypotheses\n\nThe discovery of a charged substructure to atoms, which are neutral overall, created considerable difficulty for pictures of how atoms worked. In 1842, the mathematician Samuel Earnshaw showed that there is no stable, static distribution of such charges, ruling out static models of the atom. Yet, despite numerous attempts following the discovery of subatomic structure, no one could arrive at a model that achieved atomic stability and explained features such as the distinct, discrete spectral lines of light emitted by atoms of different elements.\n\nShortly after Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr began to attack this problem using quantum principles. He harnessed an idea introduced by Max Planck in 1900 to explain the spectrum of light emitted by a non-reflective ‘black body’ — that energy comes only in discrete chunks, or quanta. Bohr applied it to the spectrum of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen atoms. The basic hydrogen atom is the simplest of all atoms, now known to consist of a single proton and a single electron.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nBohr started with a picture in which electrons circle the atomic nucleus, rather as planets orbit a star. He postulated that there are specific values of orbital energies at which electrons do not radiate and, therefore, atoms remain stable. Light can be emitted and absorbed only at frequencies corresponding to the difference in energy between two of these stable orbits, which Bohr characterized with different values of a first, ‘principal’ quantum number2.\n\nThis bold hypothesis could explain some features of the hydrogen spectrum, but not all. Bohr’s odyssey continued, incorporating new spectroscopic data and theoretical conjectures. These were derived in part from classical mechanics, from applying the precepts of Albert Einstein’s 1905 special theory of relativity to atomic electrons, and by introducing more quantum ideas entirely at odds with classical physics. The ‘quantum of action’ introduced by Planck (now known as Planck’s constant, h, whose ‘reduced’ form when divided by 2π, ħ, is widely used), for example, suggests there is a minimum amount of energy a system can exchange. And Bohr’s own principle of correspondence stated that, when the principal quantum number is large, predictions achieved using this mixed theoretical toolkit should approach the results known from classical physics.\n\nThese efforts resulted in Bohr introducing two more quantum numbers3: an azimuthal quantum number, which represented the magnitude of the electron’s angular momentum; and the magnetic quantum number, which described the size of its magnetic moment. These additions made sense in Bohr’s picture of the atom: if the electron is moving along a circular orbit around the atomic nucleus, it would have an angular momentum; and as a charged body in circular motion, you would also expect it to have a magnetic moment.\n\nBut again, this couldn’t explain all features of the hydrogen spectrum. By 1923–24, the main puzzle was how to explain the Zeeman effect, in which new spectral lines appear when orbiting electrons interact with an external magnetic field. This is the point at which Pauli enters the story.\n\nElectron exclusion\n\nAt the turn of 1925, Pauli was just 24 years old. Already a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Hamburg, Germany, he was highly regarded by his peers. Since his youth in Vienna, he had been recognized as a mathematics prodigy — a mantle that he did not wear with ease, as is so often the case. He sought help through the new psychoanalysis promulgated by the psychologist Carl Jung, with whom Pauli maintained a lasting intellectual dialogue4. Pauli was a prolific correspondent, and his published letters are an important source for scientists as well as historians.\n\nWolfgang Pauli delivering a lecture in Copenhagen in 1929.Credit: Gondsmit/CERN/Science Photo Library\n\nPauli’s principle1 was informed by ideas from Edmund Clifton Stoner, but his approach was original — and unusual — in many senses. For a start, it seemed to be based mainly in numerology, with no direct connection to known physics. Pauli’s key addition to Bohr’s model was a fourth quantum number — one that, unlike Bohr’s, had no analogy with classical physics, and not even any visual representation in space-time. This new quantum number, spin, could have only two values, either +ħ/2 or −ħ/2. Electrons with opposite values of this quantum number would interact differently with an external magnetic field, leading to the splitting of spectral lines seen in the Zeeman effect.\n\nNowadays, we know that the spin quantum number cannot be interpreted visually: if you try to model an electron as a charged body spinning on its axis, you find its surface would be spinning at a velocity greater than that of light. It is the strongest indication in atomic models of just how bizarre quantum theory is, filled with features that defy classical intuitions.\n\nPauli did not formulate his exclusion principle on the basis of classical theories or dynamical principles, but stated it as a simple postulate: that no two electrons in an atom can share the same set of four quantum numbers. As characterized by historian John Heilbron, this statement was rather in the style of the biblical Ten Commandments: “It shall be forbidden for more than one electron [in the same atom] … to have the same values of [all applicable] quantum numbers”5. In this regard, Pauli anticipated the new quantum mechanics, which also — to the distress of many physicists, including Schrödinger and Einstein — abandoned intuitive visual models in the construction of the theory or in its interpretation.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "Microsoft unveiled its 'Majorana 1' quantum chip in February.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nA physicist has cast doubt on a test that underlies a high-profile claim by Microsoft to have created the first ‘topological qubits’, a long-sought goal of the company’s quantum-computing effort. The critique comes amid mounting speculation about the validity of Microsoft’s claim.\n\nMicrosoft announced the breakthrough, which could lead to a quantum computer that is more resistant to information loss than with other approaches, on 19 February. Without a peer-reviewed paper backing up the claim, some researchers were sceptical. An accompanying paper in Nature described a method to measure the read-out from future topological qubits, but did not offer proof of their existence1.\n\n“While the Nature paper outlined our approach, it does not speak to our progress,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. The paper was submitted almost a year before it was published and since then “tremendous progress has occurred”, they said. (Nature’s news team is independent of its journals team.)\n\nIn the latest critique, posted as a preprint2, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, UK, raises concerns about a test that Microsoft uses to look for Majoranas, so-far undiscovered quasiparticles arising from the collective behaviour of electrons that are needed for the topological qubits to work.\n\nKnown as the topological gap protocol (TGP), the test is not mentioned in the 19 February Microsoft announcement. But the company has subsequently indicated to Nature’s news team, and in a comment online, that it created the topological qubits using the TGP. “Since the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit are not there,” says Legg.\n\nChetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft’s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, stands by the qubit claim. “The criticism can be summarized as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that,” he says.\n\nA Majorana test\n\nMajoranas have previously proved elusive. Several claimed sightings later proved to be Majorana mimics, in some cases leading to retractions.\n\nIn 2022, Microsoft researchers posted a preprint reporting that the TGP could indirectly identify Majoranas with ‘high probability’; the preprint was later published in Physical Review B (PRB)3. The test relies on electronic measurements of microscopic sandwiches of ultracold metal. If the measurement exhibits a specific feature characteristic of Majoranas, the device ‘passes’ and is said to host the elusive particles.\n\nLegg and his colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland went on to report that the test could be fooled by false positives, doppelgangers with the electronic features of Majoranas that lack their useful properties4.\n\nIn his latest critique, Legg reports further flaws with the protocol. Examining data in the PRB paper, he saw large variations in the external conditions, such as the range of magnetic field strengths, when electronic measurements were taken. The test was designed to measure the intrinsic properties of the device — and thus whether it contained Majoranas. Instead, Legg found that varying conditions made the test an inconsistent weathervane.\n\nNayak does not accept this criticism. “The ranges come from an initial scan we describe, and we always analyse the full data,” he says.\n\nAnother problem, says Legg, is that a key parameter in the code that implements the protocol, which Microsoft shared publicly, differs from the description in the PRB paper. When asked by Nature’s news team about the issue, Nayak said: “Legg claims there’s a difference between our described protocol and the implemented code. This is incorrect, so this is a non-issue.” Legg says that Nayak previously acknowledged this difference in an e-mail to him and planned to issue a correction, but changed his mind.\n\nLegg’s critique is “certainly valid”, says Carlo Beenakker, a theoretical physicist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, although he remains “enthusiastic” about Microsoft’s goal of creating topological qubits. “I have a deep respect for people who basically go out and somehow are not distracted by others who say, ‘I don't believe it’,” he says.\n\nAnton Akhmerov, a theoretical physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that “Legg’s critique requires a public response from the Microsoft researchers”. A Microsoft spokesperson said that they would officially respond to Legg’s critique when contacted by editors of PRB.",

          "abstract": "Two new AI tools check for errors in research papers including in the calculations, methodology and references.Credit: Jose A. Bernat Bacete/Getty\n\nLate last year, media outlets worldwide warned that black plastic cooking utensils contained worrying levels of cancer-linked flame retardants. The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.\n\nThe incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”\n\nThe other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.\n\nBoth projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.\n\nThe projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.\n\nOthers add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.\n\nAI sleuths\n\nMany researchers have dedicated their careers to spotting integrity concerns in papers — and tools to check certain facets of papers already exist. But advocates hope that AI could carry out a wider range of checks in a single shot and handle a larger volume of papers.\n\nBoth the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.\n\nThe systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.\n\nThe rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.\n\nSo far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.\n\nFalse positives",

But it came amid a background of increasing political attacks against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn 2023, when Cooper and her co-authors distributed the survey, 88 pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation were enacted in the United States, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The LGBTQ+ community is afforded greater legal protections and acceptance in many parts of Europe, but an anti-LGBTQ+ disinformation backlash, reportedly orchestrated and financed mainly by Russia, seems to be growing there, as well.\n\nJess McLaughlin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Alaska, Anchorage, who identifies as trans and non-binary, says that although they didn’t take the survey, they aren’t surprised by the number of trans biologists who reported hostile, intimidating or offensive behavior. “It’s something we’ve known anecdotally,” McLaughlin says — and, for them, through personal experience.\n\nWhile teaching during their PhD at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, despite wearing men’s suits to class, McLaughlin was criticized in student evaluations as unprofessional. “The problem to them was that I was the one wearing the suit,” they say.\n\nBut an incident near campus pushed McLaughlin to the brink and contributed to their decision to wrap up their PhD as quickly as possible and leave Oklahoma: “I was running and somebody was chasing me and yelling slurs,” they say.\n\nMcLaughlin’s experience aligns with the survey, in which 50% of TGNC respondents reported experiencing “exclusionary, intimidating, offensive or hostile conduct” outside of work.\n\nAt the same time, the survey documented a sharp increase, relative to a 2019 survey (also led by Cooper, who then was at the University of Central Florida in Orlando), in the proportion of LGBTQ biologists who were out to their undergraduate students (76% versus 20%).\n\nMaeve McLaughlin, a molecular microbiologist at the University of Michigan in Flint, who identifies as transgender, says that she goes out of her way to make her students feel comfortable, including highlighting the work of researchers affiliated with the group 500 Queer Scientists.\n\nDoing so, she says, makes it easier for students to come forward to seek guidance. “I have a lot of trans and gender-nonconforming students who are more comfortable asking questions,” she says.\n\nA constant push",

Credit: Buyenlarge/Getty\n\nThroughout the twentieth century and beyond, the record of colleges and universities set up to provide higher-education opportunities for Black students in the United States could be viewed as one of failure. Their mission was to produce scholars to create economic, social and political freedom for African Americans. But, in the nearly 200 years since the first historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) opened their doors, Black people in the country still have not achieved economic parity with white people.\n\nSpringboard to science: the institutions that shaped Black researchers’ careers\n\nYet this failure cannot be laid at the feet of the Black universities’ leadership. No strategy that they could have deployed would have made a difference. The suppression of African American achievement was intentional and systematic. It occurred because many of those who controlled white society (particularly in the former Confederate states) never wanted African Americans or their institutions to achieve social equality1 — and I argue that this is not a priority for the second administration of US President Donald Trump either. This does not mean that all white people are racists: indeed, many have taken an active role in the fight against structural racism. However, the majority have either bought into or been unwilling to take action against a social and political system that has and continues to deny opportunity to African Americans2.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the majority of this group accepted the inferiority of people of African descent as socially agreed ‘fact’. This allowed powerful institutions to discriminate against African Americans. For example, redlining, which occurred between 1934 and 1968, became a widespread practice in the United States to deny loans and housing to African Americans, and it led to different capacities for accumulating wealth. Today, owing in large part to such policies, the median wealth of white families is about 6.5 times greater than that of African American families3.\n\nHistoric inequality in Black education\n\nI have reviewed the history of African American higher education in the context of evolutionary science4, but the essential details of the story are the same across scientific disciplines. The second Morrill Land-Grant Act, enacted in 1890, established 19 HBCUs in the US South to provide opportunities for Black students. But these institutions and the 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Act institutions, which educated white students, were never funded equitably (see ‘HBCUs: a history of underfunding’).\n\nJoseph L. Graves Jr shows students in his evolutionary-medicine class how to construct spreadsheets to analyse models of natural selection.\n\nCompared with their historically white institution (HWI) counterparts, HBCUs admit a disproportionate share of students from struggling school districts, a result of historical inequalities in primary and secondary education in the country. Yet, state appropriations to HWIs are larger than those to HBCUs in the US South. For example, in 2021–22 the state budget appropriation per undergraduate student at the North Carolina State University (NCSU), an HWI in Raleigh, was $35,513 per student, but at my institution, the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCATSU) in Greensboro, an HBCU, it was $19,083. This means that for every dollar spent on a student at the NCATSU, $1.86 is spent on a student at the NCSU.\n\nThis situation is common across the US Southeast, as documented in a 2023 report on the status of HBCUs5 from the Century Foundation, a think tank in New York City. Between 1987 and 2020, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas underfunded their HBCUs by $8.5 billion compared with their HWIs, according to letters to the governors of these states, sent in September 2023 by Miguel Cardona, secretary of education and Thomas Vilsack, secretary of agriculture. The NCSU and the NCATSU have a $2-billion funding disparity, one letter said. The federal government has never forced states to fund white and Black higher education equitably, and it has never denied funds to states that continue discriminatory funding practices.\n\nBiden must keep funding pledge to historically Black colleges and universities\n\nThis historical underfunding has produced an environment in which HCBU faculty members have to shoulder disproportionately heavy teaching loads, advise more students — many of whom are underprepared — and operate in facilities that are ill-suited for twenty-first century instruction and research in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). HBCUs operate on shoestring budgets, so they have fewer resources for research, teaching and student and community programmes. Owing to budgetary shortfalls, administrators at HBCUs often have to delay purchasing or repairing much-needed technology and infrastructure. For example, in January 2024, the central heating plant at the NCATSU failed, so the institution had to house students in hotels or send them home.",

          "abstract": "The main historical building on the campus of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland.Credit: Gibson Green/Alamy\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has begun a mass termination of research grants that fund active scientific projects because they no longer meet “agency priorities”.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nNIH staff members have been instructed to identify and potentially cancel grants for projects studying transgender populations, gender identity, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the scientific workforce, environmental justice and any other research that might be perceived to discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity, according to documents and an audio recording that Nature has obtained. Grants that allot funding to universities in China and those relating to climate change are also under scrutiny.\n\nAt least 16 termination letters have already been sent out, says Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who has been tracking them. And hundreds more are coming, say two NIH officials, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\n“It’s extremely alarming that grants that have been vetted by the scientific community and deemed important and impactful to understand the world are now being cancelled because of political ideology,” says Lisa Fazio, a cognitive psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who studies misinformation. “For all this talk about free speech, this is direct censorship of scientific research.”\n\nThe actions come in the second month of US President Donald Trump’s presidency; on his first day in office, Trump issued executive orders “restoring freedom of speech” to “the American people” and “defending women from gender ideology extremism” by banning the allocation of federal funding to projects that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”.\n\nThe NIH, which is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the grant terminations, their legality or how many the agency anticipated sending out.\n\nCategories for cutting\n\nAlthough many NIH research grants run for longer, scientists generally receive their funding one year at a time and are required to submit a progress report to the agency annually. NIH staff members then review this report and can issue a continuation of funding.\n\nThe agency, based in Bethesda, Maryland, has now asked its employees to review new and ongoing projects for any DEI-related activities and to place them in one of four categories: projects that solely support DEI-related activities (category one), projects that partially support these activities (category two), projects that do not support these activities but include some DEI-related language (category three) and projects that do not support any DEI-related activities (category four).\n\nGuidance document obtained by Nature that describes the four categories all active NIH grants should now be grouped into (see below for PDF).\n\nThe NIH’s 27 institutes and centres should not issue awards for research in category one, according to a guidance document obtained by Nature and sent to some employees this week. Category-two research must be renegotiated with the lead researcher or institution on the grant to remove any DEI-related activities. If the work cannot be renegotiated, the institute must seek to terminate the project, the document says.\n\nCategory-three research can continue unimpeded as long as any DEI-related language is stripped from the application or progress report. Category-four research can proceed as usual.\n\nAlthough the guidance document focuses on DEI-related activities, it also includes an appendix with examples of other types of research that the NIH no longer supports. For example, projects funding research in China and those that touch on “transgender issues” will be terminated.\n\nThis guidance was drafted by the deputy director of the NIH’s Office of Extramural Research (OER), Liza Bundesen, and approved by acting NIH director Matthew Memoli, according to an e-mail that Nature has obtained. Bundesen, who took the helm of the OER less than three weeks ago, is leaving the agency on 7 March, according to an NIH official who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThe guidance does not specify how to determine whether a project is discriminatory, which has caused confusion and anxiety among agency staff, another NIH official says. Many fear losing their jobs, a factor that might lead to over-interpretation of the guidance, which would hold back more science than “needs to be” affected, they say. “For example, is a grant providing culturally appropriate care specifically to Hispanic and Latino populations ‘discrimination’?”\n\nAppendices obtained by Nature describing research that NIH no longer supports (see below for PDF).\nLost data\n\nTara McKay, who studies the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBT+) at Vanderbilt University, received an e-mail from the NIH late on 28 February. It said that the agency was pulling funding for her project tracking the health of more than 1,200 LGBT+ adults in the United States.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nMcKay’s study aims to understand sources of stress and resilience for LGBT+ people, and to conduct cognitive screening and collect blood samples to understand how they are ageing over the span of a decade. “Longitudinal research gets its value from time points,” she says. Cancelling a grant part way through means that follow-up data will be lost, she says, and “it devalues the earlier money spent”.\n\nThe e-mail that McKay received said that her grant did not satisfy certain criteria and pointed to its inclusion of “transgender issues”, saying that such research programmes are “often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans”. This is the same wording given in the internal NIH guidance document.\n\nMcKay says that her project does not centre on the experience of transgender people, but merely includes people who identify as such. “That is not a population we’re willing to leave behind in our work,” she adds.",

The World RePORT project, which tracks global health-research spending, showed that, in 2022, the NIH spent 25 times more on grants than did the next biggest funder — the London-based charity Wellcome — that reported data to the initiative (see ‘World leader’).\n\nSource: World RePORT\n\nUS biomedical science dominates the world in terms of papers, discovery and drugs, says Miriam Merad, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who receives funding from the NIH and other sources (see ‘Publication prowess’). Merad points to a study1 that shows that NIH-funded research contributed to 354 of 356 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010–19.\n\n“Without NIH, there would be no cancer immunotherapy, no anti-overdose medication, no anti-heart attack or stroke medication, no cutting-edge treatments,” addiction researcher Olivier George at the University of California, San Diego, tweeted in February.\n\nSource: PubMed\n\nThe cuts mean “drug discovery is going to slow down, for sure”, says Merad. She is working with colleagues on new drugs, the development of which they will have to pause if they don’t have certainty on funding soon. “This is the type of thing that’s happening across the country.”\n\nThe NIH’s approach to funding scientists is unique in the world, says Merad. NIH grants often allow researchers to focus on scientific problems for four or five years without the need to raise further funds, she says. That provides freedom and stability that is not typically available in other regions, such as Europe, or in industry. “They trust the brain, the mind, the intellect of the people they fund. In industry, you don’t have the luxury to pivot, you are constantly constrained.”\n\nThe NIH’s “support to basic biomedical research enables fundamental breakthroughs, the path to which would be considered too risky for any venture capitals or biopharmaceutical companies”, says Wang.",

Trenton, New Jersey\n\nThousands of researchers and supporters of science protested in cities across the United States and Europe today against actions taken by the administration of US President Donald Trump to cut the US scientific workforce and slash spending on research worldwide.\n\nUS science is under threat ― now scientists are fighting back\n\nThe mood was defiant at many of the rallies, where chants of “Scientists will not be silenced”, “Facts over fear” and “What do we want? Peer review! When do we want it? Now!” were heard.\n\nQuoting musician Bob Marley, Rush Holt Jr, former chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, told the crowd in Trenton, New Jersey, “get up, stand up”.\n\nIn the crowd at Boston’s rally, Ana-Maria Vranceanu, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School whose work helps people with dementia, chronic pain and other conditions, said: “This is the time to actually stop this, before things get really bad.”\n\nOver the past month, “I’ve been waiting for someone to do something”, said Abraham Flaxman, a global-health metrics researcher at the University of Washington, who attended the Seattle rally. But “it’s dawned on me: nobody is coming to save us. We’re going to have to save ourselves”.\n\nMarie Walde, a biophysicist at the Roscoff Biological Station in France, posted about a rally she attended to the social-media platform BlueSky, saying: “In solidarity with our colleagues in the US, researchers and citizens all over France are protesting today for science and knowledge as a public good.”\n\n‘A five-alarm fire’\n\nThe Stand Up for Science rallies are a response to the Trump administration’s siege of the US research enterprise. Since taking office in January, Trump and his team have laid off, and in some cases then tried to rehire, thousands of employees at US science agencies, whose jobs involved nuclear safety, bird flu surveillance, extreme-weather forecasting and more. The administration has also attempted to freeze research grants at science-funding agencies, including the US National Science Foundation. And it has tried to slash ‘overhead costs’ awarded to biomedical research institutions by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) — although federal judges have since blocked this action. This week, Nature revealed that, under Trump, the NIH — the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research — has begun a mass termination of active research grants for projects studying certain topics, including the health of transgender populations, that do not align with the administration’s political ideology.\n\nProtesters took to the streets in Paris, to stand in solidarity with US scientists.Credit: Mohamad Salaheldin Abdelg Alsayed/Anadolu via Getty\n\nBewildered by these moves and wondering why people weren’t visibly ‘standing up for science’, five US researchers decided to organize today’s rallies. “This is a five-alarm fire,” says co-organizer Colette Delawalla, a psychologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. “If we don’t set down our work and turn attention to these matters”, and try to make policy changes, “there will not be science for us to come back to”, she says.\n\nBut the organizers know from past protests, such as the international March for Science in 2017 — which was organized by researchers critical of policies from Trump’s first presidency — that rallies alone will not effect change. “It’s not a one-and-done thing,” says Samantha Goldstein, who studies women’s health at the University of Florida in Gainesville and is one of the Stand Up for Science organizers. She adds: the organizers will continue to “be around, making sure our policy goals and demands are fulfilled — that’s what’s important”.\n\nA generation lost\n\nAt a number of the rallies today, speakers and attendees were worried about the chilling effect that the Trump administration’s actions will have on future science and scientists.\n\nIn Boston, Nancy Kanwisher, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, told the crowd: “You can’t just fire everyone and then rehire them when you need them. A generation of scientists will have been lost.”\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign at the rally in Washington Square Park, New York City.Credit: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty\n\nAtul Gawande, a public-health researcher and former assistant administrator at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), told the crowd in Washington DC that he has watched scientists get fired from their dream jobs, walking out carrying the remnants of their careers in boxes. (The Trump administration has fired thousands of workers from the USAID, which funds overseas health programmes and disaster-relief efforts, saying that it had been run by “radical left lunatics” and is party to “tremendous fraud”.) Scientists are being targeted, because “science doesn’t always give the answers that power wants”, Gawande said.\n\nOthers expressed anger at the way scientists are being treated. “I’m a scientist and I’m pissed off,” says Carolee Caffrey, a behavioural ecologist at Rider University in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, who was welcoming people to the Trenton rally. “I’m all the ‘D’ words: dismayed, depressed, disgusted.”\n\nSome viewed the rallies as a safe outlet for scientists to voice their feelings. Valerie H., who declined to give her full name for fear of reprisal, is a software engineer who works in crop science. Recent mass firings at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies have had a huge impact on her research. “I know hundreds of people on LinkedIn who are looking for work,” she said at the Denver rally. “People are glad to have a place to come say something.”",

          "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic has abated, mortality from other causes in the United States has kept climbing, reflecting disturbing trends not seen in any other high-income country. Despite US health-care spending being about US$13,500 per person in 2022 — twice that of peer nations — its people are more likely to die younger, of preventable and treatable causes, by suicide and drug overdose or from complications of childbirth (see go.nature.com/4i41oqc). This is not owing to any law of nature, but system-wide failure.\n\nInstead of investing in public care, US politics have prioritized market-based ideologies. This means subsidizing drug companies and private insurance while underfunding public health and social services, empowering businesses and charities to operate in their place — a process known as the privatization of public health. This generates large profits by exacerbating medical needs and costs but leaves millions without care.\n\n‘Silence is complicity’ — universities must fight the anti-DEI crackdown\n\nThe Trump administration’s dismantling of public-health systems through proposed or enacted cuts to Medicaid, the US Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as food-assistance and housing programmes, is likely to intensify these deadly dynamics. Trump has also put an anti-vaccine and anti-psychiatry activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, in control of the nation’s health systems.\n\nIn response, many health leaders have decried the politicization of public health, portraying it as a neutral domain under siege by political forces. But this misdiagnoses the problem and obscures the solution.\n\nThe real crisis is not that public health — which is fundamentally about policies dictating the distribution of resources required to protect human life — has been politicized. It is that it has not been politicized nearly enough.\n\nDecades of bipartisan failure set the stage for this moment. As journalist Ed Yong described in The Atlantic in 2021 (see go.nature.com/4bun7hv), public health has “willingly silenced its own political voice”. US political leaders and health officials have abandoned the once-obvious truth that political reforms to counteract poverty, inequality and inadequate social services are crucial to preventing diseases. A medical field that’s focused on treating illness as a substitute for preventing it through public policies now laments the supposed intrusion of politics into health.\n\nNIH turmoil sparks anxiety over future of its global grants\n\nBut there can never be an apolitical approach to public health. Policy choices about caregiving infrastructure, taxes and economic inequality, environmental and consumer regulations, public housing and labour rights, for example, are inherently political. They determine who lives and who dies, whose lives matter and how much.\n\nWhat has left US health so vulnerable to partisan capture is not an excess of politics but rather a depoliticizing distortion of public health that fixates on individualistic medical care and personal responsibility, rather than public responsibility to address root social and environmental causes of disease and care for those who are sick or disabled. This weakens communities, fuels resentment and social division, limits political imagination and undercuts political organizing among groups that could achieve change.\n\nThe US medical profession, which has long been conservative, bears considerable responsibility. We physicians have historically avoided engagement with politics, except for policies that might affect our compensation and power, often justifying our inaction by appealing to scientific neutrality and professionalism. But, as Trump has made clear, our refusal to engage politically has not protected public health or medical science — it has left both defenceless.",

Credit: Daniel Munoz/AFP/Getty\n\nPostdoctoral students, graduate students and other junior scientists in large research groups are more likely to drop out of academia than are their peers in smaller groups, according to a new study of more than one million early-career researchers.\n\nBut the analysis also found that researchers trained in large groups who stay in academia have more career success. The work was published Monday in Nature Human Behaviour, amid a mass exodus of scientists from academia and a mental-health crisis among PhD students.\n\nThe findings are consistent with past anecdotal studies and survey results, but this is the first attempt to quantify the effects of different types of scientific mentorship, says co-author Roberta Sinatra, a social-data scientist at the University of Copenhagen.\n\n“I hope that this helps guide the choices of PhD students,” she says.\n\nBurnout and dropout\n\nSinatra and her team analysed academic mentorship networks using two data sets: the crowd-sourced website Academic Family Tree, which includes global records of scientists, their advisers and their students in more than 50 academic fields, and the online research catalog OpenAlex, which features records of authors and their papers, institutions and citations. Their final data set included about 1.5 million scientists and 1.8 million mentorships in chemistry, physics and neuroscience. These fields had enough long-term data for the authors’ analysis and are heavily represented in the family-tree website.\n\nThe results showed that the percentage of researchers who remain in science for at least ten years is lower for those who were trained in big groups than for those who were trained in small groups (see ‘Survival advantage’). Between the 1980s and 1995, for example, the “survival rate” of big-group protégés was 38–48% lower than that of their small-group counterparts.\n\nHowever, the big-group scientists publish papers that score higher on an index measuring average citations per year, and are more likely to be ranked among the most-cited scientists.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nTo understand why some big-group protégés succeed, the study’s authors examined papers on which a protégé was the first author and their mentor was the last author ― which suggests that the trainee had received substantial attention from their mentor. Big-group scientists who survived in academia had published “notably” more of these first-author papers than had the dropouts, the paper says.\n\n“Now we also have quantitative evidence that attention is important,” says Sinatra. “It’s not simply speculation.”\n\nHow a lab is like a city",

          "abstract": "China’s Yangtze River is the longest in Eurasia and the third-longest on the planet, flowing more than 6,000 kilometres from the Tibetan Plateau to the East China Sea. Its basin covers almost one-fifth of China’s land area and is home to hundreds of millions of people. More than 52,000 reservoirs have been built on the Yangtze and its tributaries since the 1950s to mitigate flooding, generate hydropower, stabilize water supplies and protect ecology.\n\nThere are a host of challenges in managing this massive basin to support the sometimes-contradictory goals of developing water sources sustainably and protecting ecosystems. Population growth, development and urbanization in the region are constantly increasing the demand for water, while escalating water pollution and pressures on biodiversity. Although the Yangtze River basin’s average annual precipitation has changed relatively little in the past two decades, shifts in rainfall patterns and landscape use have led to a rise in the frequency and severity of droughts and floods.\n\nFor example, the hydropower company China Yangtze Power, based in Beijing, has found that the average drought period is now two weeks longer than it was in 2000. In 2020, unusually heavy rains led to the Three Gorges Dam in Yichang having the highest inflow rates since its construction in 2003. Management of the water flow in that reservoir helped to mitigate flooding, but this inundation still affected 45 million people, with more than 140 people dead or missing and caused an estimated US$16.5 million in damages1.\n\nAI to the rescue: how to enhance disaster early warnings with tech tools\n\nA smarter, more robust system of tracking, modelling and managing water in this basin will help to alleviate such issues, resulting in enhanced operational safety and reduced costs. To this end, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission (CJW) is spearheading the Smart Yangtze River Project (see go.nature.com/4h51xzf), under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources. This project was proposed in 2022 and now has 597 million yuan (US$82 million) of dedicated government investment, for a basin-wide, full-coverage water-monitoring system, with a planned completion date of 2035 for the preliminary design. Many hydropower companies are also contributing hundreds of millions of yuan to the initiative.\n\nAt the heart of the project is a digital twin of the Yangtze River basin. This twin consists of an advanced 3D simulation of the whole region, using data on weather, water flow, ecology, sediment properties, topography, energy demand and more, to provide real-time modelling of projected flood routing, water engineering, scheduling, shipping, ecological impacts and other outcomes.\n\nThe intuitive interface provides a reliable assessment of the impact of resource-management decisions and watershed-protection actions on sustainable development and biodiversity health. It can be used for forecasting, early warning, emergency-system rehearsals and contingency planning. A first version of this digital twin already exists and is in use (see ‘Yangtze river basin’, and go.nature.com/3wvchj1), encompassing two supplementary watersheds (of the Han and Lishui rivers) and four dams (the Three Gorges, Danjiangkou, Jiangya and Zaoshi). This will be substantially improved and expanded with more data and modelling over the coming years.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nCurrently, nearly 2,700 water-level monitoring stations and more than 37,000 rainfall stations are collecting data in the Yangtze River basin. In April 2023, work began on new and existing hydrological-station networks in key areas such as the major tributaries of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, with enhanced monitoring methods including video and remote sensing. On completion, the Smart Yangtze River Project will also include hundreds of monitoring stations for water quality and groundwater levels, and tens of thousands of water intake points.\n\nMuch related work has been completed over the past five years — for example, China Yangtze Power now uses an intelligent decision-support system for reservoir-scheduling simulations and flood exercises. The Yangtze River Simulator, developed by the team of Xia Jun, a hydrologist at Wuhan University, China, is a tool for monitoring, simulation and analysis of flood control, power generation and biodiversity conservation2,3.\n\nHow to achieve safe water access for all: work with local communities\n\nAlthough the use of digital twins has grown in the past decade for everything from industrial manufacturing to transportation, there are relatively few digital-twin representations used for intelligent watershed management. The Yangtze project might represent the largest and most ambitious such initiative yet. This huge endeavour presents substantial challenges in terms of enhancing existing data collection and management, as well as improving models and services.\n\nResearchers have already amassed a wealth of data and experience. But the full potential of the Smart Yangtze River Project is still far from being realized. Funding shortages are an issue: numerous departments, companies and research institutions engaged in the project need to secure their own funding. More data need to be collected and digitized; data and model formats need to be standardized and shared across industry and academia.\n\nMany companies have yet to engage in the project because of cost or technological constraints, or perhaps because they fear that it might affect their profits. Further collaboration should address these challenges, so that there is adequate guidance for managers’ decision-making.\n\nHere, we recommend four steps that will help to ensure the success of the programme.\n\nUnify data and model standards\n\nA digital twin requires many types of data, taken at different time intervals and in various formats. For instance, a comprehensive and accurate rainfall and run-off model might require data on atmospheric temperature, humidity and cloud distribution from meteorological satellites and on surface vegetation coverage and land-use types from optical remote-sensing satellites. It might also need information on river morphology from drone-mounted cameras and terrain elevation from laser-based radar, or lidar. A digital twin requires enough data to drive high-resolution modelling but not so much that it creates transmission bottlenecks.\n\nA lack of universal methods, standards and specifications makes it challenging to integrate data from multiple monitoring networks. Data are often fragmented across different entities and stored in diverse formats. For example, meteorological and run-off data are held by the Chinese Bureau of Hydrology; reservoir-operation data by hydropower companies; and water resource-management data by the CJW. Inside the government, multiple data formats are used: the water-conservancy department utilizes HDF, the environmental-protection department uses CSV, the meteorological-department relies on NetCDF and the power department utilizes COMTRADE.\n\nDigital twins, such as this one of Zaoshi Dam, can help with real-time water management.Credit: Dr. Xiaopeng Wang\n\nNot all of the desired information is even digitized. Information about electricity demand, power market data, power-line restrictions and emergency information, for example, is still sometimes recorded and analysed without the use of computers. Existing reservoir dispatching regulations, projects and plans are typically documented in hand-written form rather than digitally.\n\nIt is also important to develop standards for the models used to process all these data, to ensure that they are versatile, reusable and interoperable. It is essential to create a common design and development platform for the Smart Yangtze River Project system, enabling all models to operate seamlessly. The project is creating unified data and model standards. Nevertheless, numerous areas remain inadequately compatible.\n\nThere are few global examples that show how to develop digital twins in a robust way with good standards — in general, the concept of digital twinning is more advanced in industrial manufacturing than in river management. One such example is the virtual shared workspace established by US aircraft manufacturer Boeing to facilitate collaboration among its corporate partners. The European Digital Twin Ocean project (see go.nature.com/3cdab5p) has established a data-governance framework to set standards for data and models across a wide swathe of content, including satellite observation data, ocean-model outputs, in situ measurements and data from historical, industrial and citizen-science sources.\n\nShare data and models\n\nCurrently, the Yangtze digital-twin platform is hosted by the Yangtze River Commission and several companies’ internal networks, and it is not fully accessible to scientists and others who work around the basin. The interaction between industry and academia is minimal, hindered by obstacles in accessing information and resources, often attributed to commercial confidentiality. One issue lies in data ownership. Regional water-management departments and companies are generally reluctant to share commercially sensitive information. Likewise, hydropower companies can find it hard to obtain power dispatch data from power-grid companies.",

Chase/Getty\n\nNASA has abruptly closed its chief-scientist office, along with 2 other offices, firing 23 employees. The 10 March action leaves the agency without a way of feeding independent science advice to its topmost leadership, at a time when it is talking about sending astronauts to the Moon and developing plans to go onwards to Mars.\n\nTrump team orders huge government lay-offs: how science could fare\n\nJanet Petro, the acting NASA administrator, said in an agency-wide e-mail that “we’re viewing this as an opportunity to reshape our workforce”. The lay-offs come days before all US federal agencies are required to submit a plan for how they would eliminate employees, as part of a radical downsizing of the federal government led by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk in the name of improving efficiency.\n\nThese are NASA’s first firings since Trump took office, and they have taken a different pattern to those at other federal agencies in the past few weeks. NASA was spared, for unknown reasons, from the extensive lay-offs of probationary employees — those with little job protection because they have been in their positions for less than two years — seen at other agencies. The move makes NASA the first agency under the current Trump administration to pre-emptively fire career employees, beginning the required ‘reductions in force’ (RIFs) sooner than many observers had anticipated. It remains unclear whether other agencies might follow NASA’s lead.\n\nThe offices closed by NASA are its Office of the Chief Scientist; its Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy; and the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility branch of its Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. The cutting of the last of these is a direct result of Trump’s 20 January executive order to slash diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government. But the reason for the closure of the other two offices is not as obvious.\n\nThinking about the future\n\nBoth offices advise NASA’s chief, or administrator, on scientific and technical matters. Petro is filling this position until Trump’s nominee, billionaire and private astronaut Jared Isaacman — a friend of Musk — is confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nNASA embraced diversity. Trump’s DEI purge is hitting space scientists hard\n\nThe two offices are unique in that they offer ways of connecting strategy across NASA’s departments and divisions. With their closure, “you will lose strategic thinking”, said a NASA staff member who is familiar with the structure of the offices but did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.",

          "authors": "Dyani Lewis",
          "abstract": "Credit: Adam Gault/OJO Images via Getty\n\nResearchers who are accused of sexual misconduct start to receive fewer citations after the media covers the allegations. But the same cannot be said about scientists publicly accused of scientific fraud, whose citations remain unchanged, according to an analysis published this week in PLoS ONE1.\n\nIn the wake of the #MeToo movement that uncovered perpetrators of sexual harassment in Hollywood and other industries, including science, Giulia Maimone, a behavioural scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wanted to know whether researchers in STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics — and the social sciences were avoiding the work of those accused of sexual harassment.\n\nShe and her colleagues compared citations for 15 researchers in the three years after they were publicly accused of sexual misconduct, with those of 15 researchers accused of data fabrication and other scientific misconduct and of 142 researchers who had not received any of such allegation. Their prediction: that scholars accused of scientific fraud would incur a greater penalty because the misconduct calls into question the merit of that person’s scientific work. “That’s not at all what we found,” says Maimone. “We were very surprised.”\n\nCitations of alleged sexual harassers fell in the aftermath of an allegation going public. But those of scientists accused of scientific misconduct held steady, even though publication rates fell for both categories.\n\n“It’s really valuable to have a study like this that looks at citational practices,” says Anna Bull, a sociologist at the University of York, UK, who studies sexual harassment in higher education. She says that the results could be a sign that attitudes towards sexual misconduct in science are changing.\n\nBut she says that the cases analysed — selected because the allegations had appeared in media reports and the accused had accrued at least 200 citations over the study period — probably represent only the severest forms of sexual misconduct. “In order for things to come out [in the media], they must be pretty egregious,” she says, noting that in many places, including the United Kingdom and European Union, few sexual-misconduct allegations reach the media owing to defamation laws.\n\nElisabeth Bik, a research-integrity consultant based in California, says that although it is good that peoples’ aversion to sexual misconduct is being reflected in the scientific community, it is concerning that there was no drop in citations for research misconduct. But she says that in cases of scientific misconduct, “it is often not clear who is responsible”, and papers might also be cited as examples of misconduct.\n\nBehavioural blind-spot\n\nThe reasons why researchers are choosing not to cite colleagues accused of sexual misconduct are unclear. They could be deliberately punishing sexual harassers by withholding citations, or they might want to preserve their own reputation, says Bull, or “maybe even both”.\n\nMaimone also says that researchers might not realize that they are punishing alleged sexual harassers more than they are scientific fraudsters.\n\nAs part of their study, she and her colleagues also surveyed 240 STEM and social-science researchers, and 231 non-academics about their attitudes towards sexual harassment and scientific misconduct.\n\nAt least 90% of non-academics said that sexual misconduct was more disgusting than scientific fraud, and three-quarters said it was more deserving of punishment. But 85% of academics surveyed said that if forced to choose, they would rather cite the article published by the sexual harasser than the fraudster. But given that the study shows that citations of scientists accused of harassment drop more than those of researchers accused of fraud, Maimone says that scientists might be overestimating their ability to judge the merit of scientific findings without considering who produced those findings.",

          "title": "Are microplastics bad for your health? More rigorous science is needed",
          "authors": "Jun-Li Xu, Stephanie Wright, Cassandra Rauert, Kevin V. Thomas",
          "abstract": "In March last year, researchers found that among a group of nearly 300 participants, people who had higher concentrations of plastics in deposits of fat in their arteries (arterial plaques) were more likely to experience heart attacks or strokes, and more likely to die as a result, than those in whom plastics were not detected1. Since it was published, the New England Journal of Medicine study has been mentioned more than 6,600 times on social media and more than 800 times in news articles and blogs.\n\nThe issue of whether plastics are entering human tissues and what impacts they might have on health is understandably of great interest to scientists, industry and society. Indeed, for the past few years there have been news stories almost every month about peer-reviewed articles that have reported findings of plastic particles in all sorts of human tissues and bodily fluids — including the lungs, heart, penis, placenta and breast milk. And in multiple countries, policymakers are being urged to implement measures to limit people’s exposure to nanoplastics and microplastics.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nMany of the studies conducted so far, however, rely on small sample sizes (typically 20–50 samples) and lack appropriate controls. Modern laboratories are themselves hotspots of nanoplastic and microplastic pollution, and the approaches that are being used to detect plastics make it hard to rule out the possibility of contamination, or prove definitively that plastics are in a sample. Also, many findings are not biologically plausible based on what is known — mainly from nanomedicine — about the movement of tiny particles within the human body.\n\nFor an emerging area of research, such problems are unsurprising. But without more rigorous standards, transparency and collaboration — among researchers, policymakers and industrial stakeholders — a cycle of misinformation and ineffective regulation could undermine efforts to protect both human health and the environment.\n\nPlastic, plastic everywhere\n\nSince the term ‘microplastic’ — used to describe plastic particles less than five millimetres long — was introduced in 2004, microplastics have been found not just in the oceans but also in lakes and rivers, soils, food and air. In a study published last year, researchers estimated that people in Denmark inhale about 3,400 microplastic particles every day when indoors2.\n\nAssessing how these tiny particles behave in the human body and whether they accumulate over time requires first identifying and quantifying plastics in blood and tissue samples. To do this, many researchers use pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), in which high temperatures (around 600–700 °C) break down plastics into smaller organic molecules. The resulting mix of molecules and the amount of each one provides a ‘signature’ that researchers can use to establish whether a certain plastic was in the original sample.\n\nBut there are limitations with this approach.\n\nPolyethylene is often the most common plastic that is found in human tissues.Credit: Leonard Ortiz/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty\n\nEven after samples have been treated, for instance with enzymes, to remove biological material, some residue can remain. And some compounds that indicate the presence of plastics can be produced when non-plastic substances are pyrolysed. Fatty acids, such as triglycerides, can break down into the same compounds as polyethylene3. Polyethylene is often the most commonly reported plastic in human-tissue studies using Py-GCMS4–6, although this is not the case for all studies that have used this method7,8.\n\nLikewise, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which is often used in combination with scanning electron microscopy, can reveal the presence of carbon-based molecules. But it identifies only what elements are present in a sample, not molecular structures — meaning that it can only suggest the presence of plastics.\n\nAnother issue with some of the data generated so far is that they don’t make sense biologically.\n\nIn a study9 published last month, researchers examined 91 brains from autopsied bodies and found that plastics made up 0.65% of the brain on average. That’s equivalent to saying that each person had around 4.5 polyethylene bottle caps’ worth of plastic in their brain.\n\nOther studies have reported the presence of large plastic particles, measuring up to 3 mm in length, in human blood samples10. One study that found microplastic particles 5.5–26.4 micrometres in size and synthetic fibres 19–24.5 µm in length in brain tissue, suggested that microplastics that are inhaled through the nose can travel along nerves to the olfactory bulb in the brain11.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nYet, previous research suggests that particles bigger than 1 µm are probably too large to pass through the lung’s air–blood barrier, and any particle bigger than 10 µm is probably too large to pass through the gut–blood barrier12,13.\n\nWithout convincing mechanistic explanations of how larger particles might bypass biological barriers, it is difficult to accept conclusions that particles larger than 10 µm have entered human tissue.\n\nEven when, say, through the use of multiple approaches, it is clear that plastics are present in a sample, there is a high possibility that the sample could have been contaminated with nanoplastics or microplastics at each stage of the research — from sampling and transportation to storage, processing and analysis. Human-tissue samples are often collected in clinical settings in which plastics are commonly used, and intravenous infusion equipment that is used to deliver medication can shed microplastics into a person’s bloodstream. Also, because different researchers use different sampling strategies, materials and analytical approaches, it is hard to compare results across studies. Some laboratories use stainless-steel chambers, for instance, and try to minimize plastic contamination; others use plastic equipment to process their samples.",

          "abstract": "Shai Berman and Tessa Montague need to carry their teaching materials in clear prison-issue bags when they help inmates to earn undergraduate degrees.Credit: Thomas Barlow\n\nFifty minutes north of Manhattan by train lies Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison for men. Sing Sing is one of the oldest and most notorious prisons in the United States. Its massive stone blocks and barbed-wire fences sit on a hill overlooking the Hudson Valley. Beyond its heavy metal gates is a group of students, largely invisible to the rest of the country, earning their undergraduate degrees. Every Monday afternoon, the two of us take the train, pass through those gates, and spend two hours teaching an “introduction to neuroscience” class to those students.\n\nTeaching in a prison comes with many challenges, but it has been one of the highlights of our professional careers. Here we describe our experience as postdoctoral fellows at New York City’s Columbia University providing instruction at Sing Sing, in partnership with Hudson Link, a non-profit organization that offers university programmes in various prisons in New York state, and Columbia’s Center for Justice, an organization that seeks to change how justice is approached through education, policy and research.\n\nThe US prison system and education\n\nThe United States is a nation of mass incarceration. There are some 1.9 million people behind bars in the country, and 14% of adults have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated for at least a year. This crisis has a disproportionate impact on low-income people, particularly in Black and Latino communities, which are affected by systemic racism and inequalities that lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction, and harsher sentences. Hudson Link and other organizations across the country are trying to disrupt the cycle and impact of incarceration in communities by providing higher-education opportunities to incarcerated individuals. Statistically speaking, education has a massive impact. In the United States, 67% of formerly incarcerated people return to prison within three years of their release, whereas less than 2% of Hudson Link graduates do.\n\nWe teach our course through Columbia University’s Prison Education Program. Official credits from this programme count towards associate’s and bachelor’s degrees. Diplomas awarded inside prison are exactly the same as those awarded outside. Thus, it is our job as instructors to provide the same quality and level of instruction to our students while working within the restrictions of the prison setting.\n\nEntering prison\n\nTo enter Sing Sing each week, we check our phones into a depot and then wait in front of the heavy gate to be called for security screening. Above us, an ornate sign reads “Through these doors pass some of the finest correctional professionals in the world”. Security is similar to that at an airport, except that our attire is inspected: only loose, professional clothing can be worn; no bold jewellery is permitted, nor anything green, which could be confused for the prison uniforms. Our possessions must be carried in prison-issue clear bags so that the contents can be inspected for contraband. We receive an ultraviolet stamp on our hand, which will be checked when we exit the prison. We then proceed to the school building in a minivan, sparing us a three-minute walk. We are assured that every step in this process is a precaution shaped by hard-learnt lessons.\n\nIn the classroom\n\nPreparation begins long before we enter the classroom. We are not allowed to take any technology into the prison. This is a challenge both for the students, who cannot use Google or ChatGPT, and for us, because we’ve grown accustomed to teaching with presentations and video demonstrations (how can you communicate flashing neurons with chalk?).\n\nFurthermore, all materials have to be submitted months in advance to be approved by prison leadership. To address these constraints, we created a custom textbook for the class, in which each chapter is a different lesson (such as the motor system, emotion and the use of animal models), and there is enough information for students to learn the material even if a class is cancelled or cut short (which they frequently are). Once we’re in the classroom, we teach everything using a blackboard, and then hand out homework, to be collected the following week. We have no means of communicating with students outside class, so the cycle of feedback is slow: by the time they receive feedback, they have already submitted another assignment. And learning about the brain tends to raise more questions than it answers — we are constantly trying to strike a balance between sticking to the planned material and going on an interesting side quest brought about by a student’s question.\n\nThe students\n\nWe have taught at both Sing Sing and Taconic Correctional Facility (a medium-security women’s prison), and the students are the best we’ve ever worked with. Students range in age from early 20s to late 60s, and their sentences probably range from less than 5 years to more than 50. One might try to guess (or actively find out) what the circumstances were that led to these long sentences. However, to us it ultimately doesn’t matter: we have found every student to be warm, laser focused and curious. There are no distractions from phones or laptops — a teacher’s dream. One of the main challenges is how to teach an intense scientific course to students with diverse educational backgrounds and lived experiences. We haven’t solved the problem, but we create homework sets that partly test the knowledge obtained in class, and partly provide the students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge and creativity to the design of experiments.",

          "abstract": "Women usually have two X chromosomes (shown here in an artist’s rendering), and one of them is inactivated early in development.Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/Alamy\n\nWomen tend to live longer than men and are often more resilient to cognitive decline as they age. Now researchers might have uncovered a source for this resilience: the second X chromosome in female cells that was previously considered ‘silent’.\n\nWhy the sexes don’t feel pain the same way\n\nIn work published today in the journal Science Advances1, a team reports that, at least in female mice, ageing activates expression of genes on what is usually the ‘silent’, or inactivated, X chromosome in cells in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial to learning and memory. And when the researchers gave mature mice of both sexes a type of gene therapy to boost expression of one of those genes, it improved their cognition, as measured by how well they explored a maze. Assuming these results can be confirmed in humans, the team suggests it could mean that women’s brains are being protected by their second X chromosome as they age — and that the finding could translate into future therapies boosting cognition for everyone.\n\n“The X chromosome is powerful,” says Rachel Buckley, a neurologist who studies sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown, and who was not involved in the research. This kind of work, she says, is helping researchers to understand “where female resilience lies and how to harness it”.\n\n(This article uses ‘women’ and ‘female’ to describe people with two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, reflecting the language of the study. Nature recognizes that not all people who identify as women have this chromosomal make-up.)\n\nDouble dose\n\nFemale cells typically have two X chromosomes, one from each parent; male cells usually have one X and one Y. Early in development, one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is inactivated — coated in various proteins and RNA molecules that prevent its genes from being expressed. Which one is ‘silenced’ — meaning which parent it comes from — is random, and the tissues in the body are a mosaic of both types.\n\nWhy autoimmune disease is more common in women: X chromosome holds clues\n\nIn theory, female and male cells both have an X chromosome that is active, so female cells have “the same dose of X chromosome as a male cell”, says Dena Dubal, a neuroscientist and neurologist at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, who led the study. But scientists are learning that it’s not so simple. Dubal says that about 30% of the genes on the so-called silent X chromosome in people are active — although that percentage varies among women. Still, scientists know little about how expression of genes on the less-active X chromosome changes from tissue to tissue in the body, or how it shifts with age.\n\nTo study this in the mouse brain, Dubal’s team bred two types of laboratory mice to produce offspring with one X chromosome from each. The chromosomes were engineered such that one would always be the active X and the other would always be inactivated, and small genetic differences in the chromosomes would allow them to be identified in lab tests. Then the researchers tracked the activity of both X chromosomes in nine major cell types, including neurons, found in the hippocampus of both young and old mice.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "The Athena lander touched down in the region around the lunar south pole (pictured) on 6 March as planned, but its health is uncertain. Credit: Dave Tyler/Galaxy/Alamy\n\nUpdate: Intuitive Machines announced on 7 March that the Athena spacecraft had landed on its side in a lunar crater and has run out of power. The mission is over, because it has no way to recharge its batteries. “Teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission,” the company said, including on the NASA ice drill that was the main reason for going to the lunar south pole.\n\nThe latest attempt to land on the Moon went at least partially awry on 6 March, when an ice-seeking spacecraft named Athena apparently landed off-kilter near the lunar south pole.\n\nThe precise status of Athena, which was built by Intuitive Machines in Houston, Texas, remained unclear in the hours after touchdown, but “we don’t believe we’re in the correct attitude”, Stephen Altemus, chief executive of Intuitive Machines, said at a post-landing press conference. Last year, the first spacecraft that the company tried to land on the Moon also set down askew, although it did accomplish some science.\n\nThis was the second lunar disappointment this week. NASA reported on 4 March that communication problems would keep its Lunar Trailblazer probe from entering its planned science orbit around the Moon. But not all the news is bad: a third lunar craft, built by Firefly Aerospace in Cedar Park, Texas, made a safe arrival on 2 March.\n\nMoon mystery\n\nAltemus said the company is working to acquire images from Athena’s several cameras and determine which parts are damaged and which are functional, and that more information will be available in the coming hours and days. At least for now, the spacecraft is getting power, and mission controllers have been able to communicate with the science payloads on board, he said.\n\nPrivate companies are flocking to the Moon — what does that mean for science?\n\nDepending on its position on the lunar surface, Athena might still be able to perform some of its activities. To have enough power to keep operating, it needs to have at least one solar panel oriented to catch sunlight. The Sun stays close to the lunar horizon at the craft’s landing site, and Athena is meant to operate until sunset at the site, roughly ten days after touchdown.\n\nBut the mission’s main purpose — hunting for ice — might not be accomplished. A drill aboard Athena that was meant to bore into the lunar soil to find ice cannot operate unless it is close to upright. “We’re looking forward to hearing what we have to work with,” said Nicola Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science, at the press conference. The success of other components, such as three rovers and an ice-sniffing robotic ‘hopper’ meant to hop into shadowy craters, also depends on Athena’s position.\n\nSpotty record\n\nThe outlook is also grim for Lunar Trailblazer’s mission to create high-resolution maps of water on the lunar surface. Trailblazer launched successfully alongside Athena on 26 February, but the NASA team “believes the spacecraft is spinning slowly in a low-power state”, the agency reported on 4 March. If mission controllers can restore communications in the coming days, they might be able to put Trailblazer into a less-than-optimal lunar orbit and eke out at least a little of its planned science.",

Widely regarded as the world’s earliest environmentalists, they live by 29 rules devised in the sixteenth century by their spiritual leader, Jambhoji. In 1730, 363 Bishnoi villagers were executed while hugging local trees by axe-wielding officials sent by the Maharaja of Jodhpur to chop down the forest to build his palace. In their own words, the Bishnoi are the only community “that dies for animals and trees”.\n\nIn Search of Green China\n\nMa Tianjie Polity (2025)\n\nIn the 1990s, part of China’s Huai River ignited. This event, caused by flammable pollution produced by food-processing plants and paper mills, triggered a remarkable increase in China’s efforts to clean its rivers and air, and stabilize its carbon emissions. Ma Tianjie, an environmental activist based in Beijing, where he was previously employed by Greenpeace, reveals the story in all its political complexity. However, he emphasizes that his book is “by no means an objective academic analysis of Chinese environmental politics”.\n\nBrain Boost\n\nBarbara J. Sahakian & Christelle Langley Cambridge Univ.

The resulting properties are potentially useful, but such 2D metals are difficult to stabilize at micrometre dimensions or greater sizes, because the atoms tend to adopt their naturally occurring 3D arrangements and oxidize readily in air. Writing in Nature, Zhao et al.1 report a process for squeezing metals down to atomic thicknesses using a benchtop hydraulic press. Their low-tech approach produces air-stable 2D crystals with dimensions greater than 100 micrometres, which is a substantial improvement over what can made using more expensive and complex techniques.",

To tackle this problem in psychology, here we use language models to obtain semantic embeddings representing psychometric items, scales and construct labels in a vector space. This approach allows us to analyse different datasets (for example, the International Personality Item Pool) spanning thousands of items and hundreds of scales and constructs and show that embeddings can be used to predict empirical relations between measures, automatically detect taxonomic fallacies and suggest more parsimonious taxonomies. These findings suggest that semantic embeddings constitute a powerful tool for tackling taxonomic incommensurability in the psychological sciences.",

However, we also discuss how some of the factors that enable prosocial behaviour can also empower malicious actors—as well as the challenge of creating prosocial behaviour that is sustainable and impactful offline. We then propose a research agenda to help scholars, policymakers and corporate leaders to identify the causal factors that shape prosocial behaviour on social media. This agenda focuses on (1) the size and shape of social networks, (2) platform affordances, (3) social norms and (4) how prosocial behaviour can be embedded within existing and future business models of social media.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the retention of memory for past experiences (episodic memory), reducing the rate of forgetting compared with wakefulness. Yet it remains unclear whether and how sleep actively transforms the way we remember multidimensional real-world experiences, and how such memory transformation unfolds over the days, months and years that follow. In an exception to the law of forgetting, we show that sleep actively and selectively improves the accuracy of memory for a one-time, real-world experience (an art tour)—specifically boosting memory for the order of tour items (sequential associations) versus perceptual details from the tour (featural associations). This above-baseline boost in sequence memory was not evident after a matched period of wakefulness. Moreover, the preferential retention of sequence relative to featural memory observed after a night’s sleep grew over time up to 1 year post-encoding. Finally, overnight polysomnography showed that sleep-related memory enhancement was associated with the duration and neurophysiological hallmarks of slow-wave sleep previously linked to sequential neural replay, particularly spindle–slow wave coupling. These results suggest that sleep serves a crucial and selective role in enhancing sequential organization in our memory for past events at the expense of perceptual details, linking sleep-related neural mechanisms to the days-to-years-long transformation of memory for complex real-life experiences.",

We used electrocorticography to record neural signals across 100 h of speech production and comprehension as participants engaged in open-ended real-life conversations. We extracted low-level acoustic, mid-level speech and contextual word embeddings from a multimodal speech-to-text model (Whisper). We developed encoding models that linearly map these embeddings onto brain activity during speech production and comprehension. Remarkably, this model accurately predicts neural activity at each level of the language processing hierarchy across hours of new conversations not used in training the model. The internal processing hierarchy in the model is aligned with the cortical hierarchy for speech and language processing, where sensory and motor regions better align with the model’s speech embeddings, and higher-level language areas better align with the model’s language embeddings. The Whisper model captures the temporal sequence of language-to-speech encoding before word articulation (speech production) and speech-to-language encoding post articulation (speech comprehension). The embeddings learned by this model outperform symbolic models in capturing neural activity supporting natural speech and language. These findings support a paradigm shift towards unified computational models that capture the entire processing hierarchy for speech comprehension and production in real-world conversations.",

Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues.

Viewed from the perspective of other key regional sites of this period, our findings indicate consolidation of a uniform behavioural set in the Levantine mid-MP, consisting of similar lithic technology, an increased reliance on large-game hunting and a range of socially elaborated behaviours, comprising intentional human burial and the use of ochre in burial contexts.

We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment ( N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.",

We present evidence from a field experiment ( N = 1,128) conducted in Australia on a major gig economy platform that allows users to outsource everyday tasks. By manipulating both the sexual orientation of job posters (gay vs. straight male) and physical proximity requirements of tasks (inside vs. outside the home), we identify discrimination against gay profiles and demonstrate a specific mechanism for its emergence: physical proximity. Gay profiles received fewer offers and less engagement, and attracted workers with significantly lower quality ratings, but only for tasks requiring close physical proximity. Additional exploratory analysis further suggests that the results are driven by an anti-gay bias rather than an anti-men or pro-women bias and that discrimination is stronger for tasks with a higher degree of interaction between worker and job poster. Our findings demonstrate how digital labor platforms can perpetuate traditional forms of discrimination, while shedding light on physical proximity as one important mechanism. These results have important implications for users of the gig economy, a sector of increasing importance due to its rapid growth and comparatively lax regulatory frameworks.",

To examine this phenomenon, we develop an approach to identifying scripted propaganda—the coerced reprinting of lightly adapted government-authored articles in newspapers—that leverages the footprints left by the government when making media interventions. We show that in China, scripted propaganda is a daily phenomenon—on 90% of days from 2012 to 2022, the vast majority of party newspapers include at least some scripted propaganda at the direction of a central directive. On particular sensitive days, the amount of scripted propaganda can spike to 30% of the articles appearing in major newspapers. We show that scripted propaganda has strengthened under President Xi Jinping. In the last decade, the front page of party newspapers has evolved from 5% scripted articles to approximately 20% scripted. This government-authored content throughout the paper is increasingly homogeneous—fewer and fewer adaptations are done by individual newspapers. In contrast to popular speculation, we show that scripted content is not only on ideological topics (although it is increasingly ideological) and is also very prevalent in commercial papers. Using a case study of domestic coverage of COVID-19, we demonstrate how the regime uses scripting to shape, constrain, and delay information during crises. Our findings reveal the wide-ranging influence of government-authored propaganda in China’s media ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "U.S. Census Bureau officials recently reaffirmed the Bureau’s ongoing efforts to replace the American Community Survey (ACS) public use microdata sample with “fully synthetic” data to protect respondent confidentiality. With the growth of computing power and expansion of private sector data about the population, the Census Bureau has valid concerns about confidentiality threats to public data. The current plan for fully synthetic data, however, threatens a cornerstone of the nation’s scientific infrastructure. Census microdata samples are among the most frequently used sources in social science research, and they are an essential tool for policy formation and planning from the local to the national level. Synthetic census microdata are not suitable for most research and policy applications. There have been no recent attempts to quantify disclosure risk in the ACS microdata, and the sole existing study failed to establish a credible threat for positive identification of ACS respondents by external intruders. I argue that we need new empirical research to pinpoint specific vulnerabilities that could allow an intruder to determine a particular individual’s confidential census responses. If significant vulnerabilities are uncovered, the Census Bureau in partnership with the research community should develop targeted methods for disclosure risk reduction that minimize damage to data usability.",

          "authors": "Ana Arjona, Mario Chacón, Laura García-Montoya",
          "abstract": "Although a growing literature has investigated the effects of various types of civil war violence on political behavior, no study has examined the impact of assassinations targeting politicians. This is a critical omission, as violence against local politicians is prevalent across civil war contexts and may be the most consequential form of violence for political participation by affecting both candidate supply and voter demand. Using an original dataset of nearly 2,000 killings of Colombian local politicians between 1980 and 2023, we estimate the impact of this violence on voter turnout. Taking municipalities where assassination attempts failed as a comparison group, we find that political assassinations significantly decrease voter turnout in both the short and medium terms, with effects persisting in various elections even after the signing of a peace agreement. These findings contrast with many studies suggesting that other forms of civil war violence enhance political participation during the postconflict period or after a truce or peace agreement. Our results suggest that different forms of violence can have distinct effects on political behavior, underscoring the need to theorize how the targeting, nature, and context of violence condition its effects. This echoes calls for more nuanced studies on the behavioral impacts of violence. Our findings also have implications for understanding democracy amid rising violence against political leaders in countries affected by organized crime, such as Mexico and Brazil; polarized contexts, such as the United States; and weakly institutionalized democracies, such as South Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.",

          "abstract": "Adults tend to view men (more so than women) as default people , with numerous real-world consequences for gender equity. In the United States, the tendency to center men in concepts of people develops across middle childhood, yet the specific mechanisms that contribute to it remain unknown. Here, we investigate one subtle but potentially powerful social mechanism: the category labels that parents use to describe boys/men and girls/women in conversations with their children. Across two studies ( N = 822 parent–child dyads, predominantly from the United States), parents used gender-neutral labels like “kid” or “person” more often to describe boys/men than girls/women and, conversely, used gender-specific labels (e.g., “girl”) more often to describe girls/women than boys/men. These patterns emerged when parents were shown gender-stereotypical girls/women and boys/men (e.g., a girl painting her nails, a boy digging for worms); when parents viewed counterstereotypical stimuli (e.g., a boy painting his nails, a girl digging for worms), the patterns reversed. Our findings illuminate parents’ category label usage as a critical social mechanism that may undergird the development of a male default in a US cultural context, informing efforts to intervene on this process.",

          "authors": "Jimin Wang",
          "abstract": "Photosynthesis converts solar energy to chemical energy by splitting water molecules and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates with an efficiency that engineers working on solar energy device can only dream of. Photosystem II (PSII) is the enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water that occurs during photosynthesis. This oxygen-producing reaction occurs in the Mn 4 Ca cluster found inside the enzyme’s oxygen-evolving center (OEC). Even though the structure and mechanism of action of the OEC have been intensively investigated for many decades, questions still remain about both. The Mn 4 Ca cluster stores the high-energy oxidizing equivalents required for water oxidation so that its own oxidation state depends on its chemical composition, i.e., the number of its oxygen ligands. The issue addressed here is the number of oxygen ligands associated with the Mn 4 Ca cluster after PSII has been exposed to two of the four flashes of light necessary for it to produce an oxygen molecule, PSII 2F. Comparisons of recently published cryo-EM maps and crystallographic OEC-omit maps described here reveal the OEC structure of PSII 2F contains only five internal oxygen ligands, and that the sixth O ligand identified earlier in PSII 2F crystal structures is an artifact caused by model bias. This finding should have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanism of water oxidation that is catalyzed by PSII because it is incompatible with prevailing high valence paradigm (HVP) models for this process.",

          "authors": "Nathan Wu, Baohua Zhou, Margarida Agrochao, Damon A. Clark",
          "abstract": "Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception of motion at each location in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original. This intuition is also reflected in classical theoretical and practical models of motion estimation, in which velocity flow fields invert when inputs are reversed in time. However, here we report that this symmetry of motion perception upon time reversal is broken in real visual systems. We designed a set of visual stimuli to investigate time reversal symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila ’s well-studied optomotor rotation behavior. We identified a suite of stimuli with a wide variety of properties that can uncover broken time reversal symmetry in fly behavioral responses. We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast distributions yielded models that broke time reversal symmetry, even when the training data themselves were time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks may be more prone to time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise from constrained optimization in natural environments.",

We used LiLac, a lactate biosensor with a quantitative fluorescence-lifetime readout, as a model system to address these questions. X-ray crystal structures and engineered high-affinity metal bridges demonstrate that LiLac exhibits a large interdomain twist motion that pulls the fluorescent protein away from a “sealed,” high-lifetime state in the absence of lactate to a “cracked,” low-lifetime state in its presence. Understanding the structures and dynamics of LiLac will help to think about and engineer other fluorescent biosensors.",

          "abstract": "The long-term success of introduced populations depends on both their initial size and ability to compete against existing residents, but it remains unclear how these factors collectively shape colonization dynamics. Here, we investigate how initial population (propagule) size shapes the outcome of community coalescence by systematically mixing eight pairs of in vitro microbial communities at ratios that vary over six orders of magnitude, and we compare our results to neutral ecological theory. Although the composition of the resulting cocultures deviated substantially from neutral expectations, each coculture contained species whose relative abundance depended on propagule size even after ~40 generations of growth. Using a consumer–resource model, we show that this dose-dependent colonization can arise when resident and introduced species have high niche overlap and consume shared resources at similar rates. Strain isolates displayed longer-lasting dose dependence when introduced into diverse communities than in pairwise cocultures, consistent with our model’s prediction that propagule size should have larger, more persistent effects in diverse communities. Our model also successfully predicted that species with similar resource-utilization profiles, as inferred from growth in spent media and untargeted metabolomics, would show stronger dose dependence in pairwise coculture. This work demonstrates that transient, dose-dependent colonization dynamics can emerge from resource competition and exert long-term effects on the outcomes of community coalescence.",

Preclinical evidence suggests that imbalance of neuroimmune proresolving interactions within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) rather than at the site of inflammation plays mechanistic roles in persistent arthritis pain. Here, we inhibited production of proresolving lipid mediators by silencing 12/15-lipoxygenase expression in CX3CR1 + monocyte/macrophages conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In an arthritis model, hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity is exacerbated in male and female cKO mice in association with DRG infiltration of neutrophils, which migrate in response to leukotriene B 4 released by macrophages through 5-lipoxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid provided by neuron-derived vesicles. Neutrophils apoptosis promotes primary macrophage efferocytosis which is defective in cKO macrophages. In wild-type (WT) and cKO mice, intrathecal injection of MerTK activating antibody, attenuates persistent hypersensitivity and polarizes DRG macrophages toward a proresolving phenotype with production of antinociceptive lipoxin A 4 . Thus, we delineate a neuron–macrophage–neutrophil bidirectional circuit that can be exploited to reduce persistent arthritis pain.",

MAF induced drug tolerance in Mtb, remodeled its transcriptome, and protected Mtb from dying in microdroplets desiccating in air. Yet survival was not passive: Mtb appeared to rely on hundreds of genes to survive conditions associated with transmission. Essential genes subserving proteostasis offered most protection. A large number of conventionally nonessential genes appeared to contribute as well, including genes encoding proteins that resemble antidesiccants.

          "abstract": "The retina is responsible for converting light into electrical signals that, when transmitted to the brain, create the sensation of vision. The mammalian retina is epigenetically unique since the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) into retinal cells is accompanied by a decrease in DNA methylation in the promoters of many genes important for retinal development and function. However, the pathway responsible for DNA demethylation and its role in retinal development and function were unknown. We hypothesized that the Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) family of dioxygenases plays a key role in this pathway. To this end, we knocked out the TET family in RPCs and characterized the TET-deficient and control retinas using various approaches including electron microscopy, electroretinogram tests, TUNEL, RNA-seq, WGBS, and 5hmC-Seal. We found that while the TET-dependent DNA demethylation pathway contributes to the development of many retinal cell types, it is the most significant contributor to rod and cone photoreceptor development and function. We found that genetic ablation of TET enzymes in RPCs prevents demethylation and the activity of genes essential for rod specification and for rod and cone maturation. Reduced activity of genes responsible for rod specification results in the TET-deficient retina being depleted of these neurons. Meanwhile, reduced activity of genes responsible for rod and cone maturation leads to the underdevelopment or complete absence of outer segments and synaptic termini in the TET-deficient photoreceptors, which results in loss of their function and leads to blindness. These function-deprived, underdeveloped photoreceptors die over time, leading to retinal dystrophy.",

          "abstract": "Contacts between particles in dense, sheared suspensions are believed to underpin much of their rheology. Roughness and adhesion are known to constrain the relative motion of particles, and thus globally affect the shear response, but an experimental description of how they microscopically influence the transmission of forces and relative displacements within contacts is lacking. Here, we show that an innovative colloidal-probe atomic force microscopy technique allows the simultaneous measurement of normal and tangential forces exchanged between tailored surfaces and microparticles while tracking their relative sliding and rolling, unlocking the direct measurement of coefficients of rolling friction, as well as of sliding friction. We demonstrate that, in the presence of sufficient traction, particles spontaneously roll, reducing dissipation and promoting longer-lasting contacts. Conversely, when rolling is prevented, friction is greatly enhanced for rough and adhesive surfaces, while smooth particles coated by polymer brushes maintain well-lubricated contacts. We find that surface roughness induces rolling due to load-dependent asperity interlocking, leading to large off-axis particle rotations. In contrast, smooth, adhesive surfaces promote rolling along the principal axis of motion. Our results offer direct values of friction coefficients for numerical studies and an interpretation of the onset of discontinuous shear thickening based on them, opening up ways to tailor rheology via contact engineering.",

To elucidate the functional relevance of these interactions, we developed a mass spectrometry–based screening method for higher throughput in vitro enzyme assays.

Our identification of 50 inhibitors and 14 activators not only expands the range of known input signals but also uncovers novel regulatory logic. For instance, we observed that AMP inhibits malic enzyme to safeguard the cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and erythrose-4-phosphate inhibits 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to redirect flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. Discrepancies between our standardized assays and existing database entries suggest that many previously reported interactions might occur only under specific, often nonphysiological conditions. Our dataset represents a systematically determined functional protein–metabolite interaction network, establishing a baseline for allosteric regulation in central metabolism. These results enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic governing metabolic processes and underscore its significance in cellular adaptation and growth.",

However, it is often nearly impossible to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which a biological isotope effect manifests due to the complexity of these systems. As such, one proposed in vitro system of study for a quantum isotope effect is calcium phosphate aggregation, where symmetric calcium phosphate molecular species, known as Posner molecules, have been theorized to have phosphorus nuclear spin–dependent self-binding rates, which could be differently modulated by doping with stable lithium isotopes. Here, we present in vitro evidence for such a differential lithium isotope effect on the formation and aggregation of amorphous calcium phosphate from solution under certain conditions. Experiments confirm that lithium incorporates into amorphous calcium phosphate, with 7 Li found to promote a greater abundance of observable calcium phosphate particles than 6 Li under identical solution preparations. These in vitro results offer a potential explanation for in vivo biological studies that have shown differential lithium isotope effects. Given the importance of calcium phosphate in biological systems—ranging from mitochondrial signaling pathways to key biomineralization processes, as well as the proposed role of Posner molecules as a “neural qutrit”—these results present an important step in understanding calcium phosphate nucleation as well as the potential role of calcium phosphate for quantum biology and processing.",

          "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCC) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with variable potency that contribute to nearly every tissue and organ throughout the body. Considered unique to vertebrates, NCC are transiently generated within the dorsolateral region of the neural plate or neural tube during neurulation. Their delamination and migration are crucial for embryo development as NCC differentiation is influenced by their final resting locations. Previous work in avian and aquatic species revealed that NCC delaminate via an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which transforms these progenitor cells from static polarized epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells with fluid front and back polarity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating NCC delamination in mammals are poorly understood. Through time-lapse imaging of NCC delamination in mouse embryos, we identified a subset of cells that exit the neuroepithelium as isolated round cells, which then halt for a short period prior to acquiring the mesenchymal migratory morphology classically associated with delaminating NCC. High-magnification imaging and protein localization analyses of the cytoskeleton, together with measurements of pressure and tension of delaminating NCC and neighboring neuroepithelial cells, revealed that round NCC are extruded from the neuroepithelium prior to completion of EMT. Furthermore, cranial NCC are extruded through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1. Our results support a model in which cell density, pressure, and tension in the neuroepithelium result in activation of the live cell extrusion pathway and delamination of a subpopulation of NCC in parallel with EMT, which has implications for cell delamination in development and disease.",

          "abstract": "Positive selection at the 2q21.3 enhancer region for lactase gene ( LCT ) expression in Europeans and Africans has long been attributed to selection for lactase persistence (LP), the capacity of adults to digest lactose in milk, presumably because of the benefits associated with milk consumption. While considered a classic example of gene–culture coevolution, recently doubts have been raised about the link between selection at 2q21.3 and LP. Analysis of additional populations could shed further light; here, we demonstrate that a haplotype spanning ~467 kb at the 2q21.3 locus has risen to high frequency in East Asians (~25%) but is absent from Africans and Europeans. This haplotype likely derived from Neanderthals and has been under positive selection in East Asians. The East Asian–specific haplotype is associated with alterations in LCT expression and promoter methylation in certain cell types, similar to what is observed with LP-associated haplotypes in Europeans. Moreover, its frequency is comparable to that of LP in East Asians, suggesting a potential association with LP in East Asians. However, it is highly unlikely that selection in East Asians was related to milk-drinking habits. We find that this haplotype impacts the expression of UBXN4 , DARS1, and DARS1-AS1 in immune cells and is associated with neutrophil and white blood cell counts. Hence, the selection might be linked to certain aspects of immune function. This implies that selection on 2q21.3 has thus either occurred for different reasons in different populations or the selection observed in other populations is also not due to LP.",

          "abstract": "Large-diameter trees provide vital ecological functions in forested ecosystems. Old, large-diameter trees may also be vulnerable to climate-driven mortality events, but past work on large tree populations has been geographically limited. Here, we characterize the population of large-diameter trees from two size categories, 50 to 100 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) (medium) and &gt;100 cm DBH (big), within the United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis data. Although populations of big trees are concentrated along the west coast, populations of medium trees are more evenly distributed across the nation. In the western United States, trees &gt;50 cm DBH comprise ~75% of the total carbon stored in live trees, while in the eastern United States they comprise ~20%. Plot remeasurement data indicate that populations of big trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.49% in the west and 2.9% in the east, and populations of medium trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.5% in the west and 2.4% in the east. One exception is the Sierra Nevada region, where big trees are declining. Additionally, we observed declines for several individual species. While the overall population trend for large-diameter trees is positive, declines in these species could have localized impacts for the environments in which they occur.",

          "abstract": "While vegetation brings positive benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, the impact of ongoing global greening remains controversial due to its uncertain effects on hydrological cycle. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation dynamics on global water availability by proposing a comprehensive framework to quantify the terrestrial water sink and source scores associated with vegetation dynamics. These scores serve as indicators of whether large alterations in water resources have occurred in the lands due to either the greening or degradation of surface vegetation. We use multisource datasets from climate model projections, remote sensing, and local measurements to examine the impact of vegetation dynamics on water availability over the periods of 1982 to 2019 and 2015 to 2100. During historical observation periods, regions such as India and northern China experienced large depletion of water resources as a result of vegetation greening, leading to water scarcity. In the future, a shift is projected for India and northern China, transforming them into regions capable of meeting water demands arising from vegetation greening. This transition is largely attributed to wetting and warming climates. It indicates that trade-off effects between climate and underlying vegetation dynamics may result in strengthening regional hydrological resilience and ensuring the stable status of local water resources. Furthermore, tropical rainforests (except for the Amazon Rainforest) are experiencing greening with minimal impact on local water resources consistently. These insights are valuable for globally identifying optimal locations to implement ecological restoration, facilitating the balance of sustainable water resources and vegetation greening.",

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate detection of DNA from disease-causing pathogens is essential for controlling the spread of infections and administering timely treatments. While traditional molecular diagnostics techniques like PCR are highly sensitive, they include nucleic acid amplification and many need to be performed in centralized laboratories, limiting their utility in point-of-care settings. Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) have demonstrated the potential for highly specific molecular detection, but the sensitivity is often constrained by the slow trans-cleavage activity of Cas enzymes, necessitating preamplification of target nucleic acids. In this study, we present a CRISPR-Cascade assay that overcomes these limitations by integrating a positive feedback loop that enables nucleic acid amplification-free detection of pathogenic DNA at atto-molar levels and achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.3 within just 10 min. The versatility of the assay is demonstrated through the detection of bloodstream infection pathogens, including Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli , and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) spiked in whole blood samples. Additionally, we introduce a multiplexing OR-function logic gate, further enhancing the potential of the CRISPR-Cascade assay for rapid and accurate diagnostics in clinical settings. Our findings highlight the ability of the CRISPR-Cascade assay to provide highly sensitive and specific molecular detection, paving the way for advanced applications in point-of-care diagnostics and beyond.",

Using high-dimensional CO-detection by indexing, a technology for spatial imaging, this study examines the cellular microenvironment of MS lesions in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood–brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain. These results highlight EBV’s contribution to immune modulation, glial dysfunction, and neuronal damage in MS, particularly in progressive subtypes. The analysis of MS brain tissue suggests potential therapeutic targets, including antivirals and brain penetrant immune modulators, to address EBV’s impact on MS progression.",

Our strategy yielded multiple nanobody ligands for the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a prototypical GPCR and important drug target. We found that nanobodies readily act as allosteric modulators, encoding selectivity for both the receptor and chemical features of GPCR ligands. We then used structure-guided design to convert two nanobodies from allosteric ligands to competitive AT1R inhibitors through simple mutations. This work demonstrates that nanobodies can encode multiple pharmacological behaviors and have great potential as evolvable scaffolds for the development of next-generation GPCR therapeutics.",

We examined color qualia structures in children (3 to 12-y-old in Japan and 6 to 8-y-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-y-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures.

          "abstract": "Microsporidia are divergent fungal pathogens that employ a unique harpoon-like apparatus called the polar tube (PT) to invade host cells. The long PT is fired out of the microsporidian spore over the course of just a few hundred milliseconds. Once fired, the PT is thought to pierce the plasma membrane of a target cell and act as a conduit for the transfer of the parasite into the host cell, which initiates infection. The PT architecture and its association with neighboring organelles within the parasite cell remain poorly understood. Here, we use cryoelectron tomography to investigate the structural cell biology of the PT in dormant spores from the human-infecting microsporidian species, Encephalitozoon intestinalis . Segmentation and subtomogram averaging of the PT reveal at least four layers: two protein-based layers surrounded by a membrane layer and filled with a dense core. Regularly spaced protein filaments form the structural skeleton of the PT. Combining cryoelectron tomography with cellular modeling, we propose a model for the three-dimensional organization of the polaroplast, an organelle that surrounds the PT and is continuous with the outermost, membranous layer of the PT. Our results reveal the ultrastructure of the microsporidian invasion apparatus in situ, laying the foundation for understanding infection mechanisms.",

The human endometrium is receptive to a blastocyst for a brief period, the window of implantation. Critical knowledge underpinning biological processes leading to RIF, essential for effective treatment, is lacking. We employed spatial transcriptomics to define region- and cell-type-specific differences in endometrial gene expression in luteinizing hormone timed biopsies between women with RIF (n = 8) and fertile controls (FC) (n = 8). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing endometrial regions between FC and RIF (685 luminal epithelium, 293 glandular epithelium, 419 subluminal stroma, 264 functionalis stroma, 1,125 subluminal stromal CD45 + leukocytes, and 1,049 functionalis stromal CD56 + leukocytes). Only 57 DEGs were common to all subregions and cell types, which highlights that multiple DEGs are lost when the endometrium is examined as a single entity. When RIF-specific DEGs were leveraged against knowledge from mouse genetic models, genes associated with aberrant embryo implantation phenotypes were observed, mostly in immune cell populations. Dysregulated pathways in specific endometrial regions included the “WNT signaling pathway,” altered in the functionalis and subluminal stroma. “Response to estradiol” and “ovulation cycle” pathways were dysregulated in the subluminal stroma. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the RIF gene expression profile (e.g., raloxifene, bisoprolol). Our findings, in a well-characterized cohort, highly endorse consideration of each endometrial region and cell type as separate entities. Ignoring individual regions and composite cell populations will overlook important aberrations, forego potential treatment targets, and lead to research waste pursuing clinically irrelevant treatment options.",

These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y −1 ) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y −1 ) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs.

Here, we show a mathematical correspondence between a value function for goal-directed spatial navigation and an information measure for word embedding models in natural language processing. Based on this relationship, we integrate spatial and semantic computations into a neural representation model called “disentangled successor information” (DSI). DSI generates biologically plausible neural representations: spatial representations like place cells and grid cells, and concept-specific word representations which resemble concept cells. Furthermore, with DSI representations, we can perform inferences of spatial contexts and words by a common computational framework based on simple arithmetic operations. This computation can be biologically interpreted by partial modulations of cell assemblies of nongrid cells and concept cells. Our model offers a theoretical connection of spatial and semantic computations and suggests possible computational roles of hippocampal and entorhinal neural representations.",

As notorious corallivores, crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) have caused extensive losses of coral habitat during unexplained population outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific. While predation of adult CoTS may help to suppress their outbreaks, it does not sufficiently explain their profound boom-bust dynamics and so remains equivocal. Factors influencing early postsettlement mortality are generally more impactful on population size, thus lower trophic interactions involving juvenile CoTS may better contribute to outbreak prevention. We evaluated the impact of key predatory decapods that interact with juvenile CoTS in their coral rubble nursery before they emerge as destructive corallivores. Decapod density was influenced by habitat complexity and varied regionally, inverse to spatial trends in CoTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Using eDNA gut content analysis, we confirmed seven species (~12% of individuals) of wild-caught decapod, collected from two reefs separated by &gt;1,000 km, as CoTS predators. Owing to spatial variation in predator abundance and community structure, we estimated potential (previous aquarium experiments) and realized (eDNA results here) rates of CoTS consumption were ~3-fold and ~1.6-fold lower, respectively, in outbreak hotspots. Through combination of field and molecular techniques, we demonstrated the appreciable impact of cryptic predators on early population success of this nuisance species, which expands our knowledge of CoTS outbreaks, pest species management, and reef conservation. Resolving predator–prey interactions at lower levels of the ecosystem can be crucial to understanding broader ecological outcomes.",

In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 μm was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modeling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay and cost-benefit tradeoff between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notoriously immune-resistant, limiting the clinical efficacy of single-agent immune modulators and thereby necessitating the exploration of multimodal immunotherapy combinations. Traditional approaches combining conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors with neoantigen vaccines have shown some promise in treating PDAC but are often compromised by intratumoral T lymphocyte exhaustion and systemic toxicity. Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that mRNA polymeric nanoparticles encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies in situ at the tumor site enhance the therapeutic efficacy of neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine for PDAC. This mRNA-based, in situ anti-PD-1 antibody production strategy also protects tumor-infiltrating T cells from PD-1 inhibition, potentially reducing the toxicities induced by systemic checkpoint inhibition. Our study may provide an innovative dual mRNA nanoparticle strategy for effective tumor neoantigen immunotherapy, as well as an mRNA cancer combination therapy strategy with other clinically approved drugs (e.g., β-elemene).",

          "abstract": "UvrD-family helicases are superfamily 1A motor proteins that function during DNA replication, recombination, repair, and transcription. UvrD family monomers translocate along single-stranded (ss) DNA but need to be activated by dimerization to unwind DNA in the absence of force or accessory factors. However, prior structural studies have only revealed monomeric complexes. Here, we report the first structures of a dimeric UvrD-family helicase, Mycobacterium tuberculosis UvrD1, both free and bound to a DNA junction. In each structure, the dimer interface occurs between the 2B subdomains of each subunit. The apo UvrD1 dimer is observed in symmetric compact and extended forms indicating substantial flexibility. This symmetry is broken in the DNA-bound dimer complex with leading and trailing subunits adopting distinct conformations. Biochemical experiments reveal that the Escherichia coli UvrD dimer shares the same 2B–2B interface. In contrast to the dimeric structures, an inactive, autoinhibited UvrD1 DNA-bound monomer structure reveals 2B subdomain–DNA contacts that are likely inhibitory. The major reorientation of the 2B subdomains that occurs upon UvrD1 dimerization prevents these duplex DNA interactions, thus relieving the autoinhibition. These structures reveal that the 2B subdomain serves a major regulatory role rather than participating directly in DNA unwinding.",

          "abstract": "Transmissibility of respiratory viruses is a complex viral trait that is intricately linked to tropism. Several highly transmissible viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and Influenza viruses, specifically target multiciliated cells in the upper respiratory tract to facilitate efficient human-to-human transmission. In contrast, the zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) generally transmits poorly between humans, which is largely attributed to the absence of its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the upper respiratory tract. At the same time, MERS-CoV epidemiology is characterized by occasional superspreading events, suggesting that some individuals can disseminate this virus effectively. Here, we utilized well-differentiated human pulmonary and nasal airway organoid-derived cultures to further delineate the respiratory tropism of MERS-CoV. We find that MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in both pulmonary and nasal airway cultures. Using single-cell messenger-RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry, we show that MERS-CoV preferentially targeted multiciliated cells, leading to loss of ciliary coverage. MERS-CoV cellular tropism was dependent on the differentiation of the organoid-derived cultures, and replication efficiency varied considerably between donors. Similarly, variable and focal expression of DPP4 was revealed in human nose tissues. This study indicates that the upper respiratory tract tropism of MERS-CoV may vary between individuals due to differences in DPP4 expression, providing an explanation for the unpredictable transmission pattern of MERS-CoV.",

The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity—roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis of this disordered system offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.",

However, how dynamic H3K27me3 mediates plant response to R light is poorly understood. Here, we report that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), an H3K27me3 demethylase, promotes hypocotyl elongation under R light in Arabidopsis . Upon exposure to R light, REF6 preferentially interacts with the active Pfr form of phyB. Consequently, phyB enhances REF6 accumulation and its binding ability, which are necessary for inducing cell-elongation-related genes from open chromatin, ensuring normal plant growth under prolonged light exposure. Moreover, REF6 acts together with the phyB-PIF4 module to mediate light regulation of hypocotyl growth.

Yet, despite extensive study of the global level of nonequilibrium in the brain, quantifying the irreversibility of interactions among brain regions at multiple levels remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we present the Directed Multiplex Visibility Graph Irreversibility framework, a method for analyzing neural recordings using network analysis of time-series. Our approach constructs directed multilayer graphs from multivariate time-series where information about irreversibility can be decoded from the marginal degree distributions across the layers, which each represents a variable. This framework is able to quantify the irreversibility of every interaction in the complex system. Applying the method to magnetoencephalography recordings during a long-term memory recognition task, we quantify the multivariate irreversibility of interactions between brain regions and identify the combinations of regions which showed higher levels of nonequilibrium in their interactions. For individual regions, we find higher irreversibility in cognitive versus sensorial brain regions while for pairs, strong relationships are uncovered between cognitive and sensorial pairs in the same hemisphere. For triplets and quadruplets, the most nonequilibrium interactions are between cognitive–sensorial pairs alongside medial regions. Combining these results, we show that multilevel irreversibility offers unique insights into the higher-order, hierarchical organization of neural dynamics from the perspective of brain network dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Despite the growing number of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) structures being resolved, the dynamic process of how GPCRs transit from the inactive toward the active state remains unclear. In this study, comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore how ligand binding modulates the conformational dynamics of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R). We observed a sequential occurrence of structural changes in the inactive-to-active transition of M2R induced by a superagonist iperoxo, which includes the orthosteric binding site contraction, the TM6 opening into an intermediate conformation, and a further structural change toward full activation upon binding to G protein or a G protein mimetic nanobody. Two activation intermediates were identified, which show structural features different from those reported for apo-GPCRs. Moreover, our results suggest that stabilization of a specific W400 6.48 conformation and enhanced F396 6.44 dynamics are crucial for activation, whereas distinct side-chain rotamer equilibriums of Y206 5.58 in the cytoplasmic cavity are correlated with agonist efficacies.

Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.",

While eight binding sites on the tubulin dimer have been structurally characterized, this study reveals a ninth. We found that the tubulin inhibitor Tumabulin-1 (TM1, a BML284 derivative) binds simultaneously to the well-known colchicine site and a previously unknown site, designated as Tumabulin site. This site resides at the interface of α1-tubulin, β1-tubulin, and RB3 within the tubulin–RB3–tubulintyrosine ligase complex. Remarkably, two TM1 molecules bind cooperatively to this relatively large pocket, interacting with all three proteins. Crucially, this binding is dependent on RB3; it is absent when RB3 is missing or the key residue H71 is mutated (H71Q). We further designed and synthesized Tumabulin-2 (TM2) that selectively binds the Tumabulin site, excluding binding the colchicine site. TM2 acts as a molecular glue, strengthening the interaction between RB3 and the tubulin dimer and consequently enhancing RB3’s tubulin-depolymerizing activity. In conclusion, our findings confirm the existence of a ninth tubulin-binding site and offer a promising foundation for developing Tubulin–RB3 molecular glues as a next generation of anticancer therapeutics.",

Herein, we demonstrated that pyroptosis—a recently identified inflammatory type of regulated cell death dependent on gasdermin D (GSDMD)—was activated in the cochleae of cisplatin-treated mice, causing CIHL. Meanwhile, treatment with the GSDMD inhibitor necrosulfonamide alleviated CIHL in these mice. To further examine the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in CIHL, we conducted experiments in Gsdmd- deficient mice . Gsdmd −/− mice demonstrated significantly lower cisplatin-induced cochlear damage than control mice and appeared to be invulnerable to CIHL. Furthermore, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the stria vascularis (SV), but not in the hair cells (HCs), played a dominant role in CIHL. In marginal cells (MCs) of SV, cisplatin induced caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage, and the pore-forming N-terminal of GSDMD rapidly localized to the mitochondria, leading to abnormal mitochondrial aggregation and oxidative stress. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in MCs might result in the severe progression of inflammation, SV damage, and HC loss. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis using the FDA-approved drug disulfiram effectively alleviated the symptoms of CIHL. Collectively, these findings offer a broad avenue for inhibiting pyroptosis-induced cisplatin ototoxicity and provide valuable theoretical insights for the clinical management of CIHL.",

          "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-Megabase regions in vertebrate genomes with enriched intradomain interactions that restrict enhancer–promoter contacts across their boundaries. However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, here we show that the width of TAD boundaries forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBSs distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the random crosslinker polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis, using three generic boundary categories, identifies differential influence on TAD insulation, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in establishing genome organization. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer–promoter contacts over long distances across TAD boundaries, providing a further mechanism for transcriptional regulation.",

More than seven decades have passed since Waddington’s pioneering demonstration of the acquisition of morphological traits through genetic assimilation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by performing combined genomic analyses of Waddington’s genetic assimilation experiments using the ectopic veins (EV) phenocopy in Drosophila as a model. Our study reveals the assimilation of EV in both outbred and inbred fly natural populations, despite their limited genetic diversity. We identified key changes in the expression of developmental genes and pinpointed selected alleles involved in EV assimilation. The assimilation of EV is mainly driven by the selection of regulatory alleles already present in the ancestral populations, including the downregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cad96Ca by the insertion of a transposable element in its 3′ untranslated region. The genetic variation at this locus in the inbred population is maintained by a large chromosomal inversion. In outbred populations, the evolution of EV results from a polygenic response shaped by the selective environment. Our results support a model in which selection for multiple preexisting alleles in the ancestral population, rather than stress-induced genetic or epigenetic variation, drives the evolution of EV in natural fly populations.",

          "abstract": "Androgen and estrogen, key sex hormones, were long thought to be exclusively produced by vertebrates. The O 2 -dependent aromatase that converts androgen to estrogen (estrogenesis) has never been identified in any prokaryotes. Here, we report the finding of anaerobic estrogenesis in a Peptococcaceae bacterium ( Phosphitispora sp. strain TUW77) isolated from the gut of the great blue-spotted mudskipper ( Boleophthalmus pectinirostris ). This strain exhibits testosterone fermentation pathways, transforming testosterone into estrogens and androstanediol under anaerobic conditions. Physiological experiments revealed that strain TUW77 grows exclusively on testosterone, utilizing the androgenic C-19 methyl group as both the carbon source and electron donor. The genomic analysis identified three copies of a polycistronic gene cluster, abeABC (anaerobic bacterial estrogenesis), encoding components of a classic cobalamin-dependent methyltransferase system. These genes, highly expressed under testosterone-fed conditions, show up to 57% protein identity to the characterized EmtAB from denitrifying Denitratisoma spp., known for methylating estrogen into androgen (the reverse reaction). Tiered transcriptomic and proteomic analyses suggest that the removed C-19 methyl group is completely oxidized to CO 2 via the oxidative Wood–Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), while the reducing equivalents (NADH) fully reduce remaining testosterone to androstanediol. Consistently, the addition of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate, an extracellular electron acceptor, to testosterone-fed TUW77 cultures enabled complete testosterone conversion into estrogen without androstanediol accumulation (anaerobic testosterone oxidation). This finding of aromatase-independent estrogenesis in anaerobic bacteria suggests that the ancient WLP may have contributed to the emergence of estrogens in the early biosphere.",

We used computer simulations of mammalian Arp2/3 complex to address fundamental questions about the mechanism. Metadynamics and umbrella free energy sampling simulations of the pathway revealed that a clash between the D-loop of Arp2 and Arp3 produces an energy barrier of 20 ± 6 kcal/mol between the inactive splayed and active short-pitch conformations of Arp2/3 complex. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that binding the CA motif of the nucleation-promoting factor Neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (N-WASp) to inactive, splayed Arp2/3 complex shifts it toward the short-pitch active conformation and opens a binding site for an actin monomer on Arp3. Other simulations showed that this actin monomer stabilizes a transition state of Arp2/3 complex. These observations together with prior experimental work provide insights required to propose a physically grounded pathway for actin filament branch formation.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are only partially understood. We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.",

          "abstract": "Some viruses counter host-cell efforts to digest invading viral RNA by using special structures resistant to host RNases, known as exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). xrRNAs typically form an unusual fold with the 5′-end threaded through a ring consisting of a multihelix junction closed by a pseudoknot. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we previously showed that a Zika virus xrRNA is extremely rigid mechanically, withstanding very high forces, and that this mechanical resistance—not simply the knot-like fold topology—is essential for RNase resistance. Here, we have determined which interactions are most important for generating mechanical rigidity in the Zika virus xrRNA, by systematically mutating tertiary contacts. We found that removing any of the tertiary contacts involving the threaded 5′ end was sufficient to abrogate mechanical resistance. In contrast, breaking a single pseudoknot base pair was not sufficient to do so: Two broken pairs were needed. This hierarchy of interaction importance for mechanical rigidity was supported by simulations mapping how mechanical tension was distributed within the xrRNA. For all mutants, RNase resistance varied in lock-step with mechanical resistance, confirming the primary role of mechanical rigidity in xrRNA function. This work reveals which interactions are most important for Zika xrRNA function, with implications for targeting the xrRNA therapeutically.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which NBS1 mutations cause clinical phenotypes of NBS, such as craniofacial dysmorphism, is still unclear. Here, we show that NBS1 localizes at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in nucleoli and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and TCOF1. Loss of NBS1 impairs Pol I-dependent transcription of pre-rRNA and induces nucleolar stress. In particular, lacking Nbs1 in mouse neural crest cells not only leads to the reduction of ribosome biogenesis but also craniofacial abnormalities during prenatal development. Moreover, the C-terminus of NBS1 is associated with pre-rRNA and a number of pre-rRNA processing factors, which may also facilitate pre-rRNA maturation. Taken together, our study reveals the functions of NBS1 in rRNA biogenesis.",

Here, we report that a p53-induced circular RNA circASCC3 promotes chemotherapeutic resistance by resolving R-loops. Our results reveal that p53 directly activates the transcription of ASCC3 , the host gene of circASCC3. In addition, the RNA-binding protein SFPQ is identified to inhibit the formation of circASCC3 by associating with its flanking regions. Importantly, p53 facilitates the formation of circASCC3 by repressing the expression of SFPQ. CircASCC3 has a marginal effect on the survival and growth of cancer cells under normal growing conditions but surprisingly boosts their survival and growth in response to DNA damage stress. Mechanistic analysis reveals that circASCC3 binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 to inhibit its proteasomal degradation. This results in the prevention of R-loop accumulation due to DNA damage, thereby conferring tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Together, our study uncovers that p53 activates circASCC3 to promote R-loop resolution, which maintains genomic stability and potentially contributes to chemoresistance.",

Unless their therapeutic effects are solely mediated by paracrine, transplanted stem cells need to be highly plastic to adapt to the host tissue environment and differentiate into constituent tissue-specific cells for tissue repair. Stem cells used in current cell-based therapies either have limited differentiation potential or are pluripotent but must be strictly restricted to avoid tumorigenicity risk in vivo. Here, we describe the derivation of human adult high-plasticity stem cells, which we call guide-integrated adult stem cells (giaSCs), from the interaction of blood-derived guide cells and umbilical cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). The guide cells are a cell population derived from the peripheral blood of human adults. Unidirectional transfer through nanotube-like structures of granular substances from the guide cells into the recipient UC-MSCs gave rise to giaSCs. Topical application of human giaSCs into full-layer excisional wounds of wild-type mice led to reconstitution of skin tissue. Systemically administered human giaSCs migrated to and reside in mouse small intestinal tissue damaged by lipopolysaccharides and then differentiated into small intestinal epithelial cells for tissue repair. These transplantation experiments demonstrated that giaSCs have in vivo high plasticity. Additional in vivo and in vitro data showed that giaSCs have low immunogenicity and are nontumorigenic. These data indicate that giaSCs offer a highly promising approach to stem cell therapy.",

However, the contribution and biological significance of the totipotency-related gene duplication events in early embryo development remain poorly understood. Here, we focus on Dux cluster, the master regulator of ZGA that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of 2C-like cells and activation of totipotency-related genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). By reducing Dux gene copies from 31 to 0 or 1 through CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generate Dux -KO and Dux (n = 1) mESC lines, respectively. We uncover that the totipotency-related gene transcriptional profile is awakened to a much lesser extent in Dux (n = 1) mESCs compared to wild type mESCs following global DNA demethylation reprogramming or induction of DNA damage, mimicking the intrinsic events in preimplantation development.

          "abstract": "Bifacial cambium, which produces xylem and phloem, and monopodial architecture, characterized by apical dominance and lateral branching from axillary buds, are key developmental features of seed plants, consisting of angiosperms and gymnosperms. These allow seed plants to adapt to diverse environments by optimizing resource allocation and structural integrity. In seed plants, SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE ( SMXL ) family members function in phloem development and strigolactone-induced inhibition of axillary bud outgrowth. Although strigolactone signaling regulates most SMXL family members, the only known regulator of SMXL4 and SMXL5 is the RNA-binding protein JULGI. We demonstrate that in angiosperms, by directly regulating SMXL4/5 expression, JULGI uncouples SMXL4/5 activity from strigolactone signaling. JULGI and ancestral SMXL s from seedless vascular plants or SMXL4/5 from seed plants are coexpressed in the phloem tissues of vascular plants, from lycophytes to angiosperms. Core angiosperm SMXL4/5 mRNAs contain a G-rich element in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) that serves as a target sequence for JULGI to negatively regulate SMXL4/5 expression. Heterologous expression of JULGI s from various angiosperms rescued the Arabidopsis jul1 jul2 mutant. Expressing SMXL4/5 s from seed plants and ancestral SMXL s rescued Arabidopsis smxl4 smxl5 . Angiosperm SMXL4/5s lack an RGKT motif for proteasomal degradation. Indeed, treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog rac -GR24 induced proteasomal degradation of SMXL from ferns and SMXL5a from gymnosperms, but not SMXL4/5 from angiosperms. These findings suggest that in ancestral angiosperms, the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5 gained G-rich elements, creating a regulatory module with JULGI that allows the phloem development pathway to act independently of strigolactone signaling.",

          "abstract": "To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as E ( 3 d n − 1 4 s 1 ) − E ( 3 d n − 2 4 s 2 ) . Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the 4s 2 configuration. Here, we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from the local spin density approximation (LSDA) to the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the regularized and restored Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (r 2 SCAN) meta-GGA for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (∼2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew–Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an “energy penalty” associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.",

Circuit reconfiguration appears to be a feature of the cerebral cortex, so understanding the dynamical principles underlying self-reconfiguration may prove of import to elucidate brain function. We present a very simple example of dynamical reconfiguration: a family of networks whose signal pathways can be switched on the fly, only through use of their inputs, with no changes to their synaptic weights. These are single-layer convolutional recurrent network with local unitary synaptic weights and a smooth sigmoidal activation function. We generate traveling waves using the high spatiotemporal frequencies of the input, and we use the low spatiotemporal frequencies of the input to landscape the ongoing activity, channeling said traveling waves through an input-specified spatial pattern. This mechanism uses inherent properties of marginally stable, dynamically critical systems, which are a direct consequence of their unitary convolution kernels: every network in the family can do this. We show these networks solve the classical connectedness detection problem, by allowing signal propagation only along the regions to be evaluated for connectedness, and forbidding it elsewhere.",

Here, we used whole-mount tissue clearing of full mouse brains to image RGC anterograde transport function and astrocyte responses across retinorecipient regions early in a unilateral microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. Using light sheet imaging, we found that RGC projections terminating specifically in the accessory optic tract are the first to lose transport function. Although degeneration was induced in one retina, astrocytes in both brain hemispheres responded to transport loss in a retinotopic pattern that mirrored the degenerating RGCs. A subpopulation of these astrocytes in contact with large descending blood vessels were immunopositive for LCN2, a marker associated with astrocyte reactivity. Together, these data suggest that even early stages of unilateral glaucoma have broad impacts on the health of astrocytes across both hemispheres of the brain, implying a glial mechanism behind neurodegenerative comorbidity in glaucoma.",

Using a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach to estimate TSI from both satellite-based observations and proxies gives two complementary explanations: recent satellite-based observations of TSI contain unaccounted-for positive linear drifts, and regression-based reconstructions are affected by commonly used solar magnetic proxies becoming less sensitive to TSI variations at low values. After accounting for satellite instrument drifts and reduced sensitivity, direct and proxy observations come into agreement and together indicate a linear trend in overall TSI of −0.15 W/m 2 per decade with a 95% CI of −0.17 to −0.13 W/m 2 per decade between 1980 and 2023.",

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here, we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a space-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction, and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision-making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.",

Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation.

To understand heterogeneity across microbiome samples from different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental replicates, we present FAVA ( F ST -based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances), a framework for characterizing compositional variability across two or more microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are identical and 1 when each sample is entirely composed of a single taxon (and at least two distinct taxa are present across samples). Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic F ST , with samples playing the role of “populations” and taxa playing the role of “alleles.” Its mathematical properties allow users to compare datasets with different numbers of samples and taxonomic categories. We introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and spatial or temporal distances between samples. We demonstrate FAVA in two examples. First, we use FAVA to measure how the taxonomic and functional variability of gastrointestinal microbiomes across individuals from seven ruminant species changes along the gastrointestinal tract. Second, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of gut microbiomes in healthy humans following an antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the antibiotic’s influence on temporal microbiome variability.

          "abstract": "Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.",

          "abstract": "Infiltrating macrophages contribute to muscle dystrophic changes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In a DMD mouse model, mdx 5cv mice, CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) deficiency diminishes Ly6C hi macrophage infiltration by blocking blood Ly6C hi inflammatory monocyte recruitment. This is accompanied by transient improvement of muscle damage, fibrosis, and regeneration. The benefit, however, is lost after the expansion of intramuscular Ly6C lo macrophages. To address the mechanisms underlying the Ly6C lo macrophage expansion, we compared mdx 5cv /Nur77 −/− and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− /Nur7 −/− mice with mdx 5cv and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− mice, respectively, and found no evidence to suggest Ly6C lo monocyte recruitment by dystrophic muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Flt3 cre /Rosa26 LSL-YFP -based lineage tracing of macrophage origins demonstrated the expansion and pathogenic activation of muscle resident macrophages in CCR2-deficient mdx 5cv mice. The expansion was associated with increased cell proliferation, which appeared induced by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) derived from fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Our study establishes a pathogenic role for skeletal muscle resident macrophages and supports a regulatory role of FAPs in stimulating the expansion of resident macrophages in the DMD mouse model when the inflammatory macrophage infiltration is inhibited.",

          "abstract": "The transthyretin (TTR) tetramer, assembled as a dimer of dimers, transports thyroxine and retinol binding protein in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Aggregation of wild type (WT) or pathogenic variant TTR leads to transthyretin amyloidosis, which is associated with neurodegenerative and cardiac disease. The trigger for TTR aggregation under physiological conditions is unknown. The tetramer is extremely stable at neutral pH, but aggregation via tetramer dissociation and monomer misfolding can be induced in vitro by lowering the pH. To elucidate factors that may cause TTR aggregation at neutral pH, we examined the effect of shear forces such as those that arise from fluid flow in the vascular system. Fluid shear forces were generated by rapidly stirring TTR solutions in conical microcentrifuge tubes. Under agitation, TTR formed β-rich aggregates and fibrils at a rate that was dependent upon protein concentration. The lag time before the onset of agitation-induced aggregation increases as the total TTR concentration is increased, consistent with a mechanism in which the tetramer first dissociates to form monomer that either partially unfolds to enter the aggregation pathway or reassociates to form tetramer. NMR spectra recorded at various time points during the lag phase revealed growth of an aggregation-prone intermediate trapped as a dynamically perturbed tetramer. Enhanced conformational fluctuations in the weak dimer–dimer interface suggest loosening of critical intersubunit contacts which likely destabilizes the agitated tetramer and predisposes it toward dissociation. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of aggregation of WT human TTR under near-physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake is critical in cardiac adaptation to chronic stressors. Abnormalities in Ca 2+ handling, including mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, have been implicated in pathological heart hypertrophy. Enhancing mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) expression has been suggested to interfere with maladaptive development of heart failure. Here, we addressed whether MCU modulation affects the cardiac response to pressure overload. MCU content was quantified in human and murine hearts at different phases of myocardial hypertrophy. Cardiac function/structure were analyzed after Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) in mice undergone viral-assisted overexpression or downregulation of MCU. In vitro and ex vivo assays determined the effect of MCU modulation on mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, cellular phenotype and hypertrophic signaling. In human and murine hearts MCU levels increased in the adaptive phase of myocardial hypertrophy and declined in the failing stage. Consistently, modulation of MCU had a cell-autonomous effect in cardiomyocyte/heart adaptation to chronic overload. Indeed, upon TAC MCU-downregulation accelerated development of contractile dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis and heart failure. Conversely, MCU-overexpression prolonged the adaptive phase of hypertrophic response, as, in advanced stages upon TAC, hearts showed preserved contractility, absence of fibrosis and intact vascularization. In vitro and ex vivo analyses indicated that enhancement in mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes entails “mitochondrion-to-cytoplasm” signals leading to ROS-mediated activation of Akt, which may explain the protective effects towards heart response to TAC. Enhanced mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake affects the compensatory response to pressure overload via retrograde mitochondrial-Ca 2+ /ROS/Akt signaling, thus uncovering a potentially targetable mechanism against maladaptive myocardial hypertrophy.",

In tropical mountains, plants are mostly expected to migrate upslope in response to warming. To assess this, we analyze shifts in elevation ranges of species in Mesoamerican cloud forests using three decades of species’ occurrence records. Our findings reveal a mean upslope shift of 1.8 to 2.7 meters per year since 1979 driven by the upslope retreat of the less thermophilic montane species. These shifts are mostly accompanied by retreating lower and upper edges attributed to varying degrees of species’ exposure to deforestation and climate change.

          "abstract": "Peroxisomes are vital but often overlooked metabolic organelles. We found that excessive interferon signaling remodeled macrophage peroxisomes. This loss of peroxisomes impaired inflammation resolution and lung repair during severe respiratory viral infections. Peroxisomes were found to modulate lipid metabolism and mitochondrial health in a macrophage type-specific manner and enhanced alveolar macrophage-mediated tissue repair and alveolar regeneration after viral infection. Peroxisomes also prevented excessive macrophage inflammasome activation and IL-1β release, limiting accumulation of KRT8 high dysplastic epithelial progenitors following viral injury. Pharmacologically enhancing peroxisome biogenesis mitigated both acute symptoms and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) in animal models. Thus, macrophage peroxisome dysfunction contributes to chronic lung pathology and fibrosis after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.",

We mechanically reinforced perovskite thin films by integrating a polymer-coupled monolithic single-layer graphene interface that led to a twofold enhancement in modulus and hardness. The synergistic effect of graphene and poly(methyl methacrylate) restricted photoinduced lattice expansion and decreased the deformation ratio from 0.31 to 0.08%, which minimized the structural damage caused by dynamic lattice evolution.

Domestication for its starchy roots involved a near-total shift from sexual to clonal propagation, and almost all manioc worldwide is now grown from stem cuttings. In this work, we analyze 573 new and published genomes, focusing on traditional varieties from the Americas and wild relatives from herbaria, to reveal the effects of this shift to clonality. We observe kinship over large distances, maintenance of high genetic diversity, intergenerational heterozygosity enrichment, and genomic mosaics of identity-by-descent haploblocks that connect all manioc worldwide. Interviews with Indigenous traditional farmers in the Brazilian Cerrado illuminate how traditional management strategies for sustaining, diversifying, and sharing the gene pool have shaped manioc diversity.",

This seemingly straightforward question is often unanswerable because regulations, monitoring approaches, and reporting structures cannot keep up with the rapid human-induced shifts to the planet and atmosphere. The air is becoming more burdened by pollutants from new sources such as intense fires at the wildland-urban interface, an ever-expanding area where human development meets natural habitats. Air pollution is the second leading cause of human death worldwide, a statistic that excludes numerous indoor and acute outdoor exposures. To protect public health everywhere, air quality standards must be modernized, advanced instrumentation mobilized, and collaborative networks established to move air quality assessment into the 21st century.",

In this study, we demonstrated exciton formation in a single molecule through ultrafast electron tunneling processes between a molecule and a metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) using a phase-controlled terahertz (THz) pulse. The pronounced luminescence of the well-defined molecular system under the distinct carrier-envelope phase of the THz pulse revealed that sequential state-selective electron-tunneling processes to the frontier molecular orbitals promoted ultrafast exciton formation in the molecule at the STM junction. Furthermore, ultrafast control of exciton formation was achieved using phase- and delay-controlled THz pulse pairs, providing a route for the regulation of molecular dynamics and the emergence of new molecular functions.",

This operationally simple and highly functionally compatible reaction works on a wide range of unactivated alkenes. PIFA, a commercially available and inexpensive hypervalent iodine reagent, is key to this reactivity. Our mechanistic proposal is supported by chemical trapping experiments, which concomitantly demonstrate the utility of our method to access valuable N -heterocycles. Additionally, our method can be used as a general strategy for synthesizing amides and amines, as well as 15 N-labeled molecules.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes have linear DNA and their telomeres are hotspots for transposons, which in some cases took over telomere maintenance. Here we identify several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in linear chromosomes and plasmids of cyanobacteria and Streptomyces . While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence, with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show that they move using two transposon ends, likely when transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems. Mobilization of the element and the associated telomere allows replacement of native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new transposon telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, significantly influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.",

In this study, we demonstrate that proteins with shared functions share amino acid sequence codes that guide them to compartment destinations. We developed a protein language model, ProtGPS, that predicts with high performance the compartment localization of human proteins excluded from the training set. ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in the nucleolus. ProtGPS identified pathological mutations that change this code and lead to altered subcellular localization of proteins. Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution to diverse subcellular compartments.",

Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.",

If accurate, such age-driven skill losses pose a major threat to the human capital of societies with rapidly aging populations. We estimate actual age-skill profiles from individual changes in literacy and numeracy skills at different ages. We use the unique German longitudinal component of the Programme of the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC-L) that retested a large representative sample of adults after 3.5 years. Our empirical approach separates age from cohort effects and corrects for measurement error from reversion to the mean. Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties. Women have larger skill losses at older age, particularly in numeracy.",

First, although women today report higher levels of life satisfaction and overall happiness than men, they experience worse outcomes in mental health and negative affect. Second, despite substantial advances in women’s social and economic status over the past 50 years, their well-being relative to men has declined. We explore the evidence supporting these paradoxes, considering potential explanations related to differential expectations, biology, and scale use. Using global data from 2006 to 2023 and long-term data from Europe and the US since the 1970s, we provide empirical illustrations. These findings reveal a diverse and seemingly inconsistent pattern of gender well-being gaps between countries, suggesting that the first paradox is not universally applicable.

We establish a direct geochemical link between DT volcanism as recorded in marine osmium isotopic data and global climate change documented in benthic foraminifera carbon and oxygen isotope records. Based on our state-of-the-art astronomically calibrated age model, two major shifts in marine 187 Os/ 188 Os at 66.49 and 66.28 million years ago are contemporaneous with major eruption phases of the DT and disruptions of the global carbon cycle. Geochemical records and modeling suggest larger erupted volumes with high volatile emissions for the early phase of DT volcanism and point to differing emissions of SO 2 and CO 2 during the observed marine osmium shifts with diverse effects on the global climate system.",

Comprehensive exploration of endogenous metabolites that drive aging remains insufficient.

Systematic investigations demonstrated that citrulline exhibited antiaging effects by reducing cellular senescence, protecting against DNA damage, preventing cell cycle arrest, modulating macrophage metabolism, and mitigating inflammaging. Long-term citrulline supplementation in aged mice yielded beneficial effects and ameliorated age-associated phenotypes. We further elucidated that citrulline acts as an endogenous metabolite antagonist to inflammation, suppressing proinflammatory responses in macrophages. Mechanistically, citrulline served as a potential inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in macrophage and regulated the mTOR–hypoxia-inducible factor 1α–glycolysis signaling pathway to counter inflammation and aging. These findings underscore the significance of citrulline deficiency as a driver of aging, highlighting citrulline supplementation as a promising therapeutic intervention to counteract aging-related changes.",

We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.",

Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids. The timed oxygen tension elevation can be suppressed by hypoxia treatment or silencing of neuroglobin gene. This study provides insights into the role of oxygen in early neurogenesis from functional, genotypic, phenotypic, and proteomic aspects.

This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.",

We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.",

We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis.

Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.",

Here, we show that the pathway leading to cell death depends on the nature of the activating signal. Previous models suggest that in steady state, TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die slowly and spontaneously predominantly by uncontrolled tumor necrosis factor–RIPK1–driven death. However, upon infection of cells that express the NLRP3 inflammasome, (e.g., macrophages), with pathogens that activate this pathway (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes ), TBK1/IKKε-deficient cells die rapidly, prematurely, and exclusively by enhanced NLRP3-driven pyroptosis. Even infection with the RIPK1-activating pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis , results in enhanced RIPK1–caspase-8 activation and enhanced secondary NLRP3 activation. Mechanistically, TBK1/IKKε control endosomal traffic, and their loss disrupts endosomal homeostasis, thereby signaling cell stress. This results in premature NLRP3 activation even upon sensing “signal 2” alone, without the obligatory “signal 1.” Collectively, TBK1/IKKε emerge as a central brake in limiting death-induced inflammation by both RIPK1 and NLRP3 death-inducing pathways.",

Herein, we reveal that lipopolysaccharide stimulation increases LACC1-dependent isocyanic acid production, which attenuates inflammation by limiting the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages primed with lipopolysaccharide for 8 hours. Mechanistically, isocyanic acid directly carbamoylates NLRP3 at lysine-593 to disrupt NLRP3-NEK7 interaction, a key step in assembly of active NLRP3 inflammasome. Abrogation of isocyanic acid biosynthesis by LACC1 / Lacc1 knockout or expression of K593 carbamoylation (K593ca)–deficient NLRP3 mutant promotes macrophagic inflammatory response in vitro. Furthermore, Lacc1 −/− mice and mice harboring K593ca-deficient NLRP3 mutation manifest exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo.

Little is known about its hepatotoxic effects, which we aimed to characterize in this study. In a mouse model of chronic hyperammonemia without preexisting liver disease, we observed development of liver fibrogenesis and necroptotic cell death. Hyperammonemia also induced dysregulation of its main metabolic pathway, the urea cycle, as reflected by down-regulation of urea cycle enzyme protein expression and accumulation of its metabolites. Inhibition of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its upstream inducer Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protected against liver injury and further hyperammonemia. In clinically relevant rodent models of hyperammonemia (genetic ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and bile duct ligation–induced cirrhosis), TLR4 inhibition reduced circulating ammonia. In conclusion, hyperammonemia induces liver fibrogenesis and RIPK1-mediated cell death, which is associated with urea cycle dysfunction. Inhibition of RIPK1 and TLR4 protects against hyperammonemia-induced liver injury and are potential therapeutic targets for hyperammonemia and chronic liver disease progression.",

Micro- and nanorobots have been used to eliminate biofilm infections in hard-to-reach regions inside the body. However, applying antibiofilm robots under physiological conditions is limited by the conflicting demands of accessibility and driving force. Here, we introduce a liquid-bodied antibiofilm robot constructed by a dynamically cross-linked magnetic hydrogel. Leveraging the viscoelastic response of the robot enables it to adapt to complex surface topographies such as medical meshes and stents. Upon actuation, the robot can mechanically destroy the biofilm matrix, chemically deactivate bacterial cells, and collect disrupted biofilm debris. The robot’s antibiofilm performance is studied in vitro and demonstrated on a medical mesh and a biliary stent. Tracking and navigation under endoscopy and x-ray imaging in an ex vivo porcine bile duct are demonstrated. Last, in vivo antibiofilm treatment is conducted by indwelling infected stents into mice’s abdominal cavity and clearing the biofilm infection using the proposed robot.",

This platform comprises a high-resolution closed-loop video imaging system, coupled with a deep learning network to annotate 35 body parts, and a computational pipeline to extract behaviors from high-dimensional data. FlyVISTA reveals the distinct spatiotemporal dynamics of sleep and wake-associated microbehaviors at baseline, following administration of the sleep-inducing drug gaboxadol, and with dorsal fan-shaped body drivers. We identify a microbehavior (“haltere switch”) exclusively seen during quiescence that indicates a deeper sleep stage.

Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4.

Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.",

We found that PDAC cells were identified by signatures of glycans detected by four glycan-binding proteins (VVL, CA19-9, sTRA, and GM2) and that there are three types of glycan-defined PDAC tumors: sTRA type, CA19-9 type, and intermixed.

          "abstract": "Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and Max-like protein X (MLX) form a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that couples intracellular sugar levels to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.",

This remarkable activity is largely attributable to the deltaproteobacterial family Desulfobacteraceae of complete oxidizers (to CO 2 ), which our biogeography focused meta-analysis verified as cosmopolitan. However, the catabolic/regulatory networks underlying this ecophysiological feat at the thermodynamic limit are essentially unknown. Integrating cultivation-based (80 conditions) proteogenomics of six representative Desulfobacteraceae spp., we identify molecular commonalities explaining the family’s environmental relevance and success. Desulfobacteraceae genomes are specifically enriched in substrate uptake, degradation capacities, and regulatory functions including fine-tuned sulfate uptake. Conserved gene arrangements and shared regulatory patterns translate into strikingly similar (sub-)proteome profiles. From 319 proteins, we constructed a meta-network for catabolizing 35 substrates. Therefrom, we defined a Desulfobacteraceae characteristic gene subset, which we found prevalent in metagenomes of organic-rich, marine sediments. These genes are promising targets to advance our mechanistic understanding of Desulfobacteraceae -driven biogeochemical processes in marine sediments and beyond.",

The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein.

We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem.

Distinct regions within the CARD bind to phosphate groups and long acyl chains of self- and nonself-lipids. Self-lipid binding capability is conserved across numerous caspase-11 homologs and orthologs.

          "abstract": "While energetic plasmonic hot carriers in nonthermal equilibrium states have pushed the limits of energy conversion efficiency in plasmon-driven photocatalysts and optoelectronics, the acceleration of plasmonic hot-hole flux remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate an approach to control the generation and injection nature of plasmonic hot holes released from Au nanomesh/p-type GaN (p-GaN) Schottky architecture by modulating polarity of p-GaN. This polarity modulation enhances the flux of hot holes into the plasmonic platform, thereby accelerating Landau damping stemming from increased effective heat capacity of hot electrons in the metallic nanomaterial. We observed that this strategy drives the intensified hot-hole flux even in non–hot spot areas, hinting at the prospect of leveraging the complete potential of the plasmonic device beyond usual hot spots. The polarity modulation in plasmonic Schottky device gives rise to opportunities for manipulating the nature of plasmonic hot carriers for future energy conversion devices.",

Mutations in C9ORF72 are the most frequent cause, but it is not understood why there is notable regional pathology. An increased burden of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in ALS-FTLD brains implicates mitochondrial mechanisms; however, it remains unclear how and when these mutations arise. To address this, we generated cerebral organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) of patients with ALS-FTLD harboring the C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion alongside CRISPR-corrected isogenic and healthy controls. Here, we show a higher mtDNA single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) burden in astroglia derived from C9ORF72 -mutant organoids, with some de novo mtSNVs likely due to the C9ORF72 repeat and others evading selection to reach higher heteroplasmy levels. Thus, the functional consequences of the regional accumulation of mtSNVs in C9ORF72 ALS-FTLD brains are likely to manifest through astroglial mitochondrial dysfunction.",

However, the mechanisms governing cardiomyocyte fate decisions remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, genetically encoded biosensors, and in toto live imaging, we observe intrinsic variations in erbb2 expression and its association with trabecular fate. Specifically, erbb2 promotes PI3K activity and recruits the Arp2/3 complex, inducing a polarized accumulation of the actomyosin network to drive cell delamination. Subsequently, the lineage-committed nascent trabeculae trigger Notch activity in neighboring cardiomyocytes to suppress erbb2 expression and reduce cell tension, thereby confining them to the compact layer. Overall, this genetic and cellular interplay governs compact and trabecular cell fate determination to orchestrate myocardial pattern formation.",

Studying past comparable crises can offer insights, but there is no fossil evidence of diverse megafloral ecosystems surviving the largest Phanerozoic biodiversity crisis. Here, we investigated palynomorphs, plant, and tetrapod fossils from the Permian-Triassic South Taodonggou Section in Xinjiang, China. Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic.",

We found dietary induction and subsequent transgenerational inheritance of the predatory morph and identified a role of ubiquitin ligase EBAX-1/ZSWIM8 in this process. Ppa-ebax-1 mutants are transgenerational inheritance defective, and Ppa- EBAX-1 destabilizes the clustered microRNA family miR-2235a/miR-35. Deletions of a cluster of 44 identical miR-2235a copies resulted in precocious and extended transgenerational inheritance of the predatory morph.

A key highlight is the successful assembly of DNA motifs in nickel-containing buffer at temperatures below 40°C, otherwise unachievable at higher temperatures or using an annealing protocol.

The in situ–generated O-Fe-P structure serves as the origin of the enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity of the catalyst, a finding supported by theoretical calculations.

The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.",

Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic.

Several ASD mouse models ( Scn2a +/− , Fmr1 −/− , Cdkl5 −/− ) exhibit impaired spatial learning, with these deficits often attributed to hippocampal dysfunction. However, we identify the perirhinal cortex (PRC) as a critical driver of these deficits. Cortical-wide Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons replicated the spatial learning and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairments—a cellular correlate of learning—seen in Scn2a +/− mice, while hippocampal-wide reduction did not. PRC-specific viral-mediated Scn2a reduction in excitatory neurons decreased release probability, which consequently disrupted synaptic transmission and LTP in the hippocampus, as well as spatial learning. As PRC activity was reduced, chemogenetic activation of the PRC reversed these deficits in Scn2a +/− mice and rescued spatial learning and LTP impairments in Fmr1 and Cdkl5 knockout mice.

We show that these emergent features can be used to predict mechanical property enhancements arising from postspin drawing. Simulations recapitulate a purely process-dependent mechanical property envelope in which order enhances fiber strength while preserving toughness. The relationship between chain extension and crystalline domain alignment observed in simulations is validated by Raman spectroscopy of wet-spun fibers. Property enhancements attributed to the progression of anisotropic extension are verified by mechanical tests of drawn silk fibers and justified by theory.

Furthermore, splenic monocytes isolated from β-glucan–trained mice revealed enhanced procoagulant activity up to 4 weeks after β-glucan administration compared to monocytes from control mice over the same time period. Moreover, hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow interstitial fluid from β-glucan–trained mice had enhanced procoagulant activity compared to control mice. Trained immunity and associated metabolic perturbations may therefore represent an opportunity for targeted intervention in immunothrombotic disease development.",

          "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is an inevitable stage in the progression of most chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis are crucial for effectively managing chronic liver conditions. However, there lacks a noninvasive and sensitive imaging method capable of early assessing fibrosis activity. Here, we report a molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe for imaging fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) even in very early fibrotic livers. This method relies on FAP-catalyzed in situ self-assembly of its substrate probe that leads to the increase of the rotational correlation time (τ R ) of probe, thereby notably amplifies T 1 MRI signal. Thanks to the superior specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reaction, our method has been validated as highly selective and sensitive to FAP in two liver fibrosis mouse models. By establishing a direct correlation between MRI signals and fibrosis activity, our method enables continuous monitoring of liver fibrotic disease progression and assessment of treatment responses.",

          "abstract": "Excessive neutrophil infiltration can exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage, contributing to conditions like autoimmune disorders and liver diseases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) share homing mechanisms with neutrophils, showing promise for treating such diseases. However, ex vivo expanded MSCs often suffer from reduced homing efficiency due to the loss of essential ligands. Here, we engineer MSCs with P-selectin and E-selectin targeting peptides, assembling them into bispecific polyvalent structures using DNA self-assembly technology. This modification allows engineered MSCs to compete with chemotactic neutrophils for selectin binding sites on endothelial cells. In a mouse model of acute liver failure, engineered MSCs effectively home to the damaged liver and substantially inhibit excessive neutrophil infiltration. The combination of inhibiting neutrophil infiltration and the MSCs’ inherent therapeutic properties lead to superior therapeutic outcomes. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that engineered MSCs elevate the levels of Marco_macrophage, which have neutrophil-inhibitory effects. Our study offers a perspective for advancing MSC-based therapies in tissue repair.",

To address this limitation, we have developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy–based technique called oxygen-excluded nanoimaging. By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends.",

High HLA evolutionary divergence (HED) at the DQ locus in the donor was an independent predictor of BKPyV-free outcome. More generally, we highlighted the protective effect of highly divergent pairs of HLA-DQ heterodimers corresponding to heterozygous HLA-DQα01/non-DQα01 combinations. We then defined a functional divergence metrics assessed by the similarity of peptide-binding motifs between pairs of HLA-DQ molecules. Greater functional divergence correlated with the size of the BKPyV-derived DQ-bound immunopeptidome and a lower risk of BKPyV reactivation, thus providing a molecular basis for the observed genetic differences. Together, these data provide evidence for a direct link between donor HLA-DQ genetic and functional divergence, diversity of the DQ-bound immunopeptidome, and control of viral infection, likely reflecting stronger antiviral T cell responses.",

Earlier estrogen depletion—via earlier menopause—has been associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic dysfunction also incites and exacerbates AD progression. We investigated whether age at menopause and synaptic health together influence AD neuropathology and cognitive trajectories using clinical and autopsy data from 268 female decedents in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We observed significant interactions between age at menopause and synaptic integrity on cognitive decline and tau tangles, such that earlier menopause strengthened the associations of reduced synaptic integrity with faster cognitive decline and elevated tau. Exploratory analyses showed that these relationships were attenuated in women who took menopausal hormone therapy. These findings suggest that midlife endocrine processes or their sequalae may influence synaptic vulnerability to AD.

Here, we reveal the nongenomic molecular mechanism of progesterone as the activation of human and murine inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir7.1, which is expressed in myometrium and placental pericytes during late gestation. Kir7.1 is also activated by selective steroids, including those used to prevent premature labor, such as 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate and dydrogesterone, revealing their unexpected mode of action. Our results reveal that Kir7.1 is the molecular target of both endogenous and synthetic steroids that control uterine excitability and placental function.

On mitochondria, voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) interacts with BAK and BAX through a common interface to inhibit BAK or to facilitate BAX apoptotic activity. We identified a small molecule (WEHI-3773) that inhibits interaction between VDAC2 and BAK or BAX revealing contrasting effects on their apoptotic activity. WEHI-3773 inhibits apoptosis mediated by BAX by blocking VDAC2-mediated BAX recruitment to mitochondria. Conversely, WEHI-3773 promotes BAK-mediated apoptosis by limiting inhibitory sequestration by VDAC2. In cells expressing both pro-apoptotic proteins, apoptosis promotion by WEHI-3773 dominates, because activated BAK activates BAX through a feed-forward mechanism. Loss of BAX drives resistance to the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in some leukemias. WEHI-3773 overcomes this resistance by promoting BAK-mediated killing.

Aging preferentially changed gene expression on the X’s relative to autosomes. Select genes on the Xi underwent activation, with new escape across cells including in the dentate gyrus, critical to learning and memory.

Mouse blastocysts express oxytocin receptors, and oxytocin induced delayed implantation-like dispersion in cultured embryos.

          "abstract": "As a member of the proton-sensing GPCR receptors, GPR132 plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell functions, but the mechanism by which GPR132 affects natural killer (NK) cells has not yet been reported. Here, RNA-seq displayed that the expression of GPR132 was reduced in activated NK cells, and the proportion of mature NK cells in GPR132 −/− mice was substantially increased compared to WT mice, with stronger anti-melanoma capabilities. Further investigation indicates that GPR132-deficient NK92 cells expressed more GzmB and IFN-γ and exhibited stronger cytotoxicity. Mechanically, GPR132 regulates NK cell function through the CSK/ZAP70/NF-κB signaling axis. Down-regulation of GPR132 weakens the inhibition of NK cell function by lactate, thereby enhancing the functional execution of CAR-NK cells against colorectal cancer. These results highlight the previously unrecognized role of GPR132 in the regulation of NK cell function and that inhibition of GPR132 provided an updated insight for NK cell therapy.",

However, how individual subunits within tetramers control channel functionality remains unresolved. Here, we investigate (i) whether opening of KCNQ2 channels requires a concerted step or can result from independent subunit activation and (ii) how individual subunits regulate gate opening and conductance. The E140R mutation in the S2 segment prevents activated voltage sensor conformations, but concatemeric constructs containing up to three E140R subunits retain KCNQ2-like currents. The underlying single-channel currents show subconductance levels resulting from limitations in inner gate dimensions, determined by the number of activated subunits and their spatial arrangement. Channel opening is allosteric and requires activation of only a single subunit, which can accentuate the influence of clinically relevant heterozygous mutations at threshold voltages.",

NMDARs consist of two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits (2A-2D), which determine their pharmacological properties. Few compounds selectively targeting GluN2 subunits with antidepressant effects have been identified. Here, we present YY-23, a compound that selectively inhibits GluN2C- or GluN2D-containing NMDARs. Cryo-EM analysis revealed that YY-23 binds to the transmembrane domain of the GluN2D subunit. YY-23 primarily affects GluN2D-containing NMDARs on GABAergic interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, suppressing GABAergic neurotransmission and enhancing excitatory transmission. Behavioral assays demonstrate YY-23’s rapid antidepressant effects in both stress-naïve and stress-exposed models, which are lost in mice with global or selective knockout of the grin2d gene in parvalbumin-positive interneurons.

          "abstract": "The metazoan transcription elongation complex (EC) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) generally stalls between the transcription start site and the first (+1) nucleosome. This promoter-proximal pausing involves negative elongation factor (NELF), 5,6-dichloro-1-β- d -ribobenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), and transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS) and is critical for subsequent productive transcription elongation. However, the detailed pausing mechanism and the involvement of the +1 nucleosome remain enigmatic. Here, we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of ECs stalled on nucleosomal DNA. In the absence of TFIIS, the EC is backtracked/arrested due to conflicts between NELF and the nucleosome. We identified two alternative binding modes of NELF, one of which reveals a critical contact with the downstream DNA through the conserved NELF-E basic helix. Upon binding with TFIIS, the EC progressed to the nucleosome to establish a paused EC with a partially unwrapped nucleosome. This paused EC strongly restricts EC progression further downstream. These structures illuminate the mechanism of RNAPII pausing/stalling at the +1 nucleosome.",

          "abstract": "Circadian rhythms orchestrate physiological processes such as metabolism, immune function, and tissue regeneration, aligning them with the optimal time of day (TOD). This study identifies an interplay between the circadian clock within muscle stem cells (SCs) and their capacity to modulate the immune microenvironment during muscle regeneration. We reveal that the SC clock triggers TOD–dependent inflammatory gene transcription after injury, particularly genes related to neutrophil activity and chemotaxis. These responses are driven by cytosolic regeneration of the signaling metabolite nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), as enhancing cytosolic NAD + regeneration in SCs is sufficient to induce inflammatory responses that influence muscle regeneration. Mononuclear single-cell sequencing of the regenerating muscle niche further implicates the cytokine CCL2 in mediating SC-neutrophil cross-talk in a TOD-dependent manner. Our findings highlight the intersection between SC metabolic shifts and immune responses within the muscle microenvironment, dictated by circadian rhythms, and underscore the potential for targeting circadian and metabolic pathways to enhance tissue regeneration.",

However, the controlled synthesis of 2D OLHs with in-plane tunable emission remains a great challenge owing to the difficulty in the sequential integration of multiple components. Here, a cascaded strategy is demonstrated for the hierarchical assembly of OLHs with in-plane multicolor emission, from red-blue and red-green to lateral red-green-blue (RGB), with a lateral size of ~15 micrometers. The tunable regions of 2D OLHs are realized by synergistic effects of the molecular doping method and the photo-induced oxidation route during the epitaxial growth process. The obtained OLHs can actively achieve full-spectrum light transport from 420 to 720 nanometers depending on different excitation positions and thus function as multimode RGB signal converters. These findings provide insights into the epitaxial growth of OLHs for the development of next-generation organic optoelectronics.",

Women were scanned over a 4.5-year (SD, 2.1; range, 1.3 to 10.4) and 3.5-year (SD, 1.5; range, 1.2 to 8.1) period for Aβ and tau, respectively, ~14 years after the initiation of HT. In older women (aged &gt;70 years), HT users exhibited faster regional tau accumulation relative to non-users, localized to the entorhinal cortex and the inferior temporal and fusiform gyri, with an indirect effect of HT on cognitive decline through regional tau accumulation. In younger women (aged &lt;70 years), HT associations with tau accumulation were negligible. Findings are relevant for optimizing menopausal treatment guidelines.",

Analogous to magnetic stirrers, AVS arrays perturb the fluid through oscillating pressure nodes, controllable in terms of speeds and amplitudes via modulation. By optimizing the kinetics of surface-tethered DNA and enzymes via AVS, we achieve a 7.74% improvement in the stepwise yield of enzymatic DNA synthesis. In addition, the AVS enhanced DNA logic gate architecture can complete responses within 2 minutes, achieving average speed enhancement of 8.58 times compared to the non-AVS configuration. With its tunability, ease of integration, and efficiency, this technology holds promises for applications in biology and chemistry.",

Scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl 3 , where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and, thus, in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl 3 /graphene sample.

          "abstract": "Credible projections of Arctic warming and wetting (AWW) are essential for informed decision-making in a changing climate. However, current AWW projections from state-of-the-art climate models carry uncertainties. Using observational datasets and CMIP6 model simulations, we demonstrate that the observed historical global warming trend and the climatological mean pattern of Arctic sea ice can serve as effective constraints on AWW projections. Under SSP2-4.5, the constrained warming by the end of the century is reduced from 5.5° to 4.6°C. Similarly, the projected wetting decreases from 6.8 to 5.7 millimeter per month. The inter-model spread in warming and wetting is reduced by 25 and 15%, respectively. The reduction is the largest in the Barents-Kara seas, reducing warming by 1.2°C, lessening wetting by 1.7 millimeter per month, and decreasing the inter-model spread by one-third. Our findings suggest that unconstrained CMIP6 projections overestimate future AWW, particularly in the Barents-Kara seas, due to an overestimation of historical global warming and excessive sea ice in the models.",

HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV-seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe neurological symptoms than healthy EBV-seropositive and RRMS donor groups. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS diagnosis were associated with a significant increase in the number of central nervous system (CNS) infiltrating effector T cells due to enhanced proliferation of proinflammatory T cells and limited expansion of regulatory T cells.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa assembles the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) to precisely retaliate against aggressive competing bacteria. However, we lack an understanding of how the H1-T6SS assembly dynamically responds to nanomechanical forces. To address this, we analyzed live cells using correlative atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy. We show that indentation forces above 7 nanonewtons trigger local, repeated and targeted H1-T6SS assemblies within seconds of impact by the AFM tip. Analysis of the corresponding AFM force curves shows that a breach of a single layer of the cell envelope is necessary and sufficient for triggering H1-T6SS assembly. Accordingly, polymyxin B nonapeptide, which damages the outer membrane, also triggers H1-T6SS assembly. This suggests that P. aeruginosa has evolved a danger-sensing mechanism that enables rapid and precise deployment of its antibacterial H1-T6SS in response to breaches in the outer membrane.",

While the transition to motherhood has recently been recognized as one of the most neuroplastic periods in adulthood, no study has yet explored whether the hippocampus and amygdala change during the peripartum in relation to childbirth experience and perinatal depression symptoms. In this longitudinal neuroimaging study, we assessed 88 first-time gestational mothers in late pregnancy and early postpartum and 30 nulliparous control women. We used optimized high-resolution MRI scans to quantify volumetric changes in the hippocampus and amygdala, along with their substructures. We found that increases in depression symptoms during the peripartum were positively correlated with changes in the right amygdala. A more challenging birth experience was associated with bilateral increases in hippocampal volume. These findings show that studying the neuroanatomical changes during the transition to motherhood can inform not only about adaptive processes but also about potential vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of tracking perinatal experiences to enhance women’s health.",
