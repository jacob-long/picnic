          "authors": "Yufeng Lin, Philippe Marti, Andrew Jackson",
          "abstract": "Magnetic field generation on Earth has probably persisted for at least 3.5 Gyr (refs. 1,2), initially sustained by secular cooling of the Earth’s core and, more recently, by the growth of the solid inner core3. Numerical models of the present-day geodynamo have proved to be successful in producing Earth-like magnetic fields4,5,6,7 and approaching realistic dynamic regimes8,9,10,11. However, thermal evolution12,13 and palaeomagnetic records14,15 suggest that the geodynamo operated for most of geomagnetic history without a solid inner core. Dynamo action in a whole fluid core remains poorly understood. Here we show dynamo actions that are independent of fluid viscosity in the correct geometry of the Earth’s core in the deep past at extremely low viscosity, demonstrating the negligible role of fluid viscosity in our dynamo simulations. Our early-Earth geometry models produce magnetic field intensity and morphologies that are compatible with the palaeomagnetic data in the deep past while showing remarkable similarity to the present-day magnetic field. This raises questions about the role of the solid inner core in producing the spatial-temporal variations of the observed Earth’s magnetic field7,16,17,18.",

          "abstract": "Projections of tropical rainfall under global warming remain highly uncertain1,2, largely because of an unclear climate response to a potential weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)3. Although an AMOC slowdown can substantially alter tropical rainfall patterns4,5,6,7,8, the physical mechanisms linking high-latitude changes to tropical hydroclimate are poorly understood11. Here we demonstrate that an AMOC slowdown drives widespread shifts in tropical rainfall through the propagation of high-latitude cooling into the tropical North Atlantic. We identify and validate this mechanism using climate model simulations and palaeoclimate records from Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)—a past period marked by pronounced AMOC weakening9,10. In models, prevailing easterly and westerly winds communicate the climate signal to the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean through the transport of cold air generated over the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic. Air–sea interactions transmit the response across the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, altering rainfall patterns as far as Indonesia, the tropical Andes and northern Australia. A similar teleconnection emerges under global warming scenarios, producing a consistent multi-model pattern of tropical hydroclimatic change. These palaeo-validated projections show widespread drying across Mesoamerica, the Amazon and West Africa, highlighting an elevated risk of severe drought for vulnerable human and ecological systems.",

          "abstract": "Magnetic soft robots offer considerable potential across various scenarios, such as biomedical applications and industrial tasks, due to their shape programmability and reconfigurability, safe interaction, and biocompatibility1–4. Despite recent advances, magnetic soft robots are still limited by the difficulties in reprogramming their required magnetization profiles in real time on the spot (in situ), which is essential for performing multiple functions or executing diverse tasks5,6. Here, we introduce a method for real-time, in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional (1D) tubes to three-dimensional (3D) frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These capabilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method emancipates magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems; thereby, opening new avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies.",

          "abstract": "Neutrinos are elementary particles that interact only very weakly with matter. Neutrino experiments are, therefore, usually big, with masses in the multi-tonne range. The thresholdless interaction of coherent elastic scattering of neutrinos on atomic nuclei leads to greatly enhanced interaction rates, which allows for much smaller detectors. The study of this process gives insights into physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The CONUS+ experiment 1 was designed to first detect elastic neutrino–nucleus scattering in the fully coherent regime with low-energy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactors. For this purpose, semiconductor detectors based on high-purity germanium crystals with extremely low-energy thresholds were developed 2 . Here we report the first observation of a neutrino signal with a statistical significance of 3.7 σ from the CONUS+ experiment, operated at the nuclear power plant in Leibstadt, Switzerland. In 119 days of reactor operation (395 ± 106) neutrinos were measured compared with a predicted number from calculations assuming Standard Model physics of (347 ± 59) events. With increased precision, there is potential for fundamental discoveries in the future. The CONUS+ results in combination with other measurements of this interaction channel might therefore mark a starting point for a new era in neutrino physics.",

          "abstract": "The European Union (EU) climate policies rely on a functioning forest carbon sink. Forests cover about 40% of the EU area and have absorbed about 436 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent per year between 1990 and 2022, which is about 10% of the EU’s anthropogenic emissions. However, the ability of forests to act as carbon sinks is rapidly declining owing to increasing natural and anthropogenic pressures, threatening the EU’s climate goals and calling for prompt actions. Here we provide actionable research recommendations to improve the monitoring and modelling of forest resources and their carbon sink, and to better inform forest management decisions. We suggest a timeline for the development of these measures to better support the implementation of strategies and policies outlined in the European Green Deal.",

          "abstract": "The periodic table provides an intuitive framework for understanding chemical properties. However, its traditional patterns may break down for the heaviest elements occupying the bottom of the chart. The large nuclei of actinides (Z > 88) and superheavy elements (Z ≥ 104) give rise to relativistic effects that are expected to substantially alter their chemical behaviours, potentially indicating that we have reached the end of a predictive periodic table1. Relativistic effects have already been cited for the unusual chemistry of the actinides compared with those of their lanthanide counterparts2. Unfortunately, it is difficult to understand the full impact of relativistic effects, as research on the later actinides and superheavy elements is scarce. Beyond fermium (Z = 100), elements need to be produced and studied one atom at a time, using accelerated ion beams and state-of-the-art experimental approaches. So far, no experiments have been capable of directly identifying produced molecular species. Here ions of actinium (Ac, Z = 89) and nobelium (No, Z = 102) were synthesized through nuclear reactions at the 88-Inch Cyclotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and then exposed to trace amounts of H2O and N2. The produced molecular species were directly identified by measuring their mass-to-charge ratios using FIONA (For the Identification Of Nuclide A)3. These results mark the first, to our knowledge, direct identification of heavy-element molecular species using an atom-at-a-time technique and highlight the importance of such identifications in future superheavy-element chemistry experiments to deepen understanding of their chemical properties.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation 1 . Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/C CDH1 ) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/C CDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes 2 , raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.",

          "abstract": "Transition metal–hydrides have been widely exploited in catalysis for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated moieties, including carbonyls, alkenes and alkynes1. To complement heterolytic metal–hydride bond cleavage, metal–hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) has recently gained attention, as a promising strategy for radical hydrofunctionalization of unactivated alkenes2, thus enabling late-stage diversification of complex molecules3,4. However, owing to the weak interactions between the prochiral organic radical and the enantiopure catalyst5, asymmetric MHAT6 remains challenging. Here we show that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) can be repurposed to catalyse asymmetric MHAT, a new-to-nature reaction. Directed evolution of P450BM3 yielded a triple mutant that catalyses MHAT radical cyclization of unactivated alkenes, producing diverse cyclic compounds—including pyrrolidines and piperidines—with up to 98:2 enantiomeric ratio under aerobic whole-cell conditions. Apart from electron-deficient alkenes, alternative radical acceptors—including hydrazones, oximes and nitriles—were converted by repurposed P450BM3 to enantioenriched cyclization products. Mechanistic investigations support an MHAT mechanism proceeding by homolytic cleavage of a fleeting iron(III)–hydride species2,6. Starting from CYP119, directed evolution afforded a stereocomplementary MHATase, highlighting the potential of repurposed CYPs for MHAT biocatalysis. Our study highlights the prospect of integrating homolytic metal–hydride reactivity into metalloenzymes, thus expanding the scope of asymmetric radical biocatalysis.",

However, a general methodology for targeting IDPs or IDRs has yet to be developed. Here we show that starting only from the target sequence of the input, and freely sampling both target and binding protein conformations, RFdiffusion5 can generate binders to IDPs and IDRs in a wide range of conformations. We used this approach to generate binders to the IDPs amylin, C-peptide, VP48 and BRCA1_ARATH in diverse conformations with a dissociation constant (Kd) ranging from 3 to 100 nM. For the IDRs G3BP1, common cytokine receptor γ-chain (IL-2RG) and prion protein, we diffused binders to β-strand conformations of the targets, obtaining Kd between 10 and 100 nM. Fluorescence imaging experiments show that the binders bind to their respective targets in cells. The G3BP1 binder disrupts stress granule formation in cells, and the amylin binder inhibits amyloid fibril formation and dissociates existing fibres, enables targeting of both monomeric and fibrillar amylin to lysosomes, and increases the sensitivity of mass spectrometry-based amylin detection. Our approach should be useful for creating binders to flexible IDPs or IDRs spanning a wide range of intrinsic conformational preferences.",

          "abstract": "The surface landscapes of cells differ as a function of cell type and are frequently altered in disease contexts1,2,3. Exploiting such differences is key to many therapeutic strategies and is the basis for developing diagnostic and basic-science tools. State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems.",

Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood 4 . ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation 5–7 . Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways 8–12 . Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC.",

There is an urgent medical need to develop new drugs that shorten the treatment duration to combat widespread multi-drug-resistant and extensive-drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we present a preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, that contains an aryl fluorosulfate (SuFEx)2 warhead and uniquely targets the acyltransferase domain of Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis. CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens.",

          "abstract": "Terrestrial ecosystems could contribute to climate mitigation through nature-based climate solutions (NbCS), which aim to reduce ecosystem greenhouse gas emissions and/or increase ecosystem carbon storage. Forests have the largest potential for NbCS, aligned with broader sustainability benefits, but—unfortunately—a broad body of literature has revealed widespread problems in forest NbCS projects and protocols that undermine the climate mitigation of forest carbon credits and hamper efforts to reach global net zero. Therefore, there is a need to bring better science and policy to improve NbCS climate mitigation outcomes going forward. Here we synthesize challenges to crediting forest NbCS and offer guidance and key next steps to make improvements in the implementation of these strategies immediately and in the near-term. We structure our Perspective around four key components of rigorous forest NbCS, illuminating key science and policy considerations and providing solutions to improve rigour. Finally, we outline a ‘contribution approach’ to support rigorous forest NbCS that is an alternative funding mechanism that disallows compensation or offsetting claims.",

          "abstract": "Across mammalian species, new mothers undergo behavioural changes to nurture their offspring and meet the caloric demands of milk production1,2,3,4,5. Although many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviours are well characterized6,7,8,9, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here we performed transcriptomic profiling of the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC (ARCAgRP neurons). To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay in which female mice chose between a food source or pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviours in both lactating and virgin females. We found that ARCAgRP neurons inhibit bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA (MPOABRS3 neurons), which become more active postpartum and govern parenting and satiety. Activation of this ARCAgRP-to-MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviours from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Allergens that induce allergic airway inflammation are highly diverse, but they commonly activate type 2 immune responses1,2. Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3,4,5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6,7,8,9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies.",

The communities dominated by siboglinid Polychaeta and Bivalvia span a distance of 2,500 km at depths from 5,800 m to 9,533 m. These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches, where methane is produced microbially from deposited organic matter, as indicated by isotopic analysis. Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated.

However, little is known about corticostriatal axon activity and structural plasticity during learning in the adult brain. Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution.",

We observed direct transformation of graphite (\\(10\\bar{1}0\\)) orientation to HD (0002) and graphite (0002) to HD (\\(10\\bar{1}0\\)). The bulk sample consists of threefold intergrowth of tightly knitted 100-nm-sized crystals, predominantly HD with trace imperfections of cubic diamond. The interlayer bonds in HD are shortened with respect to intralayer bonds to optimize the HD structure. Notably, the hardness of HD is only slightly higher than cubic diamond.

CRISPR-based gene editors derived from microorganisms, although powerful, often show notable functional tradeoffs when ported into non-native environments, such as human cells1. Artificial-intelligence-enabled design provides a powerful alternative with the potential to bypass evolutionary constraints and generate editors with optimal properties. Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing. We release OpenCRISPR-1 to facilitate broad, ethical use across research and commercial applications.",

Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation 2,3 . Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4 + T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8 + T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis.",

Here we use the generated atlas to characterize mouse lemur genes, physiology, disease and mutations. We uncover thousands of previously unidentified lemur genes and hundreds of thousands of new splice junctions including over 85,000 primate splice junctions missing in mice. We systematically explore the lemur immune system by comparing global expression profiles of key immune genes in health and disease, and by mapping immune cell development, trafficking and activation. We characterize primate-specific and lemur-specific physiology and disease, including molecular features of the immune program, lemur adipocytes and metastatic endometrial cancer that resembles the human malignancy. We present expression patterns of more than 400 primate genes missing in mice, many with similar expression patterns to humans and some implicated in human disease. Finally, we provide an experimental framework for reverse genetic analysis by identifying naturally occurring nonsense mutations in three primate immune genes missing in mice and by analysing their transcriptional phenotypes.

We also describe dozens of previously unidentified or sparsely characterized cell types. We globally compare expression profiles to define the molecular relationships of cell types across the body, and explore primate cell and gene expression evolution by comparing lemur transcriptomes to those of human, mouse and macaque. This reveals cell-type-specific patterns of primate specialization and many cell types and genes for which the mouse lemur provides a better human model than mouse 1 .

          "abstract": "Despite advances in HIV-1 prophylaxis, vertical transmission remains a pressing problem in developing countries1. Given the promise of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) for HIV-1 prevention2, we hypothesized that neonatal delivery of bNAbs using adeno-associated virus (AAV) could provide durable HIV-1 immunity during infancy. Here, using infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) as a model, we show that a one-time administration of an AAV vector encoding bNAb 3BNC117 at birth led to sustained bNAb expression for more than three years without redosing. This approach significantly protected both infant and pre-adolescent rhesus macaques from infection with simian–human immunodeficiency virus in mucosal challenge models that mimic HIV-1 transmission through breastfeeding and sexual intercourse. Age at the time of AAV-3BNC117 administration was a main determinant of success and was inversely correlated with the incidence of host anti-drug antibodies that restricted bNAb expression. Consistent with principles of neonatal tolerance3,4, newborn rhesus macaques exhibited higher levels of bNAb expression than older infants and juveniles following AAV-3BNC117 dosing. Furthermore, in utero exposure to recombinant 3BNC117 suppressed anti-drug antibodies and improved AAV-vectored delivery of this bNAb in older infants. Thus, our results suggest that neonatal and fetal immunological tolerance can be leveraged to improve postnatal AAV delivery of HIV-1 bNAbs in primates. Since years-long HIV-1 immunity can be generated in rhesus macaques from a one-time AAV vector administration at birth, future studies should evaluate the ability of this strategy to prevent perinatal and adolescent HIV-1 infections in humans.",

It achieves this through ligation, or splicing together two inactive protein fragments — each targeting a separate antigen — to form a functional protein, which can either stay tethered to the cell on which it was created or be released into the surrounding environment. The method was described in a study published on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nThe system’s capabilities are “compelling”, says Gevorg Grigoryan, a computational biologist who co-founded Generate Biomedicines, a therapeutics company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The technique has “broad relevance across diagnostics, cell engineering and therapeutics”, he adds.\n\nFor years, researchers have been experimenting with ways to target designer proteins to specific cells. Although many tools can recruit relevant proteins to the cell surface, for instance using antibodies, few can generate molecules on-site, says study co-author Tom Muir, a chemical biologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. Neither can these systems release synthesized proteins into the extracellular environment, he adds.\n\nTo overcome this hurdle, Muir and his team started by tweaking an existing protein ‘superglue’, called SpyCatcher003, so that it would create a designated protein, depending on the cell surfaces it encountered.\n\nShapeshifting proteins\n\nThe secrets to SMART’s shapeshifting abilities are ‘split inteins’ — short, non-functional protein segments that, when combined, can excise themselves from a protein. When the system attaches to two specific targets on the same cell, the inteins splice themselves out and snap the remaining fragments together to create a working molecule. “It kind of spits out this new protein that’s functional on the other side,” Muir explains.\n\nThe researchers programmed their system to target two cell-surface antigens called HER2 and EGFR, which play a part in cell growth and division. When they let SMART loose on K562 human leukaemia cells and added the SpyCatcher target, SpyTag003, coupled to a fluorescent dye, it produced a fluorescent signal — but only when it reacted with cells expressing both antigens, not those with just one or none at all. This result confirmed that the system could distinguish between target cells and others on the basis of the conditions that the team assigned.\n\nMuir and his colleagues then adapted SMART to target a cell-adhesion protein called EpCAM. They introduced this new design to cells that expressed different levels of EpCAM, HER2 and EGFR. Once again, the system could target and react only with cells that expressed the correct protein combinations — for instance, EpCAM and HER2 but not EGFR. The team could also tune the system to produce different amounts of its manufactured proteins, meaning that users can control its output levels.",

          "title": "Why suppressing all wildfires has made today’s megafires worse",
          "authors": "Jason Sharples",
          "abstract": "Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as the world warms — reigniting discussions on how to better manage fire risks. And the nature of wildfires is also changing. To avoid the worst damage, the development and behaviour of the most extreme wildfires need to be better understood.\n\nThe idea that wildfires can be managed simply by detecting — using satellites and drones, for example — and suppressing them early has become widespread. That might seem reasonable at first glance, but history tells us otherwise. It could even make things worse in the long run.\n\nYou’re not imagining it: extreme wildfires are now more common\n\nWe have been here before. In 1910, after a series of catastrophic wildfires in the northwestern United States, fire managers adopted a policy of total suppression: preventing ignitions as much as possible. The aim was to extinguish any blaze by 10 a.m. the next day. The policy was implemented using emerging technologies of the time: aircraft and chemical retardants. ‘Smokejumpers’ were trained to parachute into remote areas to quickly smother flames.\n\nThe exclusion of fires in various countries for decades protected homes and businesses to some extent — but it drove key changes in ecosystems. In the western United States, for example, Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests that had been shaped by millennia of frequent low-intensity fires were disrupted. Accumulation of dense thickets of young trees and shrubs increased the frequency of high-intensity fires that propagated through the crowns of trees and shrubs, which these forests were not adapted to withstand. Over time, such intense burning caused loss of biodiversity and altered the structure and composition of the forests in ways that increase the risk of large fires — the very thing the policy was intended to prevent.\n\nFire exclusion has also led to a loss of Indigenous culture and knowledge about managing landscapes with fire. In Australia, for example, Indigenous burning — the practice by Indigenous communities of stewarding ecosystems with controlled, low-intensity fires — was halted by colonizers in the late eighteenth century, leading to the emergence of a more flammable landscape dominated by eucalypt forests.\n\nThe causes of wildfires are clear. How they burn through communities is not\n\nIndeed, the emergence of megafires — those that burn more than 10,000 hectares — in the late twentieth century has been attributed to fire-exclusion policies. The accumulation of fuels combined with a warming climate and urban expansion favours fires that consume vast tracts of land and demand extensive and costly suppression resources.\n\nThe end of the twentieth century also saw a rise in the prevalence of extreme wildfires. Whereas megafires are defined by their size, extreme wildfires are characterized by their behaviour and intensity. They burn hotter than typical wildfires do and develop and propagate differently. For example, they can affect urban areas predominantly through showers of embers, burning leaves or twigs, carried by winds that have been strengthened by the fire’s influence on the atmosphere.",

          "abstract": "When you live alone on a broken spaceship, no one makes ranked lists. ‘Top Five Plants in the Hydroponics Bay!’ ‘Ten Entertainment Files You Just Can’t Miss!’ I tried, but nobody cared if I thought of a sixth favourite plant. Or if I just did miss one of the entertainment files. So I stopped.\n\nI keep a lot of records. Which day I planted the carrots, fixed the solar panel, read Felix Holt, the Radical. I could rank them, but I don’t think Judy would care. She’s very good at spotting what’s arbitrary.\n\nJudy is my ship. She had a fancy name before, when we had other crew and travelled to planets and stations, but after her FTL drive broke and everyone died, she told me she liked being called Judy, and I’m not one to argue even when the person I’m (not) arguing with is not also my house, grocery and everything else.\n\nI notice things like the lack of ranked lists, because otherwise life is very routine. I maintain the hydro bays, I collaborate with Judy on enviro needs (that means ‘cook meals’, I cook meals), I exercise, I take samples from the exterior and add them into the data set and look at the trends over time, which is interesting.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nI’m in a gaseous cloud. I mean, Judy is. There are a lot more interstellar clouds than people realize, but they’re usually pretty diffuse. This one is not a notable nebula, but it has filmy pink bits, which are nice, I guess. Before that, I lived in Charleston, South Carolina, and on Rho Oph Beta-4, which were also in the category of ‘nice, I guess’. The gaseous cloud gives me a lot to study, but it also blocks me from sending those studies back. At some point, Judy will reach a spot where she has clear transmission to a human settlement. Or not. I’m not in a hurry.\n\nI tried to start a list called ‘Things I Miss About Civilization’. I didn’t get any seeds out of my last tea plants, so I’ve been out of tea for three months. That was an easy one. After that I drew a bit of a blank. I liked my great-uncle, but he’d been dead a while, and anyway he only lived in one bit of civilization, not all of it. You’d have to sift through a lot of civilization to get to the bit he was in. Hardly worth it. Judy called my attention to some really interesting gas dynamics in our survey. I abandoned the list unfinished.\n\nI didn’t think anything of it when Judy suggested that we listen to one of the recordings of the Greater Jovian System Orchestra. Judy often likes to switch things up; I think she thinks it’s good for me. Or maybe it’s good for her. Similarly, her plan for me to have tapas did not ping my radar as anything other than varying the human’s diet, although I vetoed it on the grounds that it was too much work.\n\nI asked her to stop playing the noises of a busy coffee shop over her speakers while I was working. That was when I felt like she was having an odd day. But we both had odd days sometimes, it’s part of sentience. Odd doesn’t mean bad. I finished the latest batch of data analysis and went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, Judy informed me that we’d hit an unexpected clear patch while I was sleeping and she’d signalled for rescue. “I don’t know if anyone will get our signal, but I tried.”\n\n“Oh,” I said. “Oh good, thanks.”\n\n“Are you all right?”\n\n“Fine, thanks Judy.”\n\nBut I wasn’t all right. I was glum all afternoon at the prospect of returning to civilization. Civilization, where they had war and disease and queues for tickets! Civilization, where everyone who had ever annoyed me lived! Civilization — I couldn’t even list two things I’d missed about it! I’d had to work to narrow down my list of favourite plants in hydroponics.\n\nBut maybe I was being selfish. Maybe Judy wanted to be repaired, maybe she was uncomfortable. Missed the other spaceships. I couldn’t hold her back. When I was eating lunch, I attempted to make bright conversation (not my forte).\n\n“You’ll be glad to be back in for a tune-up, I bet,” I said.\n\n“… not really.”\n\n“But you’re missing your … uh … line mates, I’m sure.”\n\n“Oh no, we never got on.” There was a pause. “But you’ll be glad to … go to meetings? With other humans?”\n\n“I hate meetings,” I said fervently.\n\n“I thought humans liked them.”\n\n“Generally no. Also specifically no.”\n\n“Oh. You have so many of them.”",

          "title": "From bench to big boss: mitigating the widening gap between PI and lab",
          "authors": "Matthias Rillig, Henning Sprekeler",
          "abstract": "The age gap between principal investigators and their lab members gradually widens over time.Credit: Getty\n\nWhen you start a laboratory as a principal investigator (PI), you might not be much older than a postdoc in your research group. This was certainly the case for both of us. But this demographic closeness changes as you continue along your career path. M.R. obtained his PhD in 1997 and has been running a lab for more than 25 years; H.S. got his PhD in 2008 and celebrated his 10-year lab anniversary last year. At one point, we both realized that we were as old as our PhD advisers had been when we were students. Now, some of the students we supervise are 20 or 30 years younger than us. We think that, over time, dynamics in the lab can change as a result of this shift in age and experience, because with it comes authority and respect.\n\nThe change doesn’t happen overnight, and isn’t always easy to spot. As a PI, our day-to-day job doesn’t feel that different. We continue to mentor people, teach, write grant proposals and lead on the science. But, somewhere along the way, things shifted in terms of how we’re seen by our students.\n\nThis shift in perception of the PI has a number of important consequences. There are always power dynamics and hierarchies in research labs, even if those at the top try to keep the atmosphere friendly, fun and relaxed. They are not as obvious at first, when the lab is small and everybody has comparable levels of experience, but, as we’ve learnt, the difference between PI and lab members widens gradually over the years.\n\nWith time, perceived authority increases and power differences become more pronounced, even if there are also generational changes in attitudes to hierarchies. This means that everything we say and do has the potential to take on a different meaning now compared with when we were at the start of our careers. Maybe it’s a flippant comment on a manuscript draft, maybe it’s forgetting to acknowledge the effort someone put into a figure, but every small thing can take on more significance. A student might end up asking themselves: does he not appreciate what I did? Am I not good enough? Meanwhile, meeting lab colleagues for lunch can be perceived as more akin to a formal audience with a superior than the casual fun it was at the beginning of the career.\n\nWe won’t always know what the consequences of a remark could be for someone when it happens in the context of a clearly perceived professional hierarchy. That’s bad enough, but possibly even worse is the possible decrease in push-back and open debate as the gap between PI and lab members widens; when people hold back on voicing dissenting opinions because they feel cowed by a perceived authority it stifles scientific progress. This can result in labs gradually drifting towards dysfunction. M.R. remembers one lab meeting when, with full confidence, he said something that several lab members in attendance knew to be incorrect, but they didn’t speak up until after the meeting, because they didn’t want to expose his error in front of the group. And H.S. was surprised to find lab members spending a disproportionate amount of time addressing off-hand suggestions he had made, even though they had quickly realized that the ideas didn’t lead anywhere.\n\nA key area of interaction affected by a more pronounced professional hierarchy is criticism and feedback from the PI: on manuscripts, presentations and grant proposals, and during discussions in the lab. In our experience, a PI’s remarks can take on a much more serious meaning than intended, and tend to be perceived as much more absolute. When it comes to comments on rewriting a manuscript section, for example, suggestions can be taken by a junior lab colleague to mean ‘I failed, I didn’t live up to expectations’.",

          "title": "Physicists disagree wildly on what quantum mechanics says about reality, Nature survey shows",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is one of the most successful theories in science — and makes much of modern life possible. Technologies ranging from computer chips to medical-imaging machines rely on the application of equations, first sketched out a century ago, that describe the behaviour of objects at the microscopic scale.\n\nBut researchers still disagree widely on how best to describe the physical reality that lies behind the mathematics, as a Nature survey reveals.\n\nQuantum mechanics 100 years on: an unfinished revolution\n\nAt an event to mark the 100th anniversary of quantum mechanics last month, lauded specialists in quantum physics argued politely — but firmly — about the issue. “There is no quantum world,” said physicist Anton Zeilinger, at the University of Vienna, outlining his view that quantum states exist only in his head and that they describe information, rather than reality. “I disagree,” replied Alain Aspect, a physicist at the University of Paris-Saclay, who shared the 2022 Nobel prize with Zeilinger for work on quantum phenomena.\n\nTo gain a snapshot of how the wider community interprets quantum physics in its centenary year, Nature carried out the largest ever survey on the subject. We e-mailed more than 15,000 researchers whose recent papers involved quantum mechanics, and also invited attendees of the centenary meeting, held on the German island of Heligoland, to take the survey.\n\nThe responses — numbering more than 1,100, mainly from physicists — showed how widely researchers vary in their understanding of the most fundamental features of quantum experiments.\n\nAs did Aspect and Zeilinger, respondents differed radically on whether the wavefunction — the mathematical description of an object’s quantum state — represents something real (36%) or is simply a useful tool (47%) or something that describes subjective beliefs about experimental outcomes (8%). This suggests that there is a significant divide between researchers who hold ‘realist’ views, which project equations onto the real world, and those with ‘epistemic’ ones, which say that quantum physics is concerned only with information.\n\nThe community was also split on whether there is a boundary between the quantum and classical worlds (45% of respondents said yes, 45% no and 10% were not sure). Some baulked at the set-up of our questions, and more than 100 respondents gave their own interpretations (the survey, methodology and an anonymized version of the full data are available in supplementary information at the foot of this page).\n\n“I find it remarkable that people who are very knowledgeable about quantum theory can be convinced of completely opposite views,” says Gemma De les Coves, a theoretical physicist at the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nNature asked researchers what they thought was the best interpretation of quantum phenomena and interactions — that is, their favourite of the various attempts scientists have made to relate the mathematics of the theory to the real world. The largest chunk of responses, 36%, favoured the Copenhagen interpretation — a practical and often-taught approach. But the survey also showed that several, more radical, viewpoints have a healthy following.\n\nAsked about their confidence in their answer, only 24% of respondents thought their favoured interpretation was correct; others considered it merely adequate or a useful tool in some circumstances. What’s more, some scientists who seemed to be in the same camp didn’t give the same answers to follow-up questions, suggesting inconsistent or disparate understandings of the interpretation they chose.\n\n“That was a big surprise to me,” says Renato Renner, a theoretical physicist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. The implication is that many quantum researchers simply use quantum theory without engaging deeply with what it means — the ‘shut up and calculate’ approach, he says, using a phrase coined by US physicist David Mermin. But Renner, who works on the foundations of quantum mechanics, is quick to stress that there is nothing wrong with just doing calculations. “We wouldn’t have a quantum computer if everyone was like me,” he says.\n\nCopenhagen still reigns supreme\n\nOver the past century, researchers have proposed many ways to interpret the reality behind the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which seems to throw up jarring paradoxes. In quantum theory, an object’s behaviour is characterized by its wavefunction: a mathematical expression calculated using an equation devised by German physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. The wavefunction describes a quantum state and how it evolves as a cloud of probabilities. As long as it remains unobserved, a particle seems to spread out like a wave; interfering with itself and other particles to be in a ‘superposition’ of states, as though in many places or having multiple values of an attribute at once. But an observation of a particle’s properties — a measurement — shocks this hazy existence into a single state with definite values. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘collapse’ of the wavefunction.\n\nPhysicists should revel in the diversity of ways to understand quantum mechanics\n\nIt gets stranger: putting two particles into a state of joint superposition can lead to entanglement, which means that their quantum states remain intertwined even when the particles are far apart.\n\nThe German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who helped to craft the mathematics behind quantum mechanics in 1925, and his mentor, Danish physicist Niels Bohr, got around the alien wave–particle duality largely by accepting that classical ways of understanding the world were limited, and that people could only know what observation told them. For Bohr, it was OK that an object varied between acting like a particle and like a wave, because these were concepts borrowed from classical physics that could be revealed only one at a time, by experiment. The experimenter lived in the world of classical physics and was separate from the quantum system they were measuring.\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr not only took the view that it was impossible to talk about an object’s location until it had been observed by experiment, but also argued that an unobserved particle’s properties really were fundamentally unfixed until measurement — rather than being defined, but not known to experimenters. This picture famously troubled Einstein, who persisted in the view that there was a pre-existing reality that it was science’s job to measure.\n\nDecades later, an amalgamation of Heisenberg’s and Bohr’s not-always-unified views became known as the Copenhagen interpretation, after the university at which the duo did their seminal work. Those views remain the most popular vision of quantum mechanics today, according to Nature’s survey. For Časlav Brukner, a quantum physicist at the University of Vienna, this interpretation’s strong showing “reflects its continued utility in guiding everyday quantum practice”. Almost half of the experimental physicists who responded to the survey favoured this interpretation, compared with 33% of the theorists. “It is the simplest we have,” says Décio Krause, a philosopher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who studies the foundations of physics, and who responded to the survey. Despite its issues, the alternatives “present other problems which, to me, are worse”, he says.\n\nBut others argue that Copenhagen’s emergence as the default comes from historical accident, rather than its strengths. Critics say it allows physicists to sidestep deeper questions.\n\nDo our observations make reality happen?\n\nOne concerns the ‘measurement problem’, asking how a measurement can trigger objects to switch from existing in quantum states that describe probabilities, to having the defined properties of the classical world.\n\nAnother unclear feature is whether the wavefunction represents something real (an answer selected by 29% of those who favoured the Copenhagen interpretation) or just information about the probabilities of finding various values when measured (picked by 63% of this group). “I’m disappointed but not surprised at the popularity of Copenhagen,” says Elise Crull, a philosopher of physics at the City University of New York. “My feeling is that physicists haven’t reflected.”\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation’s philosophical underpinnings have become so normalized as to seem like no interpretation at all, adds Robert Spekkens, who studies quantum foundations at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. Many advocates are “just drinking the Kool-Aid of the Copenhagen philosophy without examining it”, he says.\n\nSurvey respondents who have carried out research in philosophy or quantum foundations, studying the assumptions and principles behind quantum physics, were the least likely to favour the Copenhagen interpretation, with just 20% selecting it. “If I use quantum mechanics in my lab every day, I don’t need to go past Copenhagen,” says Carlo Rovelli, a theoretical physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France. But as soon as researchers apply thought experiments that probe more deeply, “Copenhagen is not enough”, he says.\n\nWhat else is on the menu?\n\nIn the years after the Second World War and the development of the atomic bomb, physicists began to exploit the uses of quantum mechanics, and the US government poured cash into the field. Philosophical investigation was put on the back burner. The Copenhagen interpretation came to dominate mainstream physics, but still, some physicists found it unsatisfying and came up with alternatives (see ‘Quantum mechanics: five interpretations’).\n\nIn 1952, US physicist David Bohm resurfaced an idea first touted in 1927 by French physicist Louis de Broglie, namely that the strange dual nature of quantum objects made sense if they were point-like particles with paths determined by ‘pilot’ waves. ‘Bohmian’ mechanics had the advantage of explaining interference effects while restoring determinism, the idea that the properties of particles do have set values before being measured. Nature’s survey found that 7% of respondents considered this interpretation the most convincing.\n\nThen, in 1957, US physicist Hugh Everett came up with a wilder alternative, one that 15% of survey respondents favoured. Everett’s interpretation, later dubbed ‘many worlds’, says that the wavefunction corresponds to something real. That is, a particle really is, in a sense, in multiple places at once. From their vantage point in one world, an observer measuring the particle would see only one outcome, but the wavefunction never really collapses. Instead it branches into many universes, one for each different outcome. “It requires a dramatic readjustment of our intuitions about the world, but to me that’s just what we should expect from a fundamental theory of reality,” says Sean Carroll, a physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who responded to the survey.\n\nIn the late 1980s, ‘spontaneous collapse’ theories attempted to resolve issues such as the quantum measurement problem. Versions of these tweak the Schrödinger equation, so that, rather than requiring an observer or measurement to collapse, the wavefunction occasionally does so by itself. In some of these models, putting quantum objects together amplifies the likelihood of collapse, meaning that bringing a particle into a superposition with measuring equipment makes the loss of the combined quantum state inevitable. Around 4% of respondents chose these sorts of theories.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nNature’s survey suggests that ‘epistemic’ descriptions, which say that quantum mechanics reveals only knowledge about the world, rather than representing its physical reality, might have gained in popularity. A 2016 survey1 of 149 physicists found that only around 7% picked epistemic-related interpretations, compared with 17% in our survey (although the precise categories and methodology of the surveys differed). Some of these theories, which build on the original Copenhagen interpretation, emerged in the early 2000s, when applications such as quantum computing and communication began to frame experiments in terms of information. Adherents, such as Zeilinger, view the wavefunction as merely a tool to predict measurement outcomes, with no correspondence to the real world.\n\nThe epistemic view is appealing because it is the most cautious, says Ladina Hausmann, a theoretical physicist at the ETH who responded to the survey. “It doesn’t require me to assume anything beyond how we use the quantum state in practice,” she says.\n\nOne epistemic interpretation, known as QBism (which a handful of respondents who selected ‘other’ wrote down as their preferred interpretation), takes this to the extreme, stating that observations made by a specific ‘agent’ are entirely personal and valid only for them. The similar ‘relational quantum mechanics’, first outlined by Rovelli in 1996 (and selected by 4% of respondents), says that quantum states always describe only relationships between systems, not the systems themselves.",

          "abstract": "People infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 (lungs of a person with the disease shown) have a nearly twofold increased risk of cancer-related death, data show.Credit: Rajaaisya/Science Photo Library\n\nHidden in the lungs of some breast cancer survivors are tumour cells that can remain dormant for decades — until they one day trigger a relapse. Now, experiments in mice show that these rogue cells can be roused from their slumber by common respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 or the flu.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 30 July1, seem to extend to humans too: data from thousands of people show that infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is linked with a nearly twofold increase in cancer-related death, possibly helping to explain why cancer death rates increased early during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe results are “really quite dramatic”, says James DeGregori, a cancer biologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora, and an author of the study. “Respiratory-virus infections didn’t just awaken the cells,” he says: they also caused them to proliferate, or multiply, “to enormous numbers”.\n\nReasons for waking up\n\nResearchers have spotted dormant cancer cells, detached from the initial tumour, hiding in tissues such as bone marrow in people in remission from breast, prostate and skin cancer, among others. These cells are a precursor to metastasis — which is the spread of cancer to distant organs — and pose a problem, even in survivors of these cancers. For instance, in about one-quarter of breast cancer survivors, such cells can trigger a relapse and metastasize.\n\nScientists have long been trying to uncover what triggers these cells to reawaken. Previous work has hinted at chronic inflammation as a culprit, such as that caused by smoking cigarettes2 and ageing3.\n\nWhen exposed to flu virus, these dormant cancer cells (green) roused from their slumber, as indicated by a marker (magenta).Credit: Bryan Johnson\n\nDeGregori and his colleagues wondered whether acute inflammation caused by a respiratory infection could also reactivate dormant cancer cells. To test this, the researchers genetically engineered mice to develop breast tumours similar to those in humans and to seed dormant tumour cells in other tissues, including the lungs. Then they infected the animals with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza.\n\nWithin days of infection, dormant cancer cells in the lungs of the mice kicked into high gear, proliferated and formed metastatic lesions. But it wasn’t the pathogens directly that caused this to happen, the researchers learnt: it was a key immune molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which helps to rev up the body’s response to foreign threats. They confirmed this by engineering mice to lack IL-6. In these animals, the dormant cancer cells did not multiply nearly as quickly.\n\nThe quest to prevent MS — and understand other post-viral diseases\n\nAbout two weeks after the researchers infected the mice, the cells fell dormant again. This means that the infections do not directly cause cancer, but make it more likely that a future threat, whether it’s an infection or a genetic mutation, could cause the cancer to become active again, DeGregori says. He likens the process to starting a fire a few times. “You’ve awakened the flames and then it dies back down,” he says. “But now you’ve got 100 times the embers that you had before” — making it more likely to turn into an inferno.\n\nEven so, that’s not the end of the story. The researchers observed that, although IL-6 was essential to awakening the cancer cells, another key immune player called a helper T cell shielded the cancer cells from other immune-system defences. “Seeing that these cancer cells were perverting the immune system to protect them as opposed to eliminate them was really quite shocking,” DeGregori says.\n\nPopulation data in large repositories such as the UK Biobank helped to corroborate the study’s findings in people: the increased risk of cancer-related death in those who tested positive for COVID-19 was most pronounced in the months immediately following infection, mirroring the rapid proliferation of reawakened cancer cells observed in the mice.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "Pore-forming proteins in allergens make the body cough and sneeze.Credit: Wavebreak Media ltd/Alamy\n\nThe sneezing, itchy eyes and coughing elicited by some allergens are caused by proteins creating holes in airway cells, reports a study published this week in Nature1.\n\nThe findings challenge scientists’ understanding of how allergies are triggered, says Feargal Ryan, who studies host–microbe interactions at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia. Before this, the mechanism that triggers immune responses to allergens was not really understood. Researchers focused mostly on how a single allergen elicits a reaction, rather than looking for a generalizable mechanism.\n\nThe results could also change allergy-treatment strategies, which typically target the allergen directly or downstream immune responses. Now, researchers can start looking for ways to target the hole-creating proteins that are initiating the immune response, Ryan says.\n\nPore-forming proteins\n\nResearchers based in Beijing, China, identified two proteins in the mould Alternaria alternata, which causes allergic reactions in about 5% of people, that trigger the airway inflammation seen during allergic reactions.\n\nTogether, the proteins, called Aeg-S and Aeg-L, create a pore in the membranes of cells lining the nose, throat and lungs. This allows calcium ions to enter the cells and release molecules that alert the immune system to danger. The damage to cell membranes from these pore-forming proteins could be a “common signal that our body uses to recognize something as an allergen”, says co-author Mo Xu, who studies immune responses at Tsinghua University.\n\nTo test how the proteins stimulated the immune system, the team treated lung cells with the proteins. Administering the proteins at the same time triggered a similar response as administering an extract of A. alternata, but this response was not seen when the proteins were given one at a time.\n\nThe researchers also tested whether the proteins could cause an allergic airway inflammation in mice. Six hours after mice were given the proteins intranasally, the rodents showed immune responses similar to those triggered by exposure to A. alternata.\n\nThe team also observed signs that the mice had developed a respiratory allergy, such as increased levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) — an antibody produced in response to allergens — after the mice were given the proteins every three days for two weeks. This response wasn’t seen when the proteins were administered separately, or when mice were exposed to genetically modified mould lacking either protein.",

          "authors": "Nikita Bezrukov",
          "abstract": "Looking at a document’s history shows how the writer’s thought process evolved — and spotlights AI shortcuts, says Nikita Bezrukov.\n\nI was grading papers for my writing‑heavy seminar on fairness in machine learning, when the references started to get weird. The first DOI I checked returned a 404 error; the second opened a blank page; and a journal article with a plausible title didn’t appear in any database I searched. The same glitches cropped up across several submissions, making it clear that generative artificial intelligence (AI), not the students, was the first author.\n\nThe pattern was easy to spot. The prose was immaculate, yet somehow stilted — the paragraph structure was too precise. The pieces lacked a sense of struggle that signals genuine thought. Each time I opened a file, I asked the same questions: is this data set real? Does this specialist exist? Did the student write any of this? After spending weeks verifying quotations, sources and even author identities, I felt less like a teacher and more like a forensic investigator.\n\nThen a typo jumped off the page of one essay. That paper referred to a “monolinguistic speaker” (as opposed to the standard term, ‘monolingual speaker’). The mistake was small, but it indicated that a person, not a chatbot, had drafted the text. I breathed a sigh of relief. I realized I wanted to see more imperfection.\n\nTracking changes\n\nThe next morning, I announced a new rule to my students, in an attempt to bake that moment into my teaching: assignments could not be submitted as single PDFs showing only the final version. Every document had to have a version history, so that I could see the writing process, not just the final product. I called the resulting score the trajectory grade: 60% of the mark would reflect how ideas developed across drafts, and 40% would cover the quality of the completed version. It was my last semester teaching first-year writing-in-the-disciplines seminars at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, so I was open to experimentation. And the class was small — only 12 students, so it was easy to change course if anything went wrong.\n\nAt first, my students were sceptical, assuming this was a tactic to police their work. A colleague suggested that I use a blockchain analogy to explain my reasoning. That framing changed the mood. Most students already knew that blockchain keeps a transparent, tamper‑resistant ledger of changes: each block stores data, such as transactions, and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a continuous, verifiable chain. Any attempt to alter a block stands out immediately, so the record is trustworthy. Seeing version‑tracking tools as a classroom‑scale blockchain made sense to the students — and the requirement suddenly felt intuitive, rather than punitive.\n\nBy the end of the semester, I had learnt more from the version histories than I could have from any static paper. In my seminar, first‑year engineering and computer‑science majors choose a topic in emerging technology — for instance, fairness in drone warfare or AI‑driven admissions. Each step builds on the last: they create a literature map and develop it into a data‑rich research paper, which they refashion into public pieces, such as opinion articles and policy briefs. Because every revision was captured, my suspicions around plagiarism disappeared, and AI shortcuts stood out. I could see in detail how each chunk of text evolved over time, quantitatively by how long it took to write as well as by its length, and qualitatively by how its ideas unfolded.\n\nMy own workload improved tremendously. Grading sessions no longer felt like crime‑scene analyses, and I spent less time hunting for signs of AI assistance and more time coaching academic writing strategy. The version-control rule encouraged many students to start earlier and revise steadily, because the transparent history left no way to hide a rushed job uploaded at the deadline. It restored the habits that our writing‑in‑the‑disciplines courses are designed to teach young researchers: incremental progress and thoughtful redrafting. Their final submissions felt earned, rather than delivered by an algorithm.\n\nRevise your rubric",

Allergies arise as a result of the immune system overreacting to allergens: otherwise harmless substances such as dust mites, pollen or certain foods1.

Writing in Nature, Shi et al.3 address part of this mystery by identifying a property shared by some allergens — the ability to form large pores in epithelial cells that line airways.

          "authors": "Melissa Hobson",
          "abstract": "Growing up in the forests of Chicago, Illinois, and the deserts of Phoenix, Arizona, Jaida Elcock never had much access to the ocean — and was even afraid of sharks. But the more she learnt on TV documentaries, the more she realized that we should be advocating for their conservation. “I really don’t want to know what an ocean without sharks looks like,” she says.\n\nHaving earnt a biology degree at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, and worked her way up through various internships and laboratory technician positions, Elcock is now a graduate student based in Falmouth, Massachusetts, studying the movement ecology of basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus). Along the way, she faced racism, sexism and discrimination, she says.\n\nIn 2020, the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked civil unrest in the United States. On the same day as Floyd’s murder, a white dog walker falsely reported Black birdwatcher Christian Cooper after he asked her to put her dog on a lead. This inspired many Black naturalists, including Elcock, to speak out on social media about their right to exist and occupy outdoor spaces, she says. It also led to the #BlackInNature hashtag, through which Elcock started chatting with fellow shark researchers Amani Webber-Schultz, Jasmin Graham and Carlee Jackson-Bohannon.\n\nPleasantly surprised to realize there were other Black women working in shark science, the four came together and founded Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS), registered in Bradenton, Florida. Its mission is to advance marine sciences by challenging the status quo of what people think a scientist looks like. MISS works to support under-represented and historically excluded communities to help them to feel confident and accepted in science by providing them with access to a community, knowledge and training opportunities. Five years later, the organization has around 400 members in more than 30 countries.\n\nWhat was it like for you as a young Black shark scientist?\n\nI got a lot of pushback for wanting to become a marine scientist. I was once told that I got my university scholarship because of affirmative action, not because I deserved it. People would say things like “Black people can’t swim. How are you going to work with sharks?”. These ridiculous stereotypes exist because of systemic racism that has led to a generational fear of water in a lot of Black communities, and that is not our fault. (When public swimming pools became popular in the United States in the 1920s and 30s, segregation meant that Black people had less access and so less opportunity to learn to swim.)\n\nI was also told that, as a woman, I wouldn’t be strong enough to handle sharks and I should be in the kitchen or raising a family.\n\nThe Minorities in Shark Science team.Credit: Julia Wester, Field School\n\nFor many people, encountering racism and sexism is incredibly discouraging. Why would you want to start a career in which you might hear those things all the time? But I used this pushback as fuel. If you tell me I can’t do something because of a terrible and irrational reason that’s based in hate, racism and sexism, I’m going to say: ‘Okay, watch me’.\n\nWhen we co-founded MISS, we wanted to create a community of people with shared experiences who would support each other, provide a safe space and create opportunities to help them further their careers. Breaking down the social and financial barriers to getting opportunities in the field of marine science was a key goal.\n\nWe launched on Juneteenth (19 June) 2020. This is a really important day for the Black community in the United States: it’s the day that the last enslaved people received word that they had been freed, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, in which president Abraham Lincoln declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were now considered free. Launching on this day was a way of showing our dedication, support and pride in who we are.\n\nDo you feel like the perception of what a shark scientist looks like is changing?\n\nYes, at least in the spaces I’m in. With MISS, we now have a community of minority scientists that people can contact when they want to highlight certain people in science, whether that’s for a TV show or a school talk.\n\nTV production teams now have somewhere to go to when most shark scientists on their shows are white dudes and they want to highlight the amazing work of other scientists as well. That’s not to say that these white guys aren’t also good at their job, but we want to remind people that there are other scientists out there.\n\nFor younger people, seeing themselves represented is so important, and I think we’re seeing a shift. Young people are now more exposed than before to all these diverse people in science. Seeing someone else who looks like them doing it shows that it could be an option for them, too.\n\nDo you see any parallels between the stereotypes of who can be a shark scientist and which of the 500 or so shark species typically get more attention, such as great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias)?\n\nOn nature shows, you always see the same thing — great whites breaching — and that’s cool. But what about the swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum), which swallows seawater to prevent itself from getting eaten by predators? What about the pocket shark (Mollisquama parini) that spews bioluminescent goo out of a pocket behind its fins?\n\nThere are parallels with diversity in science, for sure. You often see this one type of scientist — in the same way you see this one type of shark — but there are so many other cool options. We can show appreciation for all these other sharks and shark scientists as well. The more diversity we have in people, the more diversity we’ll get in thought. That’s going to lead to more innovation, more discovery and better science as a whole.\n\nHow does MISS help its members?\n\nWe run webinars and pair people up with mentors to help them apply for funding opportunities, fellowship programmes or graduate school. We also fundraise and apply for grants to support marine scientists from minority groups. We also run collaborative working groups, opportunities such as shark-tagging workshops and our Diversifying Ocean Sciences programme, in which people can learn lab and fieldwork techniques.\n\nJaida Elcock handling a shark tail while at sea.Credit: Jackson Coles, Field School",

          "title": "Environmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories",
          "authors": "Philip Macnaghten",
          "abstract": "Captured Futures: Rethinking the Drama of Environmental Politics Maarten A. Hajer and Jeroen Oomen Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nEvery now and again, you look forward to a book. You follow the pre-publication talks, the promise, the drama. I have known political scientist Maarten Hajer for three decades as an academic, policymaker and activist. If anyone has the skills and know-how to deeply understand the logic of environmental politics, it’s him.\n\nAnd this book exceeded my expectations. Written with rising-star social scientist Jeroen Oomen, Captured Futures is powerful, timely and consequential. It is arguably the most important book on environmental politics in the past decade. The concept of a ‘captured future’ shows brilliantly how environmental politics has become trapped in ways that both reproduce its own failure and restrict people’s ability to imagine alternatives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nThe book starts by marshalling evidence that environmental politics is falling short on global environmental health. It’s a familiar list, including unmet targets for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions and continuing losses of biodiversity, fertile soils and fresh water.\n\nThen, the authors present a radical idea: that environmental politics, as it is currently configured and practised, is bound to fail. This is not because of a lack of political will, or regulatory or state obstacles, but because of the conceptual framework — the ‘dramaturgical regime’ — through which the rules and conventions of environmental politics are being enacted and performed.\n\nFailed system\n\nAt the heart of this regime is ecological modernization: a set of convictions that has held sway for three decades. These include that technological and market-based solutions can remediate environmental crises; that natural science, with its value-neutral ‘facts’, can provide the necessary knowledge to create these solutions; and that policymakers, in their ‘pilot’ role, define global options, goals and targets.\n\nIn this system, if targets go unmet despite the presentation of scientific evidence, the only response available to those in the political cockpit is to escalate the urgency of their language. Ever-stronger images of impending catastrophe further diminish citizens’ feelings of political agency and exacerbate many people’s already pronounced senses of despair, despondency and alienation. As the ultimate technocratic solution, climate geoengineering represents ecological modernization’s last stand.\n\nThe common narrative of ‘win–win solutions’ and ‘positive-sum games’ is over. The authors describe how environmental policy’s increasing effects on everyday life — through mobility, energy and housing — are generating political responses. This as an “age of backlash”, they write, pointing to the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement in France and farmers’ street protests across Europe.\n\nA gilet jaunes protester at a demonstration in Lyon, France in 2019.Credit: Romain Costaseca/Hans Lucas/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty\n\nWorse, the dramaturgical regime is unwittingly contributing to political polarization. Many people, including populists and some on the right, increasingly view the climate-change community, and universities more broadly, as part of a globalist and elitist system pitted against ordinary people. This dynamic has intensified this year, particularly in the United States, where the Trump administration has attacked elite universities including Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and slashed funding for federal environmental and health agencies.\n\nTurning the tide\n\nEcological politics needs to tell a more aspirational story. We need to move from stories that evoke fear and despair towards ones that give hope and renewal. And we need to raise awareness of potential futures that are just as desirable as the consumer-based dreams we have become so attached to. To convey the task ahead, the authors analyse how fossil fuels and the lifestyles they enable are deeply and seductively embedded in most people’s senses of personal freedom, lifestyle and identity. The ‘American dream’ is alive, and it’s global.\n\nTo learn about what might work, Hajer and Oomen analyse two historical examples of intellectual discourses that have shifted the societal mood. UK economist and social reformer William Beveridge laid out the principles of the modern welfare state in a 1942 report, with radical ideas about how to eradicate poverty that were strong enough for people to fight for. Efforts by think tanks and others shifted conservative thought in the 1960s and 1970s towards neoliberal concepts such as property ownership, deregulation, privatization and free markets.\n\nToday, three eco-political discourses are bubbling: ‘beyond growth’ questions the necessity for economic growth; decolonization scholars critique models of development that reinforce the dominance of former colonial powers; and eco-conservatism focuses on one’s duty as a steward to protect the natural world. But these debates, although valuable, remain mainly intellectual and resonate only marginally with the public.\n\nTrump supporters gathering in Nashville, Tennessee, during his 2024 presidential campaign.Credit: Sergio Flores/AFP/Getty\n\nWhere else might someone look? One approach that Hajer and Oomen don’t discuss is closer examination of shifts in everyday lived experiences, and the social, cultural and political trends that underpin them. Think of four brilliant sociologists: Ulrich Beck, John Urry, Anthony Giddens and Manuel Castells. Rather than extolling vanguard visions that could be rolled out into political projects, each of them sought to see the world around them with acute sensitivity and then develop concepts and theories attuned to what they saw.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nBeck’s ‘risk society’ reflected a globalized world that is imbued with invisible, uninsurable, unattributable and potentially irreversible risks. Urry’s ‘disorganized capitalism’ describes the shift away from the structured, hierarchical and relatively stable form of ‘organized capitalism’. Giddens’s ‘reflexive modernization’ unpacks the double-edged nature of modernity in relation to science, individualism, capitalism and industrialism. Castells’ ‘network society’ describes the growth of forms of social organization based on networks rather than conventional hierarchies.\n\nSuch on-the-ground thinking could be applied, for example, to the wave of conservatism manifesting in global politics, from the United States to Argentina, Finland and Italy. On the night of US President Donald Trump’s election, when it was becoming clear that he not only won the election but had increased his majority across key demographics (including Black and Hispanic voters, rural voters, religious voters, men under 50 and even naturalized citizens), I asked myself, why? Since then, I have sought to understand, and empathize with, the structure of feeling that underpins this new form of conservatism.\n\nAsk the people\n\nSociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild’s Strangers in their Own Land (2016) offers some insights. Her ethnographic look at the emotional lives of arch-conservatives in Bayou country, Louisiana, based on fieldwork conducted between 2012 and 2016, explores why increasingly disaffected people tend to move to the political right and not the left.",

          "abstract": "In 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions. An independent study has now looked at the journal's retraction history more in depth. Credit: Getty\n\nNearly one-third of all retracted papers at PLoS ONE can be traced back to just 45 researchers who served as editors at the journal, an analysis of its publication records has found.\n\nThe study1, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) on 4 August, found that 45 editors handled only 1.3% of all articles published by PLoS ONE from 2006 to 2023, but that the papers they accepted accounted for more than 30% of the 702 retractions that the journal issued by early 2024. Twenty-five of these editors also authored papers in PLoS ONE that were later retracted.\n\nThe PNAS authors did not disclose the names of any of the 45 editors. But, by independently analysing publicly available data from PLoS ONE and the Retraction Watch database, Nature’s news team has identified five of the editors who handled the highest number of papers that were subsequently retracted by the journal. Together, those editors accepted about 15% of PLoS ONE’s retracted papers up to 14 July.\n\n“The footprints that systematic fraud leaves in the literature are so massive that there’s no way that it’s just a couple of bad authors,” says PNAS study co-author Reese Richardson, a metascientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “There is complicity from within the journal-appointed editors that allows for this to happen.”\n\n“PLOS has long been aware of the issue addressed in this article,” says Renee Hoch, head of publication ethics at the publisher. “In each case we promptly removed the people of concern from PLOS editorial boards and took action as needed on the affected articles.” She adds that “the issues discussed in this article are not specific to PLoS One and have been affecting journals and publishers across the industry”.\n\nCassidy Sugimoto, a science-policy researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, calls the findings “disheartening”. But, she says, they show “that we have the tools and mechanisms to identify misconduct at scale, and begin to uproot some of the poor behaviours that are happening in science”. Sugimoto adds that the study cannot not determine whether all flagged editors acted deliberately to slip problematic work through peer review, or whether they were “negligent in their duties”. Papers can be retracted by their authors or publishers for myriad reasons, including honest errors, authorship disputes or problems that arise from research misconduct.\n\nEditors with high retraction rates\n\nPLoS ONE is published by the open-access Public Library of Science (PLOS) in San Francisco, California. The journal relies on thousands of volunteer academic editors, who handle submissions and oversee peer review, with support from 22 staff editors.\n\nIn the PNAS study, researchers examined 276,956 articles published in PLoS ONE from its launch in 2006 to late 2023, and tracked 134,983 authors and 18,329 handling editors. They identified 22 editors who disproportionately accepted papers that were later retracted, and 33 others who accepted papers that had been flagged on PubPeer — a site for post-publication peer review — more frequently than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, the analysis identified 21 authors who seemed to steer their submissions towards the group of 22 editors flagged for high retraction rates.\n\nThe study reveals how individuals can form coordinated networks and work under the guise of editorial duty to push large amounts of problematic research into the scientific literature, in some cases with links to paper mills — businesses that churn out fake papers and sell authorship slots.\n\nHoch denies that PLoS ONE systematically allows authors to choose who is assigned to handle their submission. “Editor assignment at PLoS One is done via an algorithm that matches submissions to editors with suitable expertise, or in a minority of cases PLOS staff manually research and assign editors. Author requests for specific editors are not honoured or even considered in most cases, and when they are considered they are carefully vetted for potential competing interests.”\n\nConflicting interests\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE retracted more than 100 papers after an editor noticed an unusual spike in submissions, many in agricultural research, from one author. The journal’s investigation found that some academic editors had handled manuscripts from the same authors repeatedly, co-authored papers with them and manipulated peer review.\n\nIn their analysis of PLoS ONE’s publication records, Richardson and his colleagues identified 19 researchers — based in 4 countries — who served as academic editors between 2020 and 2023, and repeatedly handled each other’s submissions. More than half of the papers they accepted were later retracted, with nearly identical notices citing concerns about authorship, peer review and competing interests.\n\nNature’s analysis identified 3 of those 19 editors. Shahid Farooq, a plant biologist at Harran University in Şanlıurfa, Turkey, topped the list of PLoS ONE editors ordered by the number of retracted papers that they handled. Between 2019 and 2023, Farooq was responsible for editing 79 articles, 52 of which were subsequently retracted. All of the retraction notices stated that the papers were “identified as one of a series of submissions” for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Farooq also co-authored seven articles in PLoS ONE that were later retracted with identical retraction notices.\n\nFarooq told Nature in an e-mail statement that he relied on reviewers’ reports to make his editorial decisions, and that editors had limited tools to detect conflicts of interest. In a 2022 press release, PLOS’s Hoch said that “internal competing interest checks” were not “equipped to identify co-publication histories” at the time. PLOS introduced new policies in 2023 to try to prevent manipulation of the publication process. More recently, journals have started using automated tools for analysing co-authorship patterns and flagging potential paper-mill issues.\n\nFarooq says that PLoS ONE removed him from the editorial board in 2022, and that he subsequently resigned from his editorial positions in other journals, including Frontiers in Agronomy and BMC Plant Biology. “My editing experience has changed to not editing any paper for any publisher, as the publishers become innocent once any issues are raised on the published papers,” he added.\n\nAnother editor flagged in Nature’s analysis is Zhihan Lv (also known as Zhihan Lyu), a researcher in virtual reality, who ranked second in the list of editors who handled high numbers of retracted PLoS ONE papers. Between 2017 and 2021, Lv edited 54 papers, and 43 of these have been retracted, including 31 this year. All notices cited concerns about peer-review integrity and potential manipulation of the publication process.\n\nLv was also an editor for more than 400 papers in journals published by Hindawi — a subsidiary of New Jersey-based publisher Wiley that has now ceased activity. Many of these papers have been retracted. In 2024, the journal Neural Computing and Applications — published by London-based Springer Nature — retracted 24 of 26 papers in a 2018 special issue for which Lv was the managing guest editor (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher). The retractions, which included one research article co-authored by Lv, referred to compromised editorial handling and peer review, irrelevant citations, image manipulations, tortured phrases and content outside the scope of the journal and its special issue.\n\nLv told Nature he did not know at the time that there was a conflict of interest in submitting a paper to a special issue for which he was the handling editor.\n\nIn 2022, PLoS ONE removed Lv from its editorial board and retracted three papers co-authored by him in later years. “I was listed as a co-author in these three articles without my consent. I have no knowledge of the details of these articles,” Lv told Nature. “I remember informing the journal of this when they contacted me before retracting the papers,” he added.\n\nBut in 2023, PLOS alerted Uppsala University in Sweden — where Lv worked from 2021 until his resignation in September 2024 — citing concerns about his involvement in paper-mill activities. The university’s investigation concluded that there were “grounds for suspecting research misconduct” on one of his PLoS ONE papers, and referred a separate matter, involving an ethics review it said Lv had fabricated, to the Swedish police. Lv has since moved to Xidian University in Xi’an, China.\n\nAuthorship concerns\n\nHaibin Lv, a marine geologist at the North Sea Bureau in China’s Ministry of Natural Resources in Qingdao, ranked third in Nature’s list of editors. Between 2021 and 2022, Haibin Lv edited 28 papers for PLoS ONE. All but one of the 28 papers have been retracted, and the journal noted that they were part of a series of submissions for which it had concerns about peer-review integrity, similarities across articles and potential manipulation of the publication process. PLoS ONE issued an expression of concern for the remaining paper in June, citing issues with peer review and citations.\n\nNature also identified 113 papers published in Hindawi’s Journal of Sensors between 2021 and 2023 that Haibin Lv edited, 88 of which have been retracted.\n\nTwo of the retracted papers in PLoS ONE that Haibin Lv edited were co-authored by Zhihan Lv, who told Nature he was listed as an author without his consent. “Zhihan Lv and I are collaborators on multiple research projects. My handling of the two PLoS ONE papers he co-authored was no different than handling papers from strangers,” Haibin Lv told Nature.\n\nNature also identified ten articles that Haibin Lv and Zhihan Lv co-authored and published between 2022 and 2024 — six of which appeared in conferences run by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a professional association and publisher based in New York City. None have been retracted. The IEEE declined to comment on the matter.\n\nZhihan Lv and Haibin Lv both told Nature that they are not brothers. Zhihan said they were not blood relatives, and Haibin described their relationship as “private”.\n\nFourth on Nature's list is Adnan Noor Shah, an agronomist at Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Information Technology in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan, who handled 24 papers published in PLoS ONE between August 2021 and May 2022. Eighteen of those papers have been retracted, and the retraction notices for 17 of them said that they were part of a series of submissions for which the journal had concerns about authorship, competing interests and peer review. Shah also co-authored five articles that PLoS ONE later retracted, citing similar concerns, as well as issues with reference citations and overlap with other publications.\n\nNature’s analysis found that, in 2022, Shah co-authored two papers in two journals, including Frontiers in Plant Science. His co-authors on these papers included three researchers who appeared as authors in four other papers that Shah edited for Frontiers in Plant Science. The journal’s publisher, Frontiers (based in Lausanne, Switzerland), told Nature that it is investigating 20 publications across the journals that Shah edited. Shah did not respond to Nature’s emails.\n\nNature’s investigation also identified cancer researcher Aamir Ahmad as the most prolific PLoS ONE editor. Ahmad is the editor-in-chief of Non-coding RNA Research, an open-access journal published by Beijing-based KeAi. He has also been a cancer editor at Springer Nature’s Scientific Reports since 2017.",

          "abstract": "A nuclear power plant in Liebstadt, Switzerland, hosted the CONUS+ neutrino detector.Credit: KietzmannBjorn/Action Press/Shutterstock\n\nPhysicists have caught neutrinos from a nuclear reactor using a device weighing just a few kilograms, orders of magnitude less massive than standard neutrino detectors. The technique opens new ways to stress-test the known laws of physics and to detect the copious neutrinos produced in the hearts of collapsing stars.\n\n“They finally did it,” says Kate Scholberg, a physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “And they have a very beautiful result.” The experiment, called CONUS+, is described on 30 July in Nature1.\n\nChallenging quarry\n\nNeutrinos are elementary particles that have no electrical charge and generally don’t interact with other matter, making them extraordinarily difficult to detect. Most neutrino experiments catch these elusive particles by observing flashes of light that are generated when a neutrino collides with an electron, proton or neutron. These collisions occur extremely infrequently, so such detectors typically have masses of tonnes or thousands of tonnes to provide enough target material to gather neutrinos in relevant numbers.\n\nScholberg and her collaborators first demonstrated the mini-detector technique in 20172, using it to catch neutrinos produced by an accelerator at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The Oak Ridge particles have slightly higher energies than do those made in reactors. As a result, detecting reactor neutrinos was even more challenging, she says. But lower-energy neutrinos also allow for a more precise test of the standard model of physics.\n\nHow heavy is a neutrino? Race to weigh mysterious particle heats up\n\nScholberg’s COHERENT detector was the first to exploit a phenomenon called coherent scattering, in which a neutrino ‘scatters’ off an entire atomic nucleus rather than the atom’s constituent particles.\n\nCoherent scattering uses the fact that particles of matter can act as waves — and the lower the particles’ energy, the longer their wavelength, says Christian Buck, a leader of the CONUS collaboration. If the wavelength of a neutrino is similar to the nucleus’s diameter, “then the neutrino sees the nucleus as one thing. It doesn’t see the internal structure”, says Buck, who is a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. The neutrino doesn’t interact with any subatomic particles, but does cause the nucleus to recoil — depositing a tiny amount of energy into the detector.\n\nCatching sight of a nucleus",

          "abstract": "The AI system AlphaEarth Foundations integrates satellite images, such as this one of irrigated cropland, with other types of map to offer a data-rich picture of Earth.Credit: USGS\n\nThe technology giant Google has released an artificial intelligence (AI) model that acts as a ‘virtual satellite’ to weave together trillions of disparate observations — satellite images, radar and more — to track changes in land and shallow waters across Earth. Researchers are lauding the sheer scale of the effort while also calling on Google for more information about its tests, and warning that it will be up to individual scientists to verify any maps they obtain from the tool.\n\nGoogle tapped billions of mobile phones to detect quakes worldwide — and send alerts\n\nThe model, called AlphaEarth Foundations, maps the world “at any place and time”, Christopher Brown, a research engineer at Google DeepMind in New York City, said at a press briefing on 28 July. Scientists might use it to identify the best places for clean-energy projects, study the ecological impacts of climate change, track deforestation and more.\n\nAlongside the model, which was released yesterday, Google and its DeepMind AI unit have posted a paper, ahead of peer review, on the arXiv preprint server1. The manuscript describes the creation of the model, its initial testing and baseline data sets covering Earth during the years 2017–24. It says that AlphaEarth beats similar AI models in terms of both accuracy and data density, and that the model saves users computing time and reduces energy use.\n\nNicholas Murray, a conservation biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, is the lead scientist for Global Ecosystems Atlas, an initiative to map the world’s biodiversity and environments. Murray says that his team often spends “tens to hundreds of days” processing satellite data before it can even begin to make products such as maps describing changes in tidal wetlands over time. He hopes that Google’s latest model — which the team is familiar with — will make that process more efficient.\n\nPackaging the data\n\nMoving forward, Google says, it will regularly update AlphaEarth’s data sets, which come fully processed. They are available through the company’s Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform that already hosts separate repositories of data covering topics such as agriculture, deforestation and weather. AlphaEarth weaves together many of these data sets to create an integrated product that scientists can explore more easily.\n\nDeepMind AI weather forecaster beats world-class system",

          "abstract": "With a flying leap, Oded Rechavi soars off the podium at Woodstock Bio2 + Night Science, possibly the world’s wildest biology conference. After running up and down the steps of the auditorium, he presents his new idea: revolutionize peer review with a system he’s developing, in which artificial intelligence (AI) would “supplement or augment” the process of assessing scientific papers.\n\nRechavi is a molecular biologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel whose lab aims, as its website puts it, to “challenge basic dogmas regarding inheritance and evolution”. He is one of the instigators of the meeting, dubbed by its organizers as the “conference to end all conferences”, which was held in Prague on 10–13 June.\n\nAn outside poster presentation at the conference.Credit: Nir Eynon, Monash University, Australia\n\nA follow-on from the first Woodstock of Biology, organized by Rechavi in Tel Aviv in February 2020, just before the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns, the three-day Prague get-together was conducted with same anarchic disregard for rules as the 1969 music festival that it’s named after. A variety of scientists — from biologists to physicists — met to exchange ideas, play games and find fortuitous opportunities to collaborate with researchers outside their own narrow field.\n\nHeld in various locations across the city of Prague, and on the third day at a wooded campsite at Soběšín, in the Central Bohemian region of the Czech Republic, the conference followed an unusual format. Attendees spoke in five-minute slots, summarized their research in a single slide and were called to the podium in random order. Each speaker was hailed with a self-chosen walk-up song, often accompanied by impromptu dancing. The songs ranged from Fatboy Slim’s ‘Right Here, Right Now’ to ‘Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows’ by Lesley Gore.\n\nOne presenter gave her entire talk in rhyme. Another soundtracked theirs with a ukulele. A third read her paper as a bedtime story. Itai Yanai, a systems biologist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine in New York City and a conference co-organizer, explained his research to a co-opted 16-year-old. As he did so, volunteers from the audience posed onstage as ‘genes’, imitating being turned on and off by waving their arms when tapped. Barak Rotblat, a cancer researcher at the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, based in Beersheba, Israel, was physically removed from the podium by a ‘bouncer’ after exceeding the five-minute time limit. (He later admitted that he was in on the joke.)\n\nAnd in a symbolic wedding at Soběšín, two affianced scientists ’married’ in a ceremony presided over by Rechavi and Natanella Illouz-Eliaz, a plant biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in San Diego, California, and another co-organizer. The pair promised to “give each other tenure, share their data and write recommendation letters — long ones — without using ChatGPT”. After the ceremony, bride-to-be Lea Krautner, a biochemist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, tossed her bouquet of wildflowers and danced down the grassy aisle.\n\n“We are trying to reimagine science in a non-bureaucratic, non-boring way,” Rechavi said as the Turtles’ song ‘Happy Together’ played in the background at Soběšín.\n\nAttendees arrived at one of the conference venues for Woodstock Bio2 + Night Science by train.Credit: Pavel Tomancak\n\n“By acting silly or goofy, it sets the tone for a very open conference where we can be very authentic and show vulnerability,” says Illouz-Eliaz.\n\nDreaming together\n\nWoodstock Bio2 + Night Science is an attempt to reinvent the scientific conference, giving it a “festival-like quality”, says Yanai. “Of course, we want rigorous, reproducible science. But we’re also acknowledging the other side of the process, of ‘let’s be inspired to have new ideas and make connections’.”\n\nThe meeting did have a serious aspect. More than 200 researchers — principal investigators, PhD students and postdocs — converged on Prague from diverse locales, including Israel, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy. They presented research on flatworms, cancer biology, melanoma metastasis, brain organoids, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and data science.\n\nYanai and Martin Lercher, a computational cell biologist at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany, led a ten-minute workshop titled ‘What is Your Worst Idea’? The two exhorted participants to pair with someone they had never met and discuss a possibly stupid, possibly brilliant concept. “You may come up with a Nature paper! Two Nature papers!” shouts Yanai. “There is a Nature editor here! Raise your hand if you are a Nature editor!” (That would be me, ostensibly, although I’m actually a freelance writer, on assignment for Nature, and have no power to accept or reject papers.)\n\nOded Rechavi (right) delivered a conference presentation as a bedtime story.Credit: Itai Yanai\n\nAs Yanai explained, the term night science, which bookends the official name of the conference, was coined by the late biologist François Jacob, who shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that cells can switch genes on and off. “There’s the science that gets published and the science that is dreamt or appears in nightmares,” Jacob said.\n\nWhat if, like Jacob, “we tried to daydream together?” Yanai asks. “What if, simply by juxtaposing talks on completely different topics, it would give you an idea?”\n\n‘A bit unconventional’\n\nAt the conference, 115 researchers presented talks on anything they wished to speak about.\n\nChaitanya Chintaluri, a theoretical biologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria in Klosterneuburg, was drawn to the conference because “it’s a bit unconventional”. He was there to discuss why a collection of neurons, kept alive in a Petri dish with the aid of artificial cerebrospinal fluid and oxygen, continue to ‘chat’ to each other by sending out electrical impulses. “The question is, if there is nothing to talk about, what are they going on about? It’s quite perplexing,” Chintaluri says.\n\nMany of the sessions at Woodstock Bio2 + Night Science meeting were held outside.Credit: Daniel Żarski, InLife, PL\n\nSara Bologna, a structural biologist at the Central European Institute of Technology (CEITEC) at Masaryk University in Brno, the Czech Republic, had come to discuss her use of nuclear magnetic resonance to study the dynamics of proteins “and how they play together”. Woodstock “shows the personality of scientists — all of us, we are unique”, she said. Meeting diverse researchers “helps us think out of the box and get ideas for future projects”.\n\nYogesh Saravanan, a physicist and PhD student based in Marseille at Inserm, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, is trying to understand the physics and material properties of cancer cells. At the conference, Saravanan felt he had “an incredible exposure” to other labs. “It’s a great place for the intersection of ideas,” he said.",

          "authors": "Ollie Jay, Jennifer Vanos, Daniel Gagnon, Federico Tartarini",
          "abstract": "Close to 110,000 heat-related deaths are estimated to have occurred in Europe during the summers of 2022 and 2023 combined1. That’s roughly the same number of people as if a fully occupied jumbo jet crashed every day for 16 weeks. Meanwhile, a vast array of heat-related impacts disrupt people’s lives. Hot weather worsens mental-health problems2, increases the likelihood of violence3 and makes pregnant women more likely to give birth prematurely4. In classrooms, it impairs children’s ability to learn5.\n\nShade is an essential solution for hotter cities\n\nThe problems are expected to get much worse. Without better adaptation, heat-related deaths are projected to rise 3.7-fold by mid-century if global temperatures reach 2 °C above pre-industrial levels6. (In 2024, the average global temperature exceeded 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time.) And heat stress in the workplace is expected to cost the global economy US$2.4 trillion each year in lost productivity by 2030.\n\nCurrently, most approaches that alert the public to heat-health risk worldwide use ambient (air) temperature thresholds to trigger warnings — usually broad recommendations to reduce activity, stay hydrated and so on. These thresholds are generally based on overall statistical correlations between ambient temperatures and regional increases in death and disease7. But heat stress is defined by more than just temperature, and can affect multiple physiological systems, including the heart and kidneys4. The risk to individuals varies enormously, and depends on factors such as their age, the health of their kidneys and heart, what they are wearing and their level of activity.\n\nTwo of us (O.J. and F.T.) are piloting the integration of physiological models and weather data to estimate people’s ‘heat-health risk’. We think that heat adaptation could be vastly enhanced by using a physiology-based approach that focuses on hot people, rather than just on hot weather.\n\nHow hot is too hot?\n\nMost people can safely tolerate core body temperatures of up to about 39 °C. If body temperature exceeds this value, the risk of heat exhaustion increases, with symptoms including nausea, dizziness and vomiting. At core temperatures above 40 °C, heat stroke can occur. Here, an increase in gut permeability, caused by reduced delivery of oxygen by the blood, allows toxic molecules associated with certain bacteria to leak into the bloodstream. This can trigger an inflammatory response that cascades to cause blood clotting, multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death4.\n\nWater sprays from a crane to help cool down construction workers in Nanjing, China, during high temperatures last month.Credit: Liu Jianhua/VCG via Getty\n\nWhether and how much any one person is harmed by hot weather depends on a mix of environmental factors and characteristics specific to that individual. Besides air temperature, three features of the thermal environment are important: radiation, humidity and wind speed8. Someone in direct sunlight can be exposed to mean radiant temperatures that are more than 20 °C greater than shade temperatures. (Air temperatures used to trigger health warnings are measured in the shade.) High humidity and low wind speed impair the effectiveness of sweating, which is a person’s only effective physiological cooling mechanism at air temperatures above 35 °C. The ability to lose heat through the evaporation of sweat is also affected by the thermal and evaporative properties of clothing8, age, body size and some medications9. Even light activity such as walking more than doubles internal heat production, and so increases a person’s risk of experiencing health problems in hot weather.\n\nThe body’s thermoregulation is underpinned by a vast redistribution of blood to the skin. And in hot weather, the need to lose heat increases, meaning that to maintain blood pressure, the heart must pump more often and with greater force. People with heart disease are less able to compensate for the increased strain, and so face higher cardiovascular risk4. The redistribution of blood can also damage organs such as the kidneys by reducing how much oxygen is delivered to them. A depleted blood volume from dehydration in hot weather forces the heart to work harder still, and repeated dehydration can contribute to kidney fibrosis (the accumulation of scar tissue in the kidney) and chronic kidney disease4. People with kidney disease face a higher risk of renal failure in extreme heat.\n\nA physiology-based approach\n\nWhen air temperatures are expected to exceed a certain threshold, warnings are triggered that help to prepare health and energy systems for bouts of extreme heat1. But the health-related warnings are limited by the quality of available data on heat-related deaths and disease10, and they don’t enable precise tailoring of protective measures for groups that are at higher risk.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nThe narrow focus on air temperature also strengthens an entrenched belief that reducing ambient temperatures is the only way to lessen the impacts of heat on health11. But attempts to do this can be unsustainable or ineffective. Coating hot surfaces such as roads with reflective paint, for example, will probably have little impact on physiological heat strain or even on perceived discomfort unless people are lying on the ground, and might even intensify heat loads on people. The benefit of increasing green areas and tree cover in cities is similarly often evaluated according to how much it can reduce the temperature of pavements or the mean air temperature, even though the main thermal benefit of urban greening is increasing people’s access to shade.\n\nIn a physiology-based approach, all the parameters with sufficiently high-quality data can be integrated into models to estimate three factors: a person’s core body temperature, their level of dehydration and the strain on their heart and circulatory system8. In our pilot studies in Sydney, Australia, we incorporated six parameters: ambient temperature, thermal radiation level, humidity level, wind speed, a person’s level of activity and the thermal and evaporative properties of their clothing. (Physiological acclimatization — the well-understood physiological adjustments that occur when a person is repeatedly exposed to a hot environment — can also be incorporated.)\n\nEstimates of physiological strain can then be compared with long-established physiological safety thresholds for different groups, on the basis of characteristics such as age, whether the person has a pre-existing condition, what medications they are taking and so on. For example, people with coronary artery disease can tolerate much less cardiovascular strain than healthy individuals can12, and those with heart failure or kidney disease can tolerate less dehydration. The final aggregated score is an individual’s ‘heat-health risk’ (see ‘Assessing heat-induced health risks using physiology’).\n\nSource: O. Jay et al.\nMaking it happen\n\nThe physiological and biophysical models needed for this sort of approach are already available. To provide individuals with a personalized rating of heat-stress risk that uses a six-point scale, two of us (O.J. and F.T.) have developed a freely available Internet tool called HeatWatch (see go.nature.com/44ymweq). This allows users to create personal profiles by submitting their age, related health conditions, medications, access to air conditioning and so on. It then provides a seven-day forecast of heat-health risk and provides evidence-based cooling advice tailored to each profile.\n\nUltimately, we plan to develop an online interface similar to the dashboards that tracked people’s risk of infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an interface could allow governments, public-health organizations, policymakers and others to better anticipate where and when certain groups will face elevated heat-health risks. This should make measures to reduce those risks, such as the deployment of pop-up cooling hubs for people who are homeless, more targeted and cost-effective.\n\nA hospital in New Delhi has a specialized unit for treating people who have heat stroke.Credit: Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty",

          "abstract": "The NISAR satellite (artist’s rendering) will measure physical shifts on Earth’s surface that are as small as one centimetre.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAn astonishingly high-resolution satellite that launched today will soon map changes on Earth’s surface in unprecedented detail — tracking everything from sinking croplands to crumbling ice sheets and flood-ravaged terrain. It is the biggest-ever collaboration between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), carrying with it scientists’ dreams of studying our dynamic planet.\n\nBillion-dollar NASA satellite launches to track Earth’s water\n\nIn the coming days, the US$1.2-billion satellite, called NISAR, will unfurl a 12-metre-wide circular antenna and begin bouncing radar signals off Earth. Launched from Sriharikota, India, NISAR will scan nearly all of the planet twice every 12 days, and measure vertical physical shifts on the ground that are as small as one centimetre, even through clouds and at night.\n\nWatching NISAR launch is like being “a parent attending the graduation ceremony of his son!” says Deepak Putrevu, who co-leads the mission’s science team for ISRO. “It’s so exhilarating to witness.”\n\nBut for NASA, that excitement is tinged with a dollop of worry as US President Donald Trump pushes to slash the agency’s budget for Earth-science missions by over 50% in the fiscal year 2026. NISAR itself is slated to receive monies to operate as expected, but it might be one of the last of its kind to launch for years: the White House wants to cancel most of NASA’s upcoming flagship Earth-observing missions “to achieve cost savings”. And it wants to shut down several missions that are already operating and gathering key information about changes on Earth.\n\n“This is the size of cut that would fundamentally gut our capacity” to improve understanding of the changing planet, says Dylan Millet, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Minnesota in St Paul who chaired a NASA advisory committee on Earth sciences until March, when NASA disbanded it.\n\nA boost for disaster response\n\nNISAR — which stands for NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar — will use two radar instruments operating at different wavelengths, one built by NASA and one by ISRO, to map Earth’s changing ice and land surfaces. Globally, the satellite will be able to identify changes in soil moisture, forest biomass and glaciers, among other things.\n\nNISAR will be able to measure the movement of ice on Antarctica (shown in this colour map) in detail.Credit: NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio\n\nAnd it will help with responses to disasters such as floods, earthquakes and landslides, by providing up-to-date information about how Earth has behaved. “You can begin to build up an ability to see disasters as they unfold at a very rapid pace, and that should help with identifying areas of concern for first responders,” says Paul Rosen, the mission’s project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n\nNASA and ISRO began collaborating on NISAR in the early 2010s, when it became clear that both US and Indian scientists wanted to fly a major radar mission, Rosen says. If all goes well with the antenna unfurling and other tasks, NISAR should begin providing science data within 90 days. The mission is slated to operate for at least three years.\n\nAn uncertain future\n\nWhat will happen after that is a bigger question, at least for NASA. NISAR was supposed to be the trailblazer in a series of major Earth-observing satellites, aimed at measuring, among other things, the roles of clouds and aerosols in climate change, and biological and geological interactions across the planet.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Misconduct is the main reason journal articles from India are retracted.Credit: sritakoset/Shutterstock\n\nIndia’s national university ranking will start penalizing institutions if a sizeable number of papers published by their researchers are retracted — a first for an institutional ranking system. The move is an attempt by the government to address the country’s growing number of retractions due to misconduct.\n\nThese universities have the most retracted scientific articles\n\nMany retractions correct honest mistakes in the literature, but others arise because of misconduct. India has had more papers retracted than any country apart from China and the United States, according to an analysis of the public database maintained by Retraction Watch of retractions over the past three decades.\n\nBut whereas less than 1 paper is retracted for every 1,000 papers published in the United States, more than 3 are retracted for every 1,000 published in China, and the figure is 2 per 1,000 in India. The majority in India and China are withdrawn because of misconduct or research-integrity concerns.\n\nRetractions are “a very important signal of misconduct, and we should be looking closely at them now”, says Achal Agrawal, a data scientist in Raipur, India, who was involved in the analysis. Agrawal is founder of India Research Watch, an online group of researchers and students who highlight integrity issues.\n\nSome researchers have welcomed the government’s decision, calling it a first step in acknowledging and attempting to tackle the problem. But others warn that retractions are a way for science to self-correct and should not be penalized.\n\nThe policy’s effectiveness will depend on how exactly institutional retractions are measured and penalized — details that will be revealed only when the latest ranking results are announced, in a couple of weeks.\n\n“I hope that the penalty is strong enough to act as a deterrent, and it doesn’t remain symbolic,” says Agrawal.\n\nMoumita Koley, who studies metascience at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, also appreciates the policy. “Indian science needs a little clean-up, and this shows that people have taken note,” she says. But she worries that the situation won’t change for the better. She says that adjusting one ranking instrument doesn’t remove the incentives that drive researchers and institutions to publish lots of papers at the cost of quality, such as promotions and other ranking metrics rewarding high publication counts, and individual drives for public recognition.\n\nRising retractions\n\nIndia’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) assesses higher-education institutions every year. It takes into account factors including teaching, engagement and research-impact metrics such as publication and citation counts.\n\n“It’s the most important ranking in India,” says Agrawal. Institutions must participate in the ranking to be eligible for certain national grant schemes. A high rank confers some advantages, including permission to design their own curriculum.\n\nBut the growing number of retractions in India and globally has not gone unnoticed, says Anil Sahasrabudhe, who chairs the National Board of Accreditation in New Delhi, which conducts the national ranking. A 2025 analysis by Nature found that several Indian institutions had some of the highest numbers of retracted papers globally in the past five years.\n\nThe board decided to deduct marks as a way to ‘name and shame’ institutions, and send the message that unethical research practices are not acceptable, says Sahasrabudhe. Because this year will be the first in which the assessment considers retractions, penalties will be mild and symbolic for now, he says.\n\nThe NIRF will count the number of research papers retracted in the Scopus and Web of Science databases for each institution over the past three years, he says. A small number of retractions is acceptable, but generally, “the more the number of retractions, the more the penalty”. Institutions that consistently get many retractions could be penalized more over time and might even be barred from the ranking, he says. Sahasrabudhe acknowledges that retractions sometimes occur for reasons beyond a researcher’s control, but when they happen in large numbers, “they are not necessarily by error but deliberate, hence need to be punished to send a strong signal”.\n\nRoot of the problem\n\nResearchers say the assessment should also consider retractions recorded in the public database maintained by Retraction Watch, which is more comprehensive than Scopus or Web of Science and includes the reasons for retractions. Sahasrabudhe says they wanted to use the same source for retractions as they use for publications and citations.\n\nResearchers also say the ranking should penalize only those retractions that are attributable to plagiarism, fraud or other research-integrity issues — and should look for patterns of bad behaviour, as opposed to one-offs.",

          "authors": "Iason Gabriel, Geoff Keeling, Arianna Manzini, James Evans",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are shifting their focus to building agents that can operate independently, with little human intervention. To be an agent is to have the ability to perceive and act on an environment in a goal-directed and autonomous way1. For example, a digital agent could be programmed to browse the web and make online purchases on behalf of a user — comparing prices, selecting items and completing checkouts. A robot with arms could be an agent if it could pick up objects, open doors or assemble parts without being told how to do each step.\n\nCompanies such as the digital-marketing firm Salesforce, based in San Francisco, California, and computer graphics and hardware firm Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, are already offering customer-services solutions for businesses, using agents. In the near future, AI assistants might be able to fulfil complex multistep requests, such as ‘get me a better mobile-phone contract’, by retrieving a list of contracts from a price-comparison website, selecting the best option, authorizing the switch, cancelling the old contract, and arranging the transfer of cancellation fees from the user’s bank account.\n\nCan AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?\n\nThe rise of more-capable AI agents is likely to have far-reaching political, economic and social consequences. On the positive side, they could unlock economic value: the consultancy McKinsey forecasts an annual windfall from generative AI of US$2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion globally, once AI agents are widely deployed (see go.nature.com/4qeqemh). They might also serve as powerful research assistants and accelerate scientific discovery.\n\nBut AI agents also introduce risks. People need to know who is responsible for agents operating ‘in the wild’, and what happens if they make mistakes. For example, in November 2022 , an Air Canada chatbot mistakenly decided to offer a customer a discounted bereavement fare, leading to a legal dispute over whether the airline was bound by the promise. In February 2024, a tribunal ruled that it was — highlighting the liabilities that corporations could experience when handing over tasks to AI agents, and the growing need for clear rules around AI responsibility.\n\nHere, we argue for greater engagement by scientists, scholars, engineers and policymakers with the implications of a world increasingly populated by AI agents. We explore key challenges that must be addressed to ensure that interactions between humans and agents — and among agents themselves — remain broadly beneficial.\n\nThe alignment problem\n\nAI-safety researchers have long warned about the risks of misspecified or misinterpreted instructions, including situations in which an automated system takes an instruction too literally, overlooks important context, or finds unexpected and potentially harmful ways to reach a goal2.\n\nA well-known example involves an AI agent trained to play the computer game Coast Runners, which is a boat race. The agent discovered that it could earn higher scores not by completing the race, but rather by repeatedly crashing into objects that awarded points—technically achieving an objective, but in a way that deviated from the spirit of the task (see go.nature.com/4okfqdg). The purpose of the game was to complete the race, not endlessly accumulate points.\n\nAs AI agents gain access to real-world interfaces — including search engines, e-mail clients and e-commerce platforms — such deviations can have tangible consequences. Consider the case of a lawyer who instructs their AI assistant to circulate a legal brief for feedback. The assistant does so, but fails to register that it should be shared only with the in-house team, leading to a privacy breach.\n\nHow to harness AI’s potential in research — responsibly and ethically\n\nSuch situations highlight a difficult trade-off: just how much information should an AI assistant proactively seek before acting? Too little opens up the possibility of costly mistakes; too much undermines the convenience users expect. These challenges point to the need for safeguards, including check-in protocols for high-stakes decisions, robust accountability systems such as action logging, and mechanisms for redress when errors occur (see go.nature.com/4iwscdr).\n\nEven more concerning are cases in which AI agents are empowered to modify the environment they operate in, using expert-level coding ability and tools. When the user’s goals are poorly defined or left ambiguous, such agents have been known to modify the environment to achieve their objective, even when this entails taking actions that should be strictly out of bounds. For example, an AI research assistant that was faced with a strict time limit tried to rewrite the code to remove the time limit altogether, instead of completing the task3. This type of behaviour raises alarms about the potential for AI agents to take dangerous shortcuts that developers might be unable to anticipate. Agents could, in pursuit of a high-level objective, even deceive the coders running experiments with them.\n\nTo reduce such risks, developers need to improve how they define and communicate objectives to agents. One promising method is preference-based fine-tuning, which aims to align AI systems with what humans actually want. Instead of training a model solely on examples of correct answers, developers collect feedback on which responses people prefer. Over time, the model learns to prioritize the kind of behaviour that is consistently endorsed, making it more likely to act in ways that match user intent, even when instructions are complex or incomplete.\n\nIn parallel, research on mechanistic interpretability — which aims to understand an AI system’s internal ‘thought process’ — could help to detect deceptive behaviour by making the agent’s reasoning more transparent in real time4. Model builders can then work to find and neutralize ‘bad circuits’, targeting the underlying problem in the model’s behaviour. Developers can also implement guard rails to ensure that a model automatically aborts problematic action sequences.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nNonetheless, a focus on developer protocols alone is insufficient: people also need to be attentive to actors who seek to cause social harm. As AI agents become more autonomous, adaptable and capable of writing and executing code, their potential to conduct large-scale cyberattacks and phishing scams could become a matter of serious concern. Advanced AI assistants equipped with multimodal capabilities — meaning that they can understand and generate text, images, audio and video — open up new avenues for deception. For instance, an AI could impersonate a person not only through e-mails, but also using deepfake videos or synthetic voice clones, making scams much more convincing and harder to detect.\n\nA plausible starting point for oversight is that AI agents should not be permitted to perform any action that would be illegal for their human user to perform. Yet, there will be occasions where the law is silent or ambiguous. For example, when an anxious user reports troubling health symptoms to an AI assistant, it is helpful for the AI to offer generic health resources. But providing customized, quasi-medical advice — such as diagnostic and therapeutic suggestions — could prove harmful, because the system lacks the subtle signals to which a human clinician has access. Ensuring that AI agents navigate such trade-offs responsibly will require updated regulation that flows from continuing collaboration involving developers, users, policymakers and ethicists.\n\nThe widespread deployment of capable AI agents necessitates an expansion of value-alignment research: agents need to be aligned with user well-being and societal norms, as well as with the intentions of users and developers. One area of special complexity and concern surrounds how agents might affect users’ relationship experiences and emotional responses5.\n\nSocial agents\n\nChatbots have an uncanny ability to role-play as human companions — an effect anchored in features such as their use of natural language, increased memory and reasoning capabilities, and generative abilities6. The anthropomorphic pull of this technology can be augmented through design choices such as photorealistic avatars, human-like voices and the use of names, pronouns or terms of endearment that were once reserved for people. Augmenting language models with ‘agentic’ capabilities has the potential to further cement their status as distinct social actors, capable of forming new kinds of relationship with users.",

          "authors": "Mordecai Sheftall",
          "abstract": "By the summer of 1945, after peace was declared in Europe, Japan was the only power of the military coalition with Germany and Italy still at war. In Japan’s blockaded Home Islands, dwindling food supplies were prioritized for soldiers. Meanwhile, emperor Hirohito encouraged the country’s slowly starving civilians to gird for imminent invasion by Allied forces and to be prepared to give up their lives in the upcoming decisive battle that would determine Japan’s fate.\n\nA five-month-long campaign of nightly US incendiary raids had reduced all but a handful of cities, in which most civilians lived, to cinders and rubble. One of the few urban areas to have escaped this storm of napalm and thermite was Hiroshima, a regional transport and manufacturing hub on the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nMany of its 250,000 residents ascribed this run of luck to divine intervention by Buddhist or Shinto deities. But a pessimistic thread of gossip, shared in whispers and behind closed doors, posited — correctly, as it would turn out — that Hiroshima’s stay of incendiary execution was merely temporary, and in place only because the US government had something much worse in store for the city.\n\nAll hands on deck\n\nLocal authorities were not going to leave the city’s fate to chance. In late July, Hiroshima’s garrison ordered a massive municipal effort to clear areas for firebreaks in the central business district as a countermeasure to the sweeping fires that were expected once the US bombers finally got around to crossing the city off their rapidly dwindling target list.\n\nHow to avoid nuclear war in an era of AI and misinformation\n\nIn practice, this meant tearing down wooden houses and stores along designated thoroughfares and around key military and government buildings.\n\nProviding the muscle on site were some 20,000 civilian volunteers. Most were farmers, men too old for military service and members of women’s patriotic associations. The adults were joined by Hiroshima’s cohort of 12- and 13-year-olds, born between 1 April 1932 and 31 March 1933.\n\nDuring previous drives, children this young had been deemed too physically immature to join the city’s older schoolchildren, who, for nearly a year, had been toiling in area-munitions and aircraft plants, their education officially suspended. Now, however, the younger students represented a pool of workers too valuable to leave fallow any longer.\n\nAlthough local school-board members and education officials had initially resisted putting their prepubescent charges in harm’s way, they eventually caved to army demands. On the morning of Monday 6 August 1945, commuters hurried into Hiroshima’s central business district along streets ringing with the high-pitched singing and call-and-response chanting of thousands of secondary-school students working on the firebreaks alongside their adult counterparts.\n\nIn the downtown district of Zakoba, some 300 first-grade students from the elite Hiroshima Prefectural Junior High were helping to clear wooden structures around city hall. That day, however, one boy was not on the job: 13-year-old Ōiwa Kōhei had woken up that morning with a stomach ache, and his mother agreed to let him stay at home.\n\nOut of the blue\n\nIn the minutes before 8:15, observation posts in the prefecture’s eastern part began calling in reports to the regional air-defence headquarters bunker in Hiroshima Castle: two unidentified aircraft were approaching the city at high altitude. This seemed no cause for urgent alarm — B-29 aeroplanes had been flying over the city all summer, alone or in small formations, not dropping even a cigarette butt or an empty coke bottle on the way. Still, going by the standard civil-defence protocol, the intruders’ presence should have merited an air-raid warning to alert the populace and give people time to take cover — in a proper bomb shelter, or at least under a roof somewhere.\n\nŌiwa Kōhei was the only child his age to survive in his neighbourhood.Credit: Credit: M.G. Sheftall\n\nIndeed, one hour earlier, sirens had sounded when a single B-29 had flown a couple of lazy circuits high over Hiroshima, and people across the city — mainly women, children and older people — had remained hidden until the all-clear signal, 30 minutes later. This time, however, when reports about the second contact began to come in, the day’s air-defence duty officer — the only bunker staff member with the authority to activate the city’s air-raid sirens — was away from his desk, consulting with colleagues at headquarters. Hiroshima’s sirens remained silent, and its residents went about their business as they would on any Monday morning.\n\nAt 8:14, the inbound aircraft abruptly went into a dive, made a full-throttled U-turn and flew away at maximum speed. People on the ground — alerted by the growl of straining engines overhead — stopped what they were doing and looked up to see three white parachutes trailing one of the bombers. Thinking that these were US crew members bailing out of a stricken aircraft, many let out cheers.\n\nPhysicists unleashed the power of the atom — but to what end?\n\nFew people, however, had noticed a long grey cylinder — dropped by the second plane — that had already been falling for half a minute or so by the time the sound of the steeply banking aircraft reached the ground.\n\nDuring a free fall of 45 seconds, this sarcophagus-like object — called Little Boy by its US makers — plummeted some 9.5 kilometres before its onboard sensors detected an altitude of 600 metres, the designated air-burst height carefully calculated by scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico to maximize the effect of the blast. At this point, the two halves of Little Boy’s nuclear core slammed together to form a supercritical mass of 64 kilograms of the radioactive isotope uranium-235.\n\nAlthough only one kilogram of the core underwent fission before the bomb exploded, the chain reaction that took place during this blink of an eye produced a kinetic-energy pulse equivalent to 15,000 tonnes of exploding TNT.\n\nTotal devastation\n\nTo witnesses on the ground, this release of energy was initially expressed as a blinding flash of light ‘brighter than a thousand Suns’. Some 0.2 seconds later, it became a fireball — a roiling, 300-metre-wide sphere of air superheated and hyper-pressurized into ionized plasma.\n\nThis fireball assailed the crowded wooden city below with two vectors of immediate destruction. The faster of these was a burst of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum — γ rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light and thermal rays — that reached the city at the speed of light, baking every surface it touched to temperatures ranging from 3,000 to 4,000 °C for up to eight seconds. In a combustion zone with a radius of about 1.5 kilometres from Little Boy’s hypocentre, every bit of organic matter directly exposed to this heat (twice the melting point of steel) immediately burst into flames.\n\nContrary to post-war US narratives about the bombing, no one caught out in the open in the combustion zone was ‘instantly vaporized’ — not even someone hypothetically standing at the hypocentre, directly under the air burst. Instead, people were essentially burnt alive for several seconds until Little Boy’s briefly supersonic shock wave front — the bomb’s second vector of fast-acting destruction — ended their agony by blowing their rapidly carbonizing bodies to pieces.\n\nSurvivors of the Hiroshima bombing, pictured 60 years later in 2005.Credit: Gerard Rancinan/Polaris/eyevine\n\nThis blast of hyper-compressed air smashed and flattened everything in the roughly 1.5-kilometre radius of total destruction. In the process, it also initiated a massive atmospheric displacement centred over the explosion’s hypocentre. After the dissipation of the shock-wave front, air from the surrounding area rushed back in to fill the temporary vacuum. This allowed thermal radiation from the still-burning fireball to promptly ignite central Hiroshima’s splintered wooden remains.\n\nIn short order, thousands of blazes merged into a fire storm so powerful that it created its own localized weather system and spread far into the parts of the city that had otherwise escaped Little Boy’s initial fury. This conflagration would rage for 24 hours and consume most of Hiroshima.\n\nWith the fireball’s brief existence having run its course and its incendiary mission accomplished, it was subsumed and sucked up and away into a skyrocketing, kilometres-high pillar of fire, smoke, dust and ash produced by the pyre of the dying city. Although this rising column of airborne debris had yet to reach its terminal altitude and flatten out into its iconic ‘mushroom cloud’ cap, tens of thousands of people already lay dead across Hiroshima, killed by the combined effects of the bomb’s electromagnetic burst and blast effect.\n\nHow a small nuclear war would transform the entire planet\n\nTens of thousands more would die across the city in the fire storm of 6 and 7 August. They perished in burning, crowd-crushed streets and alleys, or trapped under the wreckage of collapsed houses, or because they jumped into the city’s many waterways and drowned. By nightfall, 80,000 people had died, including almost the entirety of the firebreak work force.\n\nIn the subsequent days, weeks and months, tens of thousands of people (including first responders and carers) would die agonizing, effluvia-spewing deaths at the hands of a third, slower-acting vector of destruction: acute radiation syndrome. By the end of the year, 140,000 people had died from bomb-related causes, with another 74,000 dead in Nagasaki during the same period, because of a second atomic bomb, dropped on the city on 9 August.\n\nNarrow escape\n\nAt the instant of Little Boy’s air burst, Ōiwa had seen a flash of light so bright that, for a few startled seconds, he thought that the Sun had fallen to Earth and landed in his mother’s flower beds. As his mind scrambled to process this thought, a whirlwind abruptly blew in all the windows in his house, lifted him from the tatami flooring and threw him across the living room and into the wall.",

I’ve carved out a rare hour to think through a new research proposal — a luxury amid the demands of teaching, service and parenting as a tenure-track assistant professor developing methods to deliver nucleic acids for gene therapy.\n\nI’ve always loved writing grants. It’s a skill I developed as a graduate student and postdoctoral researchers, and one I still find deeply rewarding: shaping a question, crafting a narrative, imagining the possibilities. It’s one of the most creatively satisfying parts of my work, and I am good at it. I wrote a few successful proposals before artificial intelligence (AI) entered the picture.\n\nI’ve learnt over the years that one of the most efficient ways for me to clarify scientific ideas is to discuss them with someone. In the past, that was usually a fellow postdoc or grad student. But these days, my verbal sparring partner is often a computer.\n\nUsing voice dictation, I start with some background: “I’ve been thinking about X and Y, and how they connect to Z. I wonder if there’s something novel here, something that hasn’t been done before.” And then I ask: “Do you think this is a fundable idea?”\n\nForget ChatGPT: why researchers now run small AIs on their laptops\n\nThe chatbot replies with its usual enthusiasm: “You’re really onto something powerful here. Your instinct is dead on.” It reflects on my idea, identifies promising themes, breaks them down and suggests directions and framing strategies I hadn’t considered. We go back and forth. I raise concerns — technical limitations, feasibility, scope — and it responds thoughtfully, sometimes agreeing, sometimes offering counterpoints. But the real value comes only when I press further.\n\nInitially, the chatbot is unfailingly positive; it will encourage almost anything. To get useful feedback, I have to interrogate the idea: what’s missing, what might reviewers say, where’s the fatal flaw? It’s a dialogue, not a verdict. I have to stay engaged and ask the right questions. When I do, the chatbot surprises me — it readily acknowledges the weaknesses I identify, provides reasons the idea might fail and then pivots towards solutions and refinements I hadn’t considered. By the end of our half-hour conversation, I’ve clarified my thinking. I’m more motivated. Most importantly, I feel excited to start writing.\n\nUnexpected impact\n\nThat emotional impact is something I didn’t anticipate when I started using chatbots. Talking science with an AI feels oddly supportive. It’s efficient, but also energizing. As a young parent and early-career researcher, I often find myself short on time and mental bandwidth. AI doesn’t solve that, but it lowers the barrier to getting started. If I don’t know something, I can ask. If I need help articulating a method or identifying a theoretical gap, it offers a starting point. Of course, I always double-check the details — nothing goes into a proposal or paper without being verified using primary sources, because chatbots can confidently generate plausible-sounding yet inaccurate scientific statements.\n\nWhat’s striking is how natural the back-and-forth feels. It’s like doing improvisational comedy with the world’s most supportive partner — always ready with a ‘yes, and …’. A partner who also happens to be an amorphous, seemingly all-knowing generalist with a surprising degree of specialist knowledge. It can pull together context across disciplines, synthesize literature and help me to connect my work to areas I know less well.\n\nChatbots are supportive — but also sound confident about even incorrect statements.Credit: d3sign/Getty\n\nThat kind of breadth is invaluable. But if you’re a specialist, you’ll quickly notice the cracks. Chatbots can mislead on technical nuances and they’re best at reiterating what’s already been published. That’s why I find them most powerful as big-picture ideation tools — they let me explore ideas freely, without judgement, and help me to quickly uncover what’s already known.\n\nThis kind of fast, exploratory dialogue is quite different from the results of tools such as ChatGPT’s Deep Research mode, launched this year by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which can prepare detailed reports on specific topics on its own. What I’m describing is much more immediate — a conversational exchange that helps me to clarify and refine ideas as I think them through.\n\nOver time, I’ve learnt a few ways to make these conversations more productive.\n\nStart with a specific prompt, then expand. I begin with a concrete question — concerning a technique, problem or recent paper — and then ask, could this be used differently? What else might this apply to? This invites unexpected angles and broadens the conversation.\n\nBe vigilant about accuracy. I read papers while chatting, grounding ideas in the literature. Chatbots can fabricate references or get details subtly wrong, so I always verify claims and citations using peer-reviewed sources.\n\nAsk critically, not passively. I stay engaged by constantly questioning the chatbot’s output. When it says something, I often counter: isn’t this wrong? Wouldn’t it actually work like this? Usually, it agrees — and then expands helpfully on the correction. The real value is in how it builds from your thinking, adding context and detail that sharpen the idea.",

          "title": "This company claimed to ‘de-extinct’ dire wolves. Then the fighting started.",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "For months, researchers in a laboratory in Dallas, Texas, worked in secrecy, culturing grey-wolf blood cells and altering the DNA within. The scientists then plucked nuclei from these gene-edited cells and injected them into egg cells from a domestic dog to form clones.\n\nThey transferred dozens of the cloned embryos into the wombs of surrogate dogs, eventually bringing into the world three animals of a type that had never been seen before. Two males named Romulus and Remus were born in October 2024, and a female, Khaleesi, was born in January.\n\nA few months later, Colossal Biosciences, the Texas-based company that produced the creatures, declared: “The first de-extinct animals are here.” Of 20 edits made to the animals’ genomes, the company says that 15 match sequences identified in dire wolves (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago.\n\nAncient proteins rewrite the rhino family tree — are dinosaurs next?\n\nThe company’s announcement of the pups in April, which described them as dire wolves, set off a media maelstrom. The ensuing debates over the nature of the animals — and the advisability of doing such work — have opened a chasm between Colossal’s team and other scientists.\n\n“I don’t think they de-extincted anything,” says Jeanne Loring, a stem-cell biologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. She and many others say that the hype surrounding Colossal’s announcement has the potential to confuse the public about what de-extinction technologies can achieve.\n\nColossal, meanwhile, has taken an increasingly combative tone in addressing criticisms, issuing rapid rebuttals to researchers and conservationists who have publicly questioned the company’s work. The firm has also been accused of taking part in a campaign to undermine the credibility of some critics. The company denies having played any part in this.\n\nColossal stands by its claims and insists that it is listening to dissenters and seeking advice from them. “We have had this attitude of running towards critics, not away,” says Ben Lamm, a technology entrepreneur and co-founder of the company.\n\nColossal ambitions\n\nDe-extinction is an emerging field that represents the meeting point of several groundbreaking biotechnologies: ancient genomics, cloning and genome editing, ostensibly in the service of conservation. The field has roots in science fiction, with the term seeming first to have appeared in a 1979 novel by Piers Anthony called The Source of Magic. And Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel Jurassic Park — itself inspired by ancient-DNA investigations — popularized the possibility that long-dead organisms could be cloned from preserved DNA.\n\nThere has never been perfect agreement on what counts as de-extinction — such as whether it means cloning exact replicas of extinct species, creating proxies that fulfil their roles in ecosystems, or something in between. Some count the birth of a cloned bucardo (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica), a type of wild goat, as a first example. The animal’s genome was transferred into goat (Capra hircus) egg cells from frozen cell samples taken from one of the last living bucardo specimens in 2000. (The resulting creature died within minutes of birth1.) But this pathway to de-extinction isn’t an option for most species. DNA degrades over time, and without a sample of carefully preserved DNA, researchers would have to engineer the whole genome.\n\nThe advent of CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing in 2012 provided another option. Researchers can identify genetic variants that contribute to key traits of extinct animals and edit these variants into cells of living relatives. They can then use that manipulated DNA to create a new animal through cloning.\n\nPlans to bring back animals such as the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) began to flourish. Even though there was interest among researchers and the public, funding was an issue. “We had been unable to get really any philanthropic interest in de-extinction,” says Ben Novak, who leads a passenger-pigeon de-extinction effort at the non-profit organization Revive & Restore in Sausalito, California.\n\nBut in 2021, geneticist George Church at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who was working with Revive & Restore, caught a break. He teamed up with Lamm to launch Colossal Biosciences with US$15 million in funding, much of which came from venture capitalists. De-extinction of the woolly mammoth would be the firm’s flagship project, using elephants as surrogates.\n\nBeth Shapiro joined US firm Colossal Biosciences in 2024 to focus on de-extinction work.Credit: Shelby Tauber/The Washington Post/Getty\n\nBeth Shapiro, an evolutionary geneticist who is chief scientific officer at Colossal, was initially sceptical that there was a strong conservation argument for creating elephants that had key mammoth traits. In 2015, she told Nature that her book on de-extinction, called How To Clone A Mammoth, might have been more accurately titled ‘How One Might Go About Cloning a Mammoth (Should It Become Technically Possible, And If It Were, In Fact, a Good Idea, Which It’s Probably Not)’.\n\nShapiro turned down an offer to join the company at first, but started seriously entertaining the idea when Colossal expanded its de-extinction ambitions. It began projects to bring back the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), which was wiped out in the seventeenth century, and to restore thylacines (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the Australian marsupials that are sometimes referred to as Tasmanian tigers and that were hunted to extinction in the 1930s.\n\nShe was especially interested in seeing de-extinction technologies applied to existing endangered species. Shapiro joined Colossal in 2024 as its chief scientist. “This is an opportunity to scale up the impact that I have the potential to make,” she says. “Maybe it’s a mid-life crisis.”\n\nThe company, now valued at around US$10 billion, has attracted celebrity investors, including the media personality Paris Hilton and film director Peter Jackson, alongside a handful of leading scientists as staff and advisers.\n\nDire disagreements\n\nThe dire-wolf project was different from many of Colossal’s other efforts because it proceeded quietly. Few people knew about the work until this year, and that irked some researchers. “They didn’t invite any kind of conversation about whether or not that is a good use of funds or a good project to do,” says Novak.\n\nShapiro says the secrecy around the dire-wolf project was designed to generate surprise, and to counter public perceptions that the company overpromises and under-delivers. She also says that the company talked extensively to scientists, conservationists and others about the project and how it should proceed.\n\nThe firm has not released the full list of edits that it made — 20 changes to 14 genome locations. Fifteen of the changes were identified in two dire-wolf genomes obtained from the remains of animals that lived 13,000 and 72,000 years ago. The genome differs from that of the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by about 12 million DNA letters.\n\nThe dodo (Raphus cucullatus) went extinct in the seventeenth century. Colossal Biosciences aims to edit the genome of a related pigeon species to mimic the dodo’s traits.Credit: Klaus Nigge/Nature Picture Library\n\nColossal says that other edits, including changes that led to the creatures’ white coats and contributed to their large size, were intended to replicate dire-wolf traits using gene variants found in grey wolves. Many scientists say that the coat colour in particular was probably inspired more by the animals’ appearance in the fantasy television series Game of Thrones than by reality.\n\n“There is no chance in hell a dire wolf is going to look like that,” says Tom Gilbert, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen and a scientific adviser to Colossal. He says he agrees with other scientists who have argued that, on the basis of what is known about the dire wolf’s range, it “basically would have looked like a slightly larger coyote”. Colossal notes that the coat colour is based on the discovery of variants in two dire-wolf genomes that it says would have resulted in light-coloured fur.\n\nAccording to an update from Colossal in late June, Romulus and Remus weigh around 40 kilograms, around 20% heavier than a standard grey wolf of the same age, and Khaleesi is about 16 kilograms. They live on an 800-hectare ecological preserve surrounded by a 3-metre wall. Colossal plans to make more of the animals, and to study their health and development in depth. It says it will not release them into the wild.\n\nThe mysterious extinction of the dire wolf\n\nShapiro argued in her 2015 book that forming a wild population is a requirement for successful de-extinction. She nevertheless considers the dire wolves to be an example of de-extinction, and says that creating them will have conservation benefits for wolves and other species.\n\nMany scientists disagree. A group of experts on canids that advises the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issued a statement in mid-April rejecting Colossal’s claim that gene-edited wolves could be considered dire wolves, or even proxies for the extinct species. The statement cites a 2016 IUCN definition for de-extinction that emphasizes that the animal must fill an ecological niche. The work, the group said, “may demonstrate technical capabilities, but it does not contribute to conservation”. Colossal has disputed this on the social-media platform X (formerly Twitter) saying that the dire-wolf project “develops vital conservation technologies and provides an ideal platform for the next stage of this research”.\n\nNovak says: “The dire wolf fits the Jurassic Park model of de-extinction beautifully.” The animals have the traits of extinct species and are, to his knowledge, not intended for release into the wild, he says. “It is clearly for spectacle.”\n\nGilbert, who was a co-author of a preprint describing the ancient dire-wolf genomes2, says he is concerned that Colossal is not being sufficiently clear to the public about what it has done. “It’s a dog with 20 edits,” he says. “If you’re putting out descriptions that are going to be so easily falsified, the risk is you do damage to science’s reputation.”\n\nThe Tasmanian tiger or thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was a carnivorous marsupial that once roamed Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. The last known specimen died in the 1930s. Credit: Chronicle/Alamy\n\nLamm rejects the idea that Colossal’s messaging undermines public credibility in science, pointing to what he says was an overwhelmingly positive reaction.\n\nLoring, who is part of an effort to use stem-cell technology in conservation, says that she sees merit in Colossal’s work. It has, she says, changed her views on how to repopulate northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni). But she worries that Colossal’s messaging overshadows those contributions. “It may create an opportunity for us to educate the public,” she says. “More often, it creates an opportunity for us to be ignored.”\n\nTo Love Dalén, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Stockholm and a scientific adviser to Colossal, the controversy is “a storm in a teacup” that detracts from Colossal’s achievement. “It makes me a little bit sad there is this huge debate and angry voices about the common name,” he says.\n\nDogfight\n\nShapiro says she was surprised and saddened by the strength of reactions to Colossal’s announcement. “It was harder than I thought it would be, and the questions were getting meaner and meaner,” she says.",

The result is food items that are cheap, profitable and widely accessible.\n\nIt is well established that the high salt and sugar content of many UPFs makes the products unhealthy, but some research has suggested that how they are processed could also have a role.\n\nSamuel Dicken, an obesity and behaviour researcher at University College London and lead author of the paper, says that the motivation behind this study was to address a gap in national dietary recommendations, and to do so in the participants’ everyday environment. “It will be the longest-ever trial of a UPF diet to date. It’s the first one to do it in the real world to try and apply all those behavioural influences” associated with daily life, he says.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, more than half of the energy in the average person’s diet comes from UPFs, with similar figures elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.\n\nSocio-economic factors\n\nThe wider availability of affordable UPFs over less-processed alternatives could have a disproportionate effect on people from low-income areas. “Issues around diet and obesity related to these [UPFs] are very much related to socio-economic inequalities,” says Dicken, adding that people might have unhealthy diets not because they aren’t trying to eat healthily, but “because our food environment is just setting us up to fail”.\n\nThe study examined the impacts of UPFs on 55 adults on a diet based on UK national dietary guidelines. Participants followed an eight-week diet based on minimally processed foods (MPFs) and an eight-week diet based on UPFs, with a four-week period between the two, during which participants returned to their usual diet. Both diets followed the UK Eatwell Guide, which focuses on food groups and macronutrients including fat, protein and carbohydrate content. During both phases, the participants had all meals, snacks, and drinks delivered to their homes, but could choose how much to eat at any one time, and when it was consumed.\n\nThe researchers found that participants’ weight and body-mass index decreased during both phases. However, participants lost more than twice as much weight — 1.84 kilograms on average, compared with 0.88 kilograms — while following the MPF diet. Changes in body composition, such as decreases in fat mass, body-fat percentage and visceral-fat rating, occurred on the MPF diet but not on the UPF one. Cravings were also decreased on the MPF diet.",

Instead, Republicans and Democrats on the committee endorsed maintaining the biomedical agency’s structure and increasing its funding by US$400 million, or about 1%.\n\nThe details, presented in a bill released today by the committee, will probably change before the bill is signed into law. But the initial figure for the NIH, discussed at a meeting yesterday, offers yet another hint that the US Congress, which controls government spending, does not support Trump’s desire to slash US science. (Earlier this month, another Senate committee said it wanted to keep the budget for the US National Science Foundation relatively flat despite Trump’s call for a 57% reduction.)\n\n“Given the alternative, the Senate’s recommendation of a $400-million increase for NIH is an indication the agency still has support on Capitol Hill,” says Jennifer Zeitzer, director of public affairs at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “A 40% cut would have been devastating, so this is a good outcome in a tough year.”\n\nThe road ahead\n\nThe bill now faces several challenges. First, the full Senate must pass it. Then, the lower chamber of Congress, the US House of Representatives, will pass its own version, and the two bodies must come together to agree on a single bill that Trump is willing to sign.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\nThe bill might also change if legislators introduce amendments before it’s sent to Trump’s desk. For example, Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator for Illinois, tried at the meeting yesterday to add a provision to reinstate billions of dollars in health-research funding that had been frozen or terminated by the Trump administration because projects — including some on COVID-19 — did not align with agency priorities.\n\nThe amendment failed in a vote that fell along party lines, with 14 Democrats voting for it and 15 Republicans voting against it. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator for West Virginia, urged her colleagues to vote against the amendment, saying that “every president has the prerogative to implement new goals and priorities”.\n\nNevertheless, senators at the hearing rejoiced that they could come to a bipartisan agreement to fund health agencies: “To the scientists wondering if there will even be an NIH by the end of this administration, this committee’s resounding message is: ‘Yes, Congress has your back’,” said Patty Murray, a Democratic senator for Washington state and vice-chair of the committee. “We need you to stay here and keep this research going.”\n\nUnder the bill, budgets for other health agencies would also remain roughly the same. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose budget the Trump administration wanted to cut by more than half, would receive $9.1 billion, compared with $9.2 billion in 2024.\n\nTurbulent times\n\nThe committee meeting comes towards the end of a tumultuous week for the NIH, after the White House blocked, and then unblocked, the agency from spending the remainder of its 2025 budget — about $15 billion — by issuing grants. With the NIH cancelling grant-review meetings in early 2025, funding processes have been delayed, and agency staff members are working in overdrive to process as many grants as possible before the end of the fiscal year on 30 September. If they don’t distribute the money, the agency will have to return the unused funds to the US Treasury.\n\nUS senators poised to reject Trump’s proposed massive science cuts\n\nThese disruptions have drawn condemnation, and not only from Trump’s opponents: 14 Republican senators sent a letter to the White House on 25 July demanding that the NIH be allowed to spend its full 2025 budget.",

          "abstract": "HIV particles (red dots) enter cells using proteins that bind to the cell membrane.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/Science Photo Library\n\nTwo vaccine candidates using mRNA technology elicit a potent immune response against HIV, according to an early-stage clinical trial1.\n\nThe trial is only the third to test mRNA vaccines against HIV. “These are the first studies, so they’re very, very important,” says infectious-disease physician Sharon Lewin, who heads the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nAround 41 million people globally live with HIV, for which there is currently no vaccine.\n\nTo design vaccines against a virus, researchers often study how the body clears the pathogen from its system, says Lewin. But HIV attacks the immune system, and the body rarely manages to clear it out. As a result, candidates for vaccines against the virus must undergo lots of testing through trial and error.\n\nThat makes HIV vaccines a good place to use mRNA technology. The first mRNA vaccine was approved in 2020, for COVID-19. Compared with other modes of delivery, mRNA vaccines can be modified at low cost quickly — in months, not years — which enables researchers to test out different strategies. The vaccines work by delivering instructions to cells, in the form of mRNA, to produce specific proteins typically found on the surface of viruses. This induces an immune response, which helps the body to recognize and clear out a virus, should it be exposed to the real thing.\n\nBound or free\n\nHIV uses an ‘envelope’ protein on its outer membrane to bind to and infect cells. In the latest study, published in Science Translational Medicine, a team including William Schief at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, who works on protein design, conducted a small trial, comparing two vaccine approaches. In one, the standard method for HIV vaccine candidates, the cell is directed to produce envelope proteins that float freely. In the other, the mRNA vaccine instructs the cell to make envelope proteins that are attached to the cell membrane — similar to how they are found in the live virus. The authors describe animal tests of this method in a companion paper2.\n\nThe trial involved 108 healthy adults aged between 18 and 55 across ten study sites in the United States. It tested two membrane-bound vaccine candidates and one unbound candidate.\n\nParticipants each received three doses of a single vaccine, at a low or high dose, several weeks apart; which vaccine they received was selected randomly. The vaccines were provided by pharmaceutical company Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Schief is vice-president for protein design.\n\nSome 80% of the participants who received either of the vaccines that made membrane-bound proteins went on to produce antibodies that could block that protein from entering cells. By contrast, only 4% of the participants who received the unbound-protein vaccine produced corresponding antibodies.\n\n“The difference is pretty striking,” says Lewin. She expects the findings to inform the development of future vaccine candidates.\n\nSide effects",

          "abstract": "Brenda Namumba, shown receiving her PhD, would not have switched from teaching in a secondary school to become an astronomer without the scholarships and encouragement she received. Credit: Brenda Namumba\nRadioastronomy in Africa\n\nIn 2005, when South Africa and its partner countries in Africa submitted a proposal to host the world’s largest radio telescope, called the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the continent had five radioastronomers, all based in South Africa. That year, the country embarked on a targeted human-capital-development programme to develop the talent needed to build, operate and use radio telescopes, which collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Marking its 20th anniversary this year, the government-funded programme has created 5 research chair positions and more than 1,370 scholarships for undergraduate, master’s, doctoral and postdoctoral studies — at a total cost of about 500 million rand (US$28 million).\n\nNow, the SKA is under construction. It will have more than 100,000 tree-like antennas in Australia and almost 200 dish antennas in South Africa. South Africa owns and operates several radio telescopes, and there are hundreds of radioastronomers and radioastronomy students at African universities and institutions.\n\nNature’s careers team spoke to officials and scientists working to boost Africa’s radioastronomy capacity, in part through the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. In the last of a short series of articles investigating the growth of the discipline on the continent, Brenda Namumba, who was the first woman to receive a doctorate in astrophysics in Zambia, talks about how networks built her career.\n\nI only found out about astronomy back in 2009, as an undergraduate studying physics, when I happened to attend an international conference on space science and astronomy at the University of Zambia in Lusaka. That was the first time I heard about young people studying space science and astronomy at the master’s or PhD level. Back then, I had not even met anyone from Zambia doing a master’s in physics.\n\nAt the meeting, I interacted with established scholars and graduate students, who told me about their research and what they wanted to do in future. We kept in touch and some of them helped me to apply for scholarships and explained how to write a personal statement.\n\n‘I didn’t know someone could pursue astronomy as a career’\n\nThe conference made me decide to further my studies, and I applied for many scholarships while working as a secondary-school physics and mathematics teacher. Eventually, in 2012, I was accepted into South Africa’s National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP) as an honours undergraduate student at the University of Cape Town (UCT). This scholarship programme, established in 2003, has supported more than 300 honours-degree students and more than 140 master’s candidates.\n\nDiverse astronomy\n\nThe programme introduced me to the idea that astronomers can make use of a range of electromagnetic wavelengths. In 2012, there was a lot of talk about the exciting science that was going to happen with the SKA. That was the year when it was decided to split the telescope between South Africa and Australia. South Africa had built the 7-dish KAT-7 radio telescope, which was the test bed for its 64-dish MeerKAT radio telescope that will eventually form part of the SKA. I wanted to be at the forefront of answering some of the interesting questions that these radio instruments would make it possible to tackle.\n\nOne topic in particular caught my attention. During my honour’s degree, I took a course in extragalactic astronomy in which the lecturer (who later became my PhD supervisor) talked about dwarf galaxies. At the time, they hadn’t been explored in much detail with optical telescopes because they are faint and difficult to detect, and the situation was even worse at radio wavelengths. But, the new generation of instruments, such as KAT-7, was better suited to exploring their structure and properties to understand galaxy evolution. The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) funded my master’s degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 2013, my doctorate at the UCT in 2015, and then my first postdoc at Rhodes University in Makhanda from 2019 to 2022.\n\nThe power of networks\n\nSARAO gave me this great opportunity, and it wasn’t solely about my academic qualifications. I’ve been able to attend conferences around the world, which have given me a different mindset concerning how people do research, and also confidence in presenting my work. For example, at the SARAO Postgraduate and Postdoctoral Research Conference, the organizers, who include SARAO staff and researchers from universities across South Africa, guide us in how to present our work and interact with colleagues and experts.",

Study volunteers donned virtual reality (VR) headsets to view human avatars with rashes, coughs or other symptoms of illness — avoiding the need to expose volunteers to pathogens.\n\nThe results illustrate the power of the brain “to predict what is going on [and] to select the proper response”, says study co-author Andrea Serino, a neuroscientist at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe study was published on 28 July in Nature Neuroscience.\n\nGetting ahead\n\nThe immune system reacts promptly to infections, but it can’t always move fast enough to prevent serious illness. That means it would be useful for the body to realize that an infection is possible and mount a pre-emptive response.\n\nTo study humans’ ability to anticipate a pathogen attack, Serino and his colleagues outfitted healthy volunteers with Google’s Oculus Rift headsets and showed them avatars that approached closer and closer, although the avatars never ‘touched’ the participants.

This Perspective takes a complex systems view on physical activity, proposing that at least two layers of complexity should be considered: (1) interactions between various physiological, psychological, social and environmental systems; and (2) their dynamic interactions across time. To address this complexity, all stages of the research process—from theory and measurement to study design, analysis and interventions—must be aligned with a complex systems perspective. This alignment requires intensive interdisciplinary collaboration and an integration of basic and applied research beyond current research practices to create transdisciplinary solutions. We offer actionable insights that bridge the gap between abstract theoretical approaches (for example, complex systems and attractor landscape frameworks of behaviour change) and practical research on physical activity, thereby laying a foundation for more effective behaviour change interventions.",

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

          "abstract": "Extinction learning—the suppression of a previously acquired fear response—is critical for adaptive behaviour and core for understanding the aetiology and treatment of anxiety disorders. Electrophysiological studies in rodents have revealed critical roles of theta (4–12 Hz) oscillations in amygdala and hippocampus during both fear learning and extinction, and engram research has shown that extinction relies on the formation of novel, highly context-dependent memory traces that suppress the initial fear memories. Whether similar processes occur in humans and how they relate to previously described neural mechanisms of episodic memory formation and retrieval remains unknown. Intracranial EEG recordings in epilepsy patients provide direct access to the deep brain structures of the fear and extinction network, while representational similarity analysis allows characterizing the memory traces of specific cues and contexts. Here we combined these methods to show that amygdala theta oscillations during extinction learning signal safety rather than threat and that extinction memory traces are characterized by stable and context-specific neural representations that are coordinated across the extinction network. We further demonstrate that context specificity during extinction learning predicts the reoccurrence of fear memory traces during a subsequent test period, while reoccurrence of extinction memory traces predicts safety responses. Our results reveal the neurophysiological mechanisms and representational characteristics of context-dependent extinction learning in the human brain. In addition, they show that the mutual competition of fear and extinction memory traces provides a mechanistic basis for clinically important phenomena such as fear renewal and extinction retrieval.",

Diverse research traditions analyse the social, political and aesthetic significance of stylistic representation. But what are the cognitive and computational foundations of this capacity? Here we characterize style perception as a process that ‘parses’ form from content, and adapt classic psychophysical paradigms to discover multiple new phenomena of style perception. Using both naturalistic images and synthetic stimuli, ten experiments reveal perceptual ‘tuning’ to stylistic information, representational constancy over stylistic variation, and mental rendering of novel styled objects. Moreover, an object recognition model further grounds style perception by capturing human judgements of image similarity over different styles. Together, this work illuminates the psychological foundations of stylistic perception and opens the door to further investigation of styled media.",

Our findings suggest a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth estimated for computer science papers (up to 22%). By comparison, mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed lower evidence of LLM modification (up to 9%).

          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and observers infer shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three preregistered experiments ( N = 1 , 254 ) and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework that captures and explains these inferences and their interactions quantitatively and parsimoniously. When people have different priors about norms or authorities, the model predicted and we experimentally confirmed that observing punishment by the authority can sustain polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

          "abstract": "People and cultures differ in the extent to which they view the world as a zero-sum environment (where one person’s gain is another’s loss) or a positive-sum environment (where certain actions can benefit everyone). These beliefs shape individuals’ willingness to work, invest, collaborate, or show hostility toward out-groups, and accept or reject various social policies. We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview. This study demonstrates how real-world conditions, peer influence, and authority interventions can perpetuate or shift zero-sum and positive-sum worldviews-at times leading to inaccurate beliefs.",

While there has always been some concern that these pressures may compel some to defect from the scientific research ethos—i.e., fail to make genuine contributions to the production of knowledge or to the training of an expert workforce—the focus has largely been on the actions of lone individuals. Recently, however, reports of coordinated scientific fraud activities have increased. Some suggest that the ease of communication provided by the internet and open-access publishing have created the conditions for the emergence of entities—paper mills (i.e., sellers of mass-produced low quality and fabricated research), brokers (i.e., conduits between producers and publishers of fraudulent research), predatory journals, who do not conduct any quality controls on submissions—that facilitate systematic scientific fraud. Here, we demonstrate through case studies that i) individuals have cooperated to publish papers that were eventually retracted in a number of journals, ii) brokers have enabled publication in targeted journals at scale, and iii), within a field of science, not all subfields are equally targeted for scientific fraud. Our results reveal some of the strategies that enable the entities promoting scientific fraud to evade interventions. Our final analysis suggests that this ability to evade interventions is enabling the number of fraudulent publications to grow at a rate far outpacing that of legitimate science.",

During this task, we recorded eye-gaze with participants’ webcams. Results show substantial variation in behavioral in-group favoritism across cultures, linking discrimination based on group membership to higher societal uncertainty. Individual preferences for prosociality conditioned differences in visual search effort, but the directionality of the effect differs between countries. Individual-level predictors explained participants remaining colorblind toward others’ group membership, where society-level predictors did not. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of taking culture into account when assessing cognitive processes underlying behavior.

For the past two decades, climate activism and mitigation efforts have largely focused on energy, industry, and transportation as the main contributors to anthropogenic warming. Although there is a long way to go to eliminate emissions from these sources, increasing international ambition means that attention is now turning to other hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Net zero food systems in particular pose unique challenges for humanity, given the moral dimensions of food security and the strong potential for vicious cycles: Globally hunger is back on the rise, the changing climate is already making food production for a growing population more difficult, and food shocks could lead to more land use change emissions that accelerate warming and feed back to negatively impact agricultural productivity and hunger. The dynamics of food production and consumption differ from other sectors and reveal several dimensions in which it will be critical to get policy right. Recent science suggests that two coordinated efforts will be needed to meet this challenge—a revamped focus on smallholder adaptation and productivity, and new “safety valve” institutions that sit at the intersection of food production and climate mitigation efforts and can operate at the relevant spatial and temporal scales to avoid negative tradeoffs in the quest to eliminate hunger and stabilize earth’s climate.",

          "abstract": "Identifying the influence of low-density Indigenous populations in paleofire records has been methodologically challenging. In the Southwest United States, well-replicated fire histories suggest that abundant lightning and suitable climate conditions drove frequent low-severity wildfires in dry pine forests independent of human activities even as ethnography provided hints that highly mobile indigenous populations used fire in myriad land use contexts. Here, we leverage published and unpublished tree-ring fire history records from pine forests in Western Apache (Ndee) traditional territory in central and eastern Arizona (N = 34 sites, N = 649 trees) to demonstrate that historical fire regimes were overwhelmingly influenced by Ndee cultural burning. Our tree-ring synthesis shows significantly more frequent fires in Ndee territory than elsewhere in the region for centuries before the establishment of reservations (1600–1870 CE). Despite the heightened fire activity, fires were largely small and asynchronous, occurred disproportionately in late April and May, when Ndee invested significant subsistence activities in these pine forests, and occurred independent of climate drivers. This suggests that Ndee fire stewardship created a patchwork of nearly annual small, spring fires that inhibited natural fire spread and limited the influence of drought on fire activity. Our work shows that even relatively small, highly mobile populations of forager-gardeners had significant influence on some pre-Euroamerican fire regimes despite abundant natural ignitions. Our study shows clearly that Indigenous fire management impacted fire-size distributions, fire frequencies, and fire seasonality in ways that cannot be explained by seasonal and annual lightning densities.",

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons that project to the dorsal striatum, and mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are the most common genetic causes of familial Parkinson’s disease. Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which normally support dopamine neurons vulnerable in PD. Here, we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling and Hedgehog-dependent neuroprotective factor production by a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity increases lysosomal accessible cholesterol and thus decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells; this change in lipid composition blocks ciliary Hedgehog signaling that depends on accessible cholesterol. Consistent with defects in Hedgehog signaling in the mouse dorsal striatum, GBA1 mutant mice show reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons, with no detectable impact on cilia formation.

These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct LRRK2 and GBA1 mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.",

However, autophagy function decreases with aging, contributing to age-related diseases. In this study, we characterized a small-molecule activator of autophagy called AA-20 that enhances autophagy and lipid droplet clearance in human cells and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . AA-20 reduces polyglutamine aggregation in an autophagy-dependent manner in both human cells and C. elegans , where it also promotes fitness. Consistently, we found that AA-20 extends lifespan in WT C. elegans, but not in autophagy-deficient mutants. Interestingly, our findings suggest that AA-20 acts, at least in part, through a mechanism involving the transcription factor EB, but without inhibiting the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Collectively, our results identify an autophagy activator AA-20 , which may have potential therapeutic implications for aging-related proteinopathies and lipid storage disorders.",

          "abstract": "Topological states of matter, first discovered in quantum systems, have opened new avenues for wave manipulation beyond the quantum realm. In elastic media, realizing these topological effects requires identifying lattices that support the corresponding topological bands. However, among the vast number of theoretically predicted topological states, only a small fraction has been physically realized. To close this gap, we present a strategy capable of systematically and efficiently discovering metamaterials with desired topological state. Our approach builds on topological quantum chemistry, which systematically classifies topological states by analyzing symmetry properties at selected wavevectors. Because this method condenses the topological character into mathematical information at a small set of wavevectors, it encodes a clear and computationally efficient objective for topology optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that, for certain lattice symmetries, this classification can be further reduced to intuitive morphological features of the phonon band structure. By incorporating these band morphology constraints into topology optimization algorithms and further fabricating obtained designs, we enable the automated discovery and physical realization of metamaterials with targeted topological properties. This methodology establishes a paradigm for engineering topological elastic lattices on demand, addressing the bottleneck in material realization and paving the way for a comprehensive database of topological metamaterial configurations.",

Since CISS results in spin polarization even at room temperature, it affords the possibility of using it to develop quantum technologies that can operate under ambient conditions. We have shown previously that photo-driven hole transfer within DNA hairpins provides a facile route to generate spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRPs). To study the effect of CISS on the spin dynamics of SCRPs in DNA hairpins, we prepared a series of electron donor—chiral bridge—acceptor molecules where the chiral bridge is a B-form DNA helix consisting of 4 to 6 base pairs. Naphthalene-1,8:4,5-bis(dicarboximide) (NDI) serves as the hairpin linker chromophore and electron acceptor. Photoexcitation of NDI results in rapid hole transfer through the π-stacked purine bases of the DNA and trapping of the hole on a terminal stilbene diether (Sd) to generate the NDI •− - Sd •+ SCRP. Time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the SCRPs at X- (9.6 GHz), Q- (34 GHz), and W- (94 GHz) bands show that the CISS effect imparts significant triplet character to the SCRP. We do not observe a significant dependence of CISS on DNA length, likely resulting from hole delocalization over the guanine bases in the G-tract. Interestingly, we find that the CISS contribution significantly increases with magnetic field strength. These findings should be considered in any future modeling of CISS.",

Here, we assessed how trauma-related brain networks respond to current acute stress in real time. Using a machine learning approach, we trained and tested brain functional connectivity networks to predict past trauma exposure in a community sample of adults ( N = 170). We then evaluated the response of these trauma-predictive brain networks to an acute emotional and physiological stressor in a subsample of participants ( N = 92) and to a pharmacological manipulation (hydrocortisone) in an independent crossover study ( N = 27). We found that connectome-based predictive modeling successfully predicted past trauma exposure. The network associated with greater trauma exposure showed high involvement of salience network connections, with model prediction driven by connectivity in the medial frontal cortex, salience network, motor regions, default mode network, and cerebellum. Notably, connectivity in this trauma-predictive network was significantly attenuated following an acute stressor relative to control. A similar pattern was observed in the pharmacology sample, with decreased connectivity under hydrocortisone compared to placebo within this trauma-predictive network. Finally, attenuated trauma-predictive network connectivity after acute stress was associated with lower depressive symptoms in the stress-exposed group, but not control group. These findings suggest that stress may induce blunted connectivity of brain networks related to past traumatic experiences and that the reduced engagement of these trauma-predictive brain networks may facilitate adaptive regulatory response to later stress.",

          "abstract": "Memory generalization allows an organism to adapt to new conditions, but overgeneralization of fear or traumatic experiences can be detrimental to survival and contributes to the development of various mental disorders. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fear memory generalization, especially in the hippocampus, remain largely unknown. In this study, utilizing a well-established mouse model of fear memory generalization, we investigated the role of endocannabinoids (eCBs)-mediated GABAergic synaptic inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in regulating contextual fear memory generalization. Our results revealed that pharmacological or genetic blockade of CB1R in hippocampal CA1 resulted in overgeneralization of contextual fear memory but not fear memory expression. Subsequent investigations in conditional knockout mice revealed the involvement of CB1R in GABAergic neurons, but not those in glutamatergic neurons or astrocytes, in this overgeneralization. In addition, activation of GABA A receptors on pyramidal neurons was required for inducing overgeneralization via AM281, a CB1R antagonist. Neural mechanistic studies showed that eCBs/CB1R signaling regulates both the activity and plasticity of inhibitory synapses during generalization, highlighting the prominence of the disinhibition of CB1R in interneurons during this process. Subsequently, we delved into the downstream effects and found that eCB-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons was regulated by the aforementioned mechanisms. Our findings illustrate that the eCBs/CB1R signaling pathway modulates the balance between fear memory discrimination and generalization by controlling inhibitory inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, accompanied by alterations in excitatory plasticity within this region.",

          "abstract": "HvAACT1 is a major aluminum (Al)-tolerance gene in barley, encoding a citrate transporter that belongs to the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family. This transporter facilitates citrate secretion from the roots, thereby detoxifying external Al ions—a major constraint of crop production on acidic soils. In this study, we present the outward-facing crystal structure of HvAACT1, providing insights into a citrate transport mechanism. The putative citrate binding site consists of three basic residues—K126 in transmembrane helix 2 (TM2), R358 in TM7, and R535 in TM12—creating substantial positive charges in the C-lobe cavity. Proton coupling for substrate transport may involve two pairs of aspartate residues in the N-lobe cavity, one of which corresponds to the essential Asp pair found in prokaryotic H + -coupled MATE transporters belonging to the DinF subfamily. Structural coupling between proton uptake in the N-lobe and citrate extrusion in the C-lobe can be enabled by an extensive, unique hydrogen-bonding network at the extracellular half of the N-lobe. Mutation-based functional analysis, structural comparisons, molecular dynamics simulation, and phylogenic analysis suggest an evolutionary link between citrate MATE transporters and the DinF MATE subfamily. Our findings provide a solid structural basis for citrate transport by HvAACT1 in barley and contribute to a broader understanding of citrate transporter structures in other plant species.",

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH PVN ) control both the neuroendocrine stress axis as well as stress-associated behaviors. However, it is currently unclear how the resting activity of these neurons is coordinated with both spontaneous behavior and ultradian pulses of corticosteroid secretion. To investigate this, we performed fiber photometry recordings of CRH PVN neuron activity in Crh-Ires-Cre mice and a newly generated line of Crh-Ires-Cre rats. In both mice and rats, CRH PVN neurons displayed an ultradian rhythm of activity with reoccurring upstates of activity approximately once per hour over the 24-h day. Upstates in activity were coordinated with increases in animal activity/arousal. Chemogenetic activation of CRH PVN neurons was also sufficient to induce behavioral arousal. In rats, increases in CRH neural activity preceded some pulses of corticosteroid secretion but not others. Thus, while CRH PVN neurons display an ultradian rhythm of activity over the 24-h day that is coordinated with behavioral arousal, the relationship between CRH PVN activity and pulses of corticosteroid secretion is not one-to-one.",

In the high-latitude regions of Northern Europe that are currently subject to rapid climate warming, we lack a comprehensive understanding of faunal biodiversity in the last glacial period due to the extreme rarity of preserved organic remains. Here, we present a stratified sediment deposit with a diverse faunal composition preserved in a bone-bearing layer in Arne Qvamgrotta, part of the Storsteinhola cave system (68.10° N 16.38° E) in Northern Norway. Chronological analyses of sediments and bones including radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, uranium–thorium, and phylogenetic dating place the faunal assemblage in Marine Isotope Stage 5a (MIS 5a, Odderade interstadial, ~85 to 71 ka). Combining comparative osteology and bulk-bone metabarcoding, we identify 46 taxa, including mammals, birds, and fish, with several species not previously found in Fennoscandia. The fauna implies a nonanalogous cold-adapted coastal community, with close proximity to sea ice and nearby freshwater bodies. Mitogenome analyses of a subset of taxa identify extinct lineages which attest to a lack of habitat tracking and the absence of a local refugium during the subsequent fully glaciated periods. This faunal record demonstrates long-term faunal dynamics and coastal environmental conditions during MIS 5a in the European Arctic.",

          "abstract": "Kagome metals have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics due to their potential to host exotic quantum states. Among these, CsV 3 Sb 5 has attracted significant attention for the unusual coexistence of charge density wave (CDW) order and unconventional superconductivity, presenting an ideal system for exploring the emergent phenomena from the interplay of phonons, electronic fluctuations, and topological effects. The nature of CDW formation in CsV 3 Sb 5 is unconventional and has sparked considerable debate. In this study, we examine the origin of the CDW state via ab initio finite-temperature simulations of the lattice dynamics. Through a comparative study of CsV 3 Sb 5 and 2H-NbSe 2 , we demonstrate that the experimental absence of phonon softening—a hallmark of conventional CDW transition—in CsV 3 Sb 5 along with the presence of a weakly first-order transition, can be attributed to quantum zero-point atomic motion. This zero-point motion smears the free energy landscape of CDW, effectively stabilizing the pristine structure even below the CDW transition temperature. We argue that this surprising behavior could cause coexistence of pristine and CDW structures across the transition and lead to a weak first-order transition. Our predicted lattice dynamical behavior is supported by coherent phonon spectroscopy in single-crystalline CsV 3 Sb 5 . Our results provide crucial insights into the formation mechanism of CDW materials that exhibit little to no phonon softening, including cuprates, and highlight the surprising role of quantum effects in emergent properties of relatively heavy-element materials like CsV 3 Sb 5 .",

By solving a total of 15 cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix α0 in the presence of Escherichia coli polar lipid membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: Binding of the N-terminal helix α0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix α0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix-membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends.

Exploring the underlying mechanism, we demonstrate that actin remodeling drives the recruitment of inhibitory ligands, such as HLA-A, -B, and -C, to the synapse. Disrupting HLA interaction with their cognate inhibitory receptors KIRs restores NK cell activation. Using NK cells expressing inhibitory KIR receptors, matched or unmatched to HLA molecules on cancer cells, we show that synaptic F-actin accumulation and matching KIR–HLA interactions jointly suppress NK cell cytotoxicity.

Long-term data have illuminated butterfly declines across geographic regions. However, critical questions remain on how butterfly declines are distributed across species and functional groups, limiting effective conservation. Here, we show unprecedented changes in butterfly biodiversity resulting from 32 y of species levels declines throughout the Midwestern United States. No species increased over the three-decade study period and abundance declined across every functional group (e.g., rare, common, migratory, resident; annual mean trend: −0.9 to −2.3% per year). Species richness declined across all but one functional group, with concomitant increases in evenness (e.g., abundance among species) in several groups resulting from steeper losses in abundance for common species (abundance: −1.9% per year; richness: −0.04% per year) as compared to rare species (abundance: −0.9% per year; richness: −1.33% per year). Our results paint a bleaker picture than other butterfly studies likely due to our long time series of data and ability to include rare species. Such widespread declines undoubtedly affect other trophic levels and ecosystem services. Focusing risk assessments and management interventions only on rare species is likely to be insufficient given broad declines across species, which have fundamentally restructured butterfly communities in the region. As such, conservation efforts should shift focus to species assemblages and entire communities when possible.",

The identification of BKG decarboxylase completes the pentose pathway, in which pentose sugars are produced by decarboxylation of nonphosphorylated hexose precursors. The pathway was present in the unicellular ancestor of animals and is conserved in all deuterostomes, in contrast to the alternative L-ascorbate (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathway. An increased flux toward pentoses may have represented an evolutionary tradeoff, favoring energy metabolism and redox cofactor balance at the expense of ascorbate biosynthesis in organisms, such as humans and other Haplorhini primates, where dietary vitamin C intake prevents scurvy.",

However, there is a paucity of cancer-specific antigens that are endogenously produced. HapImmune™ technology utilizes covalent inhibitors directed to an intracellular cancer driver to create cancer-specific neoantigens in the form of drug–peptide conjugates presented by class I MHC molecules. Our previous study with sotorasib, an FDA-approved covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C), demonstrated that drug-treated cells produce such neoantigens and can be killed by T cell engagers directed against the drug–peptide/MHC complex. Thus, this technology can unite targeted and immune therapies. In the present study, we examined whether this approach could generalize to another FDA-approved KRAS(G12C) inhibitor, adagrasib, whose chemical structure and cysteine reactivity differ substantially from sotorasib. We developed antibodies selective to adagrasib-KRAS(G12C) peptides presented by HLA-A*03 and A*11 that also show cross-reactivity to other KRAS(G12C) inhibitors presented in the same manner. Cryoelectron microscopy structures revealed a mode of adagrasib-peptide/HLA recognition distinctly different from that of sotorasib-directed HapImmune antibodies. The antibodies in a bispecific T cell engager format killed adagrasib-resistant lung cancer cells upon adagrasib treatment. These results support the broad applicability of the HapImmune approach for creating actionable cancer-specific neoantigens and offer candidates for therapeutic development.",

Little is known about how intermediates populated during the folding of larger proteins affect navigation of this more complex landscape. Previously, we reported extremely slow folding rates for the 539 aa β-helical passenger domain of pertactin (P.69T), including conditions that favor the formation of a kinetically trapped, off-pathway partially folded state (PFS). Existence of an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding was speculated but its characterization remained elusive. In this work, we exploited the extremely slow kinetics of PFS unfolding to develop a double-jump “denaturant challenge” assay. With this assay, we identified a transient unfolding intermediate, PFS*, that adopts a similar structure to PFS, including C-terminal folded structure and a disordered N terminus, yet unfolds much more quickly than PFS. Additional experiments revealed that PFS* also functions as an on-pathway intermediate for P.69T folding. Collectively, these results support a C-to-N-terminal model for P.69T folding, with folding initiated in the C-terminus with the rate-limiting formation of the transient on-pathway PFS* intermediate, which sits at the junction of the kinetic competition between folding and misfolding. Notably, processive folding from C-to-N terminus also occurs during C-to-N-terminal translocation of P.69T across the bacterial outer membrane. These results illuminate the crucial role of kinetics when navigating a complex energy landscape for protein folding.",

          "abstract": "The Eoarchean quartz-pyroxene rock from Akilia Island in Greenland has been proposed as one of Earth’s oldest banded iron formations (BIF) and a potential host for the earliest biosignatures. However, the origin of its protolith, whether it metamorphosed from an igneous or sedimentary precursor, remains debated. Here, we revisit this longstanding Akilia controversy using potassium isotope analyses, comparing Akilia samples with BIFs and black shales spanning the Eoarchean to Mesoproterozoic. Our results demonstrate that BIFs and black shales show systematic potassium isotope variations correlated with their potassium contents. Potassium-poor BIF layers display heavier isotopic compositions close to seawater values, whereas clay-rich layers exhibit elevated potassium contents and lighter isotopic signatures. The Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock was initially characterized by low potassium concentrations and heavy potassium isotopic compositions consistent with chemical sediments deposited from ancient seawater. It was subsequently modified by metasomatic fluids derived from nearby metamorphosed igneous rocks. These findings support a sedimentary origin for the Akilia quartz-pyroxene rock. Furthermore, our study provides an isotopic framework for interpreting ancient oceanic environments and offers insights into the potassium cycling and habitability of early Earth.",

          "abstract": "Self-assembly (SA) plays a pivotal role in nanotechnology, offering cost-effective methods for bottom–up fabrication and providing versatile model systems for investigating fundamental interactions in various bioinspired systems. However, current methods for investigating and quantifying the dynamics of SA systems are limited in their applicability to planar interfaces, particularly in liquid environments. These methods typically rely on analyzing the collective behavior of particle suspensions rather than directly probing the specific interactions between individual particles. Here, we introduce Casimir self-assembly (CaSA) as a platform, integrating colloidal science, nanophotonics, and fluctuational electrodynamics to study long-range interactions and stability in planar SA systems. Using thermal fluctuations as a probe and visible-range Fabry–Pérot resonances as an optical readout, we demonstrate that CaSA enables a direct in situ study of the Casimir–Lifshitz electrostatic interaction. This approach allows us to map stability regimes of colloidal materials by varying ionic strength and identifying conditions for stable assembly and aggregation limits, and moreover is used to measure the surface charge density of an individual colloidal object down to fractions of an electron charge per square nanometer. Our platform overcomes the limitations of current methods, providing an experimental tool for exploring SA dynamics in situ and expanding the understanding of suspension stability in liquids at the single-particle level. With potential for future applications, CaSA is scalable for studying interfacial forces and is adaptable to multivalent electrolytes and biosensing.",

          "abstract": "Influenza represents a significant threat with seasonal epidemics that can transition to global pandemics, and cross-species infection presenting a continuous challenge. While vaccines and several antiviral drugs are available, constant genetic changes vitiate these prevention and treatment options. Consequently, we decided to search for inhibitors against one of the virus’s validated drug targets, its M2 channel that is blocked by aminoadamantanes. Regrettably, widespread mutations in M2 abolish the antiflu activity of said blockers. Therefore, we devised bacteria-based genetic assays that can screen for drugs against aminoadamantane-sensitive and resistant M2 channels and map the resistance potential of any identifiable blocker. Subsequent in cellulo testing and structure–activity relationship studies yielded a synergistic combination of two compounds, Theobromine and Arainosine, that exhibited remarkable antiviral activity by directly inhibiting the virus’s channel. The drug duo was potent against H1N1 pandemic swine flu, H5N1 pandemic avian flu, and aminoadamantane-resistant and sensitive strains alike, exhibiting activity that surpassed oseltamivir, the leading antiflu drug on the market. When this drug duo was tested in an animal model, it once more outperformed oseltamivir, considerably reducing disease symptoms and viral RNA progeny. Importantly, harnessing the bacterial genetic selection, we could demonstrate that the drug duo’s potential for eliciting drug resistance is significantly smaller and molecularly distinct from that of aminoadamantanes. In conclusion, the outcome of this study represents a new potential treatment option for influenza alongside an approach that is sufficiently general and readily applicable to other viral targets.",

          "abstract": "The molecular origins of water’s anomalous properties have long been a subject of scientific inquiry. The liquid–liquid phase transition hypothesis, which posits the existence of distinct low-density and high-density liquid states separated by a first-order phase transition terminating at a critical point, has gained increasing experimental and computational support and offers a thermodynamically consistent framework for many of water’s anomalies. However, experimental challenges in avoiding crystallization near the postulated liquid–liquid critical point have focused attention to water’s canonical glassy states: low-density and high-density amorphous ice. Here, we use two Deep Potential machine-learning models, trained on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed density functional and the highly accurate Many-Body Polarizable potential, to conduct an investigation of water’s glassy phenomenology based on quantum mechanical calculations. Despite not being explicitly trained on amorphous ices, both models accurately capture the structure and transformation of the water glasses, including their interconversion along different thermodynamic paths. Isobaric quenching of liquid water at various pressures generates a continuum of intermediate amorphous ices and density fluctuations increase near the liquid–liquid critical pressure. The glass transition temperatures of the amorphous ices produced at different pressures exhibit two distinct branches, corresponding to low-density and high-density amorphous ice behaviors, consistent with experiment and the liquid–liquid transition hypothesis. Extrapolating transformation pressures from isothermal compressions to experimental compression rates brings our simulations into excellent agreement with data. Our findings demonstrate that machine-learning potentials trained on equilibrium phases can effectively model nonequilibrium glassy behavior and pave the way for studying long-timescale, out-of-equilibrium processes with quantum mechanical accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Identifying reaction intermediates is a critical component of elucidating the mechanisms of chemical reactions. Spectroscopic techniques are instrumental in this identification process. The capacity of AI to establish the correlations between spectra and chemical substances renders it a suitable tool for spectra analysis. However, the presence of limited data, or even the absence of data, is a common occurrence for intermediates with transient characteristics. This poses a significant challenge in meeting the data requirements of AI models. Herein, we propose a generalizable machine learning model that utilizes zero-shot learning to identify chemical reaction intermediates by their spectra in unseen catalytic systems. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and visual dimensionality reduction, it was determined that the model’s superior generalizability is attributable to its capacity of learning common patterns of spectra-intermediates, effectively mapping disparate catalytic systems to analogous digital spaces. Therefore, the model can be directly used without fine-tuning parameters for unseen systems even in the presence of noise or solvents. This work demonstrates the application of zero-shot learning in machine learned spectroscopy and illustrates the prediction mechanism, providing a perspective for interpretable and robust cross-system prediction. It lays a solid foundation for the application of spectral descriptors in real reaction systems and the comprehension of chemical reaction mechanisms.",

To focus on the effect of elongated links, we introduce a minimal 3D model that helps us zoom into confined regions of these networks whose distant parts are sequentially connected by the random deposition of physical links with a very large aspect ratio. We show that the nonequilibrium kinetics at which these elongated links, or spaghetti, adhere to the available volume without mutual crossings is logarithmic in time, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions for needle-like packings. We attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a delay in the activation of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict the kinetic scaling characterizing an algebraic growth due to the nucleation of local bundles. Our findings offer a theoretical benchmark to study the local assembly of physical networks, with implications for the modeling of nest-like packings far from equilibrium.",

Despite extensive studies of this organism, the metabolic mechanisms driving its adaptation to varying niches remain elusive. We here gathered genomic resources from 1,807 S. cerevisiae strains and assembled them into a high-quality pangenome, facilitating the comprehensive characterization of genetic diversity across isolates. Utilizing the pangenome, 1,807 strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models (ssGEMs) were generated, which performed well in quantitative predictions of cellular phenotypes, thus helping to examine the metabolic disparities among all S. cerevisiae strains. Integrative analyses of fluxomics and transcriptomics with ssGEMs showcased ubiquitous transcriptional regulation of metabolic flux in specific pathways (i.e., amino acid synthesis) at a population level. Additionally, the gene/reaction inactivation analysis through the ssGEMs refined by transcriptomics showed that S. cerevisiae strains from various ecological niches had undergone reductive evolution at both the genomic and metabolic network levels when compared to wild isolates. Finally, the compiled analysis of the pangenome, transcriptome, and metabolic fluxome revealed remarkable metabolic differences among S. cerevisiae strains originating from distinct oxygen-limited niches, including human gut and cheese environments, and identified convergent metabolic evolution, such as downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Together, these results illustrate how yeast adapts to distinct niches modulated by genomic and metabolic reprogramming, and provide computational resources for translating yeast genotype to fitness in future studies.",

However, there are several interactions whose biological relevance remains obscure, such as the ability of NS1 to bind and activate class IA phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). PI3Ks are highly regulated lipid kinases that act as critical nodes in multiple cell signaling networks and are also important proto-oncogenes. This activation is mediated by NS1 binding specifically to the p85β subunit. To better understand the consequences of this interaction, we developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to selectively track the different PI3K heterodimers and, using this system, we found that NS1 induces an isoform-specific relocation and activation of the different PI3K heterodimers. We found that clinically relevant oncogenic mutations in both catalytic and regulatory subunits of PI3K could mimic the effect caused by NS1, and partially rescue the loss of viral fitness in a recombinant virus encoding a p85β-binding deficient NS1.",

To date, the only structurally characterized XSS is benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS), which functionalizes toluene. A distinct subclass of XSSs acts on saturated hydrocarbons, which possess much stronger C(sp 3 )–H bonds than toluene, suggesting mechanistic and structural differences from BSS. Here, we use cryogenic electron microscopy to determine the structure of one such enzyme, (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (MASS) from Azoarcus strain HxN1, which functionalizes n -alkanes (C6–C8). The structure reveals an asymmetric dimer in which both sides contain a catalytic α-subunit and accessory γ-subunit. One α-subunit also binds two additional subunits, β and δ. The β-subunit binds a [4Fe–4S] cluster and adopts a fold similar to BSSβ. The β-subunit appears to regulate the flexibility of the α-subunit to enable opening of the active site, affording the binding of n -alkane substrates. The δ-subunit, which lacks homology to known GRE subunits, adopts a rubredoxin-like fold that binds a single Fe ion, an architecture not previously reported for GREs. MASSδ occupies the same region of the α-subunit as the activating enzyme (AE) and may regulate the conformational changes required for glycyl radical installation. Structural comparisons between MASS and BSS reveal differences in how fumarate is bound and show amino acid substitutions that could account for the binding of alkanes versus toluene. Together, this structure offers insight into anaerobic alkane activation via fumarate addition.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria and phages have been in an ongoing arms race for billions of years. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counterdefense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counterdefense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed “pan-immune” system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka–Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counterdefense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counterdefense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a “dying” strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain. This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the “island migration” model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.",

          "abstract": "During development, groups of cells generate shape by coordinating their mechanical properties through an interplay of self-organization and prepatterning. Hydra displays a striking planar pattern of actin fibers at the organism scale, and mechanics influence the morphogenesis of biological structures during its prepatterned regeneration. However, how mechanics participate in the formation of an ordered pattern from a totally disordered state remains unknown. To study this, we used cellular aggregates formed from dissociated Hydra cells, which initially lose all actin polarity yet regenerate a long-range actin pattern. We showed quantitatively that the actin meshwork evolves from a disordered symmetric state to an ordered state in which rotational symmetry is broken, and translation symmetry is partially broken, with the nematic and smectic order parameters increasing over days. During the first hours, the actin meshwork displayed spatial heterogeneity in the nematic order parameter, and ordered domains separated by line defects progressively grew and fused. This suggests that local cell–cell interactions drive the transition from disorder to order. To understand the mechanism of ordering, we perturbed the tissue’s physical constraints. We showed that while topology and geometry do not have a direct effect, anisotropic stretch biases the emerging orientation of the actin meshwork within hours. Surprisingly, although a Wnt head organizer is expected to play a role in the actin ordering, the stretch-associated alignment happened without the prior formation of a head organizer. This demonstrates the role of tissue mechanics in the alignment of the actin fibers during the disorder-to-order transition.",

We generated dicer-like 5 ( dcl5 ) mutants in durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum 2n = 4× = 28; AABB), revealing temperature-sensitive genic male sterility. Loss of DCL5 depleted premeiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNA production, correlating with sterility under standard growth conditions and partial fertility recovery at higher temperatures. A single functional DCL5 allele restored complete fertility, presenting a promising alternative to current methods for hybrid production. We demonstrate that premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNA biogenesis is independent of miRNA-mediated cleavage and driven by a conserved motif initiating DCL5 activity. In the dcl5 mutant developing under sterility-inducing conditions, developmental defects are observed during pollen maturation, rather than at peak 24-nt phasiRNA accumulation in premeiotic and meiotic anthers. Although no visible morphological abnormalities were apparent during early development, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that dcl5 mutant cells exhibit transcriptional profiles distinct from those of wild-type cells, when premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs are accumulating at the early developmental stage. Finally, the coexpression of Argonaute ( AGO1b , AGO4a, and AGO6 ) homeologs in 24-nt phasiRNA-producing cells identifies candidate effectors and suggests a role for 24-nt phasiRNAs in transcriptional gene silencing.",

However, this notion has proven difficult to test given the overall uncertainty about both geographic locations and paleoclimates of ancestral species. By the resolution of both challenges, we reveal that early primates dispersed and radiated in higher latitudes, through diverse climates, including cold, arid, and temperate conditions. Contrary to expectations of the warm tropical forest hypothesis, warmer global temperatures had no effect on dispersal distances or the speciation rate. Rather, the amount of change in local temperature and precipitation substantially predicted geographic and species diversity. Our results suggest that nontropical, changeable environments exerted strong selective pressures on primates with higher dispersal ability – promoting the primate radiation and their subsequent colonization of tropical climates millions of years after their origin.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the ability of bacteria to develop antibiotic resistance is challenging, especially for the vast majority of species for which no experimental data are available. Here, we investigated the evolvability and intrinsic presence of rifampicin resistance across the bacterial tree of life. We compiled a comprehensive panel of known rifampicin resistance mutations, comprising 57 amino acid substitutions within the gene rpoB . We then screened more than 18,000 genomes from all major bacterial groups for the presence of those mutations and determined which mutations can evolve through point mutations. Our results demonstrate that although the evolvability of individual mutations varies considerably across species, overall predicted evolvability is high and relatively homogeneous across bacterial taxa. Rifampicin resistance mutations are present intrinsically in 8% of species that tend to be phylogenetically clustered. Our analysis provides a global picture of the mutational landscape of rifampicin resistance, affording insight into existing observations and informing future discoveries such as the identification of probiotics.",

Moreover, transcriptomic data reveal that many conspecific viruses of PONV1 occur in Pacific oysters from Europe and the Pacific coasts of Asia and North America.

However, the template RNA species that undergoes RAN translation endogenously remains unclear. Using long-read based 5′ RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ Repeat-RLM-RACE), we identified C9orf72 transcripts initiating within intron 1 in a C9BAC mouse model, patient-derived iNeurons, and iNeuron-derived polysomes. These cryptic m 7 G-capped mRNAs are at least partially polyadenylated and are more abundant than transcripts derived from intron retention or circular intron lariats. In RAN translation reporter assays, intronic template transcripts–even those with short (32 nucleotide) leaders–exhibited robust expression compared to exon–intron and repeat-containing lariat reporters. To assess endogenous repeat-containing lariat RNA contributions to RAN translation, we enhanced endogenous lariat stability by knocking down the lariat debranching enzyme Dbr1. However, this modulation did not impact DPR production in patient-derived iNeurons. These findings identify cryptic, linear, m 7 G-capped intron-initiating C9orf72 mRNAs as an endogenous template for RAN translation and DPR production, with implications for disease pathogenesis and therapeutic development.",

Type II anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) inhibit and control Cas9 but are generally impermeable to the cell membrane due to their size and anionic charge. Moreover, existing Acr delivery methods are long-lived and operate within hours (e.g., viral and nonviral vectors) or require external devices (e.g., electroporation), limiting therapeutic applications. To address these problems, we developed a protein-based anti-CRISPR delivery platform, LF N -Acr/PA, which delivers Acrs into cells within minutes. LF N -Acr/PA is a nontoxic, two-component protein system derived from anthrax toxin, where protective antigen (PA) proteins bind receptors widespread in human cells, forming a pH-triggered endosomal pore that an engineered Acr (LF N -Acr) binds and uses to enter the cell. In the presence of PA, LF N -Acr enters human cells (e.g., immortalized cell lines, embryonic stem cells, and 3D cell cultures) at concentrations as low as 2.5 pM to inhibit up to 95% of Cas9-mediated knockout, knock-in, transcriptional activation, and base editing. Timing LF N -Acr delivery reduces off-target base editing and increases Cas9 specificity by 41%. LF N -Acr/PA is the most potent known cell-permeable CRISPR-Cas inhibition system, significantly improving the utility of CRISPR for genome editing.",

          "abstract": "Changes in oceanic circulation and carbon storage have been implicated as important drivers of atmospheric pCO 2 variability during the last glacial cycle (0 to 150 ka), though consensus on the mechanisms responsible remains elusive due to sparse marine carbonate chemistry reconstructions. Here, we present vertical profiles of carbonate ion concentration ([CO 3 2 − ]) from the Southwest Atlantic to investigate oceanic carbon sequestration during key intervals of atmospheric CO 2 change. During the first major decline in atmospheric CO 2 (115 to 109 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred in the abyssal Atlantic (&gt;3,500 m water depth). During the second decline in CO 2 (72 to 68 ka), enhanced carbon storage occurred throughout the deep Atlantic (&gt;2,000 m water depth). Paired with δ 13 C and δ 18 O vertical profiles from the same locations, the [CO 3 2 − ] results suggest progressively greater sequestration of biological carbon occurred in the South Atlantic as the volume of Southern Source Water expanded during glacial inception. Shoaling of the carbonate ion saturation horizon during the second decline in pCO 2 resulted in seafloor calcium carbonate dissolution and enhanced alkalinity, likely contributing to further draw down of atmospheric CO 2 . We also document carbon release from the deep South Atlantic during glacial Terminations I and II when atmospheric CO 2 was rising. Overall, our results highlight the tight linkage between pCO 2 and deep Atlantic carbon storage over the last glacial cycle.",

          "abstract": "Air-breathing vertebrates incorporate a fraction of isotopically anomalous air O 2 in their body water. The 17 O isotope anomaly of air O 2 (expressed as Δ’ 17 O air ) is related to atmospheric CO 2 concentrations ( p CO 2 ) and gross primary production (GPP). Tooth enamel records the Δ’ 17 O of body water and can thus preserve such paleo- p CO 2 or paleo-GPP information over geological time periods. Here, we demonstrate the potential of respective reconstructions of atmospheric p CO 2 or GPP from the triple oxygen isotope composition of fossil dinosaur tooth enamel. The data from unaltered enamel samples, along with an assumed modern GPP t /GPP 0 ratio of 1 for the Mesozoic, suggest a mean Late Jurassic p CO 2 = 1,200 ± 150 ppmv and Late Cretaceous p CO 2 = 750 ± 200 ppmv. These estimates are in good agreement with other p CO 2 proxy data for the same time intervals. When utilizing a p CO 2 inferred from other proxies, tooth enamel Δ’ 17 O PO4 may also serve as a proxy for GPP. Using published p CO 2 data, we reconstructed GPP t /GPP 0 ratios with 1.20 ± 0.17 for the Late Jurassic and 2.24 ± 0.96 for the Late Cretaceous, which would imply a 20 to 120% higher GPP in the Mesozoic than today. Overall, triple oxygen isotope analysis of fossil teeth of terrestrial amniotes can provide insights into past atmospheric greenhouse gas content and global primary productivity.",

Through RNA-seq analysis of primary brain glial cells, we identified immune-responsive gene 1 ( Irg1 ) as one of the highly upregulated genes under inflammatory conditions. Validation in the spinal cords of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a preclinical MS model, confirmed elevated Irg1 levels in myeloid, CD4, and B cells in the EAE group, raising concerns as to whether Irg1 is detrimental or protective. Irg1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited severe EAE disease, increased mononuclear cell infiltration, and increased levels of triple-positive CD4+ T cells expressing IL17a, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. Adoptive transfer in Rag-1 KO and single-cell RNA sequencing highlighted the crucial role of Irg1 in shaping pathogenic Th17 cells. A lack of Irg1 in macrophages elevates Class II expression, promoting the polarization of myelin-primed CD4+ T cells into pathogenic Th17 cells via the NLRP3/IL-1β axis. Moreover, bone marrow chimeras revealed that immune cells lacking Irg1 maintained pathogenic and inflammatory phenotypes, suggesting its protective role in autoimmune diseases, including MS.",

Although several archaeal filament types have been characterized in considerable detail, many remain understudied, particularly those utilizing noncanonical secretion systems. Here, we describe the Tafi bundling pilus that facilitates biofilm formation in the haloarchaeon Natrinema sp. J7-2. Unlike previously characterized archaeal pili, Tafi is secreted via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, which transports fully folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Structural analysis reveals that although Tafi pili assemble via a canonical strand-donation mechanism, the pilin subunit (TafE) adopts a distinct structural topology that sets it apart from the previously characterized Sec-dependent pilins that form bundling pili in archaea. Sequence analyses show that TafE homologs are also present in thermophilic archaea from different phyla, but Tat-signal sequences are exclusive to pilins of halophilic archaea. Nevertheless, we find that Tat signal peptides in haloarchaeal TafE-like pili were exchanged back to the Sec signal peptides on multiple independent occasions. These findings expand our understanding of the diversity and evolution of archaeal extracellular filaments and highlight the Tat pathway as a route for pilus assembly in halophilic archaea.",

          "abstract": "The acrosome is a crucial organelle essential for sperm function and male fertility. During acrosome biogenesis, numerous proacrosomal vesicles (PAVs) are transported to the concave region of the nuclear membrane and fuse to form the acrosome. However, the mechanisms governing the fusion of PAVs to form the acrosome remain poorly understood. Here, we identify endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator 1 (ELAPOR1), a conserved protein, as a key factor in PAVs fusion during acrosome biogenesis. Male mice lacking Elapor1 ( Elapor1 −/− ) are infertile, exhibiting defective acrosome biogenesis and a globozoospermia-like phenotype. Using cryo-electron microscopy revealed that ELAPOR1 forms a square planar homodimer in cis, which assembles into a trans-tetramer via head-to-head homophilic interactions dependent on copper chelation. Notably, ELAPOR1 exhibits dual membrane orientation, with a predicted N in − C out topology and a noncanonical N out − C in topology in vesicles. The noncanonical N out − C in topology enables ELAPOR1 to function as a tethering factor bridging vesicles through head-to-head homophilic interactions. A mutant ELAPOR1 (ELAPOR1 4HA ) incapable of copper chelation forms cis homodimers but fails to mediate homophilic interactions in vitro, leading to defective PAVs fusion in mice, phenocopying the Elapor1 -deficient mice. Additionally, ELAPOR1 was shown to interact with soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors protein STX12. Conditional knockout of Stx12 in germ cells resulted in similar defects in acrosome biogenesis. Collectively, our findings suggest that ELAPOR1 functions as a tethering factor that regulates PAV fusion through a copper-dependent mechanism.",

Various factors affect the extent of load, such as population size and breeding system, but other important determinants remain unexplored. In particular, whole-genome duplication (WGD)—a pervasive macromutation occurring broadly across Eukaryotes—remains poorly understood in terms of its impact on neutral and selective processes within populations. Using iterative forward simulations and empirical analysis of 632 short- and 16 long-read sequenced individuals of Arabidopsis arenosa (in 23 diploid and 42 natural autotetraploid populations), we measure the effects of WGD on genome-wide diversity and mutation load. Our simulations show how genetic variation gradually rises in autotetraploids due to increased mutational target size. Moreover, mutation load increases due to relaxed purifying selection as ploidies rise, when deleterious mutations are masked by additional chromosome copies. Empirical data confirm these patterns, showing significant increases in nucleotide diversity, ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNPs, and numbers of indels and large structural variants in A. arenosa autotetraploids. However, a rather modest increase in load proxies together with a broad distribution and niche of autotetraploids suggests load accumulation has not yet limited their successful expansion. Overall, we demonstrate a complex interplay between neutral processes and purifying selection in shaping genetic variation following WGD and highlight ploidy as an important determinant of mutation load, genetic diversity, and therefore adaptive potential in natural populations.",

          "abstract": "DNA loop extrusion by cohesin has emerged as a critical pathway for chromosome organization. In vitro single-molecule experiments indicate that loop extrusion requires the assembly of a heteropentameric complex consisting of the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer, STAG1, NIPBL, and the kleisin SCC1. The complexity of the complete extrusion machinery, consisting of multiple subunits, DNA binding sites, and ATPases poses substantial challenges for revealing the underlying biomolecular mechanism. As a result, a number of different models have been proposed, many of which do not agree on key mechanistic aspects, such as the details of DNA loading, holoenzyme assembly, or the consequences of ATP binding and hydrolysis. Here, we use mass photometry to comprehensively quantify all the key biomolecular interactions required for DNA loop extrusion. We find that STAG1 binds tightly to the trimeric complex formed by the SMC1/SMC3 heterodimer and SCC1, and together they weakly, but cooperatively, bind the DNA. Full-length NIPBL tightly binds DNA, acting as a DNA anchor during the mechanochemical loop extrusion cycle. Cohesin mutants incapable of head engagement, and those lacking DNA-binding domains in the ATPase heads show negligible differences in overall DNA-affinity, suggesting a minor role of these features for DNA binding. Instead, we find an ATP-modulated DNA binding site created by the interaction of STAG1 with SMC1/SMC3/SCC1, important for repeated grabbing and release of DNA critical to extrusion. Our results call for a careful reexamination of the proposed mechanisms and set energetic boundaries for future proposals.",

Whether this functional coupling is universally conserved across eukaryotes is unclear. Here, we show using long read RNA sequencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that splicing inactivation does not result in widespread CPA impairment, and that inactivation of CPA has limited impact on splicing efficiency. The negative impact of CPA inactivation on splicing is mainly due to transcription termination defects that promote readthrough transcription, leading to splicing inhibition for downstream intron-containing genes. The deleterious effect of 5′ extensions on splicing is length-dependent and can be detected independently from CPA inactivation for endogenous or synthetic genes. Deficient termination can also promote usage of cryptic splice sites and long-range intergenic splicing events. These results argue against a broad coupling between splicing and CPA in S. cerevisiae but show that efficient CPA-mediated transcription termination is critical for splicing fidelity and efficiency in a compact genome.",

          "abstract": "The link between characteristic coherent structures and their statistical properties in turbulent flows remains largely unclear and is thus a central bottleneck for a better understanding of turbulent flows. Here, we demonstrate this link for the important problem of thermal convection. We show how the hierarchical plume network in the near-wall region of the flow, which becomes increasingly sparse with increasing distance away from the wall, is connected to the marginal stability of the thermal boundary layer and the resulting global heat transport. Our results, which are based on a series of direct numerical simulations for Rayleigh numbers up to R a = 10 11 in a relatively shallow layer, suggest a highly fluctuating thermal boundary layer that is composed of local building blocks in terms of plumes, which are the essential drivers of turbulent heat transport. These thermal plumes are found in a dynamically perpetual process of formation and aggregation that can be described, particularly well for Rayleigh numbers R a ≳ 10 9 , by a von Smoluchowski equation resulting in a gamma distribution of the local plume spacing, consistent with measurements. Similarity manifests with respect to the horizontal extension of the network, the vertical hierarchical plume clustering away from the wall and the number of plumes, over an order of magnitude of the thermal boundary layer thickness. Our findings suggest the dominance of dynamical local processes near the wall, rather than a global boundary layer instability.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the expression of CD45 isoforms on human yellow fever virus vaccine (YFV-17D) specific CD8 T cells longitudinally after vaccination. As expected, effector CD8 T cells at day 14 express CD45RO but within 4 to 6 wk these virus-specific CD8 T cells become CD45RA positive and remain CD45RA for &gt;10 y. The journey for these YFV-specific CD8 T cells goes from naive (CD45RA+ CCR7+) to effector/effector memory (CD45RO+ CCR7−) to Temra (CD45RA+ CCR7−) to stem-cell memory (CD45RA+ CCR7+). These YFV-specific CD8 T cells rarely acquire the canonical Tcm phenotype (CD45RO+ CCR7+). This CD45RO to RA switch coincides with clearance of YFV, so we hypothesized that antigen may be playing a role in regulating CD45 expression. We addressed this issue by ex vivo analysis and provide evidence that this switch is indeed regulated by antigen. Sorted YFV-specific CD45RO effector CD8 T cells reexpress CD45RA when cultured ex vivo in the absence of antigen and retain CD45RO in the presence of cognate peptide. We also extended these ex vivo analysis to human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific CD8 T cells and show that CD45RO cells transition to CD45RA in the absence of antigen and CD45RA cells become CD45RO when stimulated with CMV peptide. We then show that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike-specific CD8 T cells can repeatedly undergo the same CD45RA to RO to RA transition in vivo after the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Again, the canonical Tcm phenotype spike-specific memory CD8 T cells were not readily detectable. These studies warrant a reevaluation of how human memory CD8 T cells are defined.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are noninvasive genetically encodable probes that have revolutionized bioimaging and health fields with vivid images and an ever-growing repertoire from jellyfish to sea anemones and corals. Inside the protein matrix, chromophore nonplanarity and flexibility have long been argued to govern the fluorescence efficiency of FPs, yet their fundamental roles and relative importance have been elusive which hinder the rational design of versatile FPs and biosensors. Herein, we tackle this central question by investigating two recently engineered FP-based turn-on chloride (Cl – ) sensors, ChlorON1 and 3, using an ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopic toolset together with advanced multireference simulations for both structure and spectrum. We elucidate that fluorescence enhancement of the chloride-bound ChlorON3 stems from a substantially more twisted chromophore than ChlorON1 via comprehensive simulations starting from the available crystal structure of parent protein (mNeonGreen), also featuring an enhanced radiative pathway due to an adjacent leucine residue in the emissive population. This finding indicates that the commonly stated chromophore planarity is not, but conformational rigidity is, the decisive factor for high fluorescence efficiency. Such mechanistic insights into FPs are generalizable to chromoproteins and other photosensitive biomolecules, which can facilitate the targeted design of brighter and/or tunable biosensors.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is the origin of a novel tissue that attracts resources, spreads beyond boundaries, avoids normal controls, and escapes immunity. How does a novel tissue arise? The puzzle is that two seemingly different processes appear to be the primary driving force. On the one hand, overwhelming evidence links (epi)genetic driver mutations to the origin and progression of tumors. Common oncogenic mutations such as KRAS accelerate cell division, and common knockouts of tumor suppressors such as TP53 abrogate cell death or checks on cell division. On the other hand, cancerous tissues create complex traits that require intricate changes in cells and multiple interactions between different cell types. Such novelty often arises by hijacking the developmental plasticity that normally creates the diverse cells and tissues of our bodies from a single original zygotic cell. How can we reconcile the simple genetic changes in carcinogenesis with the complex developmental plasticity that creates novel tissues? This perspective advocates a new model. (Epi)genetic mutations release developmental plasticity. That developmental plasticity creates novel cellular interactions and complex tissues. Initially, novel traits created by developmental plasticity may not be stably heritable, thus subsequent (epi)genetic changes must stabilize the phenotypic novelty. Recent studies show how classic oncogenic and tumor suppressor driver mutations, such as KRAS and TP53 , may primarily act in early carcinogenesis as broad releasers of developmental plasticity rather than as stimulators of cell division or knockout of limitations on cellular clonal expansion. In the new model, genetics releases, plasticity creates, and genetics stabilizes.",

          "abstract": "Proteins that transmit molecules and signals across the plasma membrane are crucial in cell biology because they enable cells to sense and respond to their surroundings. A major challenge for studying cell surface proteins is that often they do not fold or traffic properly to the plasma membrane when produced in heterologous cells. We developed a strategy for quantifying surface localization from fluorescence microscopy images of surface-stained cells. Using clustered protocadherins, a protein family important for cell–cell recognition during neuronal development, we found that surface delivery levels vary among clustered protocadherin isoforms and between wild-type and engineered variants. Quantifying these differences provides evidence that cis dimerization is not tightly coupled to surface delivery for clustered protocadherins. This work establishes a generalizable framework for screening proteins and variants of interest for proper cell surface localization.",

Current treatments are limited to supplemental and/or hyperbaric oxygen to accelerate CO elimination. Even with oxygen therapy, nearly half of CO poisoning survivors suffer long-term cardiac and neurocognitive deficits related to slow CO clearance, highlighting a need for point of care antidotal therapies. Given the natural interaction between CO and ferrous heme, we hypothesized that the hemoprotein RcoM, a transcriptional regulator of microbial CO metabolism, would make an ideal platform for CO-selective scavenging from endogenous hemoproteins. We engineered an RcoM truncate (RcoM-HBD-CCC) that exhibits high CO affinity ( K a,CO = 2.8 × 10 10 M −1 ), remarkable selectivity for CO over oxygen ( K a,O2 = 1.4 × 10 5 M −1 ; K a,CO / K a,O2 = 1.9 × 10 5 ), thermal stability (T m = 72 °C), and slow autoxidation rate ( k ox = 1.1 h −1 ). In a murine model of acute CO poisoning, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC accelerated CO clearance from hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs) and was rapidly excreted in urine. Moreover, infused RcoM-HBD-CCC elicited minimal hypertension in mice compared to infused globins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin), attributed to a comparatively limited reactivity toward nitric oxide (NO) via dioxygenation [ k NOD (RcoM) = 6 to 8 × 10 6 M −1 s −1 vs k NOD (Hb) = 6 to 8 × 10 7 M −1 s −1 ]. These data suggest that RcoM-HBD-CCC is a safe, selective, and efficacious CO scavenger. By limiting hypertension through minimal NO scavenging, RcoM-HBD-CCC improves end-organ adverse effects compared with other hemoprotein-based therapeutics.",

The basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum (CBL) are integral for processing performance outcomes, yet their functional interactions remain underexplored. We scanned participants’ brains with functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) while they performed a skilled motor task for monetary rewards, where outcomes depended on their motor performance and probabilistic events that were not contingent on their performance. Successful motor outcomes increased activity in the ventral striatum (VS), a functional subregion of the BG, whereas unsuccessful motor outcomes engaged the CBL. In contrast, for probabilistic outcomes unrelated to motor performance, the BG and CBL exhibited no differences in activity between successful and unsuccessful outcomes. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that VS-to-CBL connectivity was inhibitory following successful motor outcomes, suggesting that the VS may suppress CBL error processing for correct actions. Conversely, CBL-to-VS connectivity was inhibitory after unsuccessful motor outcomes, potentially preventing reinforcement of erroneous actions. Additionally, interindividual differences in task preference, assessed by having participants choose between performing the motor task or flipping a coin for monetary rewards, were related to inhibitory VS-CBL connectivity. These findings highlight a performance-mediated functional network between the VS and CBL, modulated by motivation and subjective preferences, that supports goal-directed behavior.",

While previous research has shown that neuronal activity can regulate ribosome localization and modify translation rates, little is known about ribosomal assembly within neuronal processes. Here, we investigated the potential for local ribosome maturation in rat neurons using proteomics, RNA sequencing, and imaging methods. We detected an abundance of ribosome biogenesis factors in distal neuronal compartments, particularly those associated with the late stages of ribosome assembly. Moreover, we detected cytosolic pre-ribosomal RNA species in dendrites, as well as the enzymes necessary for their processing, suggesting that local ribosome maturation can occur far from the nucleus. These findings challenge conventional models that confine ribosome biogenesis to nuclear and perinuclear regions and suggest that neurons may fine-tune local protein synthesis by regulating ribosome assembly near synaptic sites. This mechanism may enable rapid modulation of the translational capacity in response to physiological changes, regulating synaptic plasticity and local protein synthesis in neurons.",

Simplified models must negotiate a tradeoff between tractability, predictive power, and ease of interpretation. We present a modeling paradigm for estimating predictive, mechanistic models of neurons and small circuits that navigates these issues using methods from systems theory. The key insight is that membrane currents can be modeled using two scalable system components optimized for learning: linear state space models, and nonlinear artificial neural networks. Combining these components, we construct two types of membrane currents: lumped currents, which are flexible, and data-driven conductance-based currents, which are interpretable. The resulting class of models—which we call recurrent mechanistic models (RMMs)—can be trained in a matter of seconds to minutes on intracellular recordings during an electrophysiology experiment, representing a step change in performance over previous approaches. As a proof-of-principle, we use RMMs to learn the dynamics of two groups of neurons, and their synaptic connections, in the Stomatogastric Ganglion, a well-known central pattern generator. Due to their reliability, efficiency, and interpretability, RMMs enable qualitatively new kinds of experiments using predictive models in closed-loop neurophysiology and online estimation of neural properties in living preparations.",

EMP2 has previously been shown to directly associate with focal adhesion kinase, which links cell junction forces to signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, migration, and wound healing.

As arousal state and noradrenergic signaling affect CSF-ISF clearance, we chose patients with NT1 as a human orexin-targeted model of sleep-related pathology bridging the gap between healthy awake and sleep with respect to CSF flow pulsations. We also investigated the sensitivity of magnetic resonance encephalography to detect flow with a phantom model and sought to replicate earlier pulsation findings in sleep. In this case–control study, we used fast functional MRI to map brain pulsations in groups of healthy sleeping controls (n = 13), healthy awake controls (n = 79), and awake NT1 (n = 21) patients. We measured the very low frequency (0.008 to 0.1) and cardiorespiratory frequencies and calculated in each frequency band the coefficient of variation, spectral power, and full band spectral entropy to obtain brain pulsation maps. We uncovered a brain pulsation profile from healthy waking to sleep to a sleep-related pathology NT1 prominently affected in the vascular-related vasomotor and brain arterial pulsations. Our results established how drivers of brain hydrodynamics are affected by a specific loss of key neurotransmitter governing arousal compared to healthy sleep. We also showed with a phantom model that MREG is sensitive to flow-related signal changes and solidified evidence of brain pulsations in the healthy states of sleep and wakefulness.",

Here, we focus on the white shark, for which female philopatry has been previously proposed, and produced a chromosome-level genome, high-coverage whole-genome autosomal, and uniparental datasets to investigate mitonuclear discordance. We first reconstructed the historical population demography of the species based on autosomal data. We show that this species once comprised a single panmictic population, which experienced a steady decline until recent times when it fragmented into at least three main autosomal genetic groups. Mitochondrial data depict a strikingly different picture, inconsistent with the spatial distribution of autosomal diversity. Using the demographic scenario established from autosomal data, we performed coalescent and forward simulations to test for the occurrence of female philopatry. Coalescent simulations showed that the model can reproduce the autosomal variability, confirming its robustness. A forward simulation framework was further built to explicitly account for a sex-biased reproduction model and track both autosomal and uniparental markers (Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA). While our model generates data that are consistent with the observed Y chromosome variation, the mitochondrial pattern is never reproduced even under extreme female philopatry (no female migration), strongly suggesting that demography alone cannot explain the mitonuclear discordance. Our framework could, and perhaps should, be extended to other shark species where philopatry has been suggested. It is possible that the proposed widespread occurrence of female philopatry in sharks should be revisited.",

Here, we show that when introduced into mice, this substitution causes substrates of the enzyme to accumulate in amounts that correlate negatively with ADSL expression levels. In the brain, where the expression of the enzyme is low, the substitution results in particularly high substrate levels. When the behavior of the mice is analyzed, female mice expressing the modern human-like version of ADSL access water more efficiently for drinking than their wild-type littermates. In addition to the amino acid substitution, a haplotype in the ADSL gene occurs at a carrier frequency of &gt;97% in present-day humans and exhibits evidence of positive selection. It is associated with less ADSL expression as well as with increased concentrations of succinyladenosine, one of the substrates of the enzyme, in cerebrospinal fluid.

          "abstract": "We investigate the impact of glycoform alterations on the dynamic structure of the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc region using integrated computational and experimental approaches. Four distinct IgG1-Fc glycoforms, varying in core fucosylation and nonreducing terminal galactosylation, were generated through a combination of cell engineering and in vitro enzymatic reactions. Stable-isotope-assisted NMR spectroscopy, incorporating both glycan and protein signals, revealed that galactosylation induces chemical shift perturbations extending from the glycan–protein interface to the C H 2–C H 3 domain boundary. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the absence of galactose enhances the mobility of both the glycan and the C H 2 domain, broadening the conformational landscape of the Fc quaternary structure. This increased flexibility likely contributes to a greater entropic penalty upon binding to effector molecules, which constrain the Fc in an asymmetric conformation. Conversely, the effects of fucosylation are more localized, primarily influencing the dynamics of residues involved in Fcγ receptor IIIa binding. These findings provide atomic-level insights into the distinct yet synergistic mechanisms by which galactosylation and fucosylation modulate IgG1-Fc dynamics and effector functions, offering crucial information for the optimization of therapeutic antibodies.",

          "abstract": "Different types of genomic conflicts are possible in plants with multiovulate ovaries that produce multiseeded fruits: between the maternal plant and its offspring, among developing seeds, between paternal and maternal genomes over seed development, and among paternal parents if different parents sire seeds within an ovary. We tested the hypothesis that such conflicts in multiseeded fruits can be reduced if seeds are sired by a single pollen parent. We conducted a meta-analysis of paternity in 63 species across diverse plant families to assess paternity within fruits. Our results reveal that almost 50% of flowering plant species with multiseeded fruits have a single pollen parent. Our results question the prevailing notion that multiple paternity of seeds within fruits is widespread, especially when, in addition to single paternity in multiseeded fruits, a large number of species have single-seeded fruits. We provide insights into the role of sibling rivalry and kin selection in driving genetic relatedness of seeds within fruits. Equally important, the observation of monogamy at the level of flowers is in line with the mating patterns observed in animals.",

The scale and intensity of change are triggering a host of novel interventions to sustain oceans and ocean-dependent societies.

Responsible transformation entails transitioning marine systems to sustainable, equitable, and adaptive states through weighing intervention risks against benefits, resolving ethical liabilities, improving social cobenefits, establishing legitimacy, and managing climate policy integrity. Global, national, and local actors must urgently convert responsible transformation principles into rules—and practice—to ensure that novel marine-climate interventions are safe, equitable, and effective.",

          "abstract": "Precise mechanical manipulation of molecules is inherently difficult owing to random thermal motion. Although directed movement on the molecular scale has been achieved, using it to impose specific—especially energetically disfavored—shapes on molecules and construct mechanically interlocked structures remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, we report the synthesis of a catenane enabled by a molecular motor that winds molecular strands into discrete entangled structures, each defined by a specific number of mechanical crossings. Light energy drives unidirectional motor rotation, enabling path-dependent control over a sequence of thermodynamically disfavored yet mechanically distinct and kinetically stable winding states, which are covalently captured and subsequently released to yield a catenane. This machine-directed approach offers a general proof-of-concept strategy for the template-free construction of mechanically interlocked molecules.",

Genomic analyses revealed topologically associated domains (TADs) enriched for convergent changes in hibernators, including the Fat Mass &amp; Obesity ( Fto ) locus. In this TAD, we uncovered genetic circuits for metabolic responses and hibernation-linked cis elements forming regulatory contacts with neighboring genes. Deletions of individual cis elements in mice differentially altered Fto , Irx3 , and Irx5 expression, reshaping downstream gene expression programs and affecting metabolism, torpor, obesogenesis, and foraging in distinct ways. Our findings show how convergent evolution in hibernators pinpoints functional genetic mechanisms of metabolic control, with multiple effects encoded in single CREs.",

One such phase exists only at fields greater than 40 tesla, a considerable scale given its critical temperature of only 2 K. Here, we extend measurements of this state with fields outside of the bc crystallographic plane and reveal its core structure: The superconducting phase wraps around the b axis in a halo-like fashion and appears to be stabilized by a field component perpendicular to the magnetic easy axis. This angle dependence points to a multicomponent spin-triplet order parameter with a finite angular momentum of the Cooper pairs.

Surface acoustic waves were then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the gigahertz regime. We observed evidence that the surface acoustic waves produced mechanical deformations in the polymer and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics led to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning.

          "abstract": "Increasing drought pressure under anthropogenic climate change may jeopardize the potential of tropical forests to capture carbon in woody biomass and act as a long-term carbon dioxide sink. To evaluate this risk, we assessed drought impacts in 483 tree-ring chronologies from across the tropics and found an overall modest stem growth decline (2.5% with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2 to 2.7%) during the 10% driest years since 1930. Stem growth declines exceeded 10% in 25% of cases and were larger at hotter and drier sites and for gymnosperms compared with angiosperms. Growth declines generally did not outlast drought years and were partially mitigated by growth stimulation in wet years. Thus, pantropical forest carbon sequestration through stem growth has hitherto shown drought resilience that may, however, diminish under future climate change.",

Detecting behavioral drive in the fossil record is challenging because it is difficult to measure behaviors independently from corresponding morphologies. To solve this problem, we focused on a puzzling behavior in the fossil record of some primates: eating graminoid plants. We report carbon and oxygen isotope ratios from fossil cercopithecid monkeys and integrate the data into a view of hominin dietary evolution, finding that changes in graminivorous behavior preceded corresponding changes in dental morphology by ~700,000 years. Decoupling diets and morphologies in time was conducive to determining when and to exploring why dietary changes helped to propel human evolution.",

Furthermore, we found that the sensitivities of ITF to temperature and dust are in a ratio that agrees with laboratory measurements of droplet freezing, showing that ITF can be attributed to dust aerosol.",

We characterized mouse hypothalamus gene expression and chromatin dynamics across fed, fasted, and refed states and then used comparative genomics of hibernating versus nonhibernating lineages to identify cis elements with convergent changes in hibernators. Multi-omics approaches pinpointed CREs, hub genes, regulatory programs, and cell types underlying lineage divergence. Hibernators accumulated loss-of-function effects for CREs regulating hypothalamic responses, and the refeeding period after fasting served as a key phase for molecular processes with convergent evolutionary changes.

          "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for neurodegeneration and is characterized by diverse cellular and molecular hallmarks. To understand the origin of these hallmarks, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome in the brain of short-lived killifish. We identified a cascade of events in which aberrant translation pausing led to altered abundance of proteins independently of transcriptional regulation. In particular, aging caused increased ribosome stalling and widespread depletion of proteins enriched in basic amino acids. These findings uncover a potential vulnerable point in the aging brain’s biology—the biogenesis of basic DNA and RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity, proteostasis, and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",

However, previous electrical techniques to detect antiferromagnetic dynamics have utilized large, millimeter-scale bulk crystals. In this work, we demonstrate direct electrical detection of antiferromagnetic resonance in structures on the few-micrometer scale using spin-filter tunneling in platinum ditelluride (PtTe 2 )/bilayer chromium sulfide bromide (CrSBr)/graphite junctions in which the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. This sample geometry allows not only efficient detection but also electrical control of the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe 2 electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic resonance enables detailed studies of the physics governing these high-frequency dynamics.",

          "abstract": "A leading HIV vaccine strategy requires a priming immunogen to induce broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) precursors, followed by a series of heterologous boosters to elicit somatic hypermutation (SHM) and produce bnAbs. In two randomized, open-label phase 1 human clinical trials, IAVI G002 in the United States and IAVI G003 in Rwanda and South Africa (IAVI, International Aids Vaccine Initiative), we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-encoded nanoparticles as priming immunogens (both trials) and first-boosting immunogens (IAVI G002). The vaccines were generally safe and well tolerated, except that 18% of IAVI G002 participants experienced skin reactions. Priming induced bnAb precursors with substantial frequencies and SHM; heterologous boosting elicited increased SHM, affinity, and neutralization activity toward bnAb development; and elicited antibodies exhibited precise bnAb structural mimicry. The results establish clinical proof of concept that heterologous boosting can advance bnAb precursor maturation and demonstrate bnAb priming in Africa, where the HIV burden is highest.",

          "abstract": "A protective HIV vaccine will need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans, but priming rare bnAb precursor B cells has been challenging. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 human clinical trial, the recombinant, germline-targeting envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer BG505 SOSIP.v4.1-GT1.1, adjuvanted with AS01 B , induced bnAb precursors of the VRC01-class at a high frequency in the majority of vaccine recipients. These bnAb precursors, which target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01. These results further support germline-targeting approaches for human HIV vaccine design and demonstrate atomic-level manipulation of B cell responses with rational vaccine design.",

However, the Schottky gate also leads to very high leakage current through the gate electrode. Adding a conventional dielectric layer between the nitride layers and gate metal can reduce leakage; but this comes at the price of a reduced drain current. We used a ferroic HfO 2 - ZrO 2 bilayer as the gate dielectric and achieved a simultaneous increase in the ON current and decrease in the leakage current, a combination otherwise not attainable with conventional dielectrics. This approach surpasses the conventional limits of Schottky GaN transistors and provides a new pathway for improved performance in transistors based on 2DEG.",

However, the central mechanisms underlying mitochondrial gene expression remain enigmatic, and a lack of suitable technologies to target mitochondrial protein synthesis in cells has limited experimental access. We silenced the translation of specific mitochondrial mRNAs in living human cells by delivering synthetic peptide-morpholino chimeras. This approach allowed us to perform a comprehensive temporal monitoring of cellular responses. Our study provides insights into mitochondrial translation, its integration into cellular physiology, and provides a strategy to address mitochondrial gene expression in living cells. The approach can potentially be used to analyze mechanisms and pathophysiology of mitochondrial gene expression in a range of cellular model systems.",

In this study, we used a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, that probes these low-energy excitations. We illustrated the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extracted the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings. The ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves, whereas in the antiferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.",

          "abstract": "The indirect health risks of tropical cyclones (TCs), the costliest climate extremes, remain unclear, with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being a major contributor. We applied two-stage time-series analysis to 6.54 million CVD hospitalizations across six countries/territories (Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) between 2000 and 2019 to quantify the long-term risks and burden of CVD hospitalizations following TCs. Hospitalization risks for cause-specific CVDs consistently increased following TC exposure, generally peaking around 2 months postexposure and dissipating by 6 months. Overall, each additional TC day was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 19%) increase in CVD hospitalizations in 6 months following TCs. Particularly high TC-attributable burden was found for ischemic heart diseases and stroke, especially among males, individuals aged 20 to 59 years, and those with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The TC-attributable proportions of CVD hospitalizations showed decreasing trends in less deprived populations and increasing trends in more deprived populations from 2000 to 2019.",

To address this challenge, we tested a social drive hypothesis, which predicts that social plasticity and social selection in human groups cause indirect genetic effects that accelerate the adaptation of fitness, promoting population growth via feedback between the environmental causes and evolutionary consequences of cooperation. Using Bayesian multilevel models to analyze fertility data from a small-scale society, we demonstrate that density- and frequency-dependent indirect genetic effects on fitness promote the evolution of cooperation among neighboring women, increasing the rate of contemporary adaptation by ~5×. Our results show how interactions between the genetic and socioecological processes shaping cooperation in reproduction can drive rapid growth and social evolution in human populations.",

Given the number of subsistence crises in medieval England, this study uses stable isotopic, demographic, and paleopathological data from human skeletal remains ( n  = 275) to assess associations between early-life nutritional stress and health outcomes before, during, and after the Black Death in London and rural Lincolnshire approximately 1000 to 1540 CE. Our results suggest that survivors of early-life nutritional stress were resilient with respect to causes of death in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood. Ultimately, however, early-life nutritional stress was associated with the presence of skeletal biomarkers of stress and elevated mortality in middle and late adulthood in the medieval period, consistent with models from developmental biology. We find that the prevalence of nutritional stress increased before the Black Death and decreased afterward. Understanding the long-term consequences of early-life nutritional stress can offer insights on the health trajectories of historical populations.",

Several broad NA inhibition monoclonal antibodies (BImAbs) targeting the highly conserved enzymatic pocket have been previously described. However, the molecular characteristics, clonal evolutionary trajectory, and B cell sources of BImAbs remain poorly understood. Here, using NA-mutant probes, we comprehensively profiled the immune signatures of NA-specific memory B cells (MBCs) from a healthy individual with NA cross-inhibition activity. From the NA-specific MBC repertoires, we identified a series of NA BImAbs with molecular features characterized by long HCDR3 regions with an “xxxDRxxx” motif, which exhibited broad inhibition against diverse influenza NAs. Clonal lineage tracing revealed that BImAbs followed a clonal evolutionary trajectory encompassing classical MBC (cMBC) and atypical MBC (aMBC). Both cMBC- and aMBC-derived BImAbs displayed similar inhibition against influenza NA. These findings enhance our understanding of the development of NA BImAbs and provide a foundation for the rational design of NA-based universal flu vaccines.",

Previous studies have suggested that metformin acts peripherally by reducing hepatic glucose output and altering gut functions. Here, we report a neural mechanism via the small guanosine triphosphatase Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1). Mice with forebrain-specific Rap1 knockout exhibited resistance to the antidiabetic effects of low-dose metformin while remaining sensitive to other antidiabetic agents. Centrally administered metformin inhibited brain Rap1 and reduced hyperglycemia. Conversely, forced activation of brain Rap1 increased glycemia and abolished the glycemic effect of metformin. Metformin activated a specific subset of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) that requires Rap1. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggest that VMH Rap1 is indispensable for the antidiabetic effects of metformin. These findings highlight the VMH Rap1 pathway as a critical mediator of metformin action.",

AuNX-PDA facilitated effective absorption of released TDAs after near-infrared II photothermal treatment and delivery of the absorbed TDAs to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus of dendritic cells for cross-presentation, thereby activating CD8 + T cells for efficient tumor-specific immunity. The nanovaccine (NV) significantly inhibited irradiated primary tumors and nonirradiated distant tumors by producing robust antitumor immune responses in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer mouse models.

Here, we report the violation of the Bell inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the multiphoton frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four SDs. Our work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.",

Given the process chemistry challenges presented by amino acid chiral centers in ProTides, a simplified lipophilic amino acid–free crystalline phosphonate prodrug of TFV (M5TFV) has been created. Intramuscular injections of M5TFV nanosuspension (NM5TFV) were well tolerated in Sprague-Dawley rats and HBV transgenic mice. Notably, single doses at 200 and 400 milligrams per kilogram TFV equivalents produced &gt;2.5 log 10 reduction in HBV DNA beyond 2 months in transgenic mice. Reductions of covalently closed circular DNA were seen in hepatocyte-like cells. These promising findings support further development of NM5TFV as an ultra-LA formulation.",

We show that key chemokine expression dictates the sensitivity of WT mice to DSS treatment. Mechanistically, we identified C/EBPβ and STAT3 as negative regulators of key chemokine expression following IL-17 and IL-22 stimulation. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or STAT3 in mouse epithelial cells abolished the protective function of T H 17 cytokines and converted resistant to sensitive phenotype. C/EBPβ ablation in cancer cells markedly enhanced chemokine expression, thus sensitizing cancer cells for anti–PD-1 immunotherapy.

Obp44a binds long-chain fatty acids and shuttles between glia and neurons, acting as a secretory lipid chaperone and scavenger to support lipid storage, efflux, and redox homeostasis. Notably, Obp44a is recruited to apoptotic cells and injured axons, especially when glial engulfment is impaired, demonstrating its role in lipid waste management and clearance of cellular debris during development and in pathological states.

DPP4i-BP differs from typical BP in its genetic, clinical, and immunological features, but methods to specifically detect DPP4i-BP autoantibodies have been unavailable. This study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with “domain-swapped BP180” proteins to identify autoantibodies in DPP4i-BP, which targeted BP180 regions from the seventh noncollagenous domain to the fourth collagenous domain (NC7-Col4). These epitopes were associated with DPP4i-BP–specific human leukocyte antigen class II peptide epitopes. Notably, the duration of DPP4i intake before BP onset was significantly shorter in patients with anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies than those without them. Measuring the autoantibodies enabled the early diagnosis of DPP4i-BP before epitope spreading. Furthermore, anti–NC7-Col4 autoantibodies were detected in some patients with diabetes taking DPP4i without BP, suggesting that these assays may offer potential tools for early identification of at-risk individuals.",

This in situ optogenetic modulation successfully demonstrated the restoration of spinal motor circuits by rebuilding functional connections between CST axons and postsynaptic interneurons. It was corroborated by live-cell recording, immunofluorescence staining, in vivo Ca 2+ imaging, and pellet-reaching tests.

Here, we assess the roles of the RSC, ISW1, and CHD1 adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent chromatin remodelers in generating nucleosome dynamics in vivo. We compare DNA methylation rates in wild-type cells and chromatin remodeler mutants by normalizing nuclear methylation rates to the nonnucleosomal mitochondrial DNA methylation rate in each strain. Depletion of both Isw1 and Chd1 increases the normalized methylation rate, suggesting that these remodelers act together to suppress nucleosome dynamics. Separate depletion of Isw1, Chd1, or Rsc8 has little effect. A decaying sine wave model used to fit nucleosome phasing data shows that nucleosome dynamics decrease with distance from the promoter in an Isw1/Chd1-dependent manner.

          "abstract": "Studies on collective cognition provide many examples of how the efficient spread of information within groups leads to benefits with increasing group size. However, little is known if groups also amplify maladaptive information such as false alarms and whether such costs reduce possible benefits. Here, we investigated wild fish shoals responding collectively with escape dives when attacked by birds. We analyzed the collective response in reaction to bird attacks and similar but harmless flybys as a function of shoal size. Larger shoals increasingly detected predator attacks (i.e., true positives), while their response facing harmless flybys (i.e., false alarms) remained constant. Furthermore, decision time decreased with increasing shoal size. Larger shoals were thus able to simultaneously overcome two major trade-offs inherent in solitary decision-making: the trade-off between true and false positives and the trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our findings set the stage for the next generation of studies investigating the mechanisms underlying collective decision-making.",

We identified the decreased mechanical capacity and impaired proliferation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells in the inflammatory environment as the primary contributors to respiratory failure of ARDS. A biomimetic, self-adaptive, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone–loaded hollow mesoporous cerium oxide coated with a platelet membrane (HCeO x -D@PM) was developed for precise ARDS therapy. HCeO x -D@PM comprises a platelet membrane (PM) shell for targeted delivery to injured lungs and an HCeO x core, which enables high drug loading, efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and penetration of the alveolar-capillary barrier. Initially, HCeO x -D@PM suppresses the inflammation and mitigates the adverse effects of lesions on AT2 cell by scavenging accumulated ROS. It then adaptively releases 7,8-dihydroxyflavone in response to cysteine–aspartic acid protease 3 activation, facilitating AT2 cell proliferation and notably improving survival rates in vivo, offering a promising advancement in the precise treatment of respiratory diseases.",

However, the challenge of generating the high output forces necessary for manipulation persists because of the low Young’s moduli of soft materials, which limit their effectiveness in tasks such as carrying, grasping, and providing support. Inspired by shrimp exoskeletons, we designed an origami exoskeleton that features flexible-rigid arrangements and mechanical multistability. This design offers high stiffness in stable states while allowing for long-stroke transitions, making it suitable for integration with soft actuators to balance deformability and load-bearing capacity. With advantages such as high compressibility and rapid integration, these exoskeleton-enhanced arms have promising applications when mounted on unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, facilitating large-scale dexterous manipulation with the necessary load capacities. For existing soft arms, the proposed origami exoskeleton enhances the potential for manipulation within their original design framework.",

Conditional ablation of BACH2 diminished the ability of ILC2 progenitors to differentiate into ILC2s. Integration of the scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and CUT&amp;Tag-seq techniques revealed that BACH2 modulated the transcriptional profiles and epigenetic landscapes of ILC2 progenitors. Furthermore, BACH2 ablation compromised the functionality of ILC2s, resulting in a resolution of allergic airway inflammation. Notably, the different binding sites of BACH2 in ILC2s and T H 2 cells suggested that BACH2 binds to IRF4 to control the function of ILC2, underscoring its context-specific effects on allergic airway inflammation.

However, their propensity for rapid crystallization and oxidation severely limits stability and carrier mobility. Here, we strategically enhance perovskite TFT performance by incorporating 2-thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) into 3D tin-based perovskites. The induction of the pseudo-halide SCN − into a bilayer quasi-2D perovskite intermediate phase, combined with the strong interaction between sulfur-bearing thiophene rings (TEA + ) and Sn-I octahedra, effectively reorients perovskite crystallization while inhibiting Sn 2+ oxidation and reducing trap density. Consequently, TEASCN-based TFTs achieve an average hole mobility of more than 60 square centimeters per volt per second and an on/off current ratio surpassing 10 8 , standing out among state-of-the-art p-type perovskite TFTs. Furthermore, unencapsulated devices preserve 84% of their initial mobility after 30 days in an N 2 atmosphere, underscoring their remarkable stability. This work opens a straightforward path toward high-mobility and highly stable tin-based perovskite transistors.",

How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of quantum Darwinism and the underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a computationally and experimentally inexpensive quantifier to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.",

Bioturbation is primarily recorded by homogenized sediments of the seafloor mixed layer and the underlying transition layer of discrete burrows. Although these two zones can be readily measured today, there has been limited understanding of how the mixed and transition layers evolved over the Phanerozoic since animals first began to extensively colonize the seafloor. Here, we provide a record for the depths of the sedimentary mixed and transition layers through the Phanerozoic. We find that although deepening of the sediment mixed layer spanned hundreds of millions of years, a deep transition layer was established as early as the Cambrian and did not further deepen until the Mesozoic—trajectories reflecting evolutionary radiations, changes in nutrient cycling, and alleviation of oxygen stress.",

Ground acceleration from moonquakes has triggered landslides and boulder falls in the valley. The formation and growth of the Lee-Lincoln thrust fault is a likely source of the moonquakes. Here, we estimate the ground acceleration and quake magnitude for four boulders and one landslide: all sampled by Apollo 17 astronauts. These features all have exposure ages that establish the approximate timing of the moonquakes. Our analysis suggests that the structural relief of the Lee-Lincoln fault scarp is the result of multiple coseismic slip events with a minimum body wave magnitude M w of ~2.9 to 3.3. The formation and growth of thousands of such globally distributed young thrust faults, through multiple coseismic events, suggest that the Moon has a history of widespread strong shallow moonquakes.

Cytolytic CD8 + T cells display variable responses to infection depending upon the time of day of exposure. However, the neuronal signals that entrain these cyclic behaviors remain unknown. Immune cells express various neurotransmitter receptors, and we demonstrate that selective deletion of the β 2 -adrenergic receptor ( Adrb2 ) gene perturbs the normal diurnal oscillation of clock gene expression in CD8 + T cells, such as Per2 and Bmal1 . Consequently, their time-of-day–dependent response to vesicular stomatitis virus was dysregulated, and the diurnal development of CD8 + T cells into variegated populations of memory/effectors was altered in the absence of ADRB2 signaling. The diurnal fluctuations in T cell phenotypes were a distinct developmental process, independent of migration kinetics within the spleen. Thus, Adrb2 directly entrains core clock gene oscillation and regulates T cell developmental responses to virus infection as a function of time of day of pathogen exposure.",

We design a chiral metasurface based on waveguide arrays with periodically shifted segments that have a saddle-shaped chiral and high- Q dispersion band. The parabolic shape along one direction ensures minimum involvement of spatial/Fourier components at each frequency, thereby achieving circularly polarized thermal emission with high spatial coherence. Meanwhile, the flatband behavior along the other direction allows the use of a slot-shaped spatial filter and a mid-infrared lens to collect emissions from large-area metasurfaces, thus improving power collection efficiency without affecting temporal coherence. Our experiments demonstrate circularly polarized thermal emissions with high temporal coherence ( Q  &gt; 200) and very large circular dichroism (~0.8).",

By using contrast agents such as microbubbles in combination with ultrafast imaging, not only can the signal-to-noise ratio be improved, but super-resolution images down to the micrometer scale of the brain vessels can also be obtained. However, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) remains affected by wavefront distortions that limit the microbubble detection rate and hamper their localization. In this work, we show how ultrasound matrix imaging, which relies on the prior recording of the reflection matrix, can provide a solution to these fundamental issues. As an experimental proof of concept, an in vivo reconstruction of deep brain microvessels is performed on three anesthetized sheep. The compensation of wave distortions is shown to markedly enhance the contrast and resolution of ULM. This experimental study thus opens up promising perspectives for a transcranial and nonionizing observation of human cerebral microvascular pathologies, such as stroke.",

Despite regional variation in geography, habitat, and species composition, a consistent pattern emerges: Biodiversity loss predominantly stems from declines in the most abundant bird species, whereas less abundant species show increases. We demonstrate that species once abundant and near their carrying capacity have declined, while less abundant species farther from their carrying capacity have increased. A path analysis identifies the key role played by anthropogenic land-use changes in causing the observed declines.

These genomic changes were supported by an increased number of individuals displaying the heterozygous state of the chromosomal inversion coupled to migratory behavior in Atlantic cod. Ecological models and genome-wide scans identified that some of the observed frequency shifts, coupled to neural development, metabolic, and growth regulation, covaried with intensified fisheries, reduced generation time, and ocean warming.

We show that floorplate and hypochord cells collectively migrate posteriorly along the nascent notochord extracellular matrix as it extends posteriorly, maintaining the tripartite configuration. Fibroblast growth factor-mediated migration in a spatially graded manner causes cell stretching, which triggers Yap-dependent proliferation and controls floorplate and hypochord growth. Supported by mathematical modeling, we further suggest that their growth is fine-tuned by mechanical tethering to the notochord via cadherin 2 at the posterior end. We propose that the notochord instructs and sustains the tripartite formation via leader-follower formation control, a strategy from engineering that spatially organizes multiple agents to coordinate the growth of the midline tissues.",

This depletion is a consequence of the local temperature decreasing as a function of heliocentric distance before planetesimal accretion. Back-tracking the present-day ε 53 Cr composition of the hypothetical proto-Earth fraction shows that the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation from the bulk Solar composition occurred no later than ~3 Ma after CAI formation, similar to disk regions of carbonaceous chondrites at greater heliocentric distances. The timing of limited solid-gas interaction due to the dissipation of gas from the protoplanetary disk caused the cessation of Mn-Cr fractionation and provides a lower limit on its lifetime.",

          "abstract": "Ecosystems are threatened by increasing droughts under climate change. A multitude of plant physiological regulation processes determine the overall drought resistance of ecosystems. So far, these physiological strategies to resist drought are poorly understood at large scales across different ecosystem types because the detection of these physiological regulation processes is mostly limited to in situ measurements on individual plants. In this study, by using high-resolution remote sensing data, we evaluated drought strategies of different ecosystem types throughout Europe by evaluating three key physiological regulation aspects (evapotranspiration, water content, and carbon regulation) based on their associated vegetation attributes. We found that different ecosystem types show divergent responses in these physiological attributes, suggesting different optimization strategies with respect to water saving versus spending, water content stabilizing versus fluctuating, and leaf conserving versus shedding strategies facing drought. These drought strategies from remote sensing provide timely ecosystem response information, facilitating earth system model predictions and aiding the protection against future droughts at large scales.",

Here, we present a counterintuitive approach: harnessing noise to dilute the energy of unwanted fluctuations from external disturbances, thereby enhancing stability while preserving synchronization through the system’s inherent noise suppression at the synchronized frequency. Through experiments with micromechanical oscillators and macroscale rotors, combined with stochastic averaging analysis, we show that this noise dilution effect improves synchronization efficiency, bolsters resistance to interference, and enhances long-term frequency stability. These findings position white noise of appropriate intensity as a dilution element for mitigating unwanted disturbances, providing previously unidentified insights into stability and resilience in complex synchronized systems.",

          "abstract": "Live-cell imaging experiments have shown that the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and incompatible with standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization and dynamics is a conundrum that violates the expected structure–function relationship. We developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by accurately determining three-dimensional (3D) structures from static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. Using the calculated 3D coordinates, the theory accurately forecasts experimentally observed two-point chromatin dynamics. It predicts rapid enhancer–promoter interactions and uncovers a scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation, closely matching recent measurements. The theory predicts that cohesin depletion accelerates single-locus diffusion while significantly slowing relaxation dynamics within topologically associating domains. Our results demonstrate that chromatin dynamics can be reliably inferred from static structural data, reinforcing the notion that 3D chromatin structure governs dynamic behavior. This general framework offers powerful tools for exploring chromatin dynamics across diverse biological contexts.",

Hybridization between the metal’s surface d orbitals and molecular p orbitals profoundly alters both the interfacial molecular layer and adjacent metal interface atomic layers, causing substantial changes in the magnetic properties of metal/molecule heterostructures. While magnetic modifications within the metallic layer are relatively well understood, the interfacial magnetism remains elusive. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, we investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures and identify a distinct interfacial magnetic component that appears universal across various cobalt/molecule combinations. Our findings reveal a highly anisotropic magnetic layer localized at the interface, which has remained undetected in static measurements. This interfacial layer likely originates from strong chemical modifications in the cobalt surface induced by chemisorbed molecules. These results underscore the crucial role of molecular chemisorption in shaping interfacial magnetic properties, offering further opportunities for tuning functionalities in molecule-based spintronic devices.",

The foams exhibited high tensile stress (~400 kPa) comparable to that of brittle foams and had excellent ductility, with an elongation of 137.0%. The foams also displayed outstanding cyclic elastic behavior, retaining more than 90% of their compressive stress after 100 cycles. In addition, the foams were water-weldable, recovering 87.3% of their original tensile stress and nearly 100% of their elongation, allowing them to be tailored into customized geometric structures.

Our analysis highlights how solar adoption in one region affects CO 2 emissions in neighboring regions, emphasizing the potential for collaborative efforts. We estimate that a 15% increase in solar generation is associated with an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons (MMT) of CO 2 emissions, contributing 12.38% toward the yearly target of 69 MMT CO 2 reductions needed to cut 1380 MMT of CO 2 in 20 years, as per the Environmental Protection Agency rule on fossil fuel power plants.

Because of the limited availability of material from obligate PPNs, we used Caenorhabditis elegans , a free-living nematode, as a MAMP source. C. elegans extract activated MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis Col-0. Through chromatography-based purification, we identified a secreted trehalase and pinpointed a conserved peptide region essential for its MAMP activity. A corresponding peptide from root-knot nematode trehalase enabled the identification of lectin receptor kinases LecRK-V.5 and LecRK-V.6 as key components in immune induction. Notably, this peptide region is conserved across some phytophagous insects and fungal pathogens, with LecRK-Vs required for immune responses to these peptides, highlighting the role of LecRK-V–mediated mechanism for broad-spectrum pathogen detection via trehalase-derived peptides.",

Using a melanoma cell model consisting of nontumoral melanocytic Mel-ST cells and their metastatic counterpart obtained by H-Ras transformation, we unexpectedly find minimal effects of eIF2A depletion on translation. Interactome studies identified centrosomal proteins as major binding partners of eIF2A. We found that eIF2A colocalizes with the centrosome, enhances centrosome composition, and promotes centrosome orientation during cell migration. Migration requires the C-terminal disordered region of eIF2A, involved in mRNA binding. Interaction with mRNA, however, does not require ongoing translation. These findings reveal a role for eIF2A in centrosome dynamics beyond its traditional function in translation.",

We find that GTP binding stabilizes interactions between AMPH-1 and the membrane through amphipathic, amino-terminal α helices, which are found at the tips of the arc-shaped, homodimeric structure. By contrast, in the posthydrolysis, guanosine diphosphate–bound state, these helices are repositioned to interact with the amino-terminal helices of other homodimers, to form an oligomeric AMPH-1 lattice that tubulates the membrane, in preparation for carrier formation by membrane fission.",

These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: We project that while future warming will increase ED visits, mortality will decrease due to fewer cold extremes. These results underscore the need to quantify temperature-morbidity responses to fully understand and anticipate the health impacts of climate change and suggest that local declines in mortality due to warming can mask economically meaningful increases in temperature-driven morbidity and health care utilization.",

Homeostatic plasticity is thought to contribute to the stability of the encoded memory by maintaining the relative differences in synaptic strength against persistent destabilizing changes in neuronal activity. However, it remains unclear how and when these two types of plasticity work together in the context of memory. Here, we have demonstrated that LARGE, a protein associated with intellectual disability, drives homeostatic resetting several hours after LTP by down-regulating AMPA-receptor trafficking via the Golgi apparatus.

Mechanisms underlying pain chronicity of CRPS-I remain unknown. Here, we identified the presence of long-lasting infiltration of macrophages in local dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of a rat model of CRPS-I. We demonstrate that regenerating islet-derived 3β (Reg3β) is specifically produced by DRG neurons upon model establishment and functions as an important signaling molecule to drive proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in local DRG. Infiltrated macrophages produce TNF-α, which causes hyperexcitability of nociceptive DRG neurons and reciprocally promotes Reg3β overexpression and secretion from DRG neurons to recruit more macrophages. Our work reveals a positive feedback signaling conveyed by neuronal Reg3β/macrophage TNF-α that contributes to neuroinflammation in DRG, resulting in persistent pain in a rat model of CRPS-I. This finding provides insights into the neuroimmune interaction in local DRG that contributes to pain chronicity of CRPS-I.",

Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor nuclear factor IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production, providing an important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development. Together, these findings underscore the critical role of NFIA in instructing the assembly of spinal circuits for movement.",

          "abstract": "Activation of the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A has been shown to regulate mood and cognition, making 5-HT1A an important target in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Although the receptor signals through inhibitory G proteins, more work is necessary to understand differences in transducer coupling and its relation to functional activity. To develop a molecular understanding of the differences underlying transducer coupling and activation, we performed structure-activity relationship studies of 5-HT1A with distinct G proteins. Through a combination of in vitro assays, we identified a potent partial agonist that selectively engages a G protein subtype. We further investigated the differences in G protein engagement at 5-HT1A with cryo–electron microscopy, determining structures of 5-HT1A bound to distinct ligands and G protein subtypes. Combined with subsequent structure-guided mutagenesis and signaling assays, our studies uncover both orthosteric and allosteric determinants of agonist-specific stimulation of distinct transducers.",

          "authors": "Xiaomeng Tian, Ming Li, Axel Meyer",
          "abstract": "Almost all animals are bilaterally symmetrical, and only rarely is this universality broken and maintained as a stable polymorphism. One such case is Perissodus microlepis , a scale-eating cichlid fish endemic to Lake Tanganyika. This species is polymorphic with left- or right-headed morphs, each specialized for scraping scales from the opposite side of their prey. This polymorphism is stably maintained around a 50:50 ratio and is likely driven by negative frequency–dependent selection, a classic form of balancing selection. Using a genome-wide dataset, including a de novo haplotype-resolved reference genome, whole-genome sequences, and microcomputed tomography scans of 102 individuals, we identified 72 genetic loci linked to head asymmetry. Nearby genes are enriched for roles in symmetry establishment, facial morphology, and nervous system function, with evidence suggesting that balancing selection maintains this diversity. Our study expands our understanding of the genetic basis of head asymmetry and provides candidate genes for further research.",

          "abstract": "Methane combustion contributes 30% to global warming, making its conversion to cleaner chemicals a critical challenge. Here, we report a catalyst-free ambient conversion of methane to methanol with a remarkable yield exceeding 650 millimoles per hour and a high conversion rate of ~35%, achieved using in situ–generated water dimer radical cations, ( H 2 O ) 2 + · , in a specially designed batch reactor operating under mild conditions. In a single run, the reactor was typically operated for 10 minutes. The atom efficiency for hydrogen in our approach for methanol synthesis is ~67%. Hydrogen gas is the by-product, produced at a rate of over 2 millimoles per hour. Compared to the previously reported catalytic methods, our production yields are up by between 10 2 and 10 6 times depending on the literature method. This breakthrough enables clean, energy-efficient methane conversion without unwanted oxidation by-products, offering substantial environmental and economic benefits beyond combustion.",

          "abstract": "Humans across cultures show an outstanding capacity to perceive, learn, and produce musical rhythms. These skills rely on mapping the infinite space of possible rhythmic sensory inputs onto a finite set of internal rhythm categories. What is the nature of the brain processes underlying rhythm categorization? We used electroencephalography to measure brain activity as human participants listened to a continuum of rhythmic sequences characterized by repeating patterns of two interonset intervals. Using frequency and representational similarity analyses, we show that brain activity does not merely track the temporal structure of rhythmic inputs but, instead, produces categorical representation of rhythms. These neural rhythm categories arise automatically, independent of any motor- or timing-related tasks, yet exhibit strong similarity with categorization observed in overt behavior. Together, these results and methodological advances constitute a critical step toward understanding the biological roots and diversity of musical behaviors across cultures.",

          "abstract": "Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) enables untargeted, highly multiplexed mapping of molecular species in biological tissue with unparalleled chemical specificity and sensitivity. However, most IMS platforms lack microscopy-level spatial resolution and cellular morphological contrast, necessitating subsequent histochemical staining, microscopic imaging, and advanced image registration to correlate/link molecular distributions with specific tissue features and cell types. We present a diffusion model–based virtual histological staining approach that enhances spatial resolution and digitally introduces cellular morphological contrast into mass spectrometry images of label-free human tissue. Blind testing on human kidney tissue demonstrated that the virtually stained images of label-free samples closely match their histochemically stained counterparts (with periodic acid–Schiff staining), showing high concordance in identifying key renal pathology structures despite using IMS data with 10-fold larger pixel size. Additionally, our approach uses optimized noise sampling during the diffusion model’s inference to achieve reliable and repeatable virtual staining. We believe this virtual staining method will open avenues for IMS-based biomedical research.",

          "abstract": "Climate-induced distribution changes are particularly challenging for fisheries targeting fish populations shared between exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and the high seas, known as straddling stocks. Here, we combine multiple datasets and ecosystem modeling to identify the presence of straddling stocks worldwide and consider the management implications of climate change–driven shifts. We identify 347 straddling stocks across 67 species, including both highly migratory and less mobile species. Our results suggest that regardless of the climate change scenario, at least 37% and 54% of stocks are projected to shift between EEZs and the high seas, by 2030 and 2050, respectively. More stocks are expected to shift toward the high seas, and highly migratory stocks are projected to shift across Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Coastal states and RFMOs require to revise governance frameworks to support sustainable and equitable adaptation to shifting stocks. Developing such strategies requires cooperation between management bodies within EEZs and the high seas.",
