          "title": "Measuring racial educational disparities over time amongst top achievers",
          "authors": "Uditi Karna, Min Sok Lee, John A. List, Andrew Simon, Haruka Uchida",
          "abstract": "Educational disparities remain a key contributor to increasing social and wealth inequalities. To address this, researchers and policymakers have focused on average differences between racial groups or differences among students who are falling behind1. This focus potentially leads to educational triage, diverting resources away from high-achieving students, including those from racial minorities2,3. Here we focus on the ‘racial excellence gap’—the difference in the likelihood that students from racial minorities (Black and Hispanic) reach the highest levels of academic achievement compared with their non-minority (white and Asian) peers. There is a shortage of evidence that systematically measures the magnitude of the excellence gap and how it evolves4,5. Using longitudinal, statewide, administrative data, we document eight facts regarding the excellence gap from third grade (typically ages 8–9) to high school (typically ages 14–18), link the stability of excellence gaps and student backgrounds, and assess the efficacy of public policies. We show that excellence gaps in maths and reading are evident by the third grade and grow slightly over time, especially for female students. About one third of the gap is explained by a student’s socioeconomic status, and about one tenth is explained by the school environment. Top-achieving racial minority students are also less likely to persist in excellence as they progress through school. Moreover, state accountability policies that direct additional resources to reduce non-race-based inequality6 had minimal effects on the racial excellence gaps. Documenting these patterns is an important step towards eliminating excellence gaps and removing the ‘racial glass ceiling’.",

          "abstract": "Greenlandic Inuit and other indigenous populations are underrepresented in genetic research1,2, leading to inequity in healthcare opportunities. To address this, we performed analyses of sequenced or imputed genomes of 5,996 Greenlanders with extensive phenotypes. We quantified their historical population bottleneck and how it has shaped their genetic architecture to have fewer, but more common, variable sites. Consequently, we find twice as many high-impact genome-wide associations to metabolic traits in Greenland compared with Europe. We infer that the high-impact variants arose after the population split from Native Americans and thus are Arctic-specific, and show that some of them are common due to not only genetic drift but also selection. We also find that European-derived polygenic scores for metabolic traits are only half as accurate in Greenlanders as in Europeans, and that adding Arctic-specific variants improves the overall accuracy to the same level as in Europeans. Similarly, lack of representation in public genetic databases makes genetic clinical screening harder in Greenlandic Inuit, but inclusion of Greenlandic data remedies this by reducing the number of non-causal candidate variants by sixfold. Finally, we identify pronounced genetic fine structure that explains differences in prevalence of monogenic diseases in Greenland and, together with recent changes in mobility, leads to a predicted future reduction in risk for certain recessive diseases. These results illustrate how including data from Greenlanders can greatly reduce inequity in genomic-based healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence indicates that migratory animals exploit the magnetic field of the Earth for navigation, both as a compass to determine direction and as a map to determine geographical position1. It has long been proposed that, to navigate using a magnetic map, animals must learn the magnetic coordinates of the destination2,3, yet the pivotal hypothesis that animals can learn magnetic signatures of geographical areas has, to our knowledge, yet to be tested. Here we report that an iconic navigating species, the loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), can learn such information. When fed repeatedly in magnetic fields replicating those that exist in particular oceanic locations, juvenile turtles learned to distinguish magnetic fields in which they encountered food from magnetic fields that exist elsewhere, an ability that might underlie foraging site fidelity. Conditioned responses in this new magnetic map assay were unaffected by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields, a treatment expected to disrupt radical-pair-based chemical magnetoreception4,5,6, suggesting that the magnetic map sense of the turtle does not rely on this mechanism. By contrast, orientation behaviour that required use of the magnetic compass was disrupted by radiofrequency oscillating magnetic fields. The findings provide evidence that two different mechanisms of magnetoreception underlie the magnetic map and magnetic compass in sea turtles.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal phenotypic traits such as morphology, connectivity and function are dictated, to a large extent, by a specific combination of differentially expressed genes. Clusters of neurons in transcriptomic space correspond to distinct cell types and in some cases—for example, Caenorhabditis elegans neurons 1 and retinal ganglion cells 2–4 —have been shown to share morphology and function. The zebrafish optic tectum is composed of a spatial array of neurons that transforms visual inputs into motor outputs. Although the visuotopic map is continuous, subregions of the tectum are functionally specialized 5,6 . Here, to uncover the cell-type architecture of the tectum, we transcriptionally profiled its neurons, revealing more than 60 cell types that are organized in distinct anatomical layers. We measured the visual responses of thousands of tectal neurons by two-photon calcium imaging and matched them with their transcriptional profiles. Furthermore, we characterized the morphologies of transcriptionally identified neurons using specific transgenic lines. Notably, we found that neurons that are transcriptionally similar can diverge in shape, connectivity and visual responses. Incorporating the spatial coordinates of neurons within the tectal volume revealed functionally and morphologically defined anatomical subclusters within individual transcriptomic clusters. Our findings demonstrate that extrinsic, position-dependent factors expand the phenotypic repertoire of genetically similar neurons.",

These planets form two populations separated by a natural division at about 1.8 R⊕ termed the radius valley. It is uncertain whether these populations arose from separate dry versus water-rich formation channels, evolved apart because of long-term atmospheric loss or a combination of both5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Here we report observations of ongoing hydrogen loss from two sibling planets, TOI-776 b (1.85 ± 0.13 R⊕) and TOI-776 c (2.02 ± 0.14 R⊕), the sizes of which near the radius valley and mature (1–4 Gyr) age make them valuable for investigating the origins of the divided population of which they are a part. During the transits of these planets, absorption appeared against the Lyman-α emission of the host star, compatible with hydrogen escape at rates equivalent to 0.03–0.6% and 0.1–0.9% of the total mass per billion years of each planet, respectively. Observations of the outer planet, TOI-776 c, are incompatible with an outflow of dissociated steam, suggesting both it and its inner sibling formed in a dry environment. These observations support the strong role of hydrogen loss in the evolution of close-orbiting sub-Neptunes5,6,7,8,15,16.",

However, the microfibrillar organization of cellulose and its complex interactions with other components of the plant cell wall poses a major challenge for enzymatic conversion4. Here, by mining the metagenomic ‘dark matter’ (unclassified DNA with unknown function) of a microbial community specialized in lignocellulose degradation, we discovered a metalloenzyme that oxidatively cleaves cellulose. This metalloenzyme acts on cellulose through an exo-type mechanism with C1 regioselectivity, resulting exclusively in cellobionic acid as a product. The crystal structure reveals a catalytic copper buried in a compact jelly-roll scaffold that features a flattened cellulose binding site. This metalloenzyme exhibits a homodimeric configuration that enables in situ hydrogen peroxide generation by one subunit while the other is productively interacting with cellulose. The secretome of an engineered strain of the fungus Trichoderma reesei expressing this metalloenzyme boosted the glucose release from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass under industrially relevant conditions, demonstrating its biotechnological potential. This discovery modifies the current understanding of bacterial redox enzymatic systems devoted to overcoming biomass recalcitrance5,6,7. Furthermore, it enables the conversion of agro-industrial residues into value-added bioproducts, thereby contributing to the transition to a sustainable and bio-based economy.",

          "abstract": "Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors play crucial roles in plant immunity by sensing pathogen effectors1. In Arabidopsis, certain sensor NLRs function as NADases to catalyse the production of second messengers2,3, which can be recognized by enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) with its partner senescence-associated gene 101 (SAG101), to activate helper NLR N requirement gene 1 (NRG1)4. A cryoelectron microscopy structure shows that second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101 mainly contacts the leucine-rich repeat domain of NRG1A to mediate the formation of an induced EDS1–SAG101–NRG1A complex. Structural comparisons show that binding of a second messenger induces conformational changes in EDS1–SAG101, which are recognized by NRG1A, leading to its allosteric activation. We further show that an inhibitory NRG1 family member, NRG1C, efficiently outcompetes NRG1A for binding to second-messenger-activated EDS1–SAG101. These findings uncover mechanisms for NRG1A activation through its recognition of a modified host EDS1–SAG101 complex, and NRG1A inhibition by NRG1C through sequestration of the activated EDS1–SAG101, thus shedding light on the activation and constraint of a central plant immune response system.",

          "abstract": "The crypt–villus structure of the small intestine serves as an essential protective barrier. The integrity of this barrier is monitored by the complex sensory system of the gut, in which serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells play an important part1,2. These rare sensory epithelial cells surveil the mucosal environment for luminal stimuli and transmit signals both within and outside the gut3,4,5,6. However, whether EC cells in crypts and villi detect different stimuli or produce distinct physiological responses is unknown. Here we address these questions by developing a reporter mouse model to quantitatively measure the release and propagation of serotonin from EC cells in live intestines. Crypt EC cells exhibit a tonic low-level mode that activates epithelial serotonin 5-HT4 receptors to modulate basal ion secretion and a stimulus-induced high-level mode that activates 5-HT3 receptors on sensory nerve fibres. Both these modes can be initiated by the irritant receptor TRPA1, which is confined to crypt EC cells. The activation of TRPA1 by luminal irritants is enhanced when the protective mucus layer is compromised. Villus EC cells also signal damage through a distinct mechanism, whereby oxidative stress activates TRPM2 channels, which leads to the release of both serotonin and ATP and consequent excitation of sensory nerve fibres. This topological segregation of EC cell functionality along the mucosal architecture constitutes a mechanism for the surveillance, maintenance and protection of gut integrity under diverse physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Crystal symmetry guides the development of condensed matter. The unique crystal symmetry connecting magnetic sublattices not only distinguishes altermagnetism1,2,3,4,5,6 from ferromagnetism and conventional antiferromagnetism but also enables it to combine the advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism4,5. Altermagnetic order is essentially a magnetic crystal order7, determined by the magnetic-order (Néel) vector and crystal symmetry. Previous experimental studies have concentrated on manipulating the altermagnetic symmetry by tuning the Néel vector orientations8,9,10,11,12. However, manipulation of the crystal symmetry, which holds great promise for manipulating the altermagnetic order, remains challenging. Here we realize the manipulation of altermagnetic order in chromium antimonide (CrSb) films via crystal symmetry. The locking between the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector and the magnetic space symmetry helps to reconstruct the altermagnetic order, from a collinear Néel vector to a canted one. It generates a room-temperature spontaneous anomalous Hall effect in an altermagnet. The relative direction between the current-induced spin polarization and the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector determines the switching modes of altermagnetic order, that is, parallel for the field-assisted mode in CrSb\\((1\\bar{1}00)\\)/Pt and non-parallel for the field-free mode in W/CrSb\\((11\\bar{2}0)\\). The Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya vector induces an asymmetric energy barrier in the field-assisted mode and generates an asymmetric driving force in the field-free mode. In particular, the latter is guaranteed by the emerging Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya torque in altermagnets. Reconstructing crystal symmetry adds a new twist to the manipulation of altermagnetic order. It not only underpins the magnetic-memory and nano-oscillator technology4,5 but also inspires crossover studies between altermagnetism and other research topics.",

          "abstract": "The biogenic structures produced by termites, ants and earthworms provide key functions across global ecosystems1,2. However, little is known about the drivers of the soil engineering effects caused by these small but important invertebrates3 at the global scale. Here we show, on the basis of a meta-analysis of 12,975 observations from 1,047 studies on six continents, that all three taxa increase soil macronutrient content, soil respiration and soil microbial and plant biomass compared with reference soils. The effect of termites on soil respiration and plant biomass, and the effect of earthworms on soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, increase with mean annual temperature and peak in the tropics. By contrast, the effects of ants on soil nitrogen, soil phosphorus, plant biomass and survival rate peak at mid-latitude ecosystems that have the lowest primary productivity. Notably, termites and ants increase plant growth by alleviating plant phosphorus limitation in the tropics and nitrogen limitation in temperate regions, respectively. Our study highlights the important roles of these invertebrate taxa in global biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functions. Given the importance of these soil-engineering invertebrates, biogeochemical models should better integrate their effects, especially on carbon fluxes and nutrient cycles.",

          "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of type 2 diabetes, which is strongly associated with obesity1, causing sensory loss and, in some patients, neuropathic pain2,3. Although the onset and progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is linked with dyslipidaemia and hyperglycaemia4, the contribution of inflammation to peripheral neuropathy pathogenesis has not been investigated. Here we used a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD), which induces obesity and prediabetic metabolic changes, to study the onset of peripheral neuropathy. Mice fed the HFHFD developed persistent heat hypoalgesia after 3 months, but a reduction in epidermal skin nerve fibre density manifested only at 6 months. Using single-cell sequencing, we found that CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate the sciatic nerves of HFHFD-fed mice well before axonal degeneration is detectable. These infiltrating macrophages share gene expression similarities with nerve-crush-induced macrophages5 and express neurodegeneration-associated microglial marker genes6, although there is no axon loss or demyelination. Inhibiting the macrophage recruitment by genetically or pharmacologically blocking CCR2 signalling resulted in more severe heat hypoalgesia and accelerated skin denervation, as did deletion of Lgals3, a gene expressed in recruited macrophages. Recruitment of macrophages into the peripheral nerves of obese prediabetic mice is, therefore, neuroprotective, delaying terminal sensory axon degeneration by means of galectin 3. Potentiating and sustaining early neuroprotective immune responses in patients could slow or prevent peripheral neuropathy.",

We highlight these themes primarily as they relate to neurological diseases, the control of immunity, and the regulation of complex behaviours. We also consider the importance and challenges linked to the study of the neuroimmune connectome, which is defined as the totality of neuroimmune interactions in the body, because this provides a conceptual framework to identify mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how the latest techniques can advance our understanding of the neuroimmune connectome, and highlight the outstanding questions in the field.",

Here we report a low-cost, green-solvent-based holistic recycling strategy to restore all valuable components from perovskite PV waste. We develop an efficient aqueous-based perovskite recycling approach that can also rejuvenate degraded perovskites. We further extend the scope of recycling to charge-transport layers, substrates, cover glasses and metal electrodes. After repeated degradation–recycling processes, the recycled devices show similar efficiency and stability compared with the fresh devices. Our holistic recycling strategy reduces by 96.6% resource depletion and by 68.8% human toxicity (cancer effects) impacts associated with perovskite PVs compared with the landfill treatment. With recycling, the levelized cost of electricity also decreases for both utility-scale and residential systems.

In mice, aggressive behaviour can be broken down into an appetitive phase, which involves approach and investigation, and a consummatory phase, which involves biting, kicking and wrestling1. Here, by performing an unsupervised weighted correlation network analysis on whole-brain FOS expression in mice, we identify a cluster of brain regions, including hypothalamic and amygdalar subregions and olfactory cortical regions, that are highly co-activated in male but not in female aggressors. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (COApl)—an extended olfactory structure—was found to be a hub region, on the basis of the number and strength of correlations with other regions in the cluster. Our data also show that oestrogen receptor 1 (Esr1)-expressing cells in the COApl (COAplEsr1) exhibit increased activity during attack behaviour and during bouts of investigation that precede an attack, in male mice only. Chemogenetic or optogenetic inhibition of COAplEsr1 cells in male aggressors reduces aggression and increases pro-social investigation without affecting social reward and reinforcement behaviour. We further show that COAplEsr1 projections to the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala are necessary for these behaviours. Collectively, these data suggest that, in aggressive males, COAplEsr1 cells respond specifically to social stimuli, thereby enhancing their salience and promoting attack behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Galaxy clusters contain vast amounts of hot ionized gas known as the intracluster medium (ICM). In relaxed cluster cores, the radiative cooling time of the ICM is shorter than the age of the cluster. However, the absence of line emission associated with cooling suggests heating mechanisms that offset the cooling, with feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) being the most likely source1,2. Turbulence and bulk motions, such as the oscillating (‘sloshing’) motion of the core gas in the cluster potential well, have also been proposed as mechanisms for heat distribution from the outside of the core3,4. Here we present X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Centaurus galaxy cluster with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission satellite. We find that the hot gas flows along the line of sight relative to the central galaxy, with velocities from 130 km s−1 to 310 km s−1 within about 30 kpc of the centre. This indicates bulk flow consistent with core gas sloshing. Although the bulk flow may prevent excessive accumulation of cooled gas at the centre, it could distribute the heat injected by the AGN and bring in thermal energy from the surrounding ICM. The velocity dispersion of the gas is found to be only ≲120 km s−1 in the core, even within about 10 kpc of the AGN. This suggests that the influence of the AGN on the surrounding ICM motion is limited in the cluster.",

          "abstract": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors sense pathogen effectors and form resistosomes to confer immunity1. Some sensor NLR resistosomes produce small molecules to induce formation of a heterotrimer complex with two lipase-like proteins, EDS1 and SAG101, and a helper NLR called NRG1 (refs. 2,3). Activation of sensor NLR resistosomes also triggers NRG1 oligomerization and resistosome formation at the plasma membrane4,5. We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A heterotrimer formation is stabilized by the AtNRG1A loss-of-oligomerization mutant L134E5,6. We report structures of AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1A L134E and AtEDS1–AtSAG101–AtNRG1C heterotrimers with similar assembly mechanisms. AtNRG1A signalling is activated by the interaction with the AtEDS1–AtSAG101 heterodimer in complex with their small-molecule ligand. The truncated AtNRG1C maintains core interacting domains of AtNRG1A but develops further interactions with AtEDS1–AtSAG101 to outcompete AtNRG1A. Moreover, AtNRG1C lacks an N-terminal signalling domain and shows nucleocytoplasmic localization, facilitating its sequestration of AtEDS1–AtSAG101, which is also nucleocytoplasmic. Our study shows the activation and inhibition mechanisms of a plant helper NLR.",

          "abstract": "Zinc is emerging as a key material for next-generation biodegradable implants1,2,3,4,5. However, its inherent softness limits its use in load-bearing orthopaedic implants. Although reducing the grain size of zinc can make it stronger, it also destabilizes its mechanical properties and thus makes it less durable at body temperature6. Here we show that extruded Zn alloys of dilute compositions can achieve ultrahigh strength and excellent durability when their micron-scale grain size is increased while maintaining a basal texture. In this inverse Hall–Petch effect, the dominant deformation mode changes from inter-granular grain boundary sliding and dynamic recrystallization at the original grain size to intra-granular pyramidal slip and unusual twinning at the increased grain size. The role of the anomalous twins, termed ‘accommodation twins’ in this work, is to accommodate the altered grain shape in the plane lying perpendicular to the external loading direction, in contrast to the well-known ‘mechanical twins’ whose role is to deliver plasticity along the external loading direction7,8. The strength level achieved in these dilute zinc alloys is nearly double those of biodegradable implants made of magnesium alloys—making them the strongest and most stable biodegradable alloys available, to our knowledge, for fabricating bone fixation implants.",

          "abstract": "Despite their high relative abundance in our Universe, neutrinos are the least understood fundamental particles of nature. In fact, the quantum properties of neutrinos emitted in experimentally relevant sources are theoretically contested1,2,3,4 and the spatial extent of the neutrino wavepacket is only loosely constrained by reactor neutrino oscillation data with a spread of 13 orders of magnitude5,6. Here we present a method to directly access this quantity by precisely measuring the energy width of the recoil daughter nucleus emitted in the radioactive decay of beryllium-7. The final state in the decay process contains a recoiling lithium-7 nucleus, which is entangled with an electron neutrino at creation. The lithium-7 energy spectrum is measured to high precision by directly embedding beryllium-7 radioisotopes into a high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction that is operated as a cryogenic sensor. Under this approach, we set a lower limit on the Heisenberg spatial uncertainty of the recoil daughter of 6.2 pm, which implies that the final-state system is localized at a scale more than a thousand times larger than the nucleus itself. From this measurement, the first, to our knowledge, direct lower limit on the spatial extent of a neutrino wavepacket is extracted. These results may have implications in several areas including the theoretical understanding of neutrino properties, the nature of localization in weak nuclear decays and the interpretation of neutrino physics data.",

          "abstract": "Lithium (Li) ions are central to the energy storing functionality of rechargeable batteries1. Present technology relies on sophisticated Li-inclusive electrode materials to provide Li ions and exactingly protect them to ensure a decent lifetime2. Li-deficient materials are thus excluded from battery design, and the battery fails when active Li ions are consumed3. Our study breaks this limit by means of a cell-level Li supply strategy. This involves externally adding an organic Li salt into an assembled cell, which decomposes during cell formation, liberating Li ions and expelling organic ligands as gases. This non-invasive and rapid process preserves cell integrity without necessitating disassembly. We leveraged machine learning to discover such functional salts and identified lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3) with optimal electrochemical activity, potential, product formation, electrolyte solubility and specific capacity. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated a 3.0 V, 1,192 Wh kg−1 Li-free cathode, chromium oxide, in the anode-less cell, as well as an organic sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode incorporated in a 388 Wh kg−1 pouch cell with a 440-cycle life. These systems exhibit improved energy density, enhanced sustainability and reduced cost compared with conventional Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the lifetime of commercial LiFePO4 batteries was extended by at least an order of magnitude. With repeated external Li supplies, a commercial graphite|LiFePO4 cell displayed a capacity retention of 96.0% after 11,818 cycles.",

Although they have feathered wings, the known Jurassic birds are more similar to non-avialan theropods in having the ancestral long reptilian tail9,10,11. This is in stark contrast to most Cretaceous and crownward taxa, which have a short tail that terminates in a compound bone called the pygostyle12,13,14. Here we report on the oldest short-tailed avialan, Baminornis zhenghensis gen. et sp. nov., from the recently discovered Late Jurassic Zhenghe Fauna15, which fills a noticeable spatio-temporal gap in the earliest branching avialan fossil record. B. zhenghensis exhibits a unique combination of derived ornithothoracine-like pectoral and pelvic girdles and plesiomorphic non-avialan maniraptoran hand, demonstrating mosaic evolution along stem avialan line. An avialan furcula collected from the same locality is referrable to ornithuromorphs on the basis of our morphometric and phylogenetic analyses. These newly discovered fossils demonstrate the early appearance of highly derived bird features, and together with an anchiornithine fossil from the same locality, they suggest an earlier origin of birds and a radiation of early birds in the Jurassic.",

          "abstract": "Cancer mutations can create neomorphic protein–protein interactions to drive aberrant function 1,2 . As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma 3 , the most common embryonal brain tumour in children 4 . These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST 5 . However, their mechanism remains unresolved. Here we establish that KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2 as the direct target of the mutant substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we chart the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat β-propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 β-propellers is stabilized by the medulloblastoma mutations, which insert a bulky side chain into the HDAC1 active site pocket. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3–neosubstrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, we unveil a converging shape-complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4–HDAC1 interface and proliferation of KBTBD4-mutant medulloblastoma cells. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein–protein interactions.",

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a muscle-degenerating disease caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes the dystrophin protein 1,2 . Utrophin ( UTRN ), the genetic and functional paralogue of DMD , is upregulated in some DMD patients 3–5 . To further investigate this UTRN upregulation, we first developed an inducible messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation system for DMD by introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in one of its alternatively spliced exons. Inclusion of the PTC-containing exon triggers DMD mutant mRNA decay and UTRN upregulation. Notably, blocking nonsense-mediated mRNA decay results in the reversal of UTRN upregulation, whereas overexpressing DMD does not. Furthermore, overexpressing DMD PTC minigenes in wild-type cells causes UTRN upregulation, as does a wild-type DMD minigene containing a self-cleaving ribozyme. To place these findings in a therapeutic context, we used splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to induce the skipping of out-of-frame exons of DMD , aiming to introduce PTCs. We found that these ASOs cause UTRN upregulation. In addition, when using an ASO to restore the DMD reading frame in myotubes derived from a DMD patient, an actual DMD treatment, UTRN upregulation was reduced. Altogether, these results indicate that an mRNA decay-based mechanism called transcriptional adaptation 6–8 plays a key role in UTRN upregulation in DMD patients, and they highlight an unexplored therapeutic application of ASOs, as well as ribozymes, in inducing genetic compensation via transcriptional adaptation. ",

          "abstract": "The detection of cosmic neutrinos with energies above a teraelectronvolt (TeV) offers a unique exploration into astrophysical phenomena1,2,3. Electrically neutral and interacting only by means of the weak interaction, neutrinos are not deflected by magnetic fields and are rarely absorbed by interstellar matter: their direction indicates that their cosmic origin might be from the farthest reaches of the Universe. High-energy neutrinos can be produced when ultra-relativistic cosmic-ray protons or nuclei interact with other matter or photons, and their observation could be a signature of these processes. Here we report an exceptionally high-energy event observed by KM3NeT, the deep-sea neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea4, which we associate with a cosmic neutrino detection. We detect a muon with an estimated energy of \\(12{0}_{-60}^{+110}\\) petaelectronvolts (PeV). In light of its enormous energy and near-horizontal direction, the muon most probably originated from the interaction of a neutrino of even higher energy in the vicinity of the detector. The cosmic neutrino energy spectrum measured up to now5,6,7 falls steeply with energy. However, the energy of this event is much larger than that of any neutrino detected so far. This suggests that the neutrino may have originated in a different cosmic accelerator than the lower-energy neutrinos, or this may be the first detection of a cosmogenic neutrino8, resulting from the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with background photons in the Universe.",

So far, we have a very incomplete understanding of how countries cause biodiversity loss outside their own borders through their demand for agricultural and forestry products grown in other countries2. Here we quantify the global range losses to forest vertebrates from 2001 to 2015 caused by deforestation attributable to 24 developed countries by means of their consumption of products obtained through global supply chains. We show that these driver countries are responsible for much greater cumulative range loss to species outside their own borders than within them. These international impacts were concentrated geographically, allowing us to map global hotspots of outsourced losses of biodiversity. Countries had the greatest external impacts on species occurring in nearby regions. However, in a few cases, developed countries also inflicted disproportionate harm on vertebrates in distant countries.",

          "abstract": "Elevated or ectopic expression of neuronal receptors promotes tumour progression in many cancer types 1,2 ; neuroendocrine (NE) transformation of adenocarcinomas has also been associated with increased aggressiveness 3 . Whether the defining neuronal feature, namely electrical excitability, exists in cancer cells and impacts cancer progression remains mostly unexplored. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an archetypal example of a highly aggressive NE cancer and comprises two major distinct subpopulations: NE cells and non-NE cells 4,5 . Here we show that NE cells, but not non-NE cells, are excitable, and their action potential firing directly promotes SCLC malignancy. However, the resultant high ATP demand leads to an unusual dependency on oxidative phosphorylation in NE cells. This finding contrasts with the properties of most cancer cells reported in the literature, which are non-excitable and rely heavily on aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we found that non-NE cells metabolically support NE cells, a process akin to the astrocyte–neuron metabolite shuttle 6 . Finally, we observed drastic changes in the innervation landscape during SCLC progression, which coincided with increased intratumoural heterogeneity and elevated neuronal features in SCLC cells, suggesting an induction of a tumour-autonomous vicious cycle, driven by cancer cell-intrinsic electrical activity, which confers long-term tumorigenic capability and metastatic potential.",

          "abstract": "The development of new synthetic methodologies are instrumental for enabling the discovery of new medicines. Those methods that provide efficient access to structural alternatives for aromatic compounds (i.e., saturated arene bioisosteres), have become highly coveted.1,2,3,4 The incorporation of such bioisosteres typically leads to favorable drug-like properties and represents an emerging field of research. Here, we report a new synthetic method that furnishes one especially coveted motif, the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane scaffold,5,6 using mild reaction conditions and an operationally-simple protocol. The methodology proceeds via the uncommon coupling of two strained fragments: transiently-generated cyclic allenes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which possess considerable strain energies of ~30 kcal/mol7 and ~60 kcal/mol,6 respectively. The reaction is thought to proceed via a σ-bond insertion through a diradical pathway. However, rather than requiring an external stimulus to generate radical species, reactivity is thought to arise as a result of innate diradical character present in each reactant. This diradicaloid character,8 an underutilized parameter in reaction design, arises from the severe geometric distortions of each reactant. Our studies provide a means to access functionalized bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes of value for drug discovery, underscore how geometric distortion of reactants can be used to enable uncommon modes of reactivity, and should encourage the further exploration and strategic use of diradicaloids in chemical synthesis.",

In this Perspective, we present the strategic vision of the MorPhiC Consortium and discuss various strategies for generating null alleles, as well as the challenges involved. We describe the cellular models and scalable phenotypic readouts that will be used in the consortium’s initial phase, focusing on 1,000 protein-coding genes. The resulting molecular and cellular data will be compiled into a catalogue of null-allele phenotypes. The methodologies developed in this phase will establish best practices for extending these approaches to all human protein-coding genes.

          "abstract": "UM171 is a potent agonist of ex vivo human haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal 1 . By co-opting KBTBD4, a substrate receptor of the CUL3–RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, UM171 promotes the degradation of the LSD1–CoREST corepressor complex, thereby limiting haematopoietic stem cell attrition 2,3 . However, the direct target and mechanism of action of UM171 remain unclear. Here we show that UM171 acts as a molecular glue to induce high-affinity interactions between KBTBD4 and HDAC1/2 to promote corepressor degradation. Through proteomics and chemical inhibitor studies, we identify the principal target of UM171 as HDAC1/2. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of dimeric KBTBD4 bound to UM171 and the LSD1–HDAC1–CoREST complex identifies an asymmetric assembly in which a single UM171 molecule enables a pair of KELCH-repeat propeller domains to recruit the HDAC1 catalytic domain. One KBTBD4 propeller partially masks the rim of the HDAC1 active site, which is exploited by UM171 to extend the E3–neosubstrate interface. The other propeller cooperatively strengthens HDAC1 binding through a distinct interface. The overall CoREST–HDAC1/2–KBTBD4 interaction is further buttressed by the endogenous cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate, which acts as a second molecular glue. The functional relevance of the quaternary complex interaction surfaces is demonstrated by base editor scanning of KBTBD4 and HDAC1 . By delineating the direct target of UM171 and its mechanism of action, we reveal how the cooperativity offered by a dimeric CRL3 E3 can be leveraged by a small molecule degrader.",

          "abstract": "The use of reactive supports to disperse metal species is crucial for constructing highly efficient interfacial catalysts, by tuning the competitive reactant adsorption–activation pattern in supported metal catalysts into a non-competitive mechanism1,2,3. However, these reactive supports are prone to deterioration during catalysis, limiting the lifespan of the catalyst and their potential practical applications4. New strategies are needed to simultaneously protect reactive supports and surface metal species without compromising the inherent catalytic performance. Here we report a new strategy to augment the structural stability of highly active interfacial catalysts by using inert nano-overlays to partially shield and partition the surface of the reactive support. Specifically, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed inert oxide nano-overlays on a highly active Pt/γ-Mo2N catalyst can block the redundant surface sites of γ-Mo2N responsible for surface oxidation of this reactive support and the resulting deactivation. This strategy yields an efficient and highly durable catalyst for hydrogen production by methanol-reforming reaction with a mere 0.26 wt% Pt loading, exhibiting a record-high turnover number, to our knowledge, of 15,300,000 and a notable apparent turnover frequency of \\(\\mathrm{24,500}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{{\\rm{H}}}_{2}}\\,{\\text{mol}}_{{\\rm{metal}}}^{-1}\\,{\\text{h}}^{-1}\\).

Cognitive maps have been observed in the hippocampus 1 , but their algorithmic form and learning mechanisms remain obscure. Here we used large-scale, longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to record activity from thousands of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice learned to efficiently collect rewards from two subtly different linear tracks in virtual reality. Throughout learning, both animal behaviour and hippocampal neural activity progressed through multiple stages, gradually revealing improved task representation that mirrored improved behavioural efficiency. The learning process involved progressive decorrelations in initially similar hippocampal neural activity within and across tracks, ultimately resulting in orthogonalized representations resembling a state machine capturing the inherent structure of the task. This decorrelation process was driven by individual neurons acquiring task-state-specific responses (that is, ‘state cells’). Although various standard artificial neural networks did not naturally capture these dynamics, the clone-structured causal graph, a hidden Markov model variant, uniquely reproduced both the final orthogonalized states and the learning trajectory seen in animals. The observed cellular and population dynamics constrain the mechanisms underlying cognitive map formation in the hippocampus, pointing to hidden state inference as a fundamental computational principle, with implications for both biological and artificial intelligence.",

Owing to its distinct molecular structure and flexible hydrogen bonds that readily adapt to a wide range of pressures and temperatures, water forms numerous crystalline and amorphous phases4–6. Most relevant for the high pressures and temperatures of planetary interiors is ice VII4, and simulations have identified along its melting curve the existence of a so-called plastic phase7–12 where individual molecules occupy fixed positions as in a solid yet are able to rotate as in a liquid. Such plastic ice has not yet been directly observed in experiments. Here, we present quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements, conducted at temperatures between 450 and 600 K and pressures up to 6 GPa, that reveal the existence of a body centered cubic (bcc) structure, as found in ice VII, with water molecules exhibiting picosecond rotational dynamics typical for liquid water. Comparison with molecular dynamics simulations indicates that this plastic ice VII does not conform to a free rotor phase but rather exhibits rapid orientational jumps, as observed in jump-rotor plastic crystals13,14. We anticipate that our observation of plastic ice VII will impact our understanding of the geodynamics of icy planets and the differentiation processes of large icy moons.",

          "authors": "Jesús Avila, Federico Mayor Jr, Paola Bovolenta",
          "abstract": "Credit: Luis Davilla/Cover/Getty\n\nBiochemist Federico Mayor Zaragoza played a pivotal part in preventing inherited metabolic diseases in Spain, setting up the country’s first trials of the heel-prick test for newborn infants. In 1975, he co-founded the Centre for Molecular Biology (CBM) in Madrid, one of southern Europe’s pioneering research institutions. During his mandate as director-general of the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO from 1987 to 1999, and afterwards, Mayor contributed to crucial initiatives that shaped international educational and scientific policies. He has died aged 90.\n\nMayor was born in Barcelona in 1934 and his early years were marked by the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). His father — a self-made man with no academic training — rose to manage one of the first pharmaceutical companies to produce antibiotics in Spain. In 1950, Mayor moved to Madrid to study pharmacy. After earning a PhD in biochemistry in 1958, he became, in 1963, the youngest professor of biochemistry at the University of Granada, in southern Spain.\n\nIn 1966–67, on sabbatical in Oxford, UK, he met biochemist Louis Woolf, who had developed simple tests for the detection of some metabolic diseases, such as phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria causes severe learning difficulties in people who are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. However, Woolf had found that the disorder could be treated successfully with a special diet if detected early enough.\n\nmRNA drug offers hope for treating a devastating childhood disease\n\nOn his return to Granada, Mayor decided to work on molecular diseases that affected newborn babies, including phenylketonuria and other rare metabolic conditions. Along with his collaborators, he launched Spain’s first neonatal blood-screening tests in 1968. These screens have since helped to prevent thousands of cases of genetic and metabolic disease in the country.\n\nBalancing research with leadership roles, Mayor was the rector of the University of Granada between 1968 and 1972. In 1973, he was recruited to lead the Department of Molecular Biology at the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM), where he mentored a large number of young investigators. With help and inspiration of Spanish Nobel prizewinner Severo Ochoa, Mayor was a key co-founder and the first director of the CBM, a multidisciplinary institute that brought together his metabolism group at the UAM and prominent researchers in virology, molecular biology and developmental genetics. He also fostered a leading centre for the diagnosis of molecular diseases (CEDEM) at the UAM, focusing on the investigation and prevention of rare genetic diseases. The CEDEM is directed by his long-time collaborator Magdalena Ugarte.\n\nAfter Spain’s transition to democracy, Mayor was elected a member of the Spanish Parliament in 1977. He chaired the parliamentary committee for education and science and acted as an adviser to the country’s prime minister at the time, Adolfo Suárez. He later served as minister of education and science (1981–82), promoting measures to foster research at Spanish universities and earning accolades.\n\nAt UNESCO, Mayor focused on raising educational, scientific and cultural standards, emphasizing improvements in low- and middle-income nations in Africa and Latin America. For instance, he lent support to the World Declaration on Education for All in 1990, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999.",

          "abstract": "From CRISPR gene editing to protein-structure predictions driven by artificial intelligence, great innovations stem from interdisciplinary research. Solutions to climate change, biodiversity loss, health inequities and other global crises will also rely on insights that bridge many fields.\n\nYet interdisciplinary research is still sidelined in many countries. Even though these papers attract more citations1 and have more impact on research2, interdisciplinary research proposals tend to be less likely to receive funding than are those with a narrower scope3.\n\nSome countries have adjusted their research funding strategies accordingly. For example, between 2016 and 2018, UK research councils awarded 30% more grants to interdisciplinary investigators than they had a decade earlier, with 44% of funded projects in 2018 spanning at least two research subjects4. A similar move has been made in the United States: between 2015 and 2020, university departments that submitted some interdisciplinary grant proposals received almost five times more funding — in terms of total and individual awards — from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) than did those that submitted in only one discipline5.\n\n‘Male-dominated campuses belong to the past’: the University of Tokyo tackles the gender gap\n\nAlas, this isn’t the case in Japan. The nation’s funding agencies still mostly support research in tight disciplinary boundaries, such as engineering or chemistry. Specialists who evaluate these grant proposals tend to favour work in fields that they are familiar with over interdisciplinary studies they do not understand well.\n\nThis narrow approach is leading to substantial underfunding of interdisciplinary research in Japan. It also means that the nation is missing out on breakthroughs. Japan’s natural resources are limited, and its economy has long relied on science and technology. The decline in its research and innovation is unmistakable, as indicated by the country’s share of the world’s top 10% of most-cited research articles, which has dropped from 6% to 2% over the past two decades or so.\n\nAs scientists and engineers based in Japanese research institutions, we urge the government and funding agencies to do more to support interdisciplinary research — or risk eroding the country’s global standing in science and its economy. Here we highlight five directions to foster such a shift.\n\nFund people, not projects\n\nWe argue that Japanese funding agencies should pivot from funding projects to supporting talented researchers. Such a model has proven to be effective in leading institutions worldwide. For example, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s (HHMI) Investigator Program provides outstanding scientists with flexible, long-term funding to pursue high-impact biomedical research — some US$11 million over a seven-year term, which can be renewed. This approach has led to groundbreaking discoveries, including the mechanistic understanding of circadian rhythms, the computational prediction of protein folding and the discovery of RNA interference.\n\nJapanese research is no longer world class — here’s why\n\nSimilarly, in Germany, the Max Planck Society prioritizes curiosity-driven research that has long-term objectives over immediate applications. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and providing institute directors with generous internal funding, free from the continual need to secure external grants, this strategy has enabled breakthroughs including the development of CRISPR–Cas9 as a gene-editing tool and structural insights into ribosomes.\n\nJapan does have some programmes to support talented researchers, but these are too timid. The Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), for example, dedicate some funds to basic science and some to curiosity-driven research. But the JST adopts a top-down approach, which often favours research on trending topics and can miss more-original ideas or projects . And the annual budget for the JSPS’s main grant programme, the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI), has remained stagnant for the past decade. Adjusted for inflation and the weakening yen, the average funding per project has halved since 2013.\n\nHowever, one Japanese institution has adopted researcher-focused funding with great success: the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST). Unlike national universities, which are funded by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, OIST is a private university that is funded by Japan’s Cabinet Office. Launched in 2011, it has a horizontal organizational structure and a strong commitment to diversity and interdisciplinary collaboration (see ‘Steps to success’). OIST is now ranked as Japan’s leading research institute by the Nature Index, and around 20% of its publications involve contributions across more than one discipline. More Japanese institutions should follow its lead.\n\nSteps to success\n\nAt the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), faculty members receive core funding for five years — with flexibility in what to do with it. Unlike many other universities, in which laboratories must cover the costs of core facilities and technical staff, access to these resources at OIST is provided free of charge. This fosters collaboration and enables high-risk, high-reward projects. A review of each faculty member every five years ensures accountability, with continued support granted only to those who demonstrate significant achievements.\n\nOIST also operates without conventional departments, helping scientists from different fields to collaborate. The buildings host open spaces, lounges, shared kitchens and open desk areas that encourage casual interactions. PhD students must also rotate through multiple labs during their first year to widen their horizons. These rotations facilitate the exchange of ideas and technologies, embedding interdisciplinary collaboration into the fabric of the institution.\n\nAlthough further progress is needed, including in terms of gender and disability, OIST fosters a greater diversity in its community than do other Japanese institutions. This is partly because it attracts scholars from around the world. In 2024, more than 60% of faculty members and 80% of students at OIST were not Japanese citizens, bringing a dynamic mix of perspectives and expertise.\n\nEmbrace high-stakes projects\n\nInterdisciplinary research is often perceived as riskier than more conventional, single-discipline work. This might be because it can be hard to learn concepts and methods, and even communicate efficiently, across disciplines. And priorities between fields can conflict.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Japanese funding agencies should consider adopting a ‘high risk, high impact’ funding model, similar to that of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which anticipates a success rate of just 50%. They should recognize that even ‘unsuccessful’ high-risk projects can generate valuable knowledge, contributing to broader scientific and technological advancements. The DARPA funding model has inspired others, such as the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), launched in the NIH to drive biomedical breakthroughs6.\n\nHow to improve assessments of publication integrity\n\nAnother example is the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in California, which supports interdisciplinary teams comprising biologists, engineers and data scientists to work on ambitious goals, such as the eradication of infectious diseases. It provides substantial funding over several years to enable teams to pivot research directions in response to emerging challenges. Success is assessed through regular milestone-based evaluations. Projects that show limited potential are promptly terminated, ensuring that resources can be reallocated to more-promising endeavours.\n\nIn Japan, we are not advocating for existing funds to be redistributed. Rather, Japanese policymakers should allocate money to high-risk, high-reward projects from a separate pot, managed through dedicated DARPA-like programmes.\n\nExpand grant panels\n\nInitiatives such as the JST’s Diversity and Inclusiveness programme aim to lessen the homogeneity of the research workforce — for example, through awards and networking opportunities for women in science and by providing support or extensions for life events as well as for childcare and caregiving commitments — which tend to fall mostly on women (see page 295). This is laudable, but these efforts should be more widespread: they should be extended across genders and also include funding agency officers, programme managers and reviewers.\n\nThe crewed research submersible Shinkai 6500 has conducted more than 1,700 dives.Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nJapan’s funding agencies should also ensure that their own decision makers are less homogeneous in terms of their discipline, background, gender, age, nationality and culture. This would help to favour interdisciplinary research, which by nature weaves different approaches together and can benefit from being planned, conducted and assessed by a diverse community.\n\nThe role of immigration in boosting diversity should also be recognized.",

          "title": "Your brain is full of microplastics: are they harming you?",
          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "A sliver of human brain in a small vial starts to melt as lye is added to it. Over the next few days, the caustic chemical will break down the neurons and blood vessels within, leaving behind a grisly slurry containing thousands of tiny plastic particles.\n\nToxicologist Matthew Campen has been using this method to isolate and track the microplastics — and their smaller counterparts, nanoplastics — found in human kidneys, livers and especially brains. Campen, who is at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, estimates that he can isolate about 10 grams of plastics from a donated human brain; that’s about the weight of an unused crayon.\n\nMicroplastics have been found just about everywhere that scientists have looked: on remote islands, in fresh snow in Antarctica, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific, in food, in water and in the air that we breathe. And scientists such as Campen are finding them spread throughout the human body.\n\nLandmark study links microplastics to serious health problems\n\nDetection is only the first step, however. Determining precisely what these plastics are doing inside people and whether they’re harmful has been much harder. That’s because there’s no one ‘microplastic’. They come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and chemical compositions, each of which could affect cells and tissues differently.\n\nThis is where Campen’s beige sludge comes into play. Despite microplastics’ ubiquity, it’s difficult to determine which microplastics people are exposed to, how they’re exposed and which particles make their way into the nooks and crannies of the body. The samples that Campen collects from cadavers can, in turn, be used to test how living tissues respond to the kinds of plastic that people carry around with them.\n\n“Morbidly speaking, the best source I can think of to get good, relevant microplastics is to take an entire human brain and digest it,” says Campen.\n\nThe world is hungry for data — German consumers rated microplastics in food as their top environmental-health concern in 2023, for example. And negotiations on a global treaty that could cap plastics production are under way. Findings have trickled out slowly, hampered by insufficient analytical methods, contamination risks and a lack of collaboration between scientists in different fields. “There’s no cookbook at this point. There’s no manual of standard operating procedures,” says Kathleen Egan, a cancer researcher at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. “We’re having to make them up as we go, and it’s a process.”\n\nBut there are signs that scientists are ironing out these kinks, and that the field is maturing. Campen is one of a cadre of researchers developing unconventional methods and forming teams of interdisciplinary scientists. They are caught in a race against time. Plastics production, which began less than a century ago, reaches an all-time high each year, and the material takes hundreds, if not thousands, of years to degrade, which will create trillions of microplastics in the process.\n\n“There are microplastics everywhere,” says Bart Koelmans, an environmental chemist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. “We cannot run away from them.”\n\nPiling up\n\nThe term microplastics was coined 20 years ago, but only in the past 10 years have researchers progressed from studying the particles in the environment and animals to gauging their effects on human health, says Martin Wagner, a biologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “It’s a young field,” he says.\n\nCampen’s team has already found grim results: as the number of plastics created has increased sharply, so too has the concentration of microplastics found in the brain, liver and kidneys, according to his group’s results published in Nature Medicine this month1. On average, microplastic levels were about 50% higher in brain samples from 2024 than in 2016 samples. And brain samples contained up to 30 times more microplastics than samples from a person’s liver and kidneys.\n\nAir pollution and brain damage: what the science says\n\nAnother study published in January2 might offer clues as to how the particles congregate. Researchers fed mice water laced with microplastics and tracked the movements of the particles through the bodies of the mice. The researchers found that the plastics were gobbled up by immune cells, and ended up piling up in and blocking small blood vessels in the brain.\n\nWhat plastics do to human organs is subject to intense study. When scientists add microplastics to human tissue samples in the laboratory, it can result in cell death, immune reactions and tissue damage. And hundreds of studies have exposed animals — mainly aquatic organisms — to microplastics and found that the particles can clog their guts or hinder their ability to reproduce. On the basis of these findings, researchers suspect that these particles could be linked to cancer3, heart4 and kidney disease5, Alzheimer’s disease6 or fertility issues7 in people.\n\nBut there is no evidence yet that microplastics directly cause poor health in humans — only data that show a link. A landmark study4, published in March 2024, reported that nearly 60% of about 250 people who were undergoing heart surgery had micro- or nanoplastics in a main artery. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the three years after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\nBut, as the authors of the study acknowledge, the presence of plastic might correlate with other factors that would influence health, such as diet or socio-economic status.\n\nShifting sands\n\nThe field has grown in the past decade: for example, in 2014, there were 20 papers published that include the keyword ‘microplastics’ listed in Elsevier’s Scopus database. Nearly 6,000 were published in 2024. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued its first grant with the word ‘microplastics’ only seven years ago — in 2018. Since then, the agency has funded more than 45 projects.\n\nBut as money comes in and interest grows, researchers are still developing methods. This burst of innovation is exciting, says Phoebe Stapleton, a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, who studies the effects of plastics during pregnancy. But it also means that each team of scientists is developing and using different analytical approaches to detect and characterize microplastics. And there haven’t been many studies analysing each method’s reliability or validity.\n\nSamples of the types of microplastic that have been found in the Atlantic Ocean.Credit: Sophie Dingwall/eXXpedition\n\nThis lack of standardization makes it difficult to do a head-to-head comparison of studies by different groups, says Eliseo Castillo, a mucosal immunologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque who studies the particles’ effects on the digestive and immune systems.\n\nFor example, many studies use pristine microplastics — such as small spheres — that are not representative of the diversity of particles found in the environment. Some researchers argue that they are the most readily available and standardized set of microplastics available to use, whereas others say that they’re a waste of money because they are so different from what people are exposed to. “We defend our areas like crazy”, Campen says, and that can ultimately hinder the search for conclusive data. There are numerous variables in the plastics themselves, including size, shape and composition. And many are coated with one of more than 10,000 chemical additives to make them more flexible, flame retardant or degradable. Furthermore, plastics might affect each organ or cell type differently. A sharp microplastic fragment might be more damaging in the fragile lung environment than in the throat, for example.\n\nThe dose matters, too, as well as the route of ingestion, says Alison Elder, an inhalation toxicologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. “The inhalation route is a major concern because if inhaled plastics can get into the deep lung and cause an inflammatory reaction, they don’t need to go anywhere to cause health outcomes,” she says.\n\nWhile the field develops tools and works out the strengths and weaknesses of each one, it will be important for researchers to use multiple methods to confirm the characteristics of the particles that they’re finding, Stapleton says.\n\nMicro to nano\n\nOf particular concern are the smallest of plastics that get inhaled and ingested, says Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London. Particles of less than 1 micrometre across (see ‘Microplastics to scale’) have earned the name nanoplastics (some argue for a smaller cut-off of around 0.1 micrometres). Depending on the ingestion route, some data suggest that many particles larger than this pass through the digestive system and are excreted. Nanoplastics, however, might be taken into cells, in which the body doesn’t have established mechanisms to digest or expel them.\n\nSource (tools and costs): S. Primpke et al. Appl. Spectrosc. 74, 1012–1047 (2020).\n\nStapleton and her colleagues, for example, have found that during pregnancy the placenta does not serve as a barrier to nanoparticles in rats, and that nanoplastics cross from mother to fetus — and are quickly dispersed in fetal tissue8. It will be important to understand what the particles are doing there, Stapleton says, especially because they take up a disproportionate amount of space in a fetus compared with in a fully-grown adult.",

This historical isolation means that people from some parts of Greenland are more likely to develop certain genetic diseases than are people in other parts of the world.\n\nThe findings, published on 12 February in Nature1, offer “new insights” on how genetics can be used to deliver better health care to Arctic populations, says Anders Koch, a senior physician at Queen Ingrid’s Hospital in Nuuk.\n\nAmbitious survey of human diversity yields millions of undiscovered genetic variants\n\nSmall, Indigenous populations — including Greenland’s — have long been a blind spot in genetics research, because most of the DNA in genetic databases comes from people of European ancestry. What little research has been done on the island suggests that living in the Arctic has profoundly altered the genetic make-up of Greenlanders, most of whom have mixed Inuit and European ancestry.\n\nIn the current study, researchers sequenced the DNA of 5,996 Greenlanders — around 14% of the adult population. By comparing these full or partially sequenced genomes, the team was able to confirm that Greenland was originally populated by a small group of travellers, fewer than 300 people, who arrived from Siberia, via North America, in the past 1,000 years.\n\nAfter the first big push, Greenland’s inhabitants “didn’t roam the coastline”, says Koch. Instead, they “sort of lived within a particular confined area and developed their own traits and variants”. Some of these gene variants seem to be adaptations to life in the Arctic. For example, many Greenlandic Inuit have the same variant of a gene involved in metabolizing fatty acids2 — this might be linked to the consumption of foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as seal and whale meat.\n\nImpact of isolation",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nJapanese biologist Tatsuya Amano has always struggled with English. But he accepted that, as a scientist, he would need to make an extra effort to communicate his research in science’s lingua franca. After moving to the University of Cambridge, UK, as a postdoc studying biodiversity changes at the global scale, Amano realized that most of his colleagues whose first language was not English were facing the same challenges, spending considerably more time reading papers, polishing their manuscripts and preparing oral presentations than those who were fluent.\n\nHe also noticed that the quality of a paper was often conflated with the quality of English writing, leading to many rejections simply because certain language standards weren’t met. Amano identified this as a serious inequality issue, so he decided to speak up — and back up his message with data. In the past decade, he has published several papers investigating language barriers in science.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\nIn one such survey-based study, non-fluent English speakers reported that their papers were rejected 2.5 times as often as those of fluent speakers, owing to language-related issues1. Amano thinks that objectively measuring the effects of language barriers will bring more awareness to this often-hidden bias and pave the way for solutions. “It’s really hard for native English speakers to see, and let alone experience, how not being fluent in English is commonly viewed as the same as being inferior as a scientist,” he says.\n\nAmano, now a biodiversity researcher at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, tells Nature that science has a lot to lose by ignoring the inequalities caused by language barriers.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nIf I have to choose one, I’d say it’s Bill Sutherland, a conservation biologist at the University of Cambridge, because he has always shown me, and continues to show, how to make a real difference in the community. As a postdoc in his group, I watched him develop and lead the Conservation Evidence project, turning his idea of “having all the existing evidence on what works in conservation2 at your fingertips” into a reality. I was lucky to watch him build this huge project, actively involving and influencing many people around the world.\n\nHe is extremely solution-oriented. For example, when he realized that we needed to provide more training on the importance of evidence-based conservation practices for future generations, he quickly assembled a team of 117 educators from 23 countries to develop open-access teaching materials in several languages. If I hadn’t worked with Bill and seen the power of these actions, I probably would have asked myself, “As a conservation scientist, should I really be working on language barriers in science?” But thanks to Bill’s influence, I had confidence in his approach and did not hesitate to tackle this issue.\n\nWhen did you decide to address language-related inequalities in science?\n\nMy first language is Japanese, and I struggle to communicate in English. Even now, I find it tough to write in English and prepare lecture materials. It was even a challenge to get ready for this interview. Initially, I saw this as my own problem.\n\nBut then, after I moved to Cambridge, I realized that this issue applies to almost every non-fluent English speaker.\n\nOne day, I looked up the number of people in the world whose first language is not English. It was 95% of the world’s population. That’s a massive number. And I thought, surely we can’t dismiss an issue that is affecting the inclusion of that much of the world. But this is not being seriously considered in academia. And that was the moment when I thought I should make a real change in science to better include non-native English speakers.\n\nHow have you dealt with issues of discrimination personally and professionally?\n\nLast April, one of my co-authored papers was rejected because the level of English did not meet the journal’s standard. Unfortunately, this is still very common.\n\nFor a long time, many of us non-native English speakers assumed that such rejections were our own fault. And the entire scientific community has relied on individuals to overcome these barriers on their own. But I see this as a serious inequality issue, and it is costing the community because we are losing huge numbers of uniquely talented researchers. For example, many participants in our survey1 expressed frustration, anxiety and stress because they had to do science in English. They also reported that younger generations have not been able to pursue their academic careers owing to language barriers.\n\nHow Los Angeles neighbours partnered to show under-represented students the ‘unspoken rules’ to success\nThat’s why we have been advocating solutions to eliminate this kind of inequality — and that led us toreview the policies of more than 700 biological science journals3. We proposed a set of linguistically inclusive policies for them to take up. For example, we recommended allowing manuscripts and abstracts to be published in relevant languages and having a public statement that manuscripts will be fairly assessed regardless of the perceived standard of English. I'm trying to make these barriers visible to everyone and propose productive solutions.",

Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nA prominent US scientific society altered its website to remove references to diversity and equity ― terms targeted by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Articles about scientists who are members of under-represented groups also temporarily vanished from the site, although they have since reappeared.\n\nThe editing sparked an outcry among some of the more than 37,000 members of the organization, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) in Washington DC. Some ASM members note that other scientific societies have posted statements in support of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), rather than deleting terms targeted by White House orders.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\n“I feel sad, mad, disappointed,” says Carla Bonilla, a biologist at the University of San Diego, California, who was born in El Salvador. An article about her on the ASM website was briefly replaced with a notice saying ‘Under review’ before being restored. Bonilla has been a member of the ASM since 2015, and says that it had always been consistent in its support for scientists from diverse backgrounds. But now, she says, it feels “like they are trying to hide me”.\n\nIn an e-mail, ASM president Theresa Koehler told Nature that the organization had followed legal advice to review all of its webpages, in the hope of protecting its federally funded programmes. But Koehler acknowledged that the organization should have alerted members to the review. “We realize that our poor communication has hurt and confused people,” wrote Koehler. “We will learn from this, and we will do better.”\n\nTargeted terminology\n\nThe ASM took action after Trump ordered federal agencies to end “radical and wasteful” DEI programmes and to take down websites and other public platforms that “promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology”. In response, numerous US agencies took steps to scrub terms mentioned in Trump’s orders from their websites and from research papers under review. Trump’s directives extended beyond the federal government: he also told federal officials to identify “large non-profit corporations or associations” that have DEI programmes as targets for investigation.\n\nIn the first few days of February, scientists began noticing changes to the ASM’s website. For example, the page for the ASM’s ‘Inclusive Diversity with Equity, Access and Accountability Committee’ morphed into a page for a ‘Progress, Impact, Access and Accountability Committee’.\n\nExclusive: how NSF is scouring research grants for violations of Trump’s orders\n\nThe phrase “other marginalized groups in science and health care” was replaced with “other groups in science and health care” in an article on the ASM website titled ‘Women in the History of Antimicrobial Development’, which was written by Jennifer Goff, a microbiologist at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse. The original language was restored within hours of its removal, but “it’s particularly concerning that alterations were made to articles without contacting the authors to ask for permission”, says microbiologist and ASM member Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington.",

          "abstract": "Researchers have developed nanosensors that can detect signs of cancer in blood.Credit: Maskot/Getty\n\nResearchers have developed a simple blood test to detect pancreatic cancer before it spreads to other sites in the body. The test could be used for routine screening to improve the disease’s low survival rate1.\n\n“It’s a very pragmatic, really translatable solution” that builds on many advances in the field, says Simone Schürle-Finke, a biomedical engineer at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, Switzerland. The results are described in Science Translational Medicine today.\n\nMost pancreatic cancers begin in the ducts that secrete enzymes used to digest food. But this form of cancer often doesn’t cause recognizable symptoms and isn’t detectable until it has metastasized and spread, making it difficult to treat. In 2022, some 467,000 people died of the disease globally. “There is a huge need for developing new ways of detecting pancreatic cancer early,” says study co-author Jared Fischer, a molecular biologist at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland.\n\nTelltale proteins\n\nFischer and his colleagues focused on detecting enzymes called proteases, which break down proteins and are active in tumours, even from the very early stages. They specifically looked at the activity of matrix metalloproteinases involved in chewing up collagen and the extracellular matrix, which helps tumours to invade the body.\n\nTo detect the presence of these proteases in the blood, the researchers developed nanosensors containing a magnetic nanoparticle attached to a small peptide that attracts matrix metalloproteinases and a fluorescent molecule. They then placed millions of nanosensors in a tiny sample of blood. If matrix metalloproteinases were present, and active, they would chop the peptide in the nanosensors, releasing the fluorescent molecule. The researchers then used a magnet to suck out all the unchopped nanosensors, and measure how many chopped fluorescent particles were left. The more active proteases were present in the blood, the brighter the sample was.\n\nThe researchers tested the nanosensor on frozen blood samples from 356 individuals, some with pancreatic cancer, some with non-cancerous forms of pancreatic disease and healthy controls. The nanosensor correctly identified healthy individuals 98% of the time, and identified people with pancreatic cancer with 73% accuracy. It always distinguished between individuals with cancer and those with other pancreatic diseases.\n\nGiven that proteases are important for many bodily functions, Schürle-Finke did not expect the nanosensor to identify such a clear tumour signal in the blood. “I was really surprised to see that,” she says. The 73% sensitivity needs to be pushed higher before the sensors can be used by physicians, but overall, it is “a very promising, very impressive result”.",

          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "The Norwegian government wants to ensure that English does not replace Norwegian as the main language used in higher education.Credit: Getty\n\nResearchers in Norway have mounted a major legal challenge to the introduction of mandatory Norwegian language classes for foreign PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, arguing that the requirement violates labour laws and threatens to harm the country’s ability to compete internationally in research. Some critics view the law as part of a broader trend of protectionist policies emerging across an increasingly conservative Europe.\n\nAll doctoral and postdoctoral researchers hired from August this year who do not speak Norwegian, Danish or Swedish must complete 15 study points of Norwegian language training — about 3 months of study — during the period covered by their contracts.\n\nLast June, Oddmund Hoel, then Norway’s research and higher-education minister, said that the law aims to “preserve Norwegian as a professional language and prevent English from becoming the main language in Norwegian higher education”. The law came into force on 1 August 2024 with a 12-month implementation delay to give universities time to adjust to the regulations.\n\nBut critics say the mandatory language courses won’t achieve the intended goal. Instead, they argue, the law could harm Norway’s ability to attract and retain international talent by cutting into research time and making it more expensive for universities to hire from abroad.\n\n“Our principal investigators, postdocs and PhDs come from all over the world,” says Edvard Moser, a Nobel laureate who heads up the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. “These demands will make it difficult for us to recruit them.”\n\nLegal challenge mounted\n\nThe impact of the law could be considerable. In 2022, around 44% of PhD candidates and 74% of postdoctoral fellows at Norwegian higher-education institutions came from abroad.\n\nBut the law is unlikely to strengthen Norwegian as a scientific language, says Pierre Lison, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo. The three-month courses will help researchers with basic conversational skills, he says, but won’t provide the level of proficiency needed “to partake in academic discussions or write academic texts in Norwegian”.\n\nLast December, Lison and the Association of Doctoral Organizations in Norway, which represents local interest groups for early-career researchers, filed a complaint with the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, none of which are members of the European Union. The complaint argues that the language policy breaches EEA law, which guarantees free movement of workers within the EU and its partner countries.\n\nAlthough EEA law allows countries to have language requirements for jobs, such criteria must serve a legitimate public interest, be appropriate for achieving that goal and not go beyond what is necessary. The petitioners argue that Norway’s language law fails on the last two counts.\n\nNobel laureate Edvard Moser is one of dozens of researchers who are protesting against the language-proficiency requirements.Credit: Philip Toscano/PA Images/Alamy\n\nThe law fails to fulfil its purpose because the level of proficiency attained through the three-month courses will be insufficient to conduct academic work in Norwegian, it says. It is also disproportionate, the petition adds, because most PhD students and postdocs in Norway don’t need to speak Norwegian to do their jobs, and because it creates additional costs for universities, which will not be given extra funding to compensate.\n\n“Institutions are expected to pay for it but don’t have the resources, so they pass it on to research groups,” says Moser, one of 26 named researchers formally backing the complaint. He adds that using research grants for language courses could violate grant terms.\n\nProtectionism in disguise?\n\nThe surveillance authority could respond in several ways, Lison says. If it finds an infringement, it typically starts by discussing possible changes with authorities in Norway. If that fails, it could issue a formal opinion requiring Norway to comply with EEA law. The final step would be court action, although Lison hopes “it will not go this far” and the ministry will drop the requirement.\n\nThe complainants’ preferred solution is to make offering language courses mandatory for universities but to allow PhD students and postdocs to choose whether to enrol. But Lison thinks there is an ulterior motive to the law that goes beyond wanting to protect the Norwegian language.\n\n“This is essentially a protectionist employment policy in disguise,” he says. The law will lead to universities favouring domestic candidates when filling positions, because they will cost less and be able to assume a higher teaching load than will foreign candidates who need to take the language classes, he says.\n\nLison draws a parallel between Norway’s law and a plan submitted by the Dutch government to its parliament last May that aims to curb the number of undergraduate courses offered in English in the Netherlands. Ostensibly a move to bolster language skills, the proposal is “essentially a way to reduce the number of international students” and address the housing shortage in university cities such as Amsterdam, he says.\n\nIn a statement, the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research told Nature that it does not think the regulations are in breach of EEA law, and that its aim is to “preserve Norwegian as a fully functional national language”. Part of this means ensuring that teaching is done primarily in Norwegian, it said, however, “In recent decades, a large share of the newly recruited academic staff has been non-Norwegian speakers”.",

Randazzo works on NASA’s Mars rover science team, helping to collect and analyse mineral samples gathered by Perseverance.Credit: Nicolas Randazzo\n\nNicolas Randazzo is proud of his unusual title: Mars 2020 Perseverance rover postdoctoral scientist. He’s based at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, where he works with meteorite geologist Chris Herd. But Randazzo also collaborates with NASA’s Mars rover science team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas. Team members work together to collect and analyse remote visual and chemical data sent to Earth by the car-sized Perseverance rover, which landed in Jezero crater on 18 February 2021. He dreams of the day when samples of rocks and soil can be physically returned to Earth, allowing for more-detailed analysis to address questions including whether mineral samples hold evidence of life.\n\nTo prepare for the sample return, Randazzo also works on NASA’s analogue, or simulation, research. He is part of a team that orchestrates sample collection from Martian-like habitats on Earth, such as the Pilbara desert in Australia, to help refine understanding of how precious Mars samples should be handled in the future. Randazzo tells Nature about working with material from another planet and how he is planning for his career’s future, knowing that decades could pass before Martian samples get shipped back to Earth.\n\nHow does Perseverance help us to understand the Martian surface?\n\nPlanning for life on Mars\n\nEvery day, we’re moving along with the rover, exploring new environments and samples. I’m involved in studying Martian chemistry and sedimentology to better understand the ancient water flows and climate of the red planet, and gain clues about whether it held ancient life. The rover’s multiple instruments enable multidisciplinary exploration. The PIXL instrument uses X-ray fluorescence to determine the microscopic make-up of rocks. High-resolution cameras MastCam-Z and Supercam take zoomed in and out views of the Martian surface, atmosphere, rocks and soils. SHERLOC uses cameras, spectrometers and a laser to search for organic molecules and minerals altered by water. Wonderful high-resolution cameras allow us to look at geology in context and ask simple questions, such as, ‘Why is this mineral white or this mineral red?’ Wonderful people on the team stitch images together to make 3D models. You can put on a virtual-reality headset and simulate touching an outcrop of rock. There are a lot of great instruments, and a lot we can learn, but it’s always a team effort.\n\nWhat have you found recently?\n\nAn exciting find a few months ago was a surface covered in leopard-like spots. We discovered that their chemistry indicates the possibility of redox reactions — chemical reactions, involving the exchange of electrons, that are common and vital to life functions such as photosynthesis and respiration, but also to abiotic processes that are nothing to do with life, like corrosion or rusting. We also found a chemical signature suggestive of vivianite, a mineral often found in fossil shells, and other compounds that could suggest there is life — or was life. But we can’t say for sure. There are also potential non-life explanations. We don’t want to jump the gun, as happened in 1996 with the Allan Hills meteorite, which looked as if it contained worm-like fossils. Then-US president Bill Clinton announced in a speech that NASA had found possible evidence for Martian life. It turned out that the rock contained structures created by abiotic processes.\n\nA photo taken on 12 March 2024 by the Perseverance Mars rover of the Bunsen Peak rock, where the rover collected mineral-core and abrasion samples.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSS\nWhy do we need to bring Martian samples back to Earth?\n\nAs wonderful as Perseverance’s instruments are, nothing beats actually having samples here, to run analyses in laboratories, with higher precision. For example, none of the instruments on Mars are doing stable isotope analyses, which could tell us more about how warm and wet Mars was in the past, using oxygen and carbon isotopes. To look at isotopes of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and strontium, you must bring rocks here. The same goes for radiometric dating to estimate when a rock was deposited. We can’t do that work on Mars. Bringing samples home is infinitely more valuable than anything remote science can tell us.\n\nWhen will a mission bring samples back?\n\nThere is more than a bit of uncertainty about that. The original plan for Mars Sample Return was the early 2030s. Now it seems it’s been pushed to the 2040s and it’s going to be more expensive than originally predicted. Plus, there is competition with other missions. It’s always a balance between finances and time, and there’s been an open call to industry partners to see if they’re willing to invest in making it happen.\n\nHow do you plan for your future work, given that sample return could be 20 years away?\n\nIs there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us\n\nA lot of research questions come up minute-by-minute, as we see the remote samples. We’ll be driving the rover, find something interesting, scrape the rock’s surface to get a sample and then see what it looks like geologically and chemically by doing a PIXL scan. Then, if it’s deemed worthwhile, the rover collects a physical sample that is stored in a titanium tube. Some of the sample tubes are stored inside the rover and, just in case of catastrophic losses, back-up samples are also placed on the Martian ground in a cache at the Three Forks sample depot in Jezero Crater.\n\nMuch of the Perseverance work here on Earth focuses on: how do we handle samples if and when we get them back? What’s the order of analyses we’re going to do?\n\nA close-up of the core sample taken from the Bunsen Peak rock.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nIn some ways, there are advantages to the samples’ return being far into the future. Right now, we can detect sulfur compounds at the parts per billion or parts per trillion level — something that, decades ago, was almost unimaginable. So, 10–15 years from now, there will be more-precise techniques.\n\nA lot of careers will open up because of materials brought back. In 2022, scientists opened a tube from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission to the Moon. I had the opportunity to hold that tube in my hands during a recent tour of the Apollo lab at the JSC. The Apollo missions came back more than 50 years ago, but there are studies being done now on the material they brought that weren’t possible then. The same will happen with Mars samples — there will be analyses and work for decades to come.",

The particle — which probably came from a distant galaxy — was spotted by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), a collection of light-detecting glass spheres on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, on 13 February 2023. Researchers monitoring the telescope did not notice the detection until early 2024, when they completed the first analysis of their data. They unveiled it as a potentially record event last year at a conference in Milan, Italy, but did not disclose details such as the timing, direction or energy of the neutrino.\n\n“We had to convince ourselves that it wasn’t something strange or weird with the telescope,” says Paschal Coyle, a neutrino physicist at Aix-Marseille University in France and KM3NeT spokesperson. The result was published on 12 February in Nature1, and will be described in four preprints due to be posted on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nHigh-energy neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are electrically neutral particles more than one million times lighter than an electron. They are typically produced in nuclear reactions such as those at the centre of the Sun, from which they emerge with energies on the order of millions of electronvolts (106 eV). But for more than 10 years, researchers have been recording neutrinos carrying unprecedented energies of up to several quadrillion electronvolts (1015 eV, or 1 petaelectronvolt), which are thought to originate in distant galaxies. (The most energetic particle ever detected, at 320,000 PeV, was not a neutrino but a cosmic ray dubbed the Oh-My-God particle.)\n\n‘Fantastic’ particle could be most energetic neutrino ever detected\n\nKM3NeT consists of strings of sensitive light detectors anchored to the sea floor at a depth of around 3,500 metres off the coast of the Italian island of Sicily, as well as in a second, smaller array near Toulon, France. These sensors pick up light emitted by high-energy, electrically charged particles such as muons. Muons are continuously raining down on Earth’s surface, because they are produced when cosmic rays hit air molecules. But occasionally, a cosmic neutrino that smashes into the planet’s surface also produces a muon.\n\nIn the February 2023 event detected by the Sicily observatory, the team estimated that the muon carried 120 PeV of energy, on the basis of the unusual amount of light it produced. The particle’s path was close to horizontal with respect to Earth’s surface and travelled eastwards, towards Greece.\n\nSource: Ref. 1Source: Aiello, S. et al. Nature 638, 376–382 (2025).",

          "abstract": "The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world.Credit: imageBROKER/Alamy\n\nThe Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) — one of the world’s largest private funders of basic biomedical research — has abruptly cancelled a US$60-million initiative to boost diversity in university science programmes and scrubbed all mention of the effort from its website.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nIn doing so, the funder has terminated grants to 104 US universities approximately midway through the programme’s six-year funding cycle, without any explanation. The move has unsettled many scientists, who are reeling after US President Donald Trump issued a stream of executive orders in the past few weeks targeting “illegal” diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies and funding across the country, saying that the policies diminish “the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society”. In response, US science agencies have ordered staff members to strip DEI mentions from government websites and are scrutinizing federal research grants for violations, with an eye towards revising or cancelling them.\n\nThat such a massive private funder, which doesn’t receive federal funding, is cutting support at such a sensitive time “is so disappointing”, says Danielle Beckman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Davis. “Now is the time that we need private funders to fill the gap that the new administration has left” by threatening public science funding.\n\nA spokesperson for the HHMI, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, confirmed that the institution terminated the initiative, called Inclusive Excellence 3 (IE3), on 5 February, adding that the HHMI “remains committed to supporting outstanding scientists and talented students training to become scientists” through its other programmes. The spokesperson did not address Nature’s queries about why IE3 was cancelled, why HHMI deleted all its webpages referencing the programme or scientists’ distress over its termination.\n\nA ‘safe haven’?\n\nWith a $24-billion endowment, the HHMI is the second-wealthiest medical-research foundation in the world. Its prominent Investigator Program offers each recipient $11 million over a renewable seven-year term to conduct groundbreaking research.\n\nRNA biologist loses disability case against Howard Hughes Medical Institute\n\nIts IE3 initiative grouped its awardee universities into seven ‘learning communities’ to encourage collaboration on projects. Each community, consisting of about 15 US institutions, received nearly $9 million and was tasked with deciding how and where to allocate that money. For example, one of the communities was working to build more robust peer-mentoring programmes to improve student outcomes.\n\nAlthough the HHMI did not say why it ended IE3, Trump’s 21 January order on DEI might have played a part. The order calls for US agencies to encourage the private sector to end “illegal DEI discrimination”. He directed each agency to produce, within four months, a list of up to nine companies, non-profit organizations, “foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more” or other private institutions for potential civil-compliance investigations.\n\nTo understand the importance of IE3, Nature reached out to nine researchers listed as a principal investigator on one of the programme’s grants. Some did not respond, and the others either declined to comment or requested anonymity because they feared drawing attention to their university in the current political climate.\n\nIn the United States, “we know we have a problem retaining STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] students, especially with how COVID interrupted schooling”, and this money helped to bring institutions together to address the problem, says one researcher. “All the momentum we had built — gone.”\n\nThe decision has left scientists in a bind, because it seems that federal funding for research related in any way to DEI will dry up after Trump’s crackdown. “There were rumours this would happen to federally funded grants, but many people thought that private foundations might be a safe haven from all that,” the same researcher says.\n\nThe fact that the HHMI not only ended IE3, but also wiped all traces of it off its website was particularly disheartening, Beckman says. “It’s like it never existed.” And sometime in the past six months, the HHMI deleted a landing page on which it stated its commitment to DEI and posted demographic data about its grantees and staff members.",

          "abstract": "One of the buildings on the US National Institutes of Health’s campus in Bethesda, Maryland, is a hospital dedicated to medical research.Credit: Bob Korn/Alamy\n\nA US judge has blocked a policy that would have, beginning today, slashed billions of dollars of funding annually for US research institutions, including universities and hospitals. The action is in response to lawsuits filed by 22 US states and a coalition of universities earlier today contending that the policy was illegal and would cause “cutting-edge work to cure and treat human disease” to “grind to a halt”.\n\nChaos erupts in US science as Trump’s team declares freeze on federal grants\n\nThe policy, announced on 7 February by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), would have cut ‘research overhead’ costs to 15% for new and existing grants. Last year, the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, awarded US$26 billion directly to scientists for laboratory expenses, including staff salaries, equipment and reagents; $9 billion went to these overhead, or indirect, costs to help institutions run their facilities and cover administrative fees. The historical average indirect-costs rate has been about 40%, reaching up to 75% at some institutions.\n\nThe steep cut attempted by the NIH comes as the administration of US President Donald Trump, in partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, is targeting federal spending and attempting to dismantle agencies such as the US Agency for International Development, which funds global disease research, prevention and care. In the past few weeks, Trump’s team tried to freeze federal grants, sowing chaos and confusion throughout the US scientific community, but federal judges have so far blocked this effort. Musk said on Friday that wealthy universities getting high rates for indirect costs is “a ripoff” on the social-media platform X, which he owns.\n\nThe 15% cap is necessary to “ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead”, according to a memorandum from the office of acting NIH director Matthew Memoli announcing the change.\n\nThe attorneys general of the states that sued are Democrats, although Trump, a Republican, won five of those states in last year’s presidential election. The effects of the policy would be “immediate and devastating”, the lawsuit said. “This agency action will result in layoffs, suspension of clinical trials, disruption of ongoing research programs, and laboratory closures.”\n\nJudge Angel Kelley’s orders temporarily prevent the NIH from enacting its policy nationwide; she set a hearing for 21 February to further consider the petitions.\n\n‘Generational restructuring’\n\nBy Monday, some research institutions had already taken precautionary measures in response to the cut. In an e-mail seen by Nature, the University of Florida in Gainesville, which has an indirect-costs rate of 52.5%, told its staff members that new awards and the projects they fund at the 15% rate would be frozen, because its accounting department has not been authorized to charge the agency the lower rate.\n\nThe US is the world’s science superpower — but for how long?\n\nResearchers say that the policy would upend the biomedical-research ecosystem. Alondra Nelson, who directed the US Office of Science and Technology Policy for eight months under former US president and Democrat Joe Biden, wrote on the social-media platform Bluesky that the policy would lead to a “generational restructuring” of the US research and development ecosystem.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, was already losing money on federally funded clinical trials, and relied on philanthropy to make up the difference, says Charles Roberts, director of the hospital’s cancer centre. The NIH rate cut would cost the hospital nearly $40 million more each year, he says. “This will likely mean that fewer experimental treatments will get to children,” he adds. “More children will die.”\n\nThe NIH referred Nature to its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for comments on the lawsuits. It also did not answer questions from Nature about whether it would give more money to researchers for their direct costs to make up for the cap. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said that the agency does not discuss ongoing litigation and declined to answer Nature’s inquiries regarding the lawsuits or scientists’ concerns about the indirect-costs policy.\n\nA question of cost\n\n‘Direct costs’ paid for by research grants help scientists to buy equipment for specific projects and cover the salaries of lab personnel. But research institutions also need to pay for air conditioning, electricity, computing resources, hazardous-waste disposal, administrative personnel and much more to support these projects.\n\nMajor biomedical funder NIH poised for massive reform under Trump 2.0\n\nTo help cover these essential utilities and resources, the federal government has since 1947 been adding ‘indirect costs’ to research grants. These rates ranged from 8% to about 20% until 1965, when individual institutions began negotiating their own rates with the HHS. For example, on a $1.2-million grant, a 20% indirect-costs rate would mean that $200,000 goes to the university to pay for overheads.\n\nThese rates have risen steadily since the 1960s, in part because of an increasing number of regulations governing lab research and how federal funds are spent. The regulations include measures to ensure data privacy; protect animal welfare and human participants in research; and govern international collaborations.",

          "title": "Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch",
          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "For Kristian Cook, every pizza box he opened was another door closed on the path to overcoming obesity. “I had massive cravings for pizza,” he says. “That was my biggest downfall.”\n\nAt 114 kilograms and juggling a daily regimen of medications for high cholesterol, hypertension and gout, the New Zealander resolved to take action. In late 2022, at the age of 46, Cook joined a clinical trial that set out to test a combination of the weight-loss drug semaglutide — better known by its brand names, Ozempic or Wegovy — and an experimental drug designed to preserve muscle while shedding fat.\n\nMuscle loss is a big concern for people on anti-obesity medications such as semaglutide. These ‘GLP-1 agonists’ mimic a natural gut hormone — glucagon-like peptide 1 — to suppress appetite and regulate metabolism. But reducing calories leads to an energy deficit, which the body often makes up for by burning muscle. The experimental drug that Cook received, called bimagrumab, seems to counteract this muscle loss.\n\nObesity drugs: huge study identifies new health risks\n\nIt’s one of more than 100 anti-obesity drug candidates that are in various stages of development. The next wave of medications, which are likely to hit pharmacy shelves in the next few years, resemble drugs that are already on the market. But close behind are numerous therapies being developed specifically for their muscle-sparing weight-loss potential. Dozens more are aimed at different biological pathways and could redefine obesity treatment in decades to come.\n\n“We’re working to create the next generation of healthy weight-loss solutions,” says Philip Larsen, who played a key part in the early development of GLP-1 drugs and is now chief executive of SixPeaks Bio, an obesity-focused start-up company in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe surge in anti-obesity drug development has been made possible by the blockbuster success of semaglutide and its rival drug tirzepatide — sold as Zepbound or Mounjaro. These drugs have unlocked the potential for a global market that is projected to surpass US$100 billion by the end of the decade.\n\nBut semaglutide and tirzepatide have limitations. They require weekly injections and frequently cause unpleasant side effects, with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea being particularly common. Long term, the loss of muscle mass and the likelihood of weight regain after stopping therapy are also issues. What’s more, the drugs don’t work sufficiently for an estimated 10–30% of people who take them.\n\nEmerging therapies aim to amplify weight loss, improve tolerability, ensure long-lasting effects and find options for a broader range of individuals (see ‘Next up in obesity drugs’). “We’re going to see that there are different medicines that work better for different groups of people,” says Louis Aronne, an obesity specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who consults for drug makers.\n\nNext up in obesity drugs\n\nExpected dates of US approval for new types of weight-loss drugs heading to market.\n\nEstimated yearDrugCompanyDescription2026OrforglipronEli LillyAn oral, small-molecule drug that activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor.2026CagriSemaNovo NordiskAn injectable that activates the amylin and GLP-1 receptors.2027SurvodutideBoehringer IngelheimAn injectable that activates the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors.2027RetatrutideEli LillyAn injectable that activates GLP-1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon receptors.2028 and beyondMariTideAmgenAn injectable that activates the GLP-1 receptor while blocking GIP signalling.2028 and beyondBimagrumabEli LillyAn injectable that blocks receptors involved in myostatin signalling.2028 and beyondMonlunabantNovo NordiskAn oral drug that inhibits the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.\nDiverse routes, same pursuit\n\nSemaglutide and tirzepatide are often lumped together under the umbrella of GLP-1 drugs, but they differ in one key regard: tirzepatide mimics not only GLP-1 but also a complementary hormone called gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). This hormone further revs up energy metabolism and affects how the body stores and burns nutrients. Tirzepatide’s dual action is thought to contribute to its superior weight-loss results.\n\nIn a large head-to-head trial, sponsored by tirzepatide’s maker Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, participants who took tirzepatide lost an average of 20% of their body weight, outpacing the 14% reduction achieved with semaglutide, which is produced by the pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark. “We believe there’s a homeostatic mechanism, like a thermostat, that we each have that is set to a certain body weight, and it’ll drive hunger until we achieve that,” says Dan Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly. But, he says, drugs such as tirzepatide can override this natural mechanism.\n\nInspired by tirzepatide’s success, many companies are advancing other drugs that engage GLP-1 and GIP receptors. At least five tirzepatide-like therapies are progressing through clinical trials, with the first expected to hit the market by 2028. Patients and clinicians alike “need an array of options”, says Ron Renaud, chief executive of Kailera Therapeutics, a biotechnology start-up in Waltham, Massachusetts, which has a tirzepatide-like therapy in advanced-stage clinical testing.\n\nWhy do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?\n\nIn addition to dual activators, such as tirzepatide, there are also drug candidates such as MariTide (produced by the biopharmaceutical company Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California) that instead block GIP signalling while still activating GLP-1. It might seem counterintuitive that both approaches could work. But Jonathan Campbell, a metabolism researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, explains metabolism in terms of a vehicle’s fuel consumption on the motorway: pushing the accelerator hard, as with GIP activation, burns energy inefficiently, depleting resources faster than they can be replenished. Conversely, driving without fully releasing the handbrake creates constant friction, much like blocking GIP, which introduces inefficiencies by forcing the system to work harder to maintain speed.\n\n“In terms of weight control, anything that makes you less efficient is going to be a positive,” says Campbell, who receives research funding from drug companies. But he cautions that the wider consequences of each strategy remain uncertain. Because GIP also plays a part in bone health, there are concerns that blocking GIP signalling could adversely affect bone health. There are also lingering questions about the long-term effects of drastic weight loss on the rest of the body, including on muscle, metabolic flexibility and organ health.\n\nAlthough drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack and other cardiovascular problems, as well as alleviate sleep apnoea and improve liver function, they have also been tied to conditions such as arthritis and pancreatitis. The unknown risks, particularly in diverse populations and with prolonged use, lead some clinicians to favour established surgical solutions, such as bariatric surgery.\n\nBut uncertainty hasn’t dissuaded pharmaceutical companies from pursuing an expanding array of hormone targets. These include other gut-derived hormones such as peptide YY, which is known for its ability to make you feel full, and pancreas-released hormones such as glucagon and amylin, which could complement GLP-1–based therapies by boosting energy expenditure, stabilizing blood sugar levels and further suppressing appetite.\n\nWorking together\n\nMany strategies in development target multiple pathways simultaneously. The combination therapy CagriSema, for example, pairs a long-acting analogue of amylin with semaglutide. Participants in a 68-week, phase III trial lost an average of nearly 23% of their body weight with this approach, according to Novo Nordisk, the company behind the drug.\n\nIf ongoing trials are successful, CagriSema, along with agents that combine GLP-1 and glucagon activity, such as survodutide from the pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim in Ingelheim, Germany, could secure regulatory approval as early as 2026 or 2027. However, their impact might be eclipsed by yet another contender. In phase II testing, Eli Lilly’s retatrutide — dubbed ‘triple G’ for its ability to target GLP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors — delivered an average weight reduction of 24% after 48 weeks, setting a new benchmark for obesity treatments1 (see ‘Shedding weight’).\n\nSources: Weg.: J.

Activating multiple pathways could allow for lower doses that achieve the same weight loss with fewer side effects.\n\nCompanies are also exploring alternatives to once-a-week injections, which can be difficult to incorporate into people’s routines and come with manufacturing challenges. Once-monthly injectables are in the works, but GLP-1 pills — led by a drug called orforglipron produced by Eli Lilly — could arrive first, hitting the market as soon as next year. In a phase II, 36-week study, participants lost up to 15% of their body weight with the once-daily oral option2.\n\nLess familiar targets\n\nAlthough gut hormones continue to be the cornerstone of drug development for obesity, large-scale genetic sequencing has been one source of inspiration for emerging targets. In 2021, scientists at the biotech company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, New York, led an analysis of DNA from nearly 650,000 individuals and uncovered a rare gene variant linked to low body weight3. The following year, researchers at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, led a study that pinpointed a mutation in a gene called INHBE. The mutation is associated with low waist-to-hip ratio, a measure that reflects a healthier fat distribution in the body4. Companies are now trying to develop drugs that replicate the metabolic benefits of these genetic variants.\n\nHow ‘miracle’ weight-loss drugs will change the world\n\nOld targets are also getting renewed attention. One example is the cannabinoid receptor CB1, originally pursued after researchers discovered its role in marijuana-induced appetite stimulation, commonly known as the munchies. In the late-2000s, a drug designed to counteract this effect was briefly sold in Europe as a weight-loss therapy. But inhibiting cannabinoid receptors in the brain was associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in some people. The drug, known as rimonabant, was withdrawn from the market after less than three years, and rival companies abandoned similar candidates.\n\nBut George Kunos, a neuroendocrinologist at the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Maryland, never gave up on the cannabinoid-blocking strategy. Around 15 years ago, his team and others demonstrated in rodents that much of the anti-obesity effects of CB1 inhibitors came from metabolic pathways in the liver, muscle, pancreas and other organs outside the brain. If a drug such as rimonabant could be chemically modified to prevent it from crossing the blood–brain barrier, it might deliver metabolic benefits without the serious side effects.\n\nKunos’s laboratory created such a next-generation cannabinoid blocker, now known as monlunabant and being advanced by Novo Nordisk. Last year, phase II trial results indicated that monlunabant can still cause anxiety, irritability and sleep disturbances. Even so, Kunos predicts that drug makers will “arrive at a dose that causes significant weight reduction with acceptable levels of side effects”.\n\nBig flex",

          "authors": "Kaori Hayashi",
          "abstract": "Last year, my colleagues and I displayed a provocative poster across the campus of the University of Tokyo (UTokyo), sparking both delight and dismay among staff and students alike. It featured a large letter ‘Q’ at its centre, for question, and challenged viewers with this enquiry: “Why are there so few women at the University of Tokyo?”\n\nIndeed, some 90% of the university’s full professors, 83% of its associate professors and — perhaps even more shockingly — 77% of its undergraduate students are men. These numbers echo those throughout the country’s higher-education institutions. Many campuses across the world similarly struggle with gender and other imbalances.\n\nJapan can be a science heavyweight once more — if it rethinks funding\n\nAs the executive vice-president of the university, leading its diversity efforts and global affairs, I have spent the past four years struggling with this inequity. The poster was part of a larger effort to improve recognition across the campus community, prompt reflection on such a skewed ratio and promote change. Although Japan’s constitution guarantees women equal rights, men have historically dominated society, including on campuses. This imbalance cannot continue.\n\nThis is why, in 2022, my colleagues and I launched the #WeChangeUTokyo programme, aimed at driving institutional change through five key actions.\n\nFirst, raise awareness among those that make up the majority of UTokyo’s community — Japanese men. Studies show that members of over-represented groups are more likely to not notice a lack of diversity, whether deliberately or not, and do not always welcome diversity, equity and inclusion efforts that they think they don’t benefit from (A. Iyer Soc. Personal. Psychol. Compass 16, e12666; 2022). We introduced initiatives to improve gender awareness, including unconscious-bias training to improve hiring processes and retention. We run courses to familiarize participants with gender stereotypes, and have workshops on consent and dealing with sexual harassment.\n\nSecond, support women in research. We do this through networking opportunities that improve people’s career-development prospects, and provide financial support for travel for those with caring commitments. These funds are available to all, but benefit mostly women, who disproportionately take on caring responsibilities for children, elder family members and others in Japan. And we offer mentorship programmes to help women to navigate their academic and professional journeys.\n\nAre women in research being led up the garden path?\n\nThird, set numerical targets. We aim to increase the proportion of women in faculty from 18% in May 2024 to 25% by the end of the 2027 academic year. Some critics argue that this target is too modest — why not 50%, because women comprise half of humanity? But, on the basis of data from the past 20 years, my colleagues and I think that this would be too big a jump right now. Setting realistic goals instead, then building on those, will be more effective.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "Credit: Monty Rakusen/Getty\n\nLast Thursday, 30 January, bioinformatician Niema Moshiri received a late-night message from a long-time collaborator urging him to back up the website of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). At the time, rumours had been circulating that the public-health agency, which tracks disease outbreaks and makes its data publicly available, would start removing pages from its website, in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump directing government departments to take down public information on gender and diversity.\n\nMoshiri, who is based at the University of California, San Diego, and is a self-described “data hoarder” who creates backups of his personal videos and online receipts and bills, was happy to help. “I never thought I would have to do it for information pages from the federal government,” he says.\n\nIn the past week, some US federal government websites containing important data sets and information on public health and demographics have been taken down, including those for global programmes to combat HIV and national surveys of chronic disease. Some have been reinstated; others not. “It was kind of shocking to me that they would just delete pages willy-nilly,” says Moshiri.\n\nMoshiri is one of dozens of researchers in the United States and globally who are scrambling to capture public information on US federal government websites before it is tampered with or disappears. “A lot of people did similar parallel efforts, especially within their own areas of expertise,” says virologist Angela Rasmussen, who is based at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, and was the collaborator who messaged Moshiri. She stayed up till 2 a.m. last Friday manually downloading data sets, such as on influenza surveillance. Having created these backups, researchers are now working out how to make them publicly available, she adds.\n\nThe CDC and its parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, say that all changes to their websites are in accordance with Trump’s executive orders.\n\nGlobal effort\n\nOver the weekend, Moshiri got in touch with Charles Gaba, a health-care policy and data analyst based near Detroit, Michigan.\n\nMoshiri helped Gaba to create an alphabetical list of every CDC web link — amounting to more than 7,000 pages, which Gaba manually redirected to the version on the Wayback Machine, a service maintained by Internet Archive, a non-profit organization based in San Francisco, California, that regularly archives web pages, including material from government websites such as that of the CDC. Gaba then posted the entire list on his blog. “It took a couple of days,” says Gaba. “A lot of it is vital, and you don’t know what’s still there, what isn’t there.” Gaba has since posted a similar list of the entire website for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), organized by subject.\n\nOn his hard drive, Moshiri now has backups of the CDC’s website and data sets, as well as the websites for the FDA and other government agencies. Some of these he downloaded himself and others were first downloaded and shared by others online. He is also in the process of backing up the US Department of Agriculture’s website — all of these sites amount to hundreds of thousands of files and more than 130 gigabytes of uncompressed data, and yet all could fit on a USB flash drive. “These are pretty tiny,” he says.\n\nMoshiri hasn’t shared his backups publicly. If his university agrees that it falls within his role as a faculty member, Moshiri wants to publish an exact untouched copy of the CDC website. And his long-term goal is to back up every federal-government website. “I have 100 terabytes of storage under my desk. In theory, I could stick all of these on.”\n\nKendra Albert, an attorney with the public-interest technology and media law firm Albert Sellars LLP in Philadelphia, says that works produced by federal government employees as part of their jobs are in the public domain. Generally speaking, it is legal to download government data sets, make backups of government websites and share them, they say. In circumstances in which copyrighted material is included in those data, making copies and sharing them would often fall under the doctrine of fair use if it is done for the purposes of research, advocacy or as a historical record to show what the site looked like at an earlier date, says Albert.\n\nInternet Archive also supports an initiative, known as the End of Term Web Archive, to archive government web pages at the beginning and end of every US presidential term. James Jacobs, a librarian at Stanford University in California who works on the archive, hopes that it could become a central place for the public to access scientists’ archives of government websites.",

The results are described in a preprint posted on the arXiv1 server.\n\n“I imagine it won’t be long before computers are getting full marks on the IMO,” says Kevin Buzzard, a mathematician at Imperial College London.\n\nSolving problems in Euclidean geometry is one of four topics covered by IMO problems — the others cover the branches of number theory, algebra and combinatorics. Geometry problems demand specific skills of an artificial intelligence (AI), because competitors must provide a rigorous proof for a statement about geometric objects on a plane. Last July, AlphaGeometry 2 made its public debut alongside a new system, AlphaProof, which DeepMind developed to solve the non-geometry questions in the IMO problem sets.\n\nMathematical language\n\nAlphaGeometry comprises a combination of components that include a specialized language model and a ‘neuro-symbolic’ system — one that does not train by learning from data, as neural networks do, but that has abstract reasoning coded in by humans. The team trained the language model to speak a formal mathematical language, which makes it possible to automatically check its output for logical rigour — and to weed out ‘hallucinations’, the incoherent or false statements that AI chatbots are prone to making.\n\nFor AlphaGeometry 2, the team made several improvements, including the integration of Google’s state-of-the-art large language model, Gemini. The team also introduced the ability for the AI to reason by moving geometric objects around a plane — allowing it to move a point along a line to change the height of a triangle, for instance — and for it to solve linear equations.\n\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad is a prestigious annual competition for gifted high-school students.Credit: Valerie Kuypers/AFP via Getty\n\nThe system was able to solve 84% of all geometry problems set in IMOs over the past 25 years, compared with the 54% achieved by the original AlphaGeometry. (Teams in India and China used different approaches last year to achieve gold-medal-level performance in geometry, but on a smaller subset of IMO geometry problems2,3.)\n\nThe authors of the DeepMind paper write that future improvements to AlphaGeometry will include dealing with maths problems that involve inequalities and non-linear equations, which will be required to fully “solve geometry”.",

The findings, published today in Nature Medicine1, raise questions about the role of the proteins that ravage the brain during the disease and the drugs that target them.\n\nSince 2011, a study called the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) has been following a family in which many members have a mutation in a gene called PSEN2. The mutation causes the brain to produce versions of the amyloid protein that are prone to clumping into the sticky plaques thought to drive neurodegeneration. Family members with the mutation invariably develop Alzheimer’s at around age 50.\n\nThis is how an Alzheimer’s gene ravages the brain\n\nThen, a 61-year-old man from this family showed up at the DIAN study’s clinic with full cognitive function, and the researchers were shocked to discover that he had the fateful PSEN2 mutation. The man’s mother had had the same mutation, as had 11 of her 13 siblings; all had developed dementia around age 50.\n\nThe researchers were even more shocked when scans revealed that his brain looked like that of someone with Alzheimer’s. “His brain was full of amyloid,” says behavioural neurologist and study co-author Jorge Llibre-Guerra at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nWhat the man’s brain didn’t contain, however, were clusters of tau — another protein that forms tangled threads inside neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans revealed that he had a small amount of abnormal tau and that it was only in the occipital lobe, a brain region involved in visual perception that is not usually affected in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nCognitive resilience\n\nOver the course of ten years, Llibre-Guerra and his colleagues ran memory tests and other cognitive assessments to determine whether the man really was resistant to Alzheimer’s. Overall, his test scores were normal and remained constant over the years. Some scores even rose owing to practice.\n\nNext, the researchers looked for genetic explanations for the man’s resilience. Previous research has found protective mutations in two people who carry a gene that invariably causes early-onset Alzheimer’s. But the man in the DIAN study didn’t carry either of these mutations.",

          "abstract": "Lactobacillus bacteria (artist’s illustration) have been genetically engineered to make molecules that travel from the nose to the brain.Credit: Artur Plawgo/SPL\n\nA healthier brain could one day be just a snort away: bacteria that colonize the nose have been engineered to ferry drugs to the brains of mice.\n\nOn 5 February, scientists reported in Cell1 that they have used nasal bacteria to deliver appetite-suppressing hormones to obese mice, which subsequently lost weight. Although the approach is still a long way from being used in humans, it is one of the latest examples of widespread efforts to harness bacteria to deliver drugs to where they are needed in the body more effectively. Another study, published today in Cell Systems2, uses a different bacterial species to deliver a protective enzyme to skin cells.\n\n“Drugs often don’t get to where they need to go very well,” says Shannon Sirk, a bioengineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, who was not involved in the studies. “If you can improve delivery, you can minimize side effects and reduce the burden on patients.”\n\nGut feeling\n\nMany attempts to engineer drug-secreting bacteria have focused on delivering molecules to the gut, says Sirk. The microbial flora in the gut is lush with bacteria that could carry a medical payload, including strains of Escherichia coli, a laboratory workhorse that is easy to genetically engineer. But the studies reported this week have ventured to other regions of the body and explored the capabilities of less familiar bacteria.\n\nThe brain is a particularly unusual site for a bacterial delivery system to target, says Cammie Lesser, a synthetic microbiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, because it is protected by a barrier that generally excludes microbes, as well as some molecules.\n\nEngineered brain parasite ferries useful proteins into neurons\n\nTo get around this, Matthew Wook Chang, a synthetic biologist at the National University of Singapore, and his colleagues decided to harness a little-studied gateway to the brain: the nose. The first step was to determine which potentially useful microbes reside there. “The nasal microbiome remains relatively unexplored, despite the nasal cavity’s direct connection to the brain,” says Chang.\n\nThe authors examined several bacteria, including five strains of Lactobacillus, a genus that is generally considered safe and is sometimes used in health supplements. The team then screened these strains for their ability to bind to a molecule that is found on a membrane called the olfactory epithelium. This lines part of the upper nasal passageway and is connected to the brain by nerves that are important for the sense of smell. Although bacteria are unlikely to travel from the nose to the brain, some molecules can diffuse along this path.\n\nOnce the researchers had found a suitable strain, Lactobacillus plantarum, they genetically engineered it to produce and secrete a variety of molecules, including three appetite-regulating hormones. Obese mice that received a dose of the bacteria in their nose each day for eight weeks ate less and lost weight during the treatment period1.\n\nSlow starter",

          "authors": "Leor Zmigrod",
          "abstract": "Outraged: Why We Fight About Morality and Politics and How to Find Common Ground Kurt Gray Pantheon (2025)\n\nSocial psychologist Kurt Gray’s timely book Outraged begins with a dramatic swerve he made on a motorway — a teenage driving mishap, a chase and an escape from the clutches of road rage. That frightening early life experience sparked Gray’s academic exploration of the roots of moral disagreement, which underpins conflicts in politics and media, and even on gridlocked streets.\n\nBy dissecting the rich body of research on how we make judgments about right and wrong, Gray delivers a second swerve — a bold conceptual turn in explaining why people collide over morality and how such collisions can be avoided.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think\n\nHe argues that our moral reflexes reveal an innate motivation to protect ourselves and others from harm. Although outrage might seem aggressive — a loud fury hollered across town halls and digital echo-chambers — it is in fact a defensive stance.\n\nOutrage, Gray suggests, can be understood once we recognize that moral anger is often an expression of fear. In many cases, when someone is outraged, it is because they are scared that a vulnerable person will be hurt or mistreated by an action or a policy.\n\nMany liberals and conservatives disagree on climate policies because they focus on different victims. US Democrats lobby for tighter environmental regulations to protect ecosystems, whereas Republicans support plans to ease environmental regulations to prevent job losses in the fossil-fuel industry. Each group is seeking to protect someone from harm.\n\nFor Gray, this dynamic is the source of our divisions, but also a source of hope. If everyone has the same moral impulses and pursues the same moral project, then there is something uniting us. Gray’s pragmatic solution to polarization is simple: share your perspective on who is being harmed by an action, and listen to others’ fears. By doing this, we will all become more sympathetic citizens.\n\nMoral myths\n\nDespite its title, Outraged is a remarkably calm and inoffensive book. Its conversational style mirrors its conciliatory message. In pursuit of relatability, personal anecdotes are woven in along with psychological experiments, recounted with a clarity that renders them fresh and interesting.\n\nGray draws on his own psychological experiments and studies from other psychologists who study morality have sought to explore our intuitions about right and wrong through clever experiments and large surveys. The book aims to debunk three myths: that we are prone to aggression because we evolved as apex predators; that there are harmless wrongs; and that facts can change people’s attitudes and bridge divides.\n\nStructurally, these three sections align with a chronology of the past, present and future of human morality. Starting with our evolutionary heritage, Gray argues that “humans express online outrage for the same reason they expressed outrage in Stone Age tribes: to guard against societal harm and reinforce moral norms”. Same mindset, different era.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nCrucially, Gray proposes that archaeologists have made a grievous error in their interpretation of the fossil record. Protection, not aggression, is the name of our evolutionary game. He urges us to discard the image of early humans as brutal hunters sharpening their spears for a predatory chase; instead, we should view them as hunted creatures trying to survive amid roving dangers. Evolutionarily, we were not predatory villains, Gray maintains — we were pretty weak prey.\n\nGray cares about this because “the assumption that humans are predators makes our moral opponents seem predatory — cold and calculating — when they do bad things”.\n\nDebunking a myth often entails denying the old narrative and completely reversing it — replacing one story with its opposite. In this case, the temptation is to claim that we were not predators, we were prey. But weren’t we both? In its early sections, the book gets a little stuck between presenting a clear theory and promoting misleading binaries. This is a wider disciplinary challenge for evolutionary psychology; amid sparse evidence and stretched implications, it can fall prey to a rigid retrospective logic that often oversimplifies the complexities of human nature.\n\nThe master key\n\nBut, fortunately, Outraged is a contemporary book concerned mostly with our present predicaments. The second myth it aims to disprove is the idea that our morality is a scattered assemblage of many heterogeneous components and levers. Instead of many moral foundations governing our instincts about good and evil, Gray insists that harm is “the master key of morality” (a recurring refrain).\n\nHe critiques theories that anchor moral concerns beyond harm, especially social psychologist Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind, whose shadow looms large over moral psychology and how people perceive the field. Outraged thus wishes to refute the notion (disseminated by Haidt) that there are ‘harmless wrongs’ – actions we perceive to be wrong but which we think hurt no one.\n\nMarshalling a range of real and thought experiments, Gray argues that “all moral judgments are psychologically grounded in harm, no matter whether you lean left or right”. Gray’s physiological experiments reveal that when a person is asked to physically imitate an act that is typically harmful, such as holding a realistic toy gun to someone else’s head, their body will be biologically disturbed.",

          "abstract": "Monica Saavedra advises people on how to move from academia into industry.Credit: National Institute of Agricultural Botany\n\nLambda Agri, based in Cambridge, UK, develops advanced materials to convert incident high-energy (ultraviolet, or UV) light into lower-energy (red) light efficiently. The applications of these materials include spray coatings for glass greenhouses that can increase crop yields.\n\nMonica Saavedra, the company’s chief executive, grew up wanting to be an astronaut and first developed a taste for experimental work during her bachelor’s degree in physics, when she did a summer placement at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, helping researchers to make and test carbon-nanotube-based soft-matter detectors for α-, β- and γ-radiation.\n\nAfter a master’s degree in nanotechnology, she undertook a doctorate in nanomaterials at the UK National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Alongside describing her own career journey, Saavedra offers advice to early-career researchers who want to move from academia to industry. She also highlights the importance of moving fast in commercial environments, using her company’s pivot from energy to agritech as an example. This month Saavedra won a 2025 Women in Innovation award, run by Innovate UK, the country's innovation agency.\n\nTell us about your career journey as an entrepreneur.\n\nIn 2012, I joined Nexeon, an early-stage company based in Abingdon, UK, developing silicon batteries. The following year, I left for a research-scientist role at Cambridge-based DNA-sequencing developer Base4 Innovation.\n\nFour years later, I joined Solaris Photonics, also based in Cambridge, as its chief technology officer (CTO), developing materials to increase the output of solar cells. Around that time, a colleague and I discussed setting up a company to make solar cells using quantum dots, which would have a bigger output than conventional silicon solar cells. I had had a similar idea around ten years previously, when I was doing my MSc — it was one of those scribbles that you do at the side of the page while the lecturer is speaking.\n\nThe company became Lambda Agri. I was its CTO originally and became chief executive in March last year.\n\nBeing a founder enabled me to wear lots of hats — one day CTO, marketing or human resources, another day chief executive. I especially enjoy hands-on involvement, making things in the laboratory, doing prototyping projects using computer-aided design and 3D printing or advising the scientists on optical physics.\n\nI also like how start-up companies are more agile than the large corporates; they are better enablers for inventiveness. I like the challenge of working fast. Smaller companies can bring more novelty into the practical realms of everyday life and, therefore, be instrumental in saving lives and the planet more quickly.\n\nWhat were the challenges and benefits of switching roles?\n\nSince switching to chief executive, my key focus is the financing and investor-relations side of the business. I was already involved in applying for funding, updating the pitch deck and having conversations with investors, so it was not a complete change. Investors expect the chief executive to be technical at an early-stage company, to increase credibility, so my CTO experience is beneficial.\n\nThe investment environment over recent years has been challenging, and even more so for women. In Europe, for example, start-up companies founded by women raised only 1.8% of the capital invested in start-ups by venture capitalists in 2023.\n\nAfter becoming chief executive, I adopted a range of measures to get it on a firmer financial footing.\n\nFirst, to minimize gender bias, I decided to approach raising funds through diversity-friendly pitch competitions (Santander X and Tech Nation are two examples).\n\nThe competitions and accelerators we participated in deviated from the current venture-capital landscape by having a much stronger female presence as the funding decision makers: approximately 30–40% female. In my experience, typically around 10–20% of venture-capital investors are female.\n\nSecond, I prioritized accelerators with grants that didn’t require match funding (a mechanism in which companies have to invest an equal sum from another source into the grant-funded project). Third, I sought equity-free funding (capital funding that does not transfer ownership of the company to investors).\n\nThese measures help to keep investors happy by minimizing dilution, which is the reduction in the percentage of existing shareholders’ equity that occurs when new shares are issued.\n\nOn one occasion, I attended a national pitch competition when I was heavily pregnant with my second child. Luckily, a representative of a family office (an investment fund managing a family’s private wealth) who was in the audience really enjoyed the pitch, and invested £100,000 (US$124,000).\n\nI live in hope that pitching events will one day be baby-friendly. At the time, I was working days, nights and weekends, with a toddler to look after as well. I have not had a day off, not even on the day my second child was born four months ago. The company has always been the ‘other baby’. I do not necessarily recommend this way of working to others, but it works for me as a mother, and I do have support, which is important.\n\nFundraising requires a focused effort that cannot stop until it’s achieved by a drop-dead deadline. Your employees have families to feed. People you care about have invested money in the business. You have to make it work if you believe in the vision, which we all do.\n\nGetting the funding in place, despite the challenges, has helped me to work on my communication skills, which I always found difficult. Previously, I was much more comfortable with computers than with people. I have had to work hard to understand how to relate better to others and in the male-dominated corporate environment.\n\nHow do you attract talent?\n\nSome scientists are technically brilliant and bold, but lack the commercial or contextual view needed to produce things as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. This is sometimes difficult to deduce before making a new hire. When I’m hiring, I only stop looking once at least one very talented and driven woman has applied.\n\nCurrently, we employ five people and the overall gender balance is 40:60 female to male. We are striving to attain a better one, ideally a 50:50 split, particularly at board level. Just now, it’s me and two white British men, both very knowledgeable angel investors.\n\nI try to ensure that women’s technical skills are being recognized, and I do not let anyone assume that they will be more suited to people-facing roles, for example. Stereotypes about women’s capabilities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics still persist.",

Our findings indicate that affluent children in public schools are relatively isolated from their less affluent peers, while low- and middle-income students experience relatively even peer income distributions. Students from families in the top percentile of the income distribution attend schools where 20 percent of their peers, on average, come from the top five income percentiles. A large majority of the differences in peer exposure that we observe arise from the sorting of students across schools; sorting across classrooms within schools plays a substantially smaller role.",

Some information is much more salient for the decision at hand and merits closer scrutiny. The inattention decision model formalizes this choice and deduces how best to navigate through the potentially vast array of data when making decisions. In the rational formulation, the decision-maker commits fully to a subjective prior distribution over the possible states of the world that could be realized. We relax this assumption and look for a robustly optimal solution to the inattention problem by allowing the decision-maker to be ambiguity averse with respect to this prior. We feature a setup that is deliberately simple by a) assuming a discrete set of choices, b) using Shannon’s mutual information to quantify attention costs, and c) imposing relative entropy with respect to a baseline probability distribution to quantify prior divergence. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust solution and develop numerical methods to solve it. In comparison to the rational solution with no prior uncertainty, our decision-maker slants priors in more cautious or pessimistic directions when deducing how to allocate attention over the range of available information. This approach implements a form of robustness to prior misspecification, or equivalently, a form of ambiguity aversion. We explore some examples that show how the robust solution differs from the rational solution with a commitment to a subjective prior distribution and how it differs from imposing risk aversion.",

          "authors": "Miruna Cotet, Wenjia Joyce Zhao, Ian Krajbich",
          "abstract": "A standard assumption in game theory is that decision-makers have preplanned strategies telling them what actions to take for every contingency. In contrast, nonstrategic decisions often involve an on-the-spot comparison process, with longer response times (RT) for choices between more similarly appealing options. If strategic decisions also exhibit these patterns, then RT might betray private information and alter game theory predictions. Here, we examined bargaining behavior to determine whether RT reveals private information in strategic settings. Using preexisting and experimental data from eBay, we show that both buyers and sellers take hours longer to accept bad offers and to reject good offers. We find nearly identical patterns in the two datasets, indicating a causal effect of offer size on RT. However, this relationship is half as strong for rejections as for acceptances, reducing the amount of useful private information revealed by the sellers. Counter to our predictions, buyers are discouraged by slow rejections—they are less likely to counteroffer to slow sellers. We also show that a drift-diffusion model (DDM), traditionally limited to decisions on the order of seconds, can account for decisions on the order of hours, sometimes days. The DDM reveals that more experienced sellers are less cautious and more inclined to accept offers. In summary, strategic decisions are inconsistent with preplanned strategies. This underscores the need for game theory to incorporate RT as a strategic variable and broadens the applicability of the DDM to slow decisions.",

          "abstract": "Based on the seminal minimal group experiment, the widely influential social identity theory has, in the last 45 y, led to the belief that discrimination follows from intergroup relations and social identity. A large body of research evidenced that people discriminate against members of their out versus ingroup, even if groups and identities were assigned on the basis of a quantity estimate, aesthetic judgment, or a chance outcome. But to what extent may unequal resource division be accounted for by ad hoc difference versus sameness, outside of any group division? We show via Bayesian regression analyses in seven preregistered experiments (&gt;1,400 subjects) that unequal resource division strategies persist against a single person that demonstrates a different versus the same quantity estimate, painting preference, or even coin flip (Experiments 1, 2, and 3ab), with 43.1% more money awarded for sameness relative to difference conditions (Experiments 4, 5, and 6). These findings open up the possibility that one key driver of discrimination may exist in a mechanism of interindividual comparison that treats ad hoc difference more negatively than ad hoc sameness. If unequal resource division readily emerges against a single person even after a mere chance difference, discrimination may be more widespread and occur for partly different reasons than is currently assumed. Theoretical implications for understanding cognitive and brain systems of discrimination are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The Cassini missions have identified the tiger stripes on Enceladus as the source of both thermal emission and plume jets. The hot spots in the tiger stripes are highly localized, and the plumes suggest active hydrothermal processes within the subglacial ocean of Enceladus. However, understanding the mechanism responsible for the heat anomalies in the tiger stripes remains a challenge. About 60 y ago, geoscientist George Veronis proposed a model for cold water oceans, along with the classical notion of a 1/3 scaling relationship between vertical heat transfer and the Rayleigh number ( Ra ), a dimensionless number representing the strength of buoyancy driving the convection within the fluid body. In this study, by delving into the steady coherent rolls arising in Veronis’ model, we first confirm the existence of the classical scaling as proposed. We identify two distinct pathways, characterized by different flow patterns, that converge to the unified classical scaling. In scenarios where stratification resulting from the density’s nonlinear temperature dependence is insignificant, convection rolls with fixed (width-to-height) aspect ratios achieve the classical scaling as Ra approaches infinity. Conversely, under high stratification levels, convection rolls with a heat-transport-maximizing aspect ratio achieve the classical scaling. This investigation also reveals a notable correspondence between optimal coherent rolls and turbulent flow patterns. Based on these coherent rolls, we offer insights into the formation of heat anomalies in the tiger stripes. The predicted heat flux through the ocean and the lateral flow length, are consistent with the measurements obtained by the Cassini spacecraft.",

          "authors": "Breanna M. Schaeffer, Tadd T. Truscott, Andrew K. Dickerson",
          "abstract": "Samaras are known for their elegant and robust autorotation, a resilience that persists in the adverse conditions imposed by high-speed raindrops. Like flying insects, samaras descending from tall trees are likely to be struck by raindrops in an intense storm. In this study, we detail the collision dynamics for impact regions across the samara body and the drop-shedding mechanisms that samaras exhibit to return to autorotation. Impacts across the samara body can pitch the samara up to 60 degrees and, in some cases, induce spanwise roll. Raindrops may shatter or remain intact upon impact, pushing the undamaged samara downward before autorotation is recovered. Drops that strike near the wingtip elicit the greatest recovery distance, while impacts onto the nutlet mass are the least disruptive to the samara and most likely to cause the drop to induce fragmentation. Faster drops allow for quicker drop shedding and a subsequent rapid return to autorotation in less than 50 ms. Our results indicate that samaras are robust to raindrop impacts and consistently recover autorotation, resulting in a minor reduction in dispersal distance. To recover, the entire drop is shed from the spinning samara over a time closely tied to the shedding mode and ensuing drop rejection forces.",

          "abstract": "We recently reported that microinjection of Xenopus nodal-related ( xnr ) mRNAs into β-catenin-depleted Xenopus embryos rescued a complete dorsal axis. Xnrs mediate the signal of the Nieuwkoop center that induces the Spemann–Mangold organizer in the overlying mesoderm, a process inhibited by the Nodal antagonist Cerberus-short (CerS). However, β-catenin also induces a second signaling center in the dorsal prospective ectoderm, designated the Blastula Chordin and Noggin Expression (BCNE) center, in which the homeobox gene siamois ( sia ) plays a major role. In this study, we asked whether the Xnrs and Sia depend on each other or function on parallel pathways. Expression of both genes induced β-catenin-depleted embryos to form complete axes with heads and eyes via the activation of similar sets of downstream organizer-specific genes. Xnrs did not activate siamois , and, conversely, Sia did not activate xnrs , although both were induced by β-catenin stabilization. Depletion with morpholinos revealed a robust role for the downstream target Chordin. Remarkably, Chordin depletion prevented all ectopic effects resulting from microinjection of the mRNA encoding the maternal cytoplasmic determinant Huluwa , including the radial expansion of brain tissue and the ectopic expression of the ventral gene sizzled . The main conclusion was that the BCNE and Nieuwkoop centers provide a double assurance mechanism for axial formation by independently activating similar downstream transcriptional target gene repertoires. We suggest that Siamois likely evolved from an ancestral Mix-type homeodomain protein called Sebox as a Xenopus -specific adaptation for the rapid differentiation of the anterior neural plate in the ectoderm.",

However, the cell-specific roles and mechanisms of EphA4 are unclear. Here, we show that EphA4 expression is elevated in hippocampal CA1 astrocytes in AD conditions. Specific knockout of astrocytic EphA4 ameliorates excitatory synapse loss in the hippocampus in AD transgenic mouse models. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis revealed that EphA4 inhibition specifically decreases a reactive astrocyte subpopulation with enriched complement signaling, which is associated with synapse elimination by astrocytes in AD. Importantly, astrocytic EphA4 knockout in an AD transgenic mouse model decreases complement tagging on excitatory synapses and excitatory synapses within astrocytes. These findings suggest an important role of EphA4 in the astrocyte-mediated elimination of excitatory synapses in AD and highlight the crucial role of astrocytes in hippocampal synapse maintenance in AD.",

Mammalian COP1 binds to DET1 and is a substrate adaptor for the CUL4A-DDB1-RBX1 RING E3 ligase. Transcription factor substrates, including c-Jun, ETV4, and ETV5, are targeted for proteasomal degradation to effect rapid transcriptional changes in response to cues such as growth factor deprivation. Here, we link a homozygous DET1 R26W mutation to lethal developmental abnormalities in humans. Experimental cryo-electron microscopy of the DET1 complex with DDB1 and DDA1, as well as co-immunoprecipitation experiments, revealed that DET1 R26W impairs binding to DDB1, thereby compromising E3 ligase function. Accordingly, human-induced pluripotent stem cells homozygous for DET1 R26W expressed ETV4 and ETV5 highly, and exhibited defective mitochondrial homeostasis and aberrant caspase-dependent cell death when differentiated into neurons. Neuronal cell death was increased further in the presence of Det1 -deficient microglia as compared to WT microglia, indicating that the deleterious effects of the DET1 p.R26W mutation may stem from the dysregulation of multiple cell types. Mice lacking Det1 died during embryogenesis, while Det1 deletion just in neural stem cells elicited hydrocephalus, cerebellar dysplasia, and neonatal lethality. Our findings highlight an important role for DET1 in the neurological development of mice and humans.",

          "abstract": "The discovery of ferroelectric phases in HfO 2 offers insights into ferroelectricity. Its unique fluorite structure and complex polarization switching pathways exhibit distinct characteristics, challenging conventional analysis methods. Combining group theory and first-principles calculations, we identify numerous unconventional electric polarization switching pathways in HfO 2 with energy barriers of 0.32 to 0.57 eV as a function of the different shift in the suboxygen lattices. In total, we identify 47 switching pathways for the orthorhombic phase, corresponding to the left cosets of the F m 3 ¯ m group with P c a 2 1 group. Contrary to the conception that the tetracoordinated oxygen (O IV ) layers are inactive, our result demonstrates that both the tricoordinated oxygen (O III ) and O IV can be displaced, leading to polarization switching along any axial direction. The multiple switching pathways in HfO 2 result in both 180° polarization reversal and the formation of 90° domains observed experimentally. Calculations show that specific switching pathways depend on the orientation of the applied electric field relative to the HfO 2 growth surface. This allows HfO 2 to automatically adjust the in-plane polarization direction under an out-of-plane electric field, thereby maximizing the out-of-plane component and contributing to the wake-up process. These findings redefine the roles of O III and O IV layers, clarify unconventional switching pathways, and enhance our understanding of electric field response mechanisms, wake-up, and fatigue in ferroelectrics.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 sometimes appear to be creative, solving novel tasks often with a few demonstrations in the prompt. These tasks require the models to generalize on distributions different from those from training data—which is known as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach OOD generalization remains an open and underexplored question. We examine OOD generalization in settings where instances are generated according to hidden rules, including in-context learning with symbolic reasoning. Models are required to infer the hidden rules behind input prompts without any fine-tuning. We empirically examined the training dynamics of Transformers on a synthetic example and conducted extensive experiments on a variety of pretrained LLMs, focusing on a type of component known as induction heads. We found that OOD generalization and composition are tied together—models can learn rules by composing two self-attention layers, thereby achieving OOD generalization. Furthermore, a shared latent subspace in the embedding (or feature) space acts as a bridge for composition by aligning early layers and later layers, which we refer to as the common bridge representation hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the Z 2 QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a hidden large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.",

It is widely accepted that hemolysis-derived toxic molecules are cleared by macrophages or metabolized in hepatocytes.

These engulfment processes are mediated by the scavenger receptor Stab2. To demonstrate the protective function of SECs during hemolysis, we employed a zebrafish model of erythropoietic porphyria, characterized by excessive protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulation due to ferrochelatase mutation, leading to light-sensitive hemolysis and larva death. We found that SECs facilitate the clearance of excess PPIX via Stab2, thereby mitigating PPIX-induced larval mortality. In addition, mouse SECs possess a conserved capability of scavenging Hb/UCB/PPIX. In conclusion, our study identifies SECs as a detoxification system during physiological and pathological hemolysis, shedding light on their protective role against hemolysis-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Fluid flows are dominant features of many bacterial environments, and flow can often impact bacterial behaviors in unexpected ways. For example, the most common type of cardiovascular infection is heart valve colonization by gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis (endocarditis). This behavior is counterintuitive because heart valves experience high shear rates that would naively be expected to reduce colonization. To determine whether these bacteria preferentially colonize higher shear rate environments, we developed a microfluidic system to quantify the effect of flow conditions on the colonization of S. aureus and E. faecalis . We find that the preferential colonization in high flow of both species is not specific to heart valves and can be found in simple configurations lacking any host factors. This behavior enables bacteria that are outcompeted in low flow to dominate in high flow. Surprisingly, experimental and computational studies reveal that the two species achieve this behavior via distinct mechanisms. S. aureus grows in cell clusters and produces a dispersal signal whose transport is affected by shear rate. Meanwhile, E. faecalis grows in linear chains whose mechanical properties result in less dispersal in the presence of higher shear force. In addition to establishing two divergent mechanisms by which these bacteria each preferentially colonize high-flow environments, our findings highlight the importance of understanding bacterial behaviors at the level of collective interactions among cells. These results suggest that distinct multicellular nanocolony morphologies have previously unappreciated costs and benefits in different environments, like those introduced by fluid flow.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria frequently inhabit surface-attached communities where rich “social” interactions can significantly alter their population-level behavior, including their response to antibiotics. Understanding these collective effects in spatially heterogeneous communities is an ongoing challenge. Here, we investigated the spatial organization that emerges from antibiotic exposure in initially randomly distributed communities containing antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Enterococcus faecalis , an opportunistic pathogen. We identified that a range of complex spatial structures emerged in the population homeland—the inoculated region that microbes inhabit prior to range expansion—which depended on initial colony composition and antibiotic concentration. We found that these arrangements were explained by cooperative interactions between resistant and sensitive subpopulations with a variable spatial scale, the result of dynamic zones of protection afforded to sensitive cells by growing populations of enzyme-producing resistant neighbors. Using a combination of experiments and mathematical models, we explored the complex spatiotemporal interaction dynamics that create these patterns, and predicted spatial arrangements of sensitive and resistant subpopulations under new conditions. We illustrated how spatial population dynamics in the homeland affect subsequent range expansion, both because they modulate the composition of the initial expanding front, and through long-range cooperation between the homeland and the expanding region. Finally, we showed that these spatial constraints resulted in populations whose size and composition differed markedly from matched populations in well-stirred (planktonic) cultures. These findings underscore the importance of spatial structure and cooperation, long-studied features in theoretical ecology, for determining the fate of bacterial communities under antibiotic exposure.",

We show anti-poly-glycine-arginine (a-polyGR) positive aggregates frequently accumulate in sporadic AD autopsy brains (45/80 cases). We hypothesize that these aggregates are caused by one or more polyGR-encoding repeat expansion mutations. We developed a CRISPR/deactivated-Cas9 enrichment strategy to identify candidate GR-encoding repeat expansion mutations directly from genomic DNA isolated from a-polyGR(+) AD cases. Using this approach, we isolated an interrupted (GGGAGA) n intronic expansion within a SINE-VNTR-Alu element in CASP8 ( CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP ). Immunostaining using a-polyGR and locus-specific C-terminal antibodies demonstrate that the CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP expresses hybrid poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n proteins that accumulate in CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP (+) AD brains. In cells, expression of CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP minigenes leads to increased p-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) levels. Consistent with other types of repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins, poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n protein levels are increased by stress. Additionally, levels of these stress-induced proteins are reduced by metformin. Association studies show specific aggregate promoting interrupted CASP8 -GGGAGA EXP sequence variants found in ~3.6% of controls and 7.5% AD cases increase AD risk [ CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1; OR 2.2, 95% CI (1.5185 to 3.1896), P = 3.1 × 10 −5 ]. Cells transfected with a high-risk CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 variant show increased toxicity and increased levels of poly(GR)n(GE)n(RE)n aggregates. Taken together, these data identify polyGR(+) aggregates as a frequent and unexpected type of brain pathology in AD and CASP8 -GGGAGA-AD-R1 alleles as a relatively common AD risk factor.

The nervous system is well established to interface with the immune system to fine-tune immunity in various organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract. Specialized sensory neurons can detect bacteria, bacterial products, and the resulting inflammation, to coordinate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. These sensory neurons release peptide neurotransmitters such as Substance P (SP), to induce both neuronal signaling and localized responses in nonneuronal cells. With this in mind, we assessed the immunoregulatory roles of SP receptor signaling during enteric bacterial infection with the noninvasive pathogen Citrobacter rodentium . Pharmacological antagonism of the SP receptor significantly reduced bacterial burden and prevented colonic crypt hyperplasia. Mice with SP receptor signaling blockade had significantly reduced inflammation and recruitment of T cells in the colon. Reduced colonic T cell recruitment is due to reduced expression of adhesion molecules on colonic endothelial cells in SP receptor antagonist-treated mice. Using SP receptor T cell conditional knockout mice, we further confirmed SP receptor signaling enhanced select aspects of T cell responses. Our data demonstrate that SP receptor signaling can significantly reduce inflammation and prevent host-maladaptive responses without impinging upon host protection.",

          "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the predominant human renal cancer with surging incidence and fatality lately. Hyperactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling are the common signatures in ccRCC. Herein, we employed spontaneous ccRCC model to demonstrate the indispensability of an underappreciated Ser/Thr kinase, CDKL3, in the initiation and progression of ccRCC. Ablation of CDKL3 does not affect normal kidney, but abrogates Akt-mTOR hyperactivity and thoroughly prevents the formation and growth of the HIF-agitated ccRCC in vivo. Remarkable clinical correlations also supported the oncogenic role of CDKL3. Mechanism-wise, cytosolic CDKL3 unexpectedly behaves as the adaptor to physically potentiate mTORC2-dependent Akt activation without functioning through kinase activity. And mTORC2 can phosphorylate and stabilize CDKL3 to form a positive feedback loop to sustain the cancer-favored Akt-mTOR overactivation. Together, we revealed the pathological importance and molecular mechanism of CDKL3-mediated Akt-mTOR axis in ccRCC initiation and progression.",

          "abstract": "The seed is a landmark plant adaptation where the embryo is sheltered by a protective seed coat to facilitate dispersion. In Arabidopsis , the seed coat, derived from ovular integuments, plays a critical role in maintaining dormancy, ensuring germination occurs during a favorable season. Dormancy is enhanced by cold temperatures during seed development by affecting seed coat permeability through changes in apoplastic barriers. However, their localization and composition are poorly understood. This study identifies and investigates a polar barrier in the seed coat’s outer integument (oi1) cells. We present histological, biochemical, and genetic evidence showing that cold promotes polar seed coat lignification of the outer integument 1 (oi1) cells and suberization throughout the entire oi1 cell boundary. The polar oi1 barrier is regulated by the transcription factors MYB107 and MYB9. MYB107, in particular, is crucial for the lignified polar oi1 barrier formation under cold temperatures. The absence of the oi1 barrier in mutant seeds correlates with increased permeability and reduced dormancy. Our findings elucidate how temperature-induced modifications in seed coat composition regulate dormancy, highlighting the roles of suberin and lignin in this process.",

          "abstract": "Hemizygous genes, which are present on only one of the two homologous chromosomes of diploid organisms, have been mainly studied in the context of sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes. However, these genes can also occur on the autosomes of diploid plants due to structural variants (SVs), such as a deletion/insertion of one allele, and this phenomenon largely unexplored in plants. Here, we investigated the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of hemizygous genes across 22 genomes with varying propagation histories: eleven clonal lineages, seven outcrossed samples, and four inbred and putatively homozygous genomes. We identified SVs leading to genic hemizygosity. As expected, very few genes (0.01 to 1.2%) were hemizygous in the homozygous genomes, representing negative controls. Hemizygosity was appreciable among outcrossed lineages, averaging 8.7% of genes, but consistently elevated for the clonal samples at 13.8% genes, likely reflecting heterozygous SV accumulation during clonal propagation. Compared to diploid genes, hemizygous genes were more often situated in centromeric than telomeric regions and experienced weaker purifying selection. They also had reduced levels of expression, averaging ~20% of the expression levels of diploid genes, violating the evolutionary model of dosage compensation. We also detected higher DNA methylation levels in hemizygous genes and transposable elements, which may contribute to their reduced expression. Finally, expression profiles showed that hemizygous genes were more specifically expressed in contexts related to fruit development, organ differentiation, and stress responses. Overall, hemizygous genes accumulate in clonally propagated lineages and display distinct genetic and epigenetic features compared to diploid genes, shedding unique insights into genetic studies and breeding programs of clonal crops.",

The oldest known evidence, dating to 3.3 Ma, indicates a combination of percussive and flake production activities. Studying the archaeological signature of percussive stone tool use in living primate provides a potential analog to the origin of stone flake technology in the hominin lineage. Here, we present a yellow-breasted capuchin ( Sapajus xanthosternos ) stone tool assemblage from Fazenda Matos, Brazil, to explore the variability of the material signatures associated with percussive tool use. Our analysis of this record demonstrates many archaeological features previously associated with intentional flake production. This includes hammerstones with substantial percussive damage and a range of flaked and detached pieces. Comparative analyses with other flaked primate and hominin assemblages reveals that, unintentional flake production is a universal component of stone hammer and anvil percussive behaviors, suggesting that similar behaviors by early hominins may have led to stone flake technology and that this record may have been highly variable. To fully understand the origins of hominin stone technology, a broad spectrum of material records including both hominin and primate must be considered.",

Among them, thermosalient crystals are particularly favored thanks to their efficient energy conversions and rapid responses. However, the mechanisms for the mechanical responses of thermosalient crystals remain largely unclear. Herein we demonstrate that thermosalient effects of molecular crystals could be driven by thermoelastic twisting behaviors. The crystal, based on a model compound with rigid dibenzothiophene sulfone planes and flexible ethoxy chains, can spontaneously self-heal from mechanical fractures. Upon heating, the crystal undergoes remarkable thermosalient behaviors driven by a distinctive left- or right-handed twisting. This thermoelastic twisting converts thermal energy into elastic potential energy, which is further released as kinetic energy upon untwisting to drive the crystal jump. Our demonstration on thermoelastic twisting–induced crystal jumping offers a different perspective on the origins of thermosalient crystals and could provide inspiration for future engineering and application of dynamic molecular crystals.",

          "abstract": "Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) acts by binding to FSHRs expressed on ovarian granulosa cells and produces estradiol. FSH is essential for female fertility because mice lacking FSH ( Fshb KO ) are anestrous and infertile. Although several in vitro cell culture and ex vivo approaches combined with pharmacological hormone treatment were used to identify FSH-regulated genes, how FSH orchestrates ovarian gene networks in vivo has not been investigated. Whether FSH-regulated genes display estrous stage–specific expression changes has also not been studied. Here, we functionally rescued Fshb null mice with a gonadotrope-targeted HFSHB transgene and performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs obtained from FSH-intact ( WT ), FSH-deficient ( Fshb KO ), and FSH-rescue ( HFSHB + rescue) mice. By comparing WT vs. Fshb KO and Fshb KO vs. HFSHB + rescue ovarian gene expression datasets, we identified FSH-responsive genes in vivo. Cross interrogation of these datasets further allowed us to identify several transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding proteins specific to FSH-regulated genes. In an independent set of experiments, we performed RNA-Seq analysis on ovarian RNAs from mice in diestrous (DE), proestrous (PE), and estrous (E) and identified estrous stage–specific ovarian gene expression patterns. Interestingly, many of the FSH-regulated TFs themselves were estrous-stage specifically expressed. We found that ESR2 and GATA6, two known FSH-responsive TFs, and their target genes are reciprocally regulated with distinct patterns of expression in estrous stages. Together, our in vivo models and RNA-Seq analyses identify FSH-regulated ovarian genes in specific estrous stages that are under transcriptional and posttranscriptional control.",

Although the impacts of mycorrhiza are highly context-dependent, it remains unclear how these effects vary across broad spatial scales. Based on data from 2296 field sites across grassland ecosystems of China, here we show that mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis enhances SOC storage in the topsoil and subsoil through increasing plant diversity and elevating biomass allocation to belowground. SOC storage is significantly higher in both the topsoil and subsoil in systems dominated by obligate mycorrhizal (OM) and facultative mycorrhizal (FM) plants than those dominated by nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants. Also, the relative abundance of OM plants increases at the expense of FM plants as temperature and precipitation increase. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential mechanisms by which mycorrhizal fungi may influence grassland plant diversity and SOC storage in the context of global change.",

Specifically, the disclination leads to Faraday lines of effective magnetic flux that run from the center all the way to the edge of the arrays. Moreover, the geometric deformation, induced by the topological defect, curves the geometry such that these Faraday lines are channeled preferentially by the arrays’ curved geometry. Our results demonstrate how the intentional combination of topology and geometry can be designed to control magnetic charges and the flow of local magnetization and thus manipulate associated collective excitations.",

          "abstract": "Species-level networks emerge as the combination of interactions spanning multiple individuals, and their study has received considerable attention over the past 30 y. However, less is known about the structure of interaction configurations within species, even though individuals are the actual interacting units in nature. We compiled 46 empirical, individual-based, interaction networks on plant-animal seed dispersal mutualisms, comprising 1,037 plant individuals across 29 species from various regions. We compared the structure of individual-based networks to that of species-based networks and, by extending the niche concept to interaction assemblages, we explored individual plant specialization. Using a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty derived from sampling, we examined how plant individuals “explore” the interaction niche of their populations. Both individual-based and species-based networks exhibited high variability in network properties, lacking remarkable structural and topological differences between them. Within populations, frugivores’ interaction allocation among plant individuals was highly heterogeneous, with one to three frugivore species dominating interactions. Regardless of species or bioregion, plant individuals displayed a variety of interaction profiles across populations, with a consistently-small percentage of individuals playing a central role and exhibiting high diversity in their interaction assemblage. Plant populations showed variable mid to low levels of niche specialization; and individuals’ interaction niche “breadth” accounted for 70% of the population interaction diversity, on average. Our results highlight how downscaling from species to individual-based networks helps understanding the structuring of interactions within ecological communities and provide an empirical basis for the extension of niche theory to complex mutualistic networks.",

          "abstract": "Calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) play central roles in cellular physiology. Fluorescent indicators for Ca 2+ ions revolutionized our ability to make rapid, accurate, and highly parallel measurement of Ca 2+ concentrations in living cells. The use of ratio-based imaging with one particular indicator, fura-2, allowed practitioners to correct for a number of experimental confounds, including dye bleaching, variations in sample thickness, and fluctuations in illumination intensity. Ratio-based imaging with fura-2 was the most accurate and reliable method for measuring Ca 2+ concentrations. Two drawbacks to fura-2 exist. First, it requires ultraviolet (UV) excitation, which is more toxic to living cells than visible light. Second, our ability to use fura-2 for accurate, stable, ratio-based determinations of Ca 2+ concentration in living cells is fast becoming a method of the past. This is due, in part, because modern microscopes are phasing out the use of mercury arc lamps that provide the UV excitation needed for fura-2 imaging. To address this problem, we describe the design, synthesis, and cellular application of benzo[ b ]phosphole-based fluorescent Ca 2+ indicators for ratio-based imaging of Ca 2+ in living cells that can be used with modern light emitting diode (LED)-equipped fluorescence microscopes. We report isoCaRed-1Me, a Ca 2+ indicator that enables ratio-based imaging in immortalized cell lines, primary mammalian hippocampal neurons, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes. These data show that isoCaRed-1Me will be useful for ratio-based Ca 2+ imaging using modern microscopes.",

          "abstract": "The tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau has been influenced by continental collision and postcollisional convergence of Indian and Eurasian plates, both of which have undoubtedly imposed their imprints on the lithosphere and upper-mantle structures beneath the collision zone. However, the mode by which the Indian Plate has subducted beneath Tibet, and its driving forces, have been highly uncertain. Here, we present seismic evidence from a full-waveform tomographic model that reveals flat subduction of the Indian Plate beneath nearly the entire plateau at ∼ 300 km depth, implying that the slab may have transitioned to positive/neutral buoyancy and is no longer capable of supporting steep-angle deep subduction. The horizontal distance over which the flat slab slides northward increases from west (where it collides with the Tarim lithospheric keel) to east (where it has resided approximately north of the Songpan-Ganzi Fold Belt beyond the Qiangtang Block). The Asian lithosphere is subducting beneath northeastern Tibet without colliding with the Indian slab. The low-velocity zone, with a thickness of 50 to 110 km, sandwiched between the Tibetan crust and Indian slab, is positively correlated with the high-elevation, low-relief topography of Tibet, suggesting partial melting of the uppermost mantle that has facilitated the growth and flatness of the plateau by adding buoyant material to its base. We propose that deep mantle convective currents, traced to the Réunion plume and imaged as large-scale low-velocity anomalies from the upper mantle under the Indian Plate downward toward the uppermost lower mantle under the Baikal-Mongolia Plateau, are the primary force driving the ongoing India–Asia postcollisional convergence.",

We used PiggyBac (PB) transposon technology to insert a liver-specific hNTCP expression cassette into rhesus macaque zygotes and transferred the resulting embryos into surrogate females, resulting in two healthy transgenic offspring.

          "abstract": "Chimeric hemagglutinins (cHA) appear to be promising for the design and development of universal influenza vaccines. Influenza A group 1 cHAs, cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1, comprising an H1 stem attached to either an H5, H8, or H11 globular head, have been used sequentially as vaccine immunogens in human clinical trials and induced high levels of broadly protective antibodies. Using X-ray crystallography and negative-stain electron microscopy, we determined structures of cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs in their apo (unliganded) and antibody Fab-bound states. Stem-reactive antibodies 3E1 and 31.b.09 recognize their cognate epitopes in cH5/1, cH8/1, and cH11/1 HAs. However, with cH5/1, the head domains are rotated by 35 to 45° around the threefold axis of the HA trimer compared to native HA with a more splayed-open conformation at the stem base. cH11/1 with 3E1 is structurally more native-like but resembles cH5/1 with 31.b.09, whereas cH8/1 with 31.b.09 exhibited a range of closed-to-open stem configurations with some separation of head and stem domains. Furthermore, all of these group 1 cHAs effectively bound a broad head trimer interface antibody and other broad stem antibodies. Thus, the cHAs exhibit structural plasticity without compromising the stem and head trimer interface epitopes for elicitation of influenza A group 1 cross-reactive antibodies.",

          "abstract": "Fungal infections represent a significant global health concern, with a growing prevalence of antifungal drug resistance. Targeting glucosylceramides (GlcCer), which are functionally important glycosphingolipids (GSL) present in fungal membranes, represents a promising strategy for the development of antifungal drugs. GlcCer are associated with the antifungal activity of certain plant and insect defensins. The 44-residue ETD151 peptide, optimized from butterfly defensins, is active against several fungal pathogens. ETD151 has been shown to induce a multifaceted mechanism of action (MOA) in Botrytis cinerea , a multiresistant phytopathogenic fungus. However, the target has yet to be identified. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of GlcCer in membranes determines the susceptibility of Pichia pastoris and Candida albicans toward ETD151. To ascertain whether this is due to direct molecular recognition, we demonstrate that ETD151 selectively recognizes liposomes containing GlcCer from B. cinerea , which reveals a methylated-sphingoid base structure. The dissociation constant was estimated by microscale thermophoresis to be in the µM range. Finally, fluorescence microscopy revealed that ETD151 localizes preferentially at the surface of B. cinerea . Furthermore, the majority of prokaryotic cells do not contain GSL, which explains their resistance to ETD151. We investigated the susceptibility of Novosphingobium capsulatum , one of the rare GSL-containing bacteria, to ETD151. ETD151 demonstrated transient morphological changes and inhibitory growth activity (IC 50 ~75 µM) with an affinity for the cell surface, emphasizing the critical importance of GSL as target. Understanding the MOA of ETD151 could pave the way for new perspectives in human health and crop protection.",

However, certain proteins may fold into two or more conformations from single amino acid sequences. Here, we designed a protein that adopts interconvertible alternative functional conformations, termed “seesaw” protein (SSP). An SSP was engineered by fusing GFP lacking the C-terminal β-strand and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) lacking the N-terminal β-strand with an overlapping linker, which can be competitively incorporated into either the GFP or the DHFR moiety. In vivo and biochemical analyses, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, demonstrated that the SSP adopts two alternative conformations, which can be biased by point mutations and ligand binding. The drastic conformational change upon the ligand binding was directly visualized by high-speed AFM. Furthermore, the balance of the seesaw can be reversibly changed depending on buffer conditions. In summary, our design strategy for SSP provides a unique direction for creating artificial proteins with on–off behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Ripening is crucial for the development of fleshy fruits that release their seeds following consumption by frugivores and are important contributors to human health and nutritional security. Many genetic ripening regulators have been identified, especially in the model system tomato, yet more remain to be discovered and integrated into comprehensive regulatory models. Most tomato ripening genes have been studied in pericarp tissue, though recent evidence indicates that locule tissue is a site of early ripening-gene activities. Here, we identified and functionally characterized an Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) gene, SlERF.D6 , by investigating tomato transcriptome data throughout plant development, emphasizing genes elevated in the locule during fruit development and ripening. SlERF.D6 loss-of-function mutants resulting from CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing delayed ripening initiation and carotenoid accumulation in both pericarp and locule tissues. Transcriptome analysis of lines altered in SlERF.D6 expression revealed multiple classes of altered genes including ripening regulators, in addition to carotenoid, cell wall, and ethylene pathway genes, suggesting comprehensive ripening control. Distinct regulatory patterns in pericarp versus locule tissues were observed, indicating tissue-specific activity of this transcription factor (TF). Analysis of SlERF.D6 interaction with target promoters revealed an APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) TF ( SlDEAR2 ) as a target of SlERF.D6. Furthermore, we show that a third TF gene, SlTCP12 , is a target of SlDEAR2, presenting a tricomponent module of ripening control residing in the larger SlERF.D6 regulatory network.",

PAHs/PACs are the most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco smoke, and cigarette use during pregnancy can convey these molecules to the developing fetus through the placenta. This exposure is associated with many negative health outcomes, from premature birth to sudden infant death syndrome and adverse neurodevelopmental disorders. This study demonstrates the use of surface-enhanced Raman and surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopies for direct detection of PAHs/PACs in human placental tissue. We applied two spectroscopy-informed machine learning algorithms, Characteristic Peak Extraction (CaPE) and Characteristic Peak Similarity (CaPSim), to identify the specific PAHs and PACs present in the placenta of women who smoked tobacco cigarettes in pregnancy compared to spectra of the placenta from self-reported nonsmokers. CaPE and CaPSim analysis enabled a clear distinction between these two groups. Independent verification was accomplished by detecting PAH-DNA and PAC-DNA adducts in the smoking group by means of a 32 P-postlabeling assay. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining surface-enhanced spectroscopies with informed ML analysis for the streamlined detection of hazardous environmental compounds in human tissues, suggesting broader applications in clinical diagnostics and public health surveillance.",

          "abstract": "Male germ cells, which are responsible for producing millions of genetically diverse sperm through meiosis in the testis, rely on lactate as their central energy metabolite. Recent study has revealed that lactate induces epigenetic modification in cells through histone lysine lactylation. Here, we report dynamic histone lactylation at histone H4-lysine 5 (K5), -K8, and -K12 during meiosis prophase I in mouse spermatogenesis. By profiling the genome-wide occupancy of histone H4-K8 lactylation (H4K8la), which peaks at zygotene, our data show that H4K8la mark is observed at the promoters of genes exhibiting active expression with Gene Ontology functions enriched for meiosis. Notably, our data also demonstrate that H4K8la is closely associated with recombination hotspots, where machinery involved in the processing DNA double-stranded breaks, such as SPO11, DMC1, RAD51, and RPA2, is engaged. In addition, H4K8la was also detected at the meiosis-specific cohesion sites (marked by RAD21L and REC8) flanking the recombination hotspots. Functionally, our data show that lactate induces upregulation of key meiotic genes through H4K8la modifications. Additionally, H4K8la shows colocalization and interaction with PRDM9 at recombination hotspots. Finally, our data show that HBO1, a lactyltransferase, is highly expressed in meiotic germ cells. In vitro lactylation assays reveal that HBO1 induces H4K8la, and pharmacological inhibition of HBO1 in mice reduces H4K8la levels and disrupts meiosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that histone lactylation serves as an epigenetic mechanism that is involved in meiotic gene expression and recombination in male germ cells during spermatogenesis.",

A printed textile-based strain sensor array responds to strain from 0.1 to 10% with a gauge factor as high as 100 and shows independence to extrinsic motion artifacts via strain-isolating printed pattern design. Through reversible starching treatment, ink penetration depth during direct printing on garments is controlled to achieve batch-to-batch performance variation &lt;10%. Coupled with deep learning, explainable AI, and transfer learning data processing, the smart garment is capable of classifying six sleep states with an accuracy of 98.6%, maintaining excellent explainability (classification with low bias) and generalization (95% accuracy on new users with few-shot learning less than 15 samples per class) in practical applications, paving the way for next-generation daily sleep healthcare management.",

          "abstract": "Despite the rising challenge of antibiotic resistance, current approaches to eradicate nasal pathobionts Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae rely on antibacterials. An alternative is the artificial inoculation of commensal bacteria, i.e., probiotic treatment, supported by the increasing evidence for commensal-mediated inhibition of pathogens. To systematically investigate the potential of this approach, we developed a quantitative framework simulating the nasal microbiome dynamics by combining mathematical modeling with longitudinal microbiota data. By inferring community parameters using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing data and simulating the nasal microbial dynamics of patients colonized with S. aureus , we compared the decolonization performance of probiotic and antibiotic treatments under different assumptions on patients’ community composition and susceptibility profile. To further compare the robustness of these treatments, we simulated an S. aureus challenge and quantified the recolonization probability. Through in vitro experiments using nasal swabs of adults colonized with S. aureus , we confirmed that after antibiotic treatment, recolonization of S. aureus was inhibited in samples treated with a probiotic mixture compared to the nontreated control. Our results suggest that probiotic treatment outperforms antibiotics in terms of decolonization performance, recolonization robustness, and leads to less collateral reduction in the microbiome diversity. Thus, probiotic treatment may provide a promising alternative to combat antibiotic resistance, with the additional advantage of personalized treatment options via using the patient’s own metagenomic data. The combination of an in silico framework with in vitro experiments using clinical samples reported in this work is an important step forward to further investigate this alternative in clinical trials.",

RNA imaging methods for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA dynamics would facilitate the discovery of unknown functions of RNA, yet improving RNA imaging is challenging because of limitations in methods for directly monitoring native RNA, especially the dynamics of RNA transport and concentration fluctuation. Herein, a label-free and conformation switching–based genetically encoded sensor, termed the Dual-locked RNAtracker (Ducker), that realizes spatiotemporal monitoring of endogenous RNA dynamics in living cells is developed. In this Ducker system, a distinctive strategy is developed by employing one RNA target to initiate an allosteric event that triggers the two locked fluorogenic RNA aptamer (M18 Pepper) to restore the active structure and transmit adequate fluorescence signals. The intracellular circular Ducker (circDucker) realizes high-contrast and unbiased imaging of native mRNA abundance and monitors the fluctuations in RNA concentration. Importantly, it also enables spatiotemporal dynamic tracking of RNA translocation by directly visualizing the process of the mitochondrial lncCyt b undergoing bidirectional nucleocytoplasmic transport, indicating the bidirectional regulatory events in mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore, this highly accessible sensor affords a universal and robust platform for spatiotemporal monitoring of RNA abundance and translocation in complicated dynamic reaction networks in live systems, including mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNA, expanding the current toolbox of RNA research and shedding light on the unknown functions of RNA.",

Recent attempts to reconcile this uncertainty by “Darwinizing” nonreplicating biogeochemical processes subject to persistence-based selection conform with the historicity of the geochemical record but lack mechanistic clarity. Here, we present a theoretical framework showing how: 1) A biogeochemical “cycle-biota-variant” (CBV) can be defined non-arbitrarily as one biologically facilitated pathway for net recycling of an essential element, plus the genotypes driving the relevant interconversion reactions. 2) Distinct CBVs can be individuated if they have climatic or geochemical side effects that feed-back on relative persistence. 3) The separation of spatial/temporal scales between the dynamics of such effects and those of conventional Darwinian evolution can introduce a degree of randomness into the relationship between CBVs and their Earth system impact properties, loosely analogous to that between the biochemical causes and evolutionary effects of genetic mutation. 4) Threshold behavior in climate feedback can accentuate biotic impacts and lead to CBV-level “competitive exclusion”. 5) CBV-level persistence selection is observationally distinguishable from genotype-level selection by strong covariance between “internal” CBV properties (genotypes and reactions) and “external” climatic effects, which we argue is analogous to the covariance between fitness and traits under conventional Darwinian selection. These factors cannot circumvent the basic fact that local natural selection will often favor phenotypes that ultimately destabilize large-scale geochemical/climatic properties. However, we claim that our results nevertheless demonstrate the theoretical coherence of persistence-selection between non-replicating life–environment interaction patterns and therefore have broad biogeochemical applicability.",

While recent studies have significantly advanced the understanding of seagrass wave attenuation in pure-wave conditions, the presence of a current introduces several complications that have yet to be fully explored. In the present study, we quantify the wave attenuation of seagrass canopies in the presence of a current parallel to the direction of wave propagation via experiments conducted with dynamically scaled mimics of seagrass installed in a laboratory flume facility. The dataset we present is the largest of its kind and spans a broad range of wave properties, current velocities, water depths, and plant densities for a total of over 300 experiments. Using our experimental results, we show that the commonly employed approach of modeling wave attenuation as a result of vegetation drag works well for a range of conditions but underpredicts systematically when turbulence generated by the interaction between the seagrass canopy and the current is sufficiently strong. We then employ phenomenological arguments and experimental data to identify a nondimensional parameter that effectively quantifies the relative importance of turbulence and drag in dictating the overall observed wave attenuation. Moreover, we propose a simple but physically based modeling approach that is consistent with the proposed phenomenology and can be used for applications in coastal waters.",

Here, we study the evaporation dynamics of a tricomponent liquid film, consisting of water, ethanol, and trans-anethole oil (known as “ouzo”). With the preferential evaporation of ethanol, cellular convective structures are observed both in the thermal patterns and in the nucleated oil droplet patterns. However, the feature sizes of these two patterns can differ, indicating dual instability mechanisms dominated by either temperature or solute concentration. Using numerical simulations, we quantitatively compare the contributions of temperature and solute concentration on the surface tension. Our results reveal that the thermal Marangoni effect predominates at the initial evaporation stage, resulting in cellular patterns in thermal images, while the solutal Marangoni effect gradually becomes dominant. By regulating the transition time of this thermal-solutal-induced bistability and the nucleation time of oil microdroplets in the ternary mixture, the oil droplet patterns can be well controlled. This capability not only enhances our understanding of the evaporation dynamics but also paves the way for precise manipulation of nucleation and deposition processes at larger scales.",

Using our wavelet-based representation, we investigate the endogenous or exogenous nature of cojumps, which occur when multiple stocks experience price jumps within the same minute.

          "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales have the largest known RNA genomes of vertebrate and invertebrate viruses with 36.7 and 41.1 kb, respectively. The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb barrier. Other factors constraining genome size variations in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. We assemble 76 genome sequences of invertebrate nidoviruses from &gt;500.000 published transcriptome experiments and triple the number of known nidoviruses with &gt;36 kb genomes, including a 64 kb RNA genome. Many of the identified viral lineages acquired putative enzymatic and other protein domains linked to genome size, host phyla, or virus families. The inserted domains may regulate viral replication and virion formation, or modulate infection otherwise. We classify ExoN-encoding nidoviruses into seven groups and four subgroups, according to canonical and noncanonical modes of viral replicase expression by ribosomes and genomic organization (reModes). The most-represented group employing the canonical reMode comprises invertebrate and vertebrate nidoviruses, including coronaviruses. Six groups with noncanonical reModes include invertebrate nidoviruses with 31-to-64 kb genomes. Among them are viruses with segmented genomes and viruses utilizing dual ribosomal frameshifting that we validate experimentally. Moreover, largest polyprotein length and genome size in nidoviruses show reMode- and host phylum-dependent relationships. We hypothesize that the polyprotein length increase in nidoviruses may be limited by the host-inherent translation fidelity, ultimately setting a nidovirus genome size limit. Thus, expansion of ExoN-encoding RNA virus genomes, the vertebrate/invertebrate host division, the control of viral replicase expression, and translation fidelity are interconnected.",

          "abstract": "Quantifying viral load, a key indicator required to achieve control and elimination of the HIV epidemic, requires cell-free plasma or serum to ensure measurements are not biased by proviral DNA contained in infected CD4 T lymphocytes. Plasma separation cards (PSC) collect and preserve a dried specimen, which makes them practical solutions for decentralized sample collection and transport in limited-resource settings. However, physiological variations in hematocrit levels can introduce significant variability in the quality of plasma generated by commercial PSCs and can lead to inaccurate test results and clinical decisions. In addition to hematocrit-dependent sampling, the Roche PSC, a standard for dried plasma collection, is known to induce considerable hemolysis, which further impacts specimen quality, concordance with liquid plasma, and the overall benefit of microsampling. We address these gaps with a patterned dried plasma spot (pDPS) card, which generates plasma with improved hematocrit independence and minimal hemolysis. This study directly compares pDPS cards to the Roche PSC to measure HIV viral load. Analysis of viral load from 75 donors revealed strong agreement in sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and viral load band placement between devices, with quantitative metrics suggesting improved performance for pDPS cards. In reflexive genotyping, remnant dried blood from pDPS cards exhibited greater success than Roche PSC in amplification and sequencing (71% vs. 62%) and detecting drug resistance mutations (63% vs. 42%). Based on this performance, pDPS cards can be versatile across multiple analytical platforms, integrate seamlessly into existing clinical laboratory workflows, and aid clinicians in making accurate treatment decisions.",

Zymocin is encoded by a killer plasmid or virus-like element (VLE), which is a linear DNA molecule located in the cytosol. We hypothesized that a tRNA-cleaving toxin similar to zymocin may have caused the three parallel changes to the nuclear genetic code that occurred during yeast evolution, in which the codon CUG became translated as Ser or Ala instead of Leu. However, zymocin-like toxins are rare — both among species, and among strains within a species —and only four toxins of this type have previously been discovered. Here, we identified 45 zymocin-like toxin genes in Saccharomycotina, the budding yeast subphylum, using a bioinformatics strategy, and verified that many of them are toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae when expressed. Some of the toxin genes are located on cytosolic VLEs, whereas others are on VLE-derived DNA integrated into the nuclear genome. The toxins are extraordinarily diverse in sequence and show evidence of positive selection. Toxin genes were found in five taxonomic orders of budding yeasts, including two of the three orders that reassigned CUG codons, indicating that VLEs have been parasites of yeast species for at least 300 My and that their existence predates the genetic code changes.",

          "abstract": "Aminoglycosides (AGs) are highly potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics frequently used as first-line treatments for multiple life-threatening infections. Despite their severe ototoxicity, causing irreversible hearing loss in millions of people annually, no preventive therapy has been approved. We previously reported that GABARAP and several other central autophagy proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss. This finding opens avenues for the rational design and development of inhibitors that selectively target proteins in this pathway, thereby mitigating AG ototoxicity. In this study, we generated a mouse model with a targeted deletion of GABARAPL1, a homolog of GABARAP, and another model deficient in both GABARAP and GABARAPL1. We found that normal hearing is unaffected by the depletion of these proteins. Remarkably, both proteins are essential for AG-induced hearing loss, with GABARAP playing a more significant role. To further explore the therapeutic potential, we designed and validated short hairpin RNAs targeting the mouse and human GABARAP gene. By inhibiting GABARAP expression in inner ear hair cells using adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference, we successfully prevented AG-induced hair cell death and subsequent hearing loss. Our findings underscore the critical role of GABARAP in AG ototoxicity and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing AG-induced hearing loss.",

          "abstract": "The house mouse X and Y chromosomes have recently acquired multicopy, rapidly evolving gene families representing an evolutionary arms race. This arms race between proteins encoded by X-linked Slxl1 / Slx and Y-linked Sly gene families can distort offspring sex ratio, but how these proteins compete remains unknown. Here, we report how Slxl1 / Slx and Sly encoded proteins compete in a protein family–specific and dose-dependent manner using yeast. Specifically, SLXL1 competes with SLY1 and SLY2 for binding to the Spindlin SPIN1. Similarly, SLX competes with SLY2 for binding the Spindlin SSTY2. These competitions are driven by the N termini of SLXL1, SLX, SLY1, and SLY2 binding to the third Tudor domains of SPIN1 and SSTY2. SLY1 and SLY2 form homo- and heterodimers, suggesting that the competition is between complex multimers. Residues under positive selection mapping to the interaction domains and rapid exon gain/loss are consistent with competition between the X- and Y-linked gene families. Our findings support a model in which dose-dependent competition of these X- and Y-linked encoded proteins to bind Spindlins occurs in haploid X- and Y-spermatids to influence X- versus Y-sperm fitness and thus sex ratio.",

Here, we synthesized a global dataset of 6,733 independent observations across six continents to illustrate the climatic and substrate controls over litter decomposition. The average decomposition rates of various litter types ranged from 0.74 to 4.01 y −1 across polar to tropics, showing a large geographical span. Litter substrate and climate directly explained 36 and 30% of the variations in decomposition rates, with the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio identified as the best predictor. In the absence of climate variables, litter substrate can effectively explain the variation, while the model’s predictive capacity decreased significantly after litter substrate was excluded. Our synthesis highlights that a fundamental constraint on litter substrate leads to predictable global-scale patterns of terrestrial litter decomposition rates. Integrating litter chemistry parameters should be prioritized for parameter optimization in Earth system models.",

So would transgenically increasing Rubisco increase A sat and result in increased productivity in the field? Here, we successfully overexpressed the Rubisco small subunit ( RbcS ) with Rubisco accumulation factor 1 ( Raf1 ) in both sorghum and sugarcane, resulting in significant increases in Rubisco content of 13 to 25% and up to 90% respectively. A sat increased 12 to 15% and Rubisco enzyme activity ~40% in three independent transgenic events of both species. Sorghum plants also showed increased speeds of photosynthetic induction and decreased bundle sheath leakiness. These improvements translated into average increases of 15.5% in biomass in field-grown sorghum and a 37 to 81% increase in greenhouse-grown sugarcane. This suggests a potential opportunity to achieve substantial increases in productivity of this key economically important clade of C 4 crops, future proofing their value under global atmospheric change.",

          "abstract": "Bone is a dynamic organ constantly undergoing remodeling with both bone formation and resorption. Bone formation is mediated by osteoblasts originating from the differentiation of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (BM-MSPCs). However, how bone cells communicate with BM-MSPCs to coordinate bone formation remains largely elusive. Here, we unveil a key role of osteocyte connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels in regulating the lineage commitment of BM-MSPCs. Two transgenic mouse models expressing dominant negative Cx43 mutants in osteocytes were used: R76W (inhibiting gap junctions) and Δ130 to 136 (inhibiting both hemichannels and gap junctions). BM-MSPCs from Δ130 to 136 mice showed enhanced adipogenic differentiation and reduced osteogenic potential, leading to increased BM adipocytes. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed shifts in BM-MSPC subsets, less osteogenic-biased MSPCs, and more adipogenic-biased MSPCs in Δ130 to 136 mice. Conversely, R76W, with more functional hemichannels, exhibited effects similar to WT mice or even greater opposite effects than Δ130 to 136 mice. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), released from active Cx43 hemichannels, inhibited adipogenesis and promoted osteogenesis via the PGE 2 receptor EP4 and ERK1/2 signaling. Inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels or EP4 led to increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs. Moreover, administration of a Cx43(M1) antibody, which inhibits hemichannels, substantially increased BM adipocytes, accompanied by increased adipogenic-biased MSPCs, and decreased osteogenic-biased MSPCs. Our study highlights the pivotal role of osteocyte Cx43 hemichannels in BM-MSPC fate decision through PGE 2 release, providing insights into the precise and highly regulated communication between matrix-bound bone cells and BM-MSPCs, which dictates bone formation and remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Urate provides ~50% of the reducing potential in human and primate plasma which is key to detoxifying reactive oxygen by-products of cellular metabolism. Urate is the endpoint of purine metabolism in primates, and its concentration in plasma is a balance between excretion from kidney and intestine, and subsequent reabsorption in and through cells of kidney proximal tubules to maintain a regulated concentration in plasma. SLC2A9 is the primary transporter that returns urate from the basolateral side of kidney tubule cells back to plasma. A shorter splice variant of SLC2A9 is directed to the apical surface where several transporters recapture urate from the tubule back into cells. Too high a concentration in plasma causes hyperuricemia, is linked to gout, and favors kidney stone formation. To understand the molecular basis of uric acid transport and the role of disease-causing mutations in SLC2A9, we determined structures of human SLC2A9 in its apo form, and its urate-bound form by cryo-EM, at resolution of 3.3 Å and 4.1 Å respectively. Both structures are captured in an inward open conformation. Using the inward-facing structure as a template we modeled the outward-facing conformation to understand the alternating access mechanism. Alternative salt bridge pairs on the cytoplasmic side suggest a mechanism that can balance the energetics of the inward open and outward open states. The location of disease-causing mutants suggests their role in impacting function. Our structures elucidate the molecular basis for urate selectivity and transport and provide a platform for future structure-based drug discovery aimed at reducing plasma urate levels in diseases of hyperuricemia and gout.",

In obese mice lacking the endothelial adrenomedullin receptor, insulin-induced endothelial nitric oxide–synthase activation and skeletal muscle perfusion were increased. Treating mice with adrenomedullin mimicked the effect of obesity and induced endothelial and systemic insulin resistance.

          "abstract": "In eukaryotes, DNA-associated protein complexes coevolve with genomic sequences to orchestrate chromatin folding. We investigate the relationship between DNA sequence and the spontaneous loading and activity of chromatin components in the absence of coevolution. Using bacterial genomes integrated into Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which diverged from yeast more than 2 billion years ago, we show that nucleosomes, cohesins, and associated transcriptional machinery can lead to the formation of two different chromatin archetypes, one transcribed and the other silent, independently of heterochromatin formation. These two archetypes also form on eukaryotic exogenous sequences, depend on sequence composition, and can be predicted using neural networks trained on the native genome. They do not mix in the nucleus, leading to a bipartite nuclear compartmentalization, reminiscent of the organization of vertebrate nuclei.",

However, the dioecious plant Silene latifolia has a giant ~550-megabase Y chromosome, which has remained unsequenced so far. We used a long- and short-read hybrid approach to obtain a high-quality male genome. Comparative analysis of the sex chromosomes with their homologs in outgroups showed that the Y is highly rearranged and degenerated. Recombination suppression between X and Y extended in several steps and triggered a massive accumulation of repeats on the Y as well as in the nonrecombining pericentromeric region of the X, leading to giant sex chromosomes. Using sex phenotype mutants, we identified candidate sex-determining genes on the Y in locations consistent with their favoring recombination suppression events 11 and 5 million years ago.",

However, the impact of nutrient metabolism on epigenetic modifications that control TEX differentiation remains unclear. We showed that TEX cells shifted from acetate to citrate metabolism by down-regulating acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) while maintaining ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) activity. This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses. These findings unveiled a nutrient-instructed histone code governing CD8 + T cell differentiation, with implications for metabolic- and epigenetic-based T cell therapies.",

Major knowledge gaps in critical processes—spanning the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheets, underlying beds, ice shelves, and sea ice—create uncertainties in future projections, hindering climate adaptation and risk assessments of ice intervention strategies. Antarctica’s ice sheet could contribute 28 centimeters to sea level by 2100, and potentially more if we surpass warming thresholds that trigger instabilities and rapid retreat. We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research. Progress requires high-resolution satellite data, targeted field campaigns, improved modeling, and refined theory. Increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential to uncovering Antarctica’s hidden processes and reducing uncertainties in future projections.",

In this work, we explored the phononic properties of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club using laser ultrasonic techniques and numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the dactyl club’s periodic region functions as a dispersive, high-quality graded system, exhibiting Bloch harmonics, flat dispersion branches, ultraslow wave modes, and wide Bragg bandgaps in the lower megahertz range. These features effectively shield the shrimp from harmful high-frequency stress waves generated by cavitation bubble collapse events during impact.",

However, only with a whole Y chromosome assembly can candidate genes be validated experimentally and their locations determined and related to the suppression of recombination. We describe the genomic changes as the ancestral chromosome evolved into the current XY pair, testing ideas about the evolution of large nonrecombining regions and the mechanisms that created the present recombination pattern.",

Evolutionary histories and functional ecology are well understood only for vertebrates, whereas research on invertebrates is largely limited to species descriptions and some studies on environmental tolerances. Knowledge on Antarctic vegetation cover showcases the challenges of characterizing population trends for most groups. Recent community-level microbial studies have provided insights into the functioning of life at its limits. Overall, biotic interactions remain largely unknown across all groups, restricted to basic information on trophic level placement. Insufficient knowledge of many groups limits the understanding of ecological processes on the continent. Remedies for the current situation rely on identifying the caveats of each ecological discipline and finding targeted solutions.

Human language, which is also culturally transmitted, has statistically coherent parts whose frequency distribution follows a power law.

If so, we would expect to find them in other culturally transmitted systems. In this study, we applied methods based on infant speech segmentation to 8 years of humpback recordings, uncovering in whale song the same statistical structure that is a hallmark of human language. This commonality, in two evolutionarily distant species, points to the role of learning and cultural transmission in the emergence of properties thought to be unique to human language.",

Animals can adapt their behavior and suppress instinctive reactions, but the neural pathways mediating such ethologically relevant forms of learning remain unclear. We found that posterolateral higher visual areas (plHVAs) are crucial for learning to suppress escapes from innate visual threats through a top-down pathway to the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). plHVAs are no longer necessary after learning; instead, the learned behavior relies on plasticity within vLGN populations that exert inhibitory control over escape responses. vLGN neurons receiving input from plHVAs enhance their responses to visual threat stimuli during learning through endocannabinoid-mediated long-term suppression of their inhibitory inputs. We thus reveal the detailed circuit, cellular, and synaptic mechanisms underlying experience-dependent suppression of fear responses.",

Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, a 1-gigahertz frequency comb centered at 1560 nanometers is amplitude-squeezed by &gt;3 decibels (dB) over a 2.5-terahertz bandwidth. Dual-comb interferometry yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio nearly 3 dB beyond the shot-noise limit.

          "abstract": "Dengue fever poses major public health challenges, with climate change complicating control efforts. Yet, the full extent of climate change’s impact on dengue remains elusive. To investigate this, we used an advanced causal inference method to 16 diverse climatic regions in the Philippines. This method is capable of detecting nonlinear and joint effects of temperature and rainfall to dengue incidence. We found that temperature consistently increased dengue incidence throughout all the regions, while rainfall effects differed depending on the variation in dry season length, a factor previously overlooked. Specifically, our results showed that regions with low variation in dry season length experience a negative impact of rainfall on dengue incidence likely due to strong flushing effect on mosquito habitats, while regions with high variation in dry season length experience a positive impact, likely due to increased mosquito breeding sites. Our findings emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies based on local climate conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.",

Previous assessments of temperature-related mortality, however, lack a comprehensive analysis of distinct impacts of temperature change across different timescales and characteristics. Using a longitudinal survey of 27,233 elderly Chinese citizens from 2005 to 2018, we establish connections between rising temperatures, temperature variability, and extreme heat with increased mortality risk, assessed through four annual metrics that combine temperature and humidity. The intensity and prolonged duration of extreme heat are found to have the greatest impact on mortality risk. Furthermore, by identifying heterogeneous impacts based on location, sex, age, obesity, income, and diet, we reveal the pathways through which temperature metrics are likely to influence mortality risk. Our study highlights the compound effects of rising temperatures for elderly populations, and it could be expanded to other countries and regions experiencing similar challenges due to an aging population experiencing warming conditions.",

We show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, from where it recruits ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers. Last, we show that Asgard ESCRT-IIIA is able to remodel membranes into tubes as a likely prelude to scission.

Microtubule reorganization supports plant survival in saline-rich soils, but the underlying molecular mechanism in tree species remains unclear. In this study, we identified a salinity stress response mechanism in hybrid poplar seedlings. This mechanism involves regulation of microtubule dynamics by the microtubule-associated protein PLASMA MEMBRANE–ASSOCIATED CATION BINDING PROTEIN 1a (PagPCaP1a). Salinity stress induced PagPCaP1a expression and phase separation of PagPCaP1a protein to form PagPCaP1a condensates in a calcium-dependent manner. The formation of PagPCaP1a condensates was partially driven by the VEEEKK motif within the carboxyl terminus of the protein, which rapidly depolymerizes microtubules under salinity stress. Our study reveals that the liquid-liquid phase separation of PagPCaP1a represents an additional regulatory layer for microtubule depolymerization, and we propose an effective strategy to manipulate the phase separation of PagPCaP1a to improve plant stress tolerance.",

A fundamental question in understanding the plasma dynamics is how energy is transported and dissipated across scales. Here, we present spacecraft measurements in the terrestrial foreshock, a region upstream of the bow shock where the solar wind population coexists with the reflected ions. In this region, the fluid-scale, ultralow-frequency waves resonate with the reflected ions to modify the velocity distributions, which in turn cause the growth of the ion-scale, magnetosonic-whistler waves. The latter waves then resonate with the electrons, and the accelerated electrons contribute to the excitation of electron-scale, high-frequency whistler waves. These observations demonstrate that the chain of wave-particle resonances is an efficient mechanism for cross-scale energy transfer, which could redistribute the kinetic energy and accelerate the particles upstream of the shocks.",

The potential influence of the gut microbiota on MAIT cell homing to different regions of the human gut is also discussed. Last, we introduce how organoid technology offers a potentially valuable approach to advance our understanding of MAIT cell tissue homing by providing a more physiologically relevant model that mimics the human gut tissue. These models may enable a detailed investigation of the gut-specific homing mechanisms of MAIT cells. By understanding the regulation of MAIT cell homing to the human gut, potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting gut inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) may emerge.",

          "abstract": "The mechanism for neurological deficits from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is unclear. In a series of 150 patients with CO poisoning, we found marked elevations of blood-borne inflammatory filamentous (F-) actin–coated microparticles (MPs), neutrophil activation, and a 90% reduction in the normal level of plasma gelsolin (pGSN), a protein capable of lysing F-actin–coated MPs. This led to studies in a murine model where the same events occur and cause neuroinflammation with cognitive dysfunction. All events are recapitulated when F-actin MPs are injected intravenously, which establishes a blood-to-brain-to-blood inflammatory cycle that persists for weeks. All changes, including cognitive dysfunction, can be abrogated by an injection of human recombinant pGSN within 2 weeks after CO poisoning. These findings demonstrate that CO-induced neurological injury has an inflammatory etiology. Because of MP-mediated communications between the brain and systemic circulation, CO-induced cognitive deficits may be reversible with a pharmaceutical intervention.",

However, the inherent inaccuracies of analog mechanisms create challenges in achieving high-precision solutions while maintaining low-energy consumption. This study introduces a memristive matrix equation solver that considerably accelerates solutions by performing mathematical iterations directly within an analog domain. Our approach facilitates rapid approximate solutions with a scalable circuit topology and expedites the high-precision refinement process by substantially reducing the digital-to-analog conversion overhead. We experimentally validated this methodology using a heterogeneous computing system. We performed simulations of multiple scientific problems on these circuits, including solving the diffusion equation and modeling equilibration in silicon P-N junctions. Notably, our memristive solver, combined with digital refinement, achieved software-equivalent precision (with an error of 10 −12 ). Compared to conventional digital processing units, this approach offered a 128-fold improvement in solution speed and a 160-fold reduction in energy consumption. This work establishes a foundation for future scientific computing using imprecise analog devices.",

Many organisms achieve camouflage and expression through skin deformation and color change. Inspired by this, we report a reprogrammable chemical fluid skin, which achieves deformation through fluids like the skin of a pufferfish and achieves color change function like the skin of a chameleon. Based on the skin, we design a soft mask that allows switching between at least eight human faces at a time. The soft mask is lightweight, thin, and fits the wearer’s head. Its actuation is silent and safe, and can realize facial switching, including facial color and shape. By wearing the soft mask, robots can show facial changes and expression modulation, and humans can change their faces as needed. Our work enables the implementation of transforming a human into other humans in the real world to achieve camouflage and expression, which, to date, exists only in people’s imagination.",

Here, we investigate changes in permafrost under net-zero and negative emissions, based on idealized emission-driven simulations using a state-of-the-art Earth system model. While acting as a net ecosystem carbon sink during most of the positive emission phase, permafrost becomes a net ecosystem carbon source just before reaching net-zero and negative emissions. Permafrost slowly recovers, especially in regions with high organic carbon content, and net ecosystem carbon loss persists until the end of simulations, resulting in a cumulative net ecosystem carbon loss of approximately 14 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in both scenarios. In addition, methane emissions increase under net-zero and negative emissions, due to the irreversibility of the inundated areas. We conclude that the permafrost ecosystem carbon loss may continue under net-zero and negative emissions, which could hinder climate change mitigation efforts.",

Retromer (VPS26/VPS35/VPS29) binds multiple sorting nexin (SNX) proteins on endosomal membranes, but assembly mechanisms of metazoan SNX/Retromer complexes remain elusive. We combine biochemical and biophysical approaches with AlphaFold modeling to identify a previously unidentified direct interaction between SNX27 and VARP. A full biochemical reconstitution system using purified proteins systematically tests how and when coats are recruited to membranes to generate tubules. We demonstrate and measure how specific combinations of Retromer with SNX27, ESCPE-1 (SNX2/SNX6), or both complexes, remodel membranes containing physiological cargo and phospholipids. SNX27, alone and with Retromer, remodels membranes with PI(3)P and PDZbm cargo. ESCPE-1 deforms membranes with bis-phosphoinositides and CI-MPR cargo but surprisingly does not recruit Retromer. VARP co-immunoprecipitates all coat components in cells and is required to reconstitute a proposed endosomal “supercomplex” (SNX27, ESCPE-1, and Retromer) in vitro. These data suggest VARP regulates metazoan endosomal coat assembly to promote cargo sorting out of endosomes.",

To date, model limitations have prevented quantifying climate-lightning-wildfire interactions comprehensively. We exploit advances in Earth System modeling to examine these three-way interactions and their sensitivities to idealized CO 2 forcing in 140-year simulations. Lightning sensitivity to global temperature change (+1.6 ± 0.1% per kelvin) is mitigated by compensating atmospheric effects. Global burned area sensitivity to temperature (+13.8 ± 0.3% per kelvin) is largely driven by intensified fire weather and increased biomass but marginally by lightning changes. We find a universal law characterizing regional-scale modeled fire activity and its CO 2 sensitivity, consistent with basic principles of statistical mechanics. Last, a negative climate feedback through intensified aerosol direct effect from fire emissions reaches an equivalent decrease of 0.91 ± 0.01% in CO 2 radiative forcing. However, this feedback contributes to polar amplification. Our analysis shows that climate-lightning-wildfire interactions involve multiple compensating and amplifying feedbacks, which are sensitive to anthropogenic CO 2 forcing.",

          "abstract": "This work aimed to reveal the molecular machinery regulating the dormancy of dinoflagellate resting cysts buried in marine sediments. Dinoflagellates play pivotal roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as major contributors of harmful algal blooms. Despite vital roles of cysts in blooming cycles and dinoflagellate ecology, the molecular processes controlling cyst dormancy have largely remained unexplored due to technological difficulties. Using DinoSL as a dinoflagellates-specific mRNA “hook” and SMRT sequencing, we analyzed metatranscriptomes of sediment-buried dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The data show that most major metabolic and regulatory pathways, except photosynthesis, were transcriptionally active. This suggests the crucial importance of broad metabolic pathways in sustaining cyst viability and germination potential. Further expression analyses of 11 genes (relevant to autophagy and phytohormone gibberellin), lysosome/autolysosome staining, and germination experiments revealed vital roles of autophagy in energy generation, nutrient recycling, and of phytohormones abscisic acid/gibberellin in modulating dormancy/germination of resting cysts. Our findings lay a cornerstone for elucidating the molecular machinery regulating dinoflagellate cyst dormancy.",

          "abstract": "The conjugate additions of nucleophiles to conjugate acceptors are among the most powerful hetero-carbon bond formation reactions. The conjugate addition normally occurs via a β-nucleophilic addition, resulting in the formation of a stabilized α-carbanion intermediate that can be subsequently quenched by electrophiles or protons. Nevertheless, the inverse conjugate addition involving an α-specific nucleophilic addition remains less explored because of the electronic mismatch. In this research, we disclosed an α-specific nucleophilic addition of the nucleophiles including Py·HF, TBACl, HOR, H 2 O, H 2 18 O, RCO 2 H, and pyrazole to conjugate acceptors concurrent with a trifluoromethylation. This umpolung and inversely regioselective conjugate addition, enabled by a visible light–induced redox photocatalysis, occurred via an unusual α-nucleophilic addition other than the normal β-nucleophilic addition to efficiently generate diverse α-functionalized CF 3 -containing amides/esters. The broad substrate scope, excellent functional-group tolerance, and versatile late-stage derivatizations as well as the biologically and functionally important CF 3 -containing products demonstrated the potential applications of this protocol in materials, agrochemicals, and pharmaceutical chemistry.",

We examined how diabetes affects the emergence of antibiotic resistance in a Staphylococcus aureus SSTI. We determined that S. aureus evolves antibiotic resistance rapidly in diabetic mice, while resistance did not occur in nondiabetic mice over the course of infection. Diabetes-associated immune cell dysfunction plays a minor role in the emergence of resistance, while hyperglycemia plays a dominant role facilitating the expansion and takeover of resistant mutants in diabetic infections. Furthermore, vancomycin intermediate resistant isolates display a pronounced fitness defect in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Together, these data suggest that the diabetic infection environment represents an ideal reservoir for the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance. Controlling the blood sugar of diabetic mice with insulin resulted in significantly decreased incidence of antibiotic-resistant S. aureus .",

We determined the isomer shift [δ = 3.3(1) millimeters per second] relative to [Os IV Cl 6 ] 2− and quadrupole splitting [Δ E Q = 12.0(2) millimeters per second] with NFS. We estimated the Lamb-Mössbauer factor [0.80(4)], extracted the density of phonon states, and carried out a thermodynamics characterization using the NIS data combined with first-principles calculations. Overall, we provide evidence that 187 Os nuclear resonance scattering is a reliable technique for the investigation of hyperfine interactions and Os-specific vibrations in osmium(VI) species and is thus applicable for such measurements in osmium complexes of other oxidation states, including those with anticancer activity such as Os(III) and Os(IV).",

It enables modular synthesis of functionally and structurally diverse tertiary amines, ethers, esters, phosphine oxides, etc., as well as related pesticides, drug intermediates, and pharmaceuticals. Compared to phosphorus-mediated name reactions, this strategy firstly transformed C═O bonds into C-element single bonds. Mechanistically, phosphinates are formed as intermediates, which undergo unconventional nucleophilic substitution at the C atom within their C─O─P unit.

Besides, materials require combinations of performance such as load bearing and energy dissipation. However, improving one performance of a material often sacrifices another performance, making it difficult to create materials with optimal performance profiles. Here we report a liquid-infused porous piezoelectric scaffold (LIPPS) that simultaneously enhances its load-bearing and energy dissipation capability under cyclic loading. For example, after 12 million loading cycles, LIPPS increases its modulus by 3600% and hysteresis by 3000%. From a CT study, this behavior is attributed to the self-recoverable mineralization under mechanical loading. Moreover, LIPPS shows a reprogrammable stiffness distribution based on the loading distribution, which enables the material to generate multiple shapes by self-folding. Our findings can contribute toward unprecedented opportunities in soft robotics, vehicles, infrastructure, and tissue engineering and contribute to the new paradigm of material selection with improved resilience and sustainability.",

The PCM comprises hundreds of proteins, and there is much debate about its physical nature. Here, we show that Drosophila Spd-2 (human CEP192) fluxes out from centrioles, recruiting Polo and Aurora A kinases to catalyze the assembly of two distinct mitotic-PCM scaffolds: a Polo-dependent Cnn scaffold, and an Aurora A–dependent TACC scaffold, which exhibit solid- and liquid-like behaviors, respectively. Both scaffolds can independently recruit PCM proteins, but both are required for proper centrosome assembly, with the Cnn scaffold providing mechanical strength, and the TACC scaffold concentrating centriole and centrosome proteins. Recruiting Spd-2 to synthetic beads injected into early embryos reconstitutes key aspects of mitotic centrosome assembly on the bead surface, and this depends on Spd-2’s ability to recruit Polo and Aurora A. Thus, Spd-2 orchestrates the assembly of two scaffolds, with distinct biophysical properties, that cooperate to build mitotic centrosomes in flies.",

To address the slow stiffness change, we propose a VS catheter based on fiber jamming (FJ) that achieves instant stiffness changes (≤300 ms), enabling seamless catheter operations without delays. Moreover, our catheter, incorporating hundreds of ultrathin fibers into a slender 2.3-mm catheter body, achieves up to 6.5-fold stiffness changes. With adequate stiffness change, our two-segment catheter achieves complex bending profiles within seconds. In addition, the FJ-based design does not require electric currents or heating inside the human body, minimizing patient risks. This FJ-based VS catheter, with instantaneous response, adequate stiffness change, and enhanced safety, can potentially establish benchmarks in MIS, allowing medical practitioners to effectively address formidable diseases.",

The neuron array can function as double-opponent receptive fields for spatial-chromatic opponent preprocessing to color signals, emulating the neural pathway from the retina to the cortex. With the color spiking preprocessing function of the neuron array, the recognition accuracy is improved almost twofold compared to direct perception of underexposure objects, and the noise robustness is also strengthened.

However, this mutation type has not been studied in other cancer genes. Here, we explore somatic nonstop mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 Associated Protein 1 ( BAP1 ) and Von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) enriched in renal cell carcinoma. For BAP1 , nonstop mutations generate an extremely long extension. Instead of proteasomal degradation, the extension decreases translation and depletes BAP1 messenger RNA from heavy polysomes. For VHL , the short extension leads to proteasomal degradation. Unexpectedly, the mutation alters the selection of the translational start site shifting VHL isoforms. We identify germline VHL nonstop mutations in patients leading to the early onset of severe disease manifestations. In summary, nonstop extension mutations inhibit the expression of renal tumor suppressor genes with pleiotropic effects on translation and protein stability.",

To this end, we leverage cell-cell “NETwork” of neutrophils to deliver SERCA activator-loaded SR-localized nanoparticles (L-P-NPs) to the damaged myocardial cells, following a hierarchical targeting process: (i) chemotactic neutrophils deliver L-P-NPs to ischemia-reperfused heart, achieving tissue level targeting; (ii) neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to transport L-P-NPs to injured myocardial cell, achieving cellular level targeting; (iii) L-P-NPs escort therapeutic payloads to the SR, achieving subcellular targeting.

We show that in Arabidopsis mur1 mutant, CWI defects from compromising dimerization of RG-II pectin, a key component of cell wall, attenuate the expression of auxin response factors ARF7-ARF19 . As a result, polar auxin transport components are misexpressed, disrupting auxin response asymmetry, leading to defective apical hook development. Accordingly, mur1 hook defects are suppressed by enhancing ARF7 expression. In addition, expression of brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes is down-regulated in mur1 mutant, and supplementing brassinosteroid or enhancing brassinosteroid signaling suppresses mur1 hook defects. Intriguingly, brassinosteroid enhances RG-II dimerization, showing hormonal feedback to the cell wall. Our results thus reveal a previously unrecognized link between cell wall defects from reduced RG-II dimerization and growth regulation mediated via modulation of auxin-brassinosteroid pathways in early seedling development.",

We studied circadian clocks of blind cave spiders and their sighted relatives. In the field, cave spiders exhibit low per expression and maintain constant activity levels. Curiously, their clocks are not permanently lost; exposure to monochromatic blue light restores both circadian gene expression and behavioral rhythms. Conversely, blocking blue light in sighted relatives induces an arrhythmic “cave phenotype.” Our RNA interference experiments suggest that clock genes regulate the rhythmicity of the huddle response, establishing a link between circadian gene networks and this behavioral rhythm. We demonstrate that circadian regulation is readily toggled and may play a latent role, even in constant darkness.

Here, we present the direct laboratory experimental evidence of ion energization from single reflection off a supercritical collisionless shock, an essential component of Fermi acceleration, in a laser-produced magnetized plasma. A quasi-monoenergetic ion beam with two to four times the shock velocity was observed, which is consistent with the fast ion component observed in the Earth’s bow shock. Our simulations reproduced the energy gain and showed that ions were accelerated mainly by the motional electric field during reflection. The results identify shock drift acceleration as the dominant ion energization mechanism, which is consistent with satellite observation in the Earth’s bow shock. Our observations pave the way for laboratory investigations of the cosmic accelerators, also be beneficial to laser fusion and laser-driven ion accelerator.",

Here, we elucidate the in vivo temporal RNA interactome landscapes of Imp and Syp during larval brain development. Imp and Syp bind a highly overlapping set of conserved mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neurodevelopment. We identify transcripts differentially occupied by Imp/Syp over time, featuring a network of known and previously unknown candidate temporal regulators that are post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp/Syp. Furthermore, the physical and coevolutionary relationships between Imp and Syp binding sites reveal a combinatorial, rather than competitive, mode of molecular interplay. Our study establishes an in vivo framework for dissecting the temporal coregulation of RBP networks as well as providing a resource for understanding neural fate specification.",

Density functional theory calculations show that electron transfer occurs to a solvated CO 2 -cation complex. A more positive potential of zero charge enhances CO 2 R activity only on Au with similar surface coordination. The symmetry factor (β) of the rate-determining step varies with surface structure and cation identity, with density functional theory calculations indicating β’s sensitivity to surface and double-layer structures.

Melanoma antigen-A4 (MAGE-A4), a cancer-testis antigen, is expressed in solid tumors and correlates with poor survival, but its role in tumorigenesis and antitumor immunity remains unclear. We found that expression of MAGE-A4 was highly associated with the loss of PTEN , a tumor suppressor, in human non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Here, we show that constitutive expression of human MAGE-A4 with Pten loss in mouse airway epithelia results in metastatic adenocarcinoma. Tumors showed distinct enrichment in IgA + CD138 + CXCR4 + plasma cells (PCs) and increased expression of CXCL12 in endothelial cells. Consistently, human NSCLC expressing MAGE-A4 showed increased CD138 + IgA + PCs surrounding tumors. Abrogation of PCs decreased tumor burden, increased activated T cell infiltration, and reduced CD163 + CD206 + macrophages in the MAGE-A4–induced lung tumors.

We discovered that restoration of mTOR signaling was the early dominant driver of resistance to Akt inhibition. Mechanistically, this can be achieved through molecular alterations, resulting in loss of negative regulators of mTOR. Unexpectedly, we discovered that this was dominated by restoration of mTOR signaling through the nutrient sensing arm. This can be achieved by loss of the components of the GATOR/KICSTOR complexes or through cellular processes, leading to the recycling of amino acids. The addition of an mTOR inhibitor restored sensitivity to Akt inhibition and represents a precision-based strategy to overcome resistance in the clinic.",

We show that bacterial cellulose (BC), but not other structurally similar matrixes, induces postwounding regeneration in nonmeristematic plant tissues via a distinctive route to callus-mediated regenerative programs. The BC-specific program involves cytokinin operating concurrently with strongly activated plant biotic response genes to induce plant regeneration. A reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, normally associated with defense responses, is sustained upon BC application, involving a network of tightly interconnected transcription factors, where WRKY8, known for regulating stress responses, shows a clustering and hierarchical prevalence. WRKY8 regulates BC-mediated plant regeneration and ROS homeostasis, including superoxide anion accumulation, to potentially promote cell proliferation after wounding. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the cytokinin- and ROS-associated defense responses can be targeted by BC application to promote plant wound regeneration through alternative regenerative programs.",

Despite excessive accumulation of α-syn being key to the pathogenesis of PD, the mechanisms governing its clearance remain elusive. In this study, we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system plays a crucial role in capturing and facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated α-syn. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Listerin was found to promote K27-linked polyubiquitination of α-syn, directing it to the endosome for subsequent degradation. We showed that the deletion of the Listerin gene exacerbates the neurodegenerative progression in a mouse model of PD, whereas the overexpression of Listerin effectively mitigates disease progression in PD mice. Consequently, our study reveals a mechanism for α-syn degradation and identifies Listerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.",

To facilitate systematic studies, we here present a targeted approach to determine the impact of cancer-associated protease variants (TACAP). Starting with the semiautomated identification of potential specificity-modulating SNVs, our workflow comprises mass spectrometry–based cleavage specificity profiling and substrate identification, localization, and inhibitor studies, followed by functional analyses investigating cancer cell properties. To demonstrate the feasibility of TACAP, we analyzed the meprin β R238Q variant.

Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel ML methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta.

In our work, we demonstrate that an anomalous logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy (EE) persists in a class of models analogous to the DQCP. On the basis of quantum Monte Carlo computation of the EE on SU( N ) DQCP spin models, we show that for a series of N smaller than a critical value, the anomalous logarithmic behavior always exists, which implies that previously determined DQCPs in these models do not belong to conformal fixed points. In contrast, when N ≥ N c with an N c we evaluate to lie between 7 and 8, DQCPs are consistent with conformal fixed points that can be understood within the Abelian Higgs field theory.",

However, the mechanism by which DNA damage is sensed and translated into PafBC activation has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the binding of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to the WYL domains of PafBC activates the transcription factor. Our cryo–electron microscopy structure of full-length PafBC in its active conformation, bound to the transcription initiation complex, reveals a previously unknown mode of interaction between the ssDNA and the WYL domains.

GATA6 protein also physically interacts with CTCF, suggesting its critical role in 3D genome organization. The ablation of GATA6 through AID and CRISPR systems severely impaired cancer cell clonogenicity and proliferation.

Rituximab in vasculitis exacerbates neutralization deficits over standard immunosuppressive therapy, although impairment resolves over time since dosing. We observed discordance between detectable IgG binding and neutralizing activity specifically in the context of rituximab use, with high proportions of individuals showing reasonable IgG titer but no neutralization.

Lichens, symbiotic complexes involving fungi and either cyanobacteria, green algae, or both, have fungi forming the external layer and much of the interior. We found an erect thallus resembling a lichen yet with an unexpected thallus structure composed of interwoven cyanobacterial filaments with numerous fungal hyphae inserted within individual cyanobacterial sheaths, contrasting with typical lichen structure. Phylogenetics identified the fungus as a previously undescribed species, Serendipita cyanobacteriicola , closely related to endophytes, and the cyanobacterium belongs to the family Coleofasciculaceae, representing a genus and species not yet classified, Symbiothallus taiwanensis . These thalli exhibit nitrogen-fixing activity similar to mosses but lower than cyanolichens. Both symbiotic partners are distinct from known lichen-forming symbionts, uncovering a phylogenetically and morphologically unprecedented thallus-forming fungus-cyanobacterium symbiosis. We propose the name “phyllosymbia” for these thalli to underscore their unique symbiotic nature and leaf-like appearance. This finding marks a previously unknown instance of fungi solely residing within structures generated by cyanobacteria.",

Understanding and controlling this phenomenon at the atomic scale, in particular in nanoscale systems, is crucial. In this study, we used scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with a nickelocene molecule to sense the spin of a hydrogen-loaded nanoscale Co island grown on Cu(111). Magnetic exchange maps obtained from the molecular tip revealed the presence of a hydrogen superstructure and a 90° rotation of the magnetization compared to the pristine island. Ab initio calculations corroborate these observations, indicating that hydrogen hybridization with Co atoms on the island surface drives the spin reorientation of the island. This reorientation is further reinforced by hydrogen penetration into the island that locates at the Co/Cu interface. However, the subsurface sensitivity of the magnetic exchange maps indicates that this effect is limited. Our study provides valuable microscopic insights into the chemical control of magnetism at the nanoscale.",

That IgA may amplify postimmune IgG production is suggested by the impaired IgG response to pneumococcal vaccines in some IgA-deficient patients. Here, we found that antipneumococcal but not total IgG production was impaired in mice with IgA deficiency. The positive effect of gut IgA on antipneumococcal IgG responses started very early in life and could implicate gut bacteria, as these responses were attenuated in germ-free mice recolonized with gut microbes from IgA-deficient donors. IgA could exert this effect by constraining the systemic translocation of gut antigens, which was associated with chronic immune activation, including T cell overexpression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). This inhibitory receptor may attenuate antipneumococcal IgG production by causing B cell hyporesponsiveness, which improved upon anti–PD-1 treatment. Thus, gut IgA functionally interacts with systemic IgG to enhance antipneumococcal vaccine responses.",

Recently demonstrated using phonon polaritons in twisted van der Waals (vdW) layers of α-MoO 3 , it offers unprecedented possibilities for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. However, practical applications have been hindered by the complex sample fabrication of twisted stacks. In this work, we introduce a previously unexplored canalization phenomenon in a single-thin vdW layer (α-MoO 3 ) interfaced with a substrate exhibiting a given negative permittivity. This enables a proof-of-concept application of polariton canalization: super-resolution nanoimaging (~λ 0 /220). Canalization-based imaging transcends conventional projection constraints, allowing the super-resolution images to be obtained at any desired location in the image plane. This versatility stems from the synergetic manipulation of three key parameters: incident frequency, rotation angle of the thin vdW layer, and thickness. Our results provide insights into the properties of canalization and constitute a seminal step toward multifaceted photonic applications, including imaging, data transmission, and ultracompact photonic integration.",

          "abstract": "Nucleosomes at promoters of active genes are marked by specific histone post-translational modifications and histone variants. These features are thought to promote the formation and maintenance of an “open” chromatin environment that is suitable for transcription. However, recent reports have drawn conflicting conclusions about whether these histone modifications depend on active transcription. To further interrogate this relationship, we inhibited transcription initiation using triptolide, which triggered degradation of RNA polymerase II, and examined the impact on histone modifications. Transcription initiation was not required for either hormone-induced or steady-state active histone modifications at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. Rather, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. P300 activity was dispensable for this effect, but inhibition of histone deacetylases masked the increased acetylation. Together, our results demonstrate that active histone modifications occur independently of transcription. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the process of transcription coordinates the removal of these modifications to limit gene activity.",

In this process, larval tissue destruction regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and adult tissue reconstruction regulated by insulin-like peptides (ILPs) occur simultaneously, but the detailed mechanism is still unclear. Here, the results of succinylome, subcellular localization, and protein interaction analysis show that non-succinylated insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) localizes in the cytoplasm, binds to insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2-like), and degrades it. When the metamorphosis is initiated, 20E up-regulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A ( Cpt1a ) through transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), thus increasing the level of IDE succinylation on K179. Succinylated IDE translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus, combined with ecdysone receptor to promote 20E signaling pathway, causing larval tissue destruction, while IGF-2-like was released to promote adult tissue proliferation. That is, succinylation alters subcellular localization of IDE so that it can bind to different target proteins and act as a hub of metamorphosis.",

A receptor-kinase signaling pathway for plant stomatal development shares components with the immunity pathway. The mechanism ensuring their signal specificities remains unclear. Using chemical genetics, here, we report the identification of a small molecule, kC9, that triggers excessive stomatal differentiation by inhibiting the canonical ERECTA pathway. kC9 binds to and inhibits the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase MPK6, perturbing its substrate interaction. Notably, activation of immune signaling by a bacterial flagellin peptide nullified kC9’s effects on stomatal development. This cross-regulation depends on the immune receptor FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2) and occurs even in the absence of kC9 if the ERECTA family receptor population becomes suboptimal. Proliferating stomatal lineage cells are vulnerable to this immune signal penetration. Our findings suggest that the signal specificity between development and immunity can be ensured by mitogen-activated protein kinase homeostasis, reflecting the availability of upstream receptors, thereby providing an unanticipated view on signal specificity.",

Particularly, BAMs and activated CD11c + microglia localized near β amyloid (Aβ) plaques exhibited a pronounced lipid-associated gene signature and a high LD load. Having observed that elevated intracellular LD content correlated inversely with microglial phagocytic activities, we subsequently inhibited LD formation specifically in CX3CR1 + brain macrophages using an inducible APP-KI/ Fit2 i Δ M φ transgenic mouse model. We demonstrated that reducing LD content in microglia and CX3CR1 + BAMs remarkably improved their phagocytic ability. Furthermore, lowering microglial LDs consistently enhanced their efferocytosis capacities and notably reduced Aβ deposition in the brain parenchyma. Therefore, mitigating LD accumulation in brain macrophages provides perspectives for AD treatment.",

Laser pulses can guide discharges but require high power and are disruptive and cumbersome to control. Here, we show that ultrasonic fields can guide plasma sparks, even around obstacles. The ultrasonic beams can be directed dynamically and within milliseconds, enabling precise, nondangerous, and fast control of high-voltage sparks.

These conditions remain hard to achieve for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems—a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here, we measure inelastic collision probabilities for Sr + + Rb and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ( f = 1) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 millikelvin. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in Sr + + Rb collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.",

However, avoiding counterproductive interventions requires knowing animal reservoirs of infection and the dynamics of transmission within them, neither of which are easily ascertained from the cross-sectional surveys that now dominate investigations into newly discovered viruses. We used biobanked sera and metagenomic data to reconstruct the transmission of recently discovered bat-associated influenza virus (BIV; H18N11) over 12 years in three zones of Peru. Mechanistic models fit under a Bayesian framework, which enabled joint inference from serological and molecular data, showed that common vampire bats maintain BIV independently of the now assumed fruit bat reservoir through immune waning and seasonal transmission pulses. A large-scale vampire bat cull targeting rabies incidentally halved BIV transmission, confirming vampire bats as maintenance hosts. Our results show how combining field studies, perturbation responses, and multi-data–type models can elucidate pathogen dynamics in nature and reveal pathogen-dependent effects of interventions.",

Among its various techniques, frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LIDAR stands out due to its capability to operate with ultralow return power, immunity to unwanted light, and simultaneous acquisition of distance and velocity. However, achieving a rapid update rate with submicrometer precision remains a challenge for FMCW LIDARs. Here, we present such a LIDAR with a sub–10-nanometer precision and a 24.6-kilohertz update rate by combining a broadband Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser with a silicon nitride soliton microcomb. An ultrahigh-frequency chirp rate up to 320 petahertz per second is linearized by a 50-gigahertz microcomb to reach this performance. Our theoretical analysis also contributes to resolving the challenge of FMCW velocity measurements with nonlinear frequency sweeps and enables us to realize velocity measurement with an uncertainty below 0.4 millimeter per second. Our work shows how microcombs can unlock the potential of ultrafast frequency sweeping lasers.",

However, a satellite’s dissipation rate, parameterized by k 2 /Q , is hard to measure and is only known for the Moon and Io. Here, we use Titan’s measured departure from its expected rotation state to infer k 2 /Q and its boundary layer dissipation parameter K/C s . Over the likely range of ocean and ice shell thicknesses, we infer a K / C s of 6.3 × 10 −14 s −1 to 2.4 × 10 −10 s −1 , a k 2 /Q of 0.058 to 0.12, and a minimum dissipation factor Q ≈ 5 . Titan’s dissipation parameters are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the Moon’s and suggest an interior with a low effective viscosity. Titan’s dissipation rate implies that its eccentricity and inclination are damping rapidly, consistent with an excitation within the last ~350 Myr. The forthcoming Dragonfly lander could measure Titan’s tidal response, and JUICE could use our approach to determine Ganymede’s k 2 /Q .",

These von Willebrand factor–bound platelets specifically recruit neutrophils in a manner that is dependent on platelet-activated α IIb β 3 , neutrophil SLC44A2, and endothelial P-selectin. The interaction of SLC44A2 with activated α IIb β 3 promotes formation of prothrombotic neutrophil extracellular traps. These data provide molecular and cellular insights into the proclivity for venous thrombosis to develop in venous valve pockets and suggest an alternative strategy to protect against the initiation of venous thrombosis.",

Here, we use the coupled high-top Community Earth System Model Version 2 with interactive chemistry to investigate how medium-sized asteroid strikes would affect climate, vegetation, and marine productivity. Our simulations, which inject up to 400 million tons of dust into the stratosphere, show marked disruptions in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and global photosynthesis. Global mean temperatures are projected to drop by 4°C, and global precipitation decreases by 15% in our simulations. The largest relative reductions in global terrestrial and marine net primary productivity reach 36 and 25%, respectively.

Analysis of cod otoliths recovered during archaeological excavations of Icelandic fish processing sites revealed that cod in the 10th to 12th centuries were 25% larger and up to 300% older than modern, despite slower density-dependent growth rates attributed to the sixfold increase in abundance. Fishing mortality came to dominate a time-invariant natural mortality rate and other population characteristics after the 14th century, with minimal evidence of environmental effects at the century scale. Despite the absence of catch records and surveys, biological reference points based on pristine fish populations are now possible where otolith collections are available.",

This physical phenomenon was regulated by a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ SUC4 ⟶ sucrose pathway in mature leaves, with a remote control of trichome production in newly developing leaves via a sucrose ⟶ ACS7 ⟶ ethylene ⟶ EIN3 ⟶ TTG1 pathway.

We reveal that the dynamic process of phenyl ring rotations at low temperature is dominated by quantum rotation tunneling rather than the quasi-free rotation process. The emergent complexity of different intramolecular rotations in a single aromatic molecule is demonstrated, including the alternating unidirectional rotation with multi-, single-, and half-circle delays driven by inelastic electron tunneling, which has not been previously adequately considered at the macroscopic level. This work builds a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic worlds and improves our understanding of structure-activity relationships, potentially bringing different functions to ordinary materials.",

NMTS is versatile for biocontainment of diverse strains, showing near complete encapsulation and negligible influence on bacterial activity. As a proof-of-concept study on probiotic transplantation to the gut microbiota, NMTS demonstrates the shielding effect to protect sealed bacteria from intraluminal insults of low pH and bile acid, the toughness to prevent bacterial leakage during entire gastrointestinal passage and reduce infection risk, and the permeability to release beneficial metabolites and reconstruct a balanced intestinal microbial structure, proposing a contactless fashion for advanced microbiota transplantation.",

This process is monitored by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which delays anaphase onset until all chromosomes are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. The kinetochore protein KNL1 plays a critical role in recruiting SAC proteins. Here, we reveal that Arabidopsis KNL1 regulates SAC silencing through the direct recruitment of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) to kinetochores. We show that KNL1 interacts with all nine TOPPs via a conserved RVSF motif in its N terminus, and this interaction is required for the proper localization of TOPPs to kinetochores during mitosis. Disrupting KNL1-TOPP interaction leads to persistent SAC activation, resulting in a severe metaphase arrest and defects in plant growth and development. Our findings highlight the evolutionary conservation of KNL1 in coordinating kinetochore-localized phosphatase to ensure timely SAC silencing and faithful chromosome segregation in Arabidopsis .",

We show that several NC and CC iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) exhibit chondrite-like MVE abundances, indicating that “first-generation” inner Solar System planetesimals were remarkably MVE rich. Consistent with isotopic signatures of MVEs in Earth and Mars, these planetesimals made a substantial contribution to the MVE inventories of terrestrial planets. Variations in MVE abundances among IMPBs, particularly the two volatile-depleted NC and CC IMPBs (IVA and IVB), reflect secondary volatile loss after disruption of their parent bodies. Consequently, MVE depletion in terrestrial planets is more closely linked to the protracted history of MVE loss during planetesimal collisions rather than incomplete condensation or MVE loss during planetesimal differentiation.",

Field experiments, conducted 20 years apart, revealed that temporal shifts in shell thickness were driven by the evolution of increased trait means and erosion of thickness plasticity. The virtual elimination of the trade-off in tissue mass that often accompanies thicker shells is consistent with the evolution of fixed defenses under increasingly certain predation risk.",
