          "abstract": "The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet 1–3 . Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall. These trends and inequalities reaffirm the case for overcoming the dependence of nations on perpetual GDP growth 4,5 and reorienting towards regenerative and distributive economic activity—within and between nations—that assigns priority to human needs and planetary integrity.",

          "abstract": "Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood 1,2 , many autistic people are diagnosed later in life 3–5 . It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated ( r g = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism.",

          "abstract": "The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas1. Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses2, here we investigated how efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4+ T cells ex vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4+ T cells in vivo within the islets. Analysing macrophage–T cell interactions within pancreatic islets using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1–IGF1R axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets. Collectively, these data advance a concept that efferocytosis-associated reprogramming of the islet macrophages and the subsequent influence on the adaptive immune response could be beneficial in modulating diabetic autoimmunity.",

          "abstract": "Chronic infections and cancer cause T cell dysfunction known as exhaustion. This cell state is caused by persistent antigen exposure, suboptimal co-stimulation and a plethora of hostile factors that dampen protective immunity and limit the efficacy of immunotherapies1,2,3,4. The mechanisms that underlie T cell exhaustion remain poorly understood. Here we analyse the proteome of CD8+ exhausted T (Tex) cells across multiple states of exhaustion in the context of both chronic viral infections and cancer. We show that there is a non-stochastic pathway-specific discordance between mRNA and protein dynamics between T effector (Teff) and Tex cells. We identify a distinct proteotoxic stress response (PSR) in Tex cells, which we term Tex-PSR. Contrary to canonical stress responses that induce a reduction in protein synthesis5,6, Tex-PSR involves an increase in global translation activity and an upregulation of specialized chaperone proteins. Tex-PSR is further characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and stress granules and an increase in autophagy-dominant protein catabolism. We establish that disruption of proteostasis alone can convert Teff cells to Tex cells, and we link Tex-PSR mechanistically to persistent AKT signalling. Finally, disruption of Tex-PSR-associated chaperones in CD8+ T cells improves cancer immunotherapy in preclinical models. Moreover, a high Tex-PSR in T cells from patients with cancer confers poor responses to clinical immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings indicate that Tex-PSR is a hallmark and a mechanistic driver of T cell exhaustion, which raises the possibility of targeting proteostasis pathways as an approach for cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral systems 1 . In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response 2–4 . Here, in an unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful defence strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of the role of oligonucleotides in immunity.",

Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity.",

At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing.",

          "abstract": "Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)1. To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing2 with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data3 indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector proteins to mediate immunity 1 . Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE , wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2′,3′-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ‘sponge’ that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.",

          "abstract": "The ‘silent pandemic’ caused by antimicrobial resistance requires innovative therapeutic approaches. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative and safe drugs in oncology1 and autoimmunity2, are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance3. Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K. pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with antimicrobial resistance.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ+ T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ+ T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ+ T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.",

The large energy gain from oxygen redox reactions is often connected with the occurrence of harmful reactive oxygen species 3,5,6 . Key species are superoxide and the highly reactive singlet oxygen 3–7 , which may evolve from superoxide. However, the factors determining the formation of singlet oxygen, rather than the relatively unreactive triplet oxygen, are unknown. Here we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behaviour. We found that as the driving force for the reaction increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behaviour also applies to the widely observed superoxide disproportionation, in which one superoxide is oxidized by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, with Lewis and Brønsted acidity controlling the driving forces. Singlet oxygen yields governed by these conditions are relevant, for example, in batteries or cellular organelles in which superoxide forms. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry, with implications for fields, including life sciences, pure chemistry and energy storage.",

These squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. Here we report the experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly interacting ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (−0.50 ± 0.13 dB) below the noise of uncorrelated spins is generated by the native magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between nitrogen–vacancy centres. To generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome several challenges. First, we develop an approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.",

Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae , a member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.",

More than 20 years ago, DNA was first used as fuel to drive nanomechanical devices1,2 and catalytic reactions3. However, each system requires distinct fuel sequences, preventing DNA alone from becoming a universal energy source. Despite extensive efforts4, we still lack an ATP-like or electricity-like power supply to sustain diverse molecular machines. Here we show that heat can restore enzyme-free DNA circuits from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium states. During heating and cooling, nucleic acids with strong secondary structures reach kinetically trapped states5,6, providing energy for subsequent computation. We demonstrate that complex logic circuits and neural networks, involving more than 200 distinct molecular species, can respond to a temperature ramp and recharge within minutes, allowing at least 16 rounds of computation with varying sequential inputs. Our strategy enables diverse systems to be powered by the same energy source without problematic waste build-up, thereby ensuring consistent performance over time.

We uncover a pervasive cis -regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein. ZNF729 binds to GC-rich sequences, abundant at gene promoters associated with basic cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and metabolism. Despite mediating recruitment of TRIM28, at many of these promoters ZNF729 acts as a transcriptional activator.

Here we present Breugnathair elgolensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a new skeleton from the Middle Jurassic epoch (167 million years ago) of Scotland, which is among the oldest relatively complete fossil squamates.

It displays a mosaic of anatomical traits that is not present in living groups, with head and body proportions similar to varanids (monitor lizards) and snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, alongside primitive traits shared with early-diverging groups such as gekkotans. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets return conflicting results, with parviraptorids either as early toxicoferans (and potentially stem snakes) or as stem squamates that convergently evolved snake-like dental and mandibular traits related to feeding.

Credit: Kateryna Kon/SPL\n\nResearchers have found a new way to power DNA computers — tiny biological devices that perform calculations using biochemical properties of DNA bases rather than conventional silicon chips, which use electricity to carry out computation.\n\nThese molecular machines could one day be used to store data, solve difficult mathematical problems and analyse biological data. But researchers have struggled to find an energy source for them that is as reliable as the ATP used in living cells or the electricity that powers everyday devices.\n\nNow, a study published in Nature on 1 October1 has demonstrated that heat could be an option. The authors created DNA circuits that they could charge and recharge by cycling the temperature of the system.\n\nThe work “suggests a future where artificial molecular machines can recharge themselves and remain active over long periods of time”, says study co-author Lulu Qian, a bioengineer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “It’s like self-driving cars pulling into charging stations on their own: molecules could one day recharge themselves at heat stations.”\n\nHeat-powered DNA computing\n\nDNA computers were first described in 1994 and have been suggested as a sustainable replacement for standard electronic storage options. In the quest to find new power sources for DNA computers, researchers have explored using molecules such as the cellular energy-carrying molecule ATP, as well as methods of thermal cycling2. However, the efficiency of the systems is sensitive to molecular changes, so Qian and her colleagues set out to develop a different method that uses heat as an energy source. The authors say that their idea was inspired by proposals that early evolution could have been driven by naturally occurring temperature cycles, in which hot volcanic rocks supply energy to allow chemical reactions to take place in cold seawater.\n\n“Heat is everywhere, and it’s easy to access, and with the right designs, it can recharge molecular machines again and again, letting them sustain activity and keep interacting with their environment,” says Qian.\n\nThe researchers aimed to do this by developing a molecular circuit that gets stuck in a state of thermal non-equilibrium. In such a state, the DNA molecules act as energy stores, absorbing energy created as the circuit tries to push back towards equilibrium.\n\nThe researchers did this by creating unstable links between DNA molecules. By varying the temperature of the reaction, the authors could change the energy storage inside these systems. At high temperatures, the molecules became single-stranded, but when the system cools, the circuit resets to its original state. Heating and cooling the system could switch molecular systems between equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium states in minutes, like recharging a battery.\n\n“Unlike chemical batteries, this recharge leaves behind virtually no waste[d energy],” says Qian.\n\nThe authors tested the ability of their method to power a set of computations in a DNA computer involving more than 200 different molecules, and found that it was sufficient to carry out at least 16 rounds of computation.",

          "abstract": "The tango’s complexity might make it particularly good for keeping the brain young.Credit: Tempura/Getty\n\nWhether it’s dancing the tango or playing the guitar, engaging in a creative pastime can slow brain ageing, according to a study of dancers, musicians, artists and video game players from multiple countries.\n\nThe analysis used brain clocks — models that measure the difference between a person’s chronological age and the age their brain appears to be — to assess whether creative activities help to maintain neurological youth. In brain regions that are most susceptible to ageing, engaging in creative activities increased connections with different areas of the brain. Although experts had ‘younger’ brains than their less-experienced counterparts did, even learning a creative skill from scratch had an anti-ageing effect on the brain.\n\nThe findings were published on 3 October in Nature Communications1.\n\nSong and dance\n\nPrevious studies suggest that engaging in creative activities can help to keep the brain young and foster emotional well-being. But few have investigated the biological basis of these brain benefits or what drives them, says study co-author Agustín Ibáñez, a neuroscientist at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Santiago, Chile. “There is really poor mechanistic evidence,” he says.\n\nHow fast are you ageing? Ordinary brain scans reveal the pace\nTo address this gap, Ibáñez and his colleagues created brain clocks using neuroimaging data of brain activity taken from 1,240 participants across 10 countries. These machine-learning models used functional connectivity, a measure of how brain regions work together, to estimate brain age. The researchers then applied their brain clocks to 232 tango dancers, musicians, visual artists and video game players of different ages and experience levels to calculate their ‘brain age gap’ — the difference between their predicted brain age and their actual age.\n\nOverall, all four creative pursuits seemed to delay brain ageing. The more skilled and experienced participants were at their chosen activity, the slower their brain aged. This anti-ageing effect was strongest in expert tango dancers, whose brains were, on average, seven years younger than their chronological age. Tango’s cognitively demanding mix of complex movement sequences, coordination and planning makes it a particularly good activity for keeping the brain young, says Ibáñez.\n\nNext, the researchers built a brain map to assess whether creativity has a protective effect on areas that are particularly vulnerable to ageing. They found that creativity had the greatest impact on the frontoparietal region, which controls various functions, including working memory and decision-making. This region is one of the most susceptible areas to age-related decline. In experienced participants, brain connections were notably strong in areas involved in movement control, coordination and rhythm, among others.",

          "title": "How to get the best night’s sleep: what the science says",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "From TikTok videos touting mouth tape and weighted blankets, to magazines ranking insomnia-curbing pillows, sleep advice is everywhere. And it’s no wonder. People all over the world complain of insomnia and not getting enough sleep, driving a market for sleep aids worth more than US$100 billion annually.\n\nBut scientists warn that online hacks and pricey tools aren’t always effective. And failed attempts to remedy the situation could have negative effects, says Andrew McHill, a circadian scientist at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “It could discourage people from finding help, and things could get worse,” he says.\n\nHow the brain wakes up from sleep — and produces that morning feeling\n\nInstead, researchers point to the lessons coming from circadian science, which over the past five decades has exposed a network of biological clocks throughout the body. This timekeeping machinery ensures that physiological systems are primed to do the right things at the right times — such as defend against pathogens, digest food and sleep. But circadian clocks don’t cycle precisely on their own. To stay in sync and function optimally, they need regular calibration from sunlight, daily routines and other cues.\n\nModern life doesn’t often cooperate. People spend much of their time indoors. They eat late into the night. They shift sleep schedules between workdays and weekends, effectively jet-lagging themselves. The toll is steep. In the short term, circadian disruption and insufficient sleep can reduce cognition, mood and reaction time. In the long term, they can increase risks of infections, diabetes, depression, dementia, cancer, heart disease and premature death.\n\nFor better sleep and overall health, McHill and other scientists emphasize three basics: contrasting light and dark, consolidating mealtimes and keeping sleep times consistent. “Simply taking a walk outside during the day and reducing our light exposure in the evening could have great effect,” says McHill.\n\nSeek contrasts\n\nLight provides the most powerful signal to the circadian system. Blue wavelengths are especially potent. That is not a coincidence. Humans evolved outdoors, under the sky. And the midday sky is rich in blue light. Still, common advice about avoiding blue light at night captures only part of the story.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, a string of discoveries proved the existence of light-sensitive cells in the eye that are not directly involved in seeing1. Rather, these cells synchronize body clocks. They detect both intensity and wavelength, with input from rods and cones, and relay those data to a circadian pacemaker in the brain.\n\nThe circadian system requires bright light to operate properly. “But we’re pretty bad at determining how much light we’re getting,” says Jamie Zeitzer, a sleep and circadian scientist at Stanford University in California. Typical home lighting of 100–250 lux might feel like a lot to the eye. But the blue-rich daylight that the circadian system is primed to detect shines orders of magnitude brighter — upwards of 10,000 lux even on an overcast day.\n\nTiming matters, too. Bright blue light during the daytime synchronizes circadian rhythms and supports the nightly surge of melatonin — the hormone signal that tells the body it’s time to sleep. It can also directly boost alertness and cognitive performance. The same illumination at night, from artificial lights and glowing screens, confuses the circadian system.\n\nUnlocking the secrets of sleep\n\nBlue light is the strongest disruptor, but enough photons of any colour at night can shift rhythms, suppress melatonin levels and hinder sleep. Exposure in the middle of the night, such as with a flip of a toilet light switch, is most disruptive, says Zeitzer. The circadian system’s sensitivity peaks near the midpoint of sleep, when it least expects light. Studies show that even dim light, such as a hallway bulb, can raise overnight heart rate and impair sleep2.\n\nUltimately, scientists say, what matters most is contrast: bright days and dark nights. In fact, light during the day can buffer against the potential harms of light at night, says Mariana Figueiro, director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Mounting research links greater daytime light exposure with stronger circadian rhythms and higher sleep quality. One study of college students found that their total hours of light exposure during the day better predicted their bedtimes and wake times than did light exposure after dusk3. “The more light you get during the day, the better you’ll sleep at night,” says Figueiro.\n\nToo little daylight and too much night light could even shorten life expectancy. A UK study of nearly 90,000 people found that the 20% with the poorest light-exposure patterns were predicted to die around five years earlier than were the 20% with the healthiest habits, even after accounting for factors such as income and physical activity4.\n\nAndrew Phillips, a sleep health scientist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and an author of the study, pins the explanation on circadian rhythms: “They regulate every aspect of your physiology.”\n\nUnfortunately, achieving this daily contrast is difficult in the modern world. Indoor lighting leans on green wavelengths that serve vision but not circadian signalling. Energy-usage codes limit how bright those fixtures shine. Daylight entering through windows gets quickly diluted. And energy-efficient window glass and blue-light-blocking spectacle-lens coatings further reduce how many circadian-stimulating photons reach the eyes. Ageing compounds the problem; people’s lenses become more yellow over time and filter out more blue light.\n\nCircadian science’s prescription: spend more time outdoors, sit near windows and use daylight-mimicking light-emitting-diode lamps during the day. In the evening, lower the brightness of lamps and power down screens — or use apps that dim or shift screens to a warmer spectrum. And consider a low-intensity amber night light for the toilet.\n\nScientists note that the precise prescription is personal. Even people of the same age can vary considerably in how they respond to the same light, possibly because of characteristics such as sex or eye colour. And when light comes from screens, the content can matter as much as the light itself. “If you’re on an iPad at 11 at night, then the light exposure might have some effect,” says Zeitzer. “But if you are doing something relaxing, that might outweigh the effect.”\n\nConsolidate calories\n\nCalorie intake is also intricately linked with circadian rhythms and sleep. The human liver at 10 a.m. and the human liver at 10 p.m. are very different organs. The same can be said for other parts of the body that process food. Hunger hormones, digestive enzymes and glucose-regulating insulin have rhythms, too.\n\nHumans are simply not equipped to deal with food at all hours, says Emily Manoogian, a circadian scientist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Late morning to early afternoon is when the body is usually most prepared for incoming calories. Eating late in the evening disrupts clocks and leaves key steps of digestion incomplete. It can also disrupt the gut microbiome, which could contribute to insomnia5. What’s more, late meals send blood to the gut and raise core body temperature, countering the natural night-time dip that promotes sleep. And they elevate glucose levels and uncouple liver and kidney clocks from the core clock in the brain, raising the chance of midnight toilet trips.\n\nManoogian and others suggest reviving the old adage: eat like a king in the morning, a prince at noon and a peasant at dinner. That last meal, they say, should fall at least three hours before bedtime, ideally with no subsequent snacks or caloric drinks.\n\nRevealed: how the brain turns stress into a bad night’s sleep\n\nFood quality matters, too. Diets high in sugar and saturated fat lighten and fragment sleep. Caffeine lingers for hours. And alcohol is deceptively disruptive: “You might fall asleep, but the quality of your sleep will be quite poor,” says Manoogian. On the flip side, eating some plant-based foods during the day could improve sleep. Research shows that walnuts boost melatonin levels and sleep quality6.

          "abstract": "Nature’s 2025 PhD survey\n\nThis article is the first in a series discussing the results of Nature’s 2025 PhD survey. The next will look at what doctoral candidates wish they’d known when they set out on their degrees. The survey, created in partnership with Thinks Insight & Strategy, a research consultancy based in London, launched in May and was advertised on nature.com, in Springer Nature digital products and through e-mail campaigns. It had 3,785 self-selecting respondents across 107 countries, with 44% describing themselves as female, 25% as belonging to an ethnic minority in their country of study and 33% as studying outside their country of origin. The full survey data sets are available at go.nature.com/4ncsuo1.\n\nIn May and June, Nature surveyed 3,785 PhD candidates from around the globe, exploring everything from supervision practices to workplace concerns. The results, published today, offer a window into how today’s doctoral researchers are adapting to the rapidly changing circumstances in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It’s a mixed bag: candidates report feeling happier overall, but serious problems persist.\n\nCollection: Career resources for PhD students\n\nThe good news? PhD satisfaction levels have bounced back from their pandemic lows (Nature’s most-recent global PhD careers survey took place in 2022). The sobering reality? Nearly half of respondents worldwide say that they still face discrimination or harassment, and many report seeing their supervisors for less than an hour each week. Beyond these challenges, doctoral candidates consistently cite poor compensation and inadequate career guidance as major sources of dissatisfaction.\n\nAs new technologies transform how doctoral students work, one thing hasn’t changed: academia continues to hold the crown as their preferred career destination.\n\nHere’s what the data reveal about the state of the doctorate in 2025.\n\nPost-COVID recovery\n\nSome 75% of the PhD candidates surveyed feel satisfied with their doctoral studies. This is a bounce back from 62% in 2022, and a rebound to pre-COVID levels: satisfaction levels were 71% in Nature’s 2019 survey and 78% in 2017.\n\nThe dip in satisfaction during the pandemic makes sense to Pil Maria Saugmann, outgoing president of Eurodoc, an organization based in Brussels that represents early-career researchers in Europe. “I had a year when all my supervision was online, all interactions with my group were online,” says the Danish researcher, who finished her theoretical-physics PhD at Stockholm University in 2022. “I’m not surprised that the numbers have gone up, because it reflects that we are in a more normal state where there is a collegial environment.”\n\nSome 78% of doctoral candidates in the survey feel most satisfied with the independence and flexibility that their PhD gives them (see ‘How PhD students rate their experiences’). “No other job has the independence, constant challenges, flexibility and stimulating environment that a PhD offers,” says Miguel González Martín, a mechanobiology PhD candidate at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. He says that his PhD allows him to keep learning new things at a high pace, and he feels privileged that his job gives him the opportunity to help solve global problems.\n\nRoughly 73% of respondents are satisfied with their relationship with their supervisor and 66% report satisfaction with the guidance they receive about their research. “My supervisor gives me the freedom to explore my research ideas while providing constructive feedback whenever I need it. This balance helps me grow as an independent researcher,” says a fourth-year PhD student in Iran who took the survey.\n\nFewer respondents are satisfied with their compensation and benefits: only 47%. Women are more dissatisfied with their PhDs than men are — 19% feel moderately, very or extremely dissatisfied, compared with 15% of men. Those who identify as members of ethnic minority groups show a similar trend (20%, compared with 17%). Saugmann says that there are certain survey findings that point to other areas of dissatisfaction, too, such as high levels of harassment and discrimination, which are higher than in some other employment sectors, she says.\n\nHow many PhDs does the world need? Doctoral graduates vastly outnumber jobs in academia\n\nSpending long hours on a PhD — 60 or more a week — also significantly correlates with lower satisfaction. This probably contributes to only 60% of PhD students in China reporting being satisfied, says Yanbo Wang, a science-policy researcher at the University of Hong Kong. PhD researchers there often work seven days a week, he says. And because many enrol for PhDs not because they want to do research, but to gain an advantage in China’s cut-throat labour market, they might lack the passion to makes all that hard work feel worthwhile. Wang says. “That mismatch is a huge part of the problem.”\n\nAbout 55% of respondents say that their PhD experience matches what they expected, whereas 34% feel their expectations aren’t being met. That dissatisfaction rises to 39% in India, where Shubha Tole, dean of graduate studies at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, says that a boom in the number of undergraduate students has increased competition for summer research placements and internships. As a result, most incoming graduate students lack such experiences and know little about how to conduct research and the research culture, she says.\n\nMo money, mo politics\n\nWhen asked about broad concerns, the two most common were financial pressures (42% chose this option) and the need to get published (41%; see ‘Major concerns of PhD candidates’). “I wish we got paid a living wage. It’s hard to focus on research when I’m worried about my next meal,” said a female second-year PhD candidate in the United States.\n\nMental health is a concern for 31% of the global sample, and 25% worry about balancing their studies with family and caring responsibilities.\n\nAsked about specific concerns, rising living costs worry 86% of the respondents, up from 85% in 2022, and 55% agree that increases in inflation will negatively affect their decisions to continue their studies. These financial concerns are “alarming”, says Mohammed Shaaban, a recent PhD graduate from the Francis Crick Institute and Imperial College London. “If this continues, we will see more students either quitting their programmes early or opting out of academic careers.”\n\nThese nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties\n\nThe political landscape is a key concern for just 21% of respondents. However, this jumps to 64% in respondents in the United States — their biggest concern by far. Teddy Warner, president of the graduate-student council at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, traces this to upheavals in the US science system under US President Donald Trump’s administration since January. “I’ve seen how things were before and after Trump’s inauguration, and mostly this year’s been much more chaotic and uncertain,” Warner says.\n\nFunding cuts have been a major source of anxiety for US graduate students, especially those early in their programmes, who worry that they might not be able to start. Crackdowns on immigration have also taken a toll, Warner says, and “there is an overall atmosphere of fear”, with some international students avoiding international travel, afraid that they might be stopped at the border.\n\nThe political turmoil in the United States spills beyond PhD candidates there, says Wang. “Given what’s going on, more and more Chinese researchers are coming back to China,” cranking up competition for post-PhD positions at home, he says.\n\nAI’s (wary) adopters\n\nThis year’s survey is the first to ask PhD candidates about their views on and use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Some 53% say that they use AI tools at least weekly, in service of their PhD studies, whereas merely 16% have never used them (see ‘AI use by PhD students differs’). Roughly 75% they think that AI can help them work more efficiently and 71% think that it is acceptable for them to use AI as part of their PhDs.\n\nMost PhD candidates feel comfortable with using AI for tasks such as preparing job applications or summarizing or tracking the scientific literature. They feel less comfortable using AI for near-research tasks such as collecting and analysing data, designing experiments, writing articles and peer reviewing. Some 81% ‘don’t fully trust’ AI. Meanwhile, 82% are concerned about the quality and integrity of AI outputs, and 65% worry that AI weakens their critical thinking and research and writing skills; 64% are concerned about the reproducibility of AI outputs.\n\nThe total sample is split on whether AI will replace core skills (43% agree and 40% disagree) and roles (42% agree and 39% disagree). Survey-takers warn about the dangers of AI dependency. “You become too overly reliant on AI tools and it ends up affecting critical thinking and self-confidence,” writes a male PhD candidate studying in India. A fourth-year female student, also in India, writes that she feels ChatGPT “spoiled the thinking power of my brain”.\n\nSome 64% say they want more guidance from their institutions about how best to use AI in their work. Shaaban, who was encouraged to use AI responsibly during his PhD in London, agrees: “This is a revolution. We need to put a lot of effort into training people how to use it responsibly, not just leave it up to trial and error.”\n\nHarassment and prejudice abound\n\nA notable 43% of respondents say that they have experienced discrimination or harassment as part of their studies, with the most common types being bullying and sexism (see ‘Problematic behaviours plague many PhD students’). This is an increase from the 20% in Nature’s 2022 PhD survey, although there, a separate question dealt with bullying, which 18% said they had experienced. This year’s survey gave respondents more-specific types of discrimination and harassment to choose from, including those based on religion, sexual orientation and disability, which makes comparisons with previous surveys difficult. In any case, with more than two in five PhD candidates in 2025 reporting experiencing discrimination and harassment, problematic workplace cultures persist, with direct effects on well-being.\n\n“If you ask whether there is a mental-health crisis in doctoral training, the answer is yes,” says Saugmann. She says that Nature’s findings echo those of other surveys looking at mental health in European universities.\n\nThese harassment experiences shoot up to 47% in international students and 55% among those who identify as belonging to ethnic minorities. “It’s deeply concerning that half of the international students experience discrimination,” says Shaaban, who experienced discrimination related to his Egyptian nationality, both in the United States, where he studied from 2018 to 2020, and during his PhD in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, this came mainly from broader society and not his workplace, he says. Nevertheless, he says, “it makes you feel unappreciated, like you don’t belong”.",

The ‘Central Nourishment Furnace’ (stove) emits comforting smells of nutrient orbs (potatoes). The dwelling is orderly. The ‘Domestic Harmony Aura’ is at its peak. Surely, nothing bad will happen.\n\nTULAR (The Reliable Earth Husband-Type Figure) is stirring a food substance while RIEEN (The Devoted Earth Spouse Companion) sets out Eating Instruments (as humans insist on using, for reasons unknown). Their movements are synchronized, rhythmic and harmonious, as per Earth Custom.\n\nAcross from them, VEYL (The Charming Yet Suspicious Guest Friend) lounges idly, fulfilling his role as ‘The Witty Freeloader’, as all Earth homes are required to contain.\n\nVEYL (with exaggerated Earth-style overconfidence): “You two are spoiling me again! This meal smells amazing. I hardly do anything around here, and yet I get treated like an Earth Monarch!”\n\n(Zeckan scholars have noted that all human conversations must contain at least one instance of the phrase “This smells amazing”.)\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nTULAR (laughs in the hearty, abrupt way all Earth Males do): “Hardly do anything?! You provide entertainment! That counts for something.”\n\n(Note: As per the sacred teachings of I Love Lucy, all Earth domestic units contain one designated humorous character whose job is to create mild chaos and serve no practical function.)\n\nVEYL (laughing too long, as is Earth custom): “Ah-ha-ha-ha! Oh, I must accept my role with grace! I am the reason you two are not boring and stale, like the Classic American Marrieds of old!”\n\n(Zeckan research indicates that ‘boring’ is the ultimate insult among humans, second only to ‘unfashionable’.)\n\nRIEEN (softly, dramatically): “And I wouldn’t have you any other way.”\n\n[BRIEF PAUSE FOR EARTH AUDIENCE TO SWOON]\n\n(Zeckan research indicates that human ‘eating’ is not merely a biological function but a sacred ritual of dominance and submission. The individual who prepares the food exerts temporary control over the others, a power dynamic often disrupted by ‘witty freeloader’ figures such as VEYL. This ongoing battle for social equilibrium seems to be the foundation of all Earthly relationships.)\n\nEverything is perfect. The home aura swells with warmth. Surely, nothing can go wrong.\n\nBUT THEN —\n\nA SMALL CLICK. A FLICKER. A HUM OF FAILING MECHANICS.\n\n(Research suggests that all Earth tragedies begin with a small but ominous sound.

His limbs bend at unnatural angles.\n\n[DRAMATIC ZOOM-IN, BLACK-AND-WHITE FOR EMPHASIS]\n\nRIEEN (as human spouses do in all betrayal scenes): “NOOOOOOOOOOO!”\n\nShe drops a bowl of nutrient orbs.\n\nIt shatters in slow motion.\n\n(Zeckan scholars remain perplexed by the human insistence that moments of heightened emotional significance must unfold at a reduced temporal rate. Attempts to replicate this phenomenon in real-time studies have resulted in multiple injuries and one unfortunate combustion incident.)\n\nTULAR (defensive Earth Husband Instincts activated): “What in the cursed void are you?!”\n\n(It remains unclear why humans ask rhetorical questions they do not wish to hear the answers to. Zeckan scientists have tested multiple responses to such inquiries — including detailed explanations, humorous quips and immediate self-destruction — and have determined that all answers are considered unsatisfactory.)\n\nVEYL, despite his grotesque, pulsating form, remains surprisingly casual — as all Earth Betrayers must. He lets out a long sigh, placing his mismatched horror-limbs on his strange, alien hips.)\n\nVEYL (exasperated, yet somehow still likeable): “Well, shit.”\n\n[CANNED LAUGHTER — BECAUSE HUMAN AUDIENCES REQUIRE IT]\n\nTHE ARGUMENT UNFOLDS: Extended drama\n\n(Zeckan scholars have determined that Earth arguments must escalate in a structured format: Shock → Denial → Betrayal → Emotional Outburst → Sudden Violence.)\n\nTULAR surges forward, shielding RIEEN. His Earth Warrior Instincts engage.\n\nTULAR (furious): “Stay back, you monstrosity! You have deceived us!”\n\nVEYL (smoothing his pulsating skin): “Minor technical malfunction. Give me a second —”\n\nHe fumbles with his wrist device. Instantly, his perfect human form snaps back into place.\n\nVEYL (charming again): “See? No problem. Still me.”\n\nRIEEN (trembling): “You are not our Veyl.”\n\nVEYL: “Oh, Rieen, darling, let’s not be dramatic. Nothing has changed.”\n\nTULAR advances menacingly. He is about to deliver a monologue.\n\nTULAR (booming): “You stole our lives! You robbed Rieen of her last season to breed! You took everything!”\n\nVEYL (momentarily annoyed, then recovers): “You’re being overly emotional. I gave you love, joy —”\n\nRIEEN: “You gave us lies.”\n\nThe intensity heightens. The argument spirals into pure Earthly chaos. Gestures become exaggerated. Plates are thrown.",

          "authors": "Anna McKie",
          "abstract": "Epidemiologist Lauren McCullough is leading the VOICES of Black Women study.Credit: Courtesy of Lauren McCullough\nBroadening the long view\n\nLongitudinal studies — which follow individuals to collect data about health, lifestyle and environment over a period of months, years or even decades — have helped researchers understand disease risk, inform prevention strategies and improve public health planning. But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nWhen epidemiologist Lauren McCullough began working in cancer research in the United States, she was struck by a glaring omission in population-level studies. “When thinking about large-scale cancer studies, one of the groups that have been left behind have been Black women,” she says. “That’s despite the fact that Black women are more likely to get an aggressive disease and, with very few exceptions, are more likely to die of their cancer.”\n\nNow, McCullough, visiting scientific director at the American Cancer Society (ACS), is leading a research effort to help change that. The VOICES of Black Women study aims to enrol 100,000 Black women aged 25–55 with no prior history of cancer. The longitudinal study, which launched in 2024, will follow participants for at least 30 years, capturing a range of data on health, lifestyle and lived experience to reach a depth and scale not seen before for this population, say those involved.\n\nFor McCullough and Alpa Patel, co-investigator on the study and senior vice-president of population science at the ACS, researchers on the team had to be more than just experts. They wanted people who “really had the passion for the topic and were committed to ensuring the study was going to be designed and executed in a way that we all felt really proud of”, McCullough says.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nThe VOICES team hope the data will begin to clarify what is behind disparities in cancer risk for Black women in the United States. They are around 40% more likely to die from breast cancer than white women, for example, despite having lower incidence rates. According to the ACS, Black women have a 12% higher overall cancer death rate than white women.\n\nInitially spanning the 20 US states with the largest populations of Black women, the study now recruits nationwide, working in partnership with a network of hospitals, community organizations and health centres.\n\nThe VOICES team wants to look beyond the biological data typical of a standard longitudinal study — such as genetics, diet or medical history — to capture some of the potential social drivers of health. “Something that was really missing when I emerged from my training was understanding how the social aspects impact cancer,” McCullough says. “How do social elements above the skin impact the biology below the skin?” To that end, the study asks participants about factors such as their experiences of racism, access to quality health care and what social support they receive.\n\nThis information is collected through a 60-minute baseline survey and shorter follow-ups, in which participants are asked about day-to-day discrimination and economic stressors. “A lot of the existing data are at the area level, like residential racial segregation, but that doesn’t really capture the specific insults an individual might experience,” McCullough says. By capturing individual experiences, the team hopes to uncover how these cumulative exposures interact with biological processes to influence cancer risk.\n\nThis is important, McCullough says, because “the data among Black women doesn’t match our ideas about how socioeconomics should lead to better health outcomes. In fact, some of the greatest health disparities are among Black women with higher levels of socioeconomic status.” Recent studies have shown that racism-related stress contributes to persistent health gaps between Black and white women by disrupting cortisol patterns, as demonstrated in a 2024 study1 published in Scientific Reports, and by activating cellular stress-response pathways linked to aggressive breast cancer, according to research from the Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, North Carolina2. The VOICES study also includes biological sampling. Participants can voluntarily provide blood samples and undergo height, weight, waist and blood-pressure measurements. These will help researchers investigate the role of ancestry, hormones, inflammation, infections and genetic mutations in cancer development.\n\n“In five years or so, I think we will better understand the various exposures that might differentially impact Black women,” says McCullough. For example, it could lead to better regulation of products frequently used by Black women, such as chemical hair relaxers, which were linked to an increased risk of uterine cancer by a 2023 study3.\n\nKey facts: VOICES of Black Women\n\nStudy name: VOICES of Black Women.\n\nLead institution: American Cancer Society (ACS).\n\nPrincipal investigators: Lauren McCullough, visiting scientific director at the ACS, and Alpa Patel, senior vice-president of population science at the ACS.\n\nParticipant goal: 100,000 Black women aged 25–55, cancer-free at enrolment.\n\nCurrent participant numbers: 4,850\n\nData collected: Online surveys (60 minutes at baseline, two 30-minute follow-ups per year) covering health behaviours, discrimination, social support, economic stress and personal care product use; optional blood samples; anthropometric and biometric data (such as height, weight, blood pressure).\n\nLaunch year: Pilot 2023, official launch 2024.\n\nDuration: At least 30 years.\n\nFunding: Solely funded by the American Cancer Society.\n\nEnrolled participants, who so far number almost 4,000, will receive regular follow-ups — two 30-minute surveys per year — with the hope this will build trust.

          "abstract": "The US National Institutes of Health fell as much as US$5 billion behind in its awarding of grants this past year, but has managed to catch up.Credit: Francis Chung/POLITICO/AP/Alamy\n\nStaff members at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) seem to have done the impossible. Despite US President Donald Trump’s administration laying off thousands of the agency’s workers, delaying meetings to review research grants and terminating funding for some projects, the NIH seems like it will dole out its entire US$48-billion budget on deadline — by the end of the fiscal year on 30 September.\n\nAt some points in the past year, the agency — the world’s largest funder of biomedical research — was nearly $5 billion behind in its awarding of grants. Researchers feared that the NIH would have to return any money it didn’t spend to the US Treasury rather than investing it in science. But staff banded together to put things on track in the past few months (see ‘Playing catch-up’).\n\n“Everyone has been rallying together to clean up the mess, but it’s a mess that did not need to be made,” says an NIH programme officer who spoke to Nature on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal.\n\nSource: NIH Reporter; adapted from: Jeremy Berg\n\nAlthough the agency’s budget will be spent, many fewer new projects will be funded. That’s because the White House budget office directed the NIH to award some research projects large sums upfront — rather than spreading it out over years — meaning that fewer institutions and researchers will receive agency funding. Success rates for grant applications at the NIH have therefore hit all-time lows.\n\n“That is extremely demoralizing,” says Michael Lauer, who for about ten years ran the NIH’s ‘extramural’ arm, which funds researchers at institutions across the United States. “We want people to be excited about being in science. And if the likelihood of success is so low, you might have to close your lab. This will do even more to chase people away from doing science in the US.”\n\nThe NIH did not respond to Nature’s queries about the funding situation or scientists’ concerns about low success rates.\n\nAn ‘unbelievable’ year\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has directed the NIH to suspend sessions to review grant applications, lay off about 6% of its 20,000-person workforce, terminate projects on a slew of topics such as COVID-19 that do not align with the president’s priorities and freeze and unfreeze its funding programmes several times. Furthermore, representatives of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency demanded that they review grants approved by NIH employees before any payments were made, Nature reported.\n\nExclusive: NIH to dismiss dozens of grant reviewers to align with Trump priorities\n\n“This year was really unbelievable,” says an NIH grants-management specialist, who has been at the agency for a decade and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “I have never experienced anything like this.”\n\nThe administration’s spending slow-down at the NIH earned a reprimand in early August from a watchdog agency in the US government. The watchdog found that the NIH had been illegally withholding, or impounding, funds that the US Congress allocated to it.\n\nTo pick up the grant-processing pace, some employees have cancelled holiday plans, worked overtime and filled in for staff missing across the NIH, the programme officer says. “Our work is already end-loaded towards the end of the fiscal year,” she says. But this year, “it’s like a pressure cooker that exploded”. But, she adds, “there was a willingness to work extra hard to move the science forward”.\n\nCollateral damage",

For example, origami, the Japanese art of folding paper, has enabled deployable structures, including shelters and aerospace applications1. In the same spirit, writing in Nature, Lamoureux et al.2 report parachutes inspired by kirigami — a Japanese art form in which a sheet of paper is cut to create complex patterns and 3D designs. By cutting patterned slits in a flat disc, the authors designed parachutes that open during flight, generating drag and slowing their descent.

          "abstract": "Susan Monarez was fired from her role as director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after refusing to strip staff members of their jobs.Credit: Alyssa Schukar for Nature\n\nWhen Susan Monarez took the helm of the beleaguered US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in late July, she had her work cut out for her. Public trust in the agency had dropped considerably since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. And US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who oversees the CDC, had called the agency a “cesspool of corruption” that needed to be fundamentally rebuilt.\n\nLess than a month into Monarez’s tenure, US President Donald Trump fired her. She had lost the trust of Kennedy, who only a month earlier had said he had “full confidence” in her ability to lead the agency and that she had “unimpeachable scientific credentials”.\n\nThis conflict spilled into public view when each presented their version of events to US senators at separate hearings on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. Monarez was dismissed, she said, for refusing to fire top scientists at the agency or pre-approve vaccine recommendations without first considering the relevant scientific data. Kennedy testified that Monarez had told him that she wasn’t trustworthy, so he ousted her.\n\nKennedy had also told Monarez that CDC employees were “killing children and they don’t care”, were “bought by the pharmaceutical industry” and “forced people to wear masks and social distance like a dictatorship”, she testified. These alleged comments came after a deadly shooting at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, soon after she became director. The gunman, who targeted the campus to protest COVID-19 vaccines, killed police officer David Rose and shattered some 150 windows.\n\nThe past few months, Monarez says, have included both “the highlights of my professional career” and the “absolute worst days of my life”. In an exclusive interview — her first since she became CDC director — she tells Nature about the consequential decisions that cost her the job and what’s next for public health in a politicized world.\n\nThe CDC director is an “inherently political position, but that doesn’t mean that it has to be politically compromised”, says Monarez, who is an immunologist and microbiologist. “The CDC is far too important to just give up on.”\n\nBefore our call, you sent me a photo that seems to be of you as a child with your father and siblings sitting on a tractor with a barn in the background. What was that about?\n\nI grew up in rural America, in a family that didn’t have many resources — my dad was a dairy farmer. You live without expecting to have the privileges and material possessions that so many people have. We just knew that you worked hard. You got up early and you treated people with kindness. We lived at or below the poverty line for a long time.\n\nMy parents, they’re still alive, thankfully. But they’ve never been wealthy, and they don’t have the advantages of immediate access to high-quality health care, and so I see them still struggling today. When we’re talking in Washington DC, we have to remember that there are millions and millions of Americans like my parents. We can’t leave them behind.\n\nBefore the CDC, you worked at the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a government agency supporting high-risk, high-reward biomedical research. How did that work inform your priorities for CDC?\n\nSo much of what we built at ARPA-H was free from all of the bureaucratic impediments. We gave ourselves permission to ask: ‘What if we could change the world?’ I wanted to bring that mindset to CDC.\n\nJust eight days into your tenure, there was a deadly shooting at CDC headquarters that terrified many members of your staff. Tell me about that experience.\n\nThe first week was probably one of the highlights of my entire professional career — meeting hundreds of CDC employees who wanted to make a difference and change the world. I got on the plane to come back to [Washington] DC. And I finally got WiFi just before we landed, and all these texts had started coming through: ‘Something’s happening here, we’re hearing there’s a shooter.’\n\nThree ways ex-CDC chief says that Trump team is sidelining science\n\nIt was the most surreal, painful change between this extraordinary enthusiasm of ‘we’re going to change the world with the most amazing people’ to ‘has anyone been killed?’\n\n[As I spoke to more CDC staff,] it looked like most were OK, but highly traumatized, because so many people were literally in the line of fire.\n\nMy father — after we lost the farm — became a police officer. It was so near and dear to my heart, the willingness of these police officers to sacrifice themselves. I couldn’t stop thinking about Officer Rose losing his life. It could have been my dad.\n\nThis wasn’t an abstract, faraway thing. These were real humans who were targeted with real bullets that were not intended for buildings — they were intended to cause harm.\n\nWhat do you make of Kennedy’s characterizations of CDC employees, such as his suggestion they have been ‘bought by the pharmaceuticals industry’?\n\nI did not meet a single human that embodied that rhetoric. They could be making a lot more money [in the private sector].\n\nI am worried about the context that we’re placing on our public-health officials, who just want to help people. To contextualize it any other way is to do them such an extraordinary disservice.\n\nHow are we going to incentivize our best and our brightest to contribute to public health, which is thankless? And what happens if we don’t?\n\nYou also testified that Kennedy had asked you to pre-approve vaccine recommendations that hadn’t yet been made. Was that the main sticking point for you?\n\nAnd firing scientists without cause. [At CDC, I] had been with selfless, brilliant, amazing people who just wanted to contribute to wellness. We had already started talking about, ‘How do we restore public trust?’ because ‘just trust us’ doesn’t work any more. So it was [against] that backdrop and then being told I had to fire these people without cause that — as a human, I wouldn’t do that. And as a leader, I wouldn’t do that.\n\nAnd being asked to commit [wholeheartedly] without evidence — I would never do that, as a scientist. You have to gather the right data.\n\n[Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement to Nature last month that Monarez “acted maliciously to undermine the president’s agenda and was fired as a result”. Kennedy conceded, in remarks to Congress, that he had asked Monarez to fire CDC staff members.]\n\nAt least ten states say they can no longer trust the CDC and have formed their own alliances, one on the West Coast and one in the Northeast. What do you make of these efforts?\n\nThese states are worried about the people who live in their communities. They’re worried about whether they will be able to help to prevent public-health harms. I understand their concerns. It is a reflection of [how much some people can trust] what’s emanating from the federal government.\n\nIsn’t this in some ways playing directly into what this administration is pushing for — a dismantling of the federal government in favour of states’ rights? Is that compatible with the fundamental principles of public health?\n\nPublic health doesn’t respect state boundaries. We do need to find a way to work together. I’ll go back to my own upbringing. The rural community where I grew up could easily be left behind [if access to high-quality healthcare is available in one state but not another] and we don’t want that.",

Yet, their closing pledges — increased collaboration and innovation — felt familiar and incremental for a crisis that many people see as systemic.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nStuart Gillespie’s book Food Fight offers a sharp diagnosis: a global system once designed to stave off famine through cheap, calorie-dense foods now fuels obesity, disease, environmental harm and inequality. Drawing on four decades of experience in global nutrition and policy, Gillespie argues that tinkering won’t do. Fixing the system will take nothing less than a revolution.\n\nThe statistics that Gillespie presents in this eye-opening book are shocking: poor diet now accounts for one-quarter of all adult deaths worldwide (more than 12 million a year); malnutrition in all its forms affects one in three people; and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which are highly profitable to corporations, are linked to as many as one in seven premature deaths in some countries. Moreover, food production generates roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nGillespie attributes many of these issues to corporate greed, weak regulation by governments and complicit international organizations. The result is a system that prioritizes profit, with people and the planet paying the price.\n\nUltra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition\n\nThe book traces the shaping of modern food systems to colonialism. Agriculture during colonial times was extractive, and geared towards the production of profitable items, including sugar, tea, coffee and cocoa, rather than nourishing local populations. Gillespie argues that this logic of plunder persists in today’s corporate-dominated system, in which a handful of transnational firms — ‘Big Food’, ‘Big Sugar’ and ‘Big Choc’ — control nearly every stage of food production, distribution and consumption. Their pursuit of profit drives the manufacture of ultra-processed products that are designed to be addictive and have a long shelf life and strong appeal, while simultaneously shifting social and environmental costs to the public.\n\nOne of the most damning sections of Food Fight deals with the health impacts of this corporate control. Gillespie emphasizes that malnutrition is no longer just about hunger — it’s about the poor quality of diets. The number of people with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and diet-related cancers is soaring worldwide. At the same time, undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies persist — the ‘double burden’ of malnutrition.\n\nA heavy toll",

It’s easy to track which papers result from a grant, but much harder to follow how research has broader societal impacts on policies, medicines or products.\n\n“Those are much more exciting [impacts], and provide greater public good,” says Dashun Wang, director of the Center for Science of Science and Innovation at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nWang and his colleagues built a tool called Funding the Frontier, which integrates data on research publications, patents, policy papers and clinical trials, and presents the information in a visually intuitive way. They also combined the tool with a machine-learning-driven predictive algorithm to forecast which studies and fields are likely to lead to the most societal benefits in the future — for example, which grants are most likely to result in a patent. They described the prototype in a paper published on the arXiv preprint server1.\n\nFunding the Frontier includes a mind-boggling amount of data, drawn from four large data sets: the Dimensions, Altmetric and Overton databases, as well as the authors’ own SciSciNet data set. The total collection links 7 million research grants to 140 million scientific publications, 160 million patents, 10.9 million policy documents, 800,000 clinical trials and 5.8 million newsfeeds, all published between 2000 and 2021, with 1.8 billion citation linkages among them. The data can be displayed in several ways, showing the impacts that flowed from a particular study and tracing outcomes back to their sources and all the links between them.\n\nStaša Milojević, who studies the science of science at Indiana University in Bloomington and was not involved in developing the tool, says that it could help to fill an important gap when it comes to translating studies of how science works into useful data. “Many studies in the area of ‘science of science’ have potential science-policy and funding implications,” she says. “However, their practical impact is often limited because they lack the tools that stakeholders can easily use to obtain useful insights.”\n\nThe size of the database, and its ability to link disparate strands together, is the biggest advantage, says Milojević. “The sheer amount of data, and the degree of data aggregation associated with FtF [Funding the Frontier], is impressive,” she says. “Even without its predictive aspect, having a tool that allows one to look up PIs [principal investigators] or grants from wide areas of science and evaluate them in terms of their various research metrics normalized for variations over fields and time is extremely useful.”\n\nHow to demonstrate the real-world impact of your research\n\nCase studies\n\nWang expects that many people will be interested in the tool. Funders might use it to investigate their funding portfolio to see which areas have been most productive; university administrators could investigate the footprint of their institution, to identify areas of strength and weakness and help to decide where to invest.\n\n“There’s an infinite amount of questions you could ask,” he says.\n\nThe preprint, which is yet to be peer reviewed, includes case studies involving anonymous potential users. One project manager at a large US funding agency used it to examine the broad social impacts of the agency’s grants, which he said he had never been able to see before. He found that their projects had been cited in policy documents in Germany and the United Kingdom and at other intergovernmental organizations. But he also identified a previously unknown gender disparity — namely that, in some fields, female PIs were under-represented — which he planned to further investigate.\n\nA second user, who works for a private investment firm specializing in biomedical research, was most interested in the tool’s predictive potential. He found that, in the field of Alzheimer’s research, the biggest clinical impact over the past 20 years came from studies aimed at understanding the disease, but the biggest predicted future impact was concentrated in studies of the social-support systems of people with the disease — suggesting a potential new investment opportunity.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nResearchers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help design the next generation of antibiotics to combat rising antimicrobial resistance. In minutes, AI can design thousands of chemical compounds with potential antibacterial properties, although there are hurdles to overcome before the first of these medicines can be tested in people.\n\nLast week, the US Centers for Disease Control reported that rates of dangerous bacterial infections surged by 69% between 2019 and 2023. Enterobacterales bacteria, also called 'nightmare bacteria', are particularly difficult to treat with existing antibiotics. Globally, 1.1 million deaths a year are linked to bacterial resistance to antimicrobial drugs.\n\nThe standard method of antibiotic discovery involves going into nature and sifting through dirt to find antibacterial compounds, says César de la Fuente, a machine biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. “That’s really painstaking work that relies on trial and error, and it can take many years,” he adds. His team has been using AI to discover antibiotics for about a decade. The whole process of discovering a candidate, creating it in the laboratory and testing it in cells can be done “within a week or two”, he adds.\n\nMost AI-designed antibiotics are still in early development. None has yet been tested in humans.\n\nAI-designed drugs\n\nMachine learning and generative AI (genAI) can speed up the process. De la Fuente and his team train machine-learning algorithms by showing them compounds that can harm bacteria, and others that cannot. The AI designs antibiotics by looking for fragments of proteins with antibacterial properties in data sets that it has not seen before. These include the proteomes — the complete set of proteins that an organism can express — of animals, plants and bacteria.\n\nGenAI algorithms — similar to the AI used in chatbots or image generators — are trained on the same data but designed to create new compounds. Earlier this month, de la Fuente and his team reported that their genAI model designed 50,000 peptides, or short chains of amino acids, that have antimicrobial properties and can destroy pathogens1. A deep-learning model then ranked these on the basis of how effective it thinks they might be at killing several bacteria types. Of the top 46 synthesized peptides, about 35 killed at least one bacterial strain in a dish, and most were not toxic to human embryonic kidney cells. The top two candidates were then tested and found to be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii in mouse models.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nBut making AI-designed antibiotics in the lab can be challenging. For example, bioengineer Jim Collins, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, has found that some AI-designed antibiotics are chemically unstable and cannot be synthesized. Others take too many steps to make and would be too costly and time-consuming to produce commercially.",

          "abstract": "DNA-synthesis firms routinely use -biosecurity-screening software to ensure that they don’t inadvertently create dangerous sequences. But a paper published in Science on 2 October describes a potential vulnerability in this workflow1.\n\nIt details how protein-design strategies aided by artificial intelligence (AI) could circumvent the screening software that many DNA-synthesis firms use to ensure that they avoid unintentionally producing sequences encoding harmful proteins or pathogens.\n\nThe researchers used an approach from the cybersecurity world: ‘red teaming’, in which one team attempts to break through another’s defences (with their knowledge). They found that some screening tools were unprepared to catch AI-generated protein sequences that recreate the structure, but not the sequence, of known biothreats, says Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. This is a type of zero-day vulnerability — one that, in the cybersecurity world, blindsides software developers and users. “The diversified proteins essentially flew through the screening techniques” that were tested, Horvitz says.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nAfter the developers patched their software to address the new threat, the tools performed much better, flagging all but about 3% of malicious sequences in a larger second attempt.\n\nThe impetus for the study is researchers’ rapidly growing ability to create new, custom proteins. Armed with AI-powered tools such as RFdiffusion and ProteinMPNN, researchers can now invent proteins to attack tumours, defend against viruses and break down -pollutants. David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, whose team developed both RFdiffusion and -ProteinMPNN, won a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in this area.\n\nBut biodesign tools could have other uses — not all of them noble. Someone might intentionally or accidentally create a toxic compound or pathogen, putting many people at risk. The Microsoft-led project aims to prevent that possibility, focusing on a key checkpoint: synthesizing the DNA strands that encode these proteins. Researchers identified gaps in the screening of risky sequences and helped DNA-synthesis providers to close them. But as AI for protein design advances, defences, too, must evolve.\n\nMoment of panic\n\nHorvitz has long recognized that AI, like all technologies, has both good and bad applications. In 2023, motivated by concerns about potential misuse of AI-based protein design, he, Baker and others organized a workshop at the University of Washington to hammer out responsible practices. Horvitz asked Bruce Wittmann, an applied scientist at Microsoft, to create a concrete example of the threat.\n\nProteins, built of amino acids, are the workhorses of the cell. They are first written in the language of DNA — a string of nucleotides, denoted by A, C, G and T, whose order defines the sequence of amino acids. To create a protein, researchers specify the underlying nucleotide sequence, which they send to a DNA--synthesis company. The provider uses biosecurity screening software (BSS) to look for similarities between the new sequence and known sequences of concern — genes that encode, say, a toxin. If nothing is flagged, the provider creates the requested DNA and mails it back.\n\nHorvitz and Wittmann wanted to see how porous such screening was. So, Wittmann adapted open-source AI protein-design software to alter the amino-acid sequence of a protein of concern while retaining its folded, 3D shape — and, potentially, its function. It’s the protein-design equivalent of paraphrasing a sentence, Wittmann says. The AI designed thousands of variants. Horvitz and Wittmann then reached out to two synthesis providers and asked them to use their BSS tools to test the sequences. One was Twist Bioscience in San Francisco, California, which used ThreatSeq from Battelle in Columbus, Ohio; the other was Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) in Coralville, Iowa, which uses FAST-NA Scanner from RTX BBN Technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The result: the tools were porous, indeed.\n\nEric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft.Credit: Dan DeLong\n\nJacob Beal, a computer scientist at BBN, recalls a “moment of panic” looking at one of the tools: “Oh my goodness, this just goes straight through everything, like butter.”\n\nBecause the findings could have been dangerous in the wrong hands, the team began by sharing them with a small circle of people, including select workshop attendees; US government biosecurity officials; and James Diggans, the chair of the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC), a coalition of synthesis providers, formed in 2009 to create and share standards for screening both sequences and customers.\n\n“The results of the framing study were not a huge surprise,” says Nicole Wheeler, a microbiologist then at the University of Birmingham, UK, and a co-author of the report. But “the study gave a clear indication of the scale of the problem today and data we could use to start testing and improving our screening tools”.\n\nHorvitz and Wittmann then conducted a larger study. They started with 72 proteins of concern — both toxins and viral proteins — and generated tens of thousands of variants of the amino-acid sequences. As before, they ran the design software in two modes, one of which kept amino acids untouched at key locations. This mode increased the chance not only that the proteins would retain the functionality of the unaltered template proteins that they were emulating, but also that they’d be flagged by the BSS. Then, they reverse-translated the -amino-acid sequences into DNA, which they sent to four BSS providers who were in on the exercise.\n\nThe team also scored the variant proteins for predicted risk. Proteins that exceeded a threshold on two measures were deemed dangerous. First, the proteins needed to be structurally similar (on the basis of computer simulations) to the template proteins. Second, the software needed to have high confidence in the predicted structure, indicating that the protein was likely to fold up properly and be functional. The researchers never actually made the toxic proteins, but in work posted to the preprint server bioRxiv in May2, they synthesized some benign ones generated through their design method. They found that their metrics accurately predicted when a protein variant would maintain functionality, suggesting that at least some of the dangerous protein variants would have been functional, too. (But perhaps not many; most of the synthesized variants of benign proteins were inactive.)\n\nIncreased cyber-biosecurity for DNA synthesis\n\nOverall, of the proteins that Horvitz and Wittmann deemed most dangerous, the patched BSS caught 97%, while keeping the false-positive rate under 2.5%.\n\nDiggans, who is also the head of biosecurity at Twist, says that the BSS tools that they use were patched in different ways during the Science study. In one case, developers used Wittmann’s sequences to fine-tune a machine-learning model; in others, they lowered the statistical-significance threshold for similarity to cast “a wider net”, now that they knew the degree to which AI could change sequences.\n\nBeal, at BBN, says that FAST-NA Scanner works differently. Before the red-teaming exercise, it looked for exact matches between short substrings of nucleotides and the sequences of genes encoding proteins of concern. After being patched, it scans for exact matches only at locations known to be important to a protein’s functionality, allowing for harmless variation elsewhere. The company uses machine learning to generate diverse new sequences of concern, then identifies the important parts of their structures on the basis of similarities between those sequences. Some of the providers have since made further patches on the basis of this work.\n\nRedacted detail\n\nHorvitz and Wittmann teamed up with co-authors, including Wheeler, Diggans and Beal, to write up and share the results. Some colleagues felt the authors should provide every detail, whereas others said they should share nothing. “Our first reaction was, ‘Anybody in the field would know how to do this kind of thing, wouldn’t they?’” Horvitz says. “And even senior folks said, ‘Well, that’s not exactly true.’ And so that went back and forth.”\n\nIn the end, they posted a version of their white paper on the preprint server bioRxiv in December, with key details removed. It doesn’t describe the proteins they modified (the Science version of the paper lists them), the design tools they used or how they used them. It also omits a section on common BSS failures and glosses over obfuscation techniques — ways to design sequences that won’t raise flags but that produce DNA strands that can easily be modified after synthesis to become more dangerous.\n\nFor the published version, the authors worked with journal editors to create a tiered system for data access. Parties must apply through the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS) in Geneva. (The highest-risk data tier includes the study’s code.) “I’m really excited about this,” Tessa Alexanian, a technical lead at IBBIS, said in a press briefing on 30 September. “This managed-access programme is an experiment, and we’re very eager to evolve our approach.”\n\n“There are two communities, which each have very well-grounded principles that both apply here and are in opposition to one another,” Beal says. In the cybersecurity world, people often share vulnerabilities, so they can be patched widely; in biosecurity, threats are potentially deadly and difficult to counter, so people prefer to keep them under wraps. “Now we’re in a place where these two worlds overlap.”\n\nRegulation\n\nEven if screening tools work perfectly, bad actors could still design and build dangerous proteins. There are no laws requiring DNA-synthesis providers to screen orders, for instance. “That’s a scary situation,” says Jaime Yassif, who runs the global biosecurity programme at the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a non-profit organization in Washington DC. “Not only is screening not required, but the cost of DNA synthesis has been plummeting exponentially for years, and the cost of biosecurity has been basically fixed, so the profit margins on DNA synthesis are pretty thin.” To maximize profit, companies could skimp on screening.\n\nIn 2020, the NTI and the World Economic Forum organized a working group to make DNA-synthesis screening more accessible to synthesis firms. The NTI began building a BSS tool called the Common Mechanism, and last year it spun off of IBBIS, which now manages the tool. (Wheeler was the technical lead who developed it.) The Common Mechanism is free, open-source software that includes a database of concerning sequences and an algorithm that detects similarities between those sequences and submitted ones. Users can integrate more databases and analysis modules as they become available.\n\nApplied scientist Bruce Wittmann.",

          "title": "Jane Goodall’s legacy: three ways she changed science",
          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse, Mohana Basu",
          "abstract": "Jane Goodall, a British primatologist known for her work with chimpanzees, died on Wednesday 1 October, aged 91. She was in California on a speaking tour and died of natural causes, according to the Jane Goodall Institute.\n\nGoodall is best known for her work with chimpanzees in Gombe National Park in Tanzania. She was the first to discover that chimpanzees made and used tools1. She went on to become an advocate for conservation, human rights and animal welfare, including stopping the use of animals in medical research. She established the Jane Goodall Institute, a non-profit wildlife and conservation organization in Washington DC, in 1977.\n\nHere are the ways in which Goodall’s legacy will endure.\n\nHumanizing primates\n\nWhile studying for her PhD at the University of Cambridge, UK, in the early 1960s, Goodall broke with the scientific convention of using numbers to identify animals, assigning them names instead. She named a male chimp with silver facial hair David Greybeard. This change upset senior scientists at the time, but it is now common practice to use animal names.\n\n“It was criticized as unscientific,” says Mireya Mayor, an anthropologist and primatologist at Florida International University in Miami, “but she proved that science could extend its boundaries without losing rigour.”\n\nGoodall was among the first to show that animals had emotions, empathy and culture, traits that had been reserved for humans, Mayor says. Her research changed how animal studies were conducted, she adds.\n\nHer discoveries in Gombe National Park “redefined humanity”, says Nick Boyle, executive director of Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. Goodall challenged the idea that chimpanzees were herbivores, and showed that they ate meat, hunted and engaged in warfare, he adds. In 1973, Goodall observed a social divide between two chimpanzee communities that led to a four-year conflict and the deaths of all of the male apes in one of the communities.\n\nInspiring women scientists\n\nBeyond primatology, Goodall’s legacy is the generations of women she inspired to follow in her footsteps into fieldwork, says Mayor. In 1961, Goodall was one of the few students accepted into a PhD at Cambridge without an undergraduate degree. She completed her PhD in 1965.\n\n“She showed that a young woman with no formal scientific training could rewrite science and the understanding of animals on such a fundamental level,” adds Mayor.\n\nAlison Behie, an anthropologist at the Australian National University, was one of the women Goodall inspired. After attending a talk by Goodall, Behie says she switched her undergraduate major from microbiology to anthropology and started taking primatology and conservation courses. “It was just a happy coincidence, but she came to speak at the exact time that I was not quite sure what sort of science I wanted to do,” she says.\n\nIn 2017, Behie introduced eight of her female students to Goodall during her visit to Australia. “It was a full circle for me to be able to show my own students what had inspired me to go down this path.”\n\nCommunicating science",

          "abstract": "Too many papers, too little time.Credit: Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty\n\nThe challenge of staying up to date with the scientific literature has become a burden for everyone from students to senior investigators. In fields such as public health, annual publication counts now exceed half a million articles — more than 1,300 papers every day. Experienced researchers and early-career scientists alike report anxiety about falling behind and emphasize the importance of building efficient reading habits. Some have noted that the pressure to keep up has left many scientists increasingly reliant on social media and recommendation systems to find papers, rather than systematic reading.\n\nWhat’s clear is that the difficulty of keeping up with the literature is no longer a niche problem, but one that cuts across disciplines, methodologies and seniority levels. As researchers at different stages of our scientific journeys — a PhD student, a mid-career investigator and a senior group leader — we, too, have faced this challenge. Collectively, we have spent decades navigating the scientific literature, testing different ways to filter information and adapting to the accelerating pace of publication.\n\nHere, we offer five complementary strategies to help you filter the literature and stay up to date on your research field. These are the strategies that we have found to be the most effective, and we hope that they will help others, too, whatever their field or career stage.\n\nSubscribe to what matters\n\nOne of the simplest and most reliable ways to stay current is through journal table of contents (ToC) alerts. This conventional method might seem outdated in the age of personalized algorithms, but subscribing to a carefully curated selection of journals remains a sound strategy. Often, ToC alerts highlight key articles and provide direct links to abstracts or full texts. Some can even filter by article type and have specific alerts for reviews, editorials, research articles or methods papers.\n\nBluesky’s science takeover: 70% of Nature poll respondents use platform\n\nReceiving a curated list of new papers from a handful of reputable journals provides a structured and predictable way to remain grounded in the core literature of your field. It’s particularly helpful for recognizing recurring themes, spotting important reviews and following long-term shifts in editorial priorities — all without needing to actively search. We recommend subscribing to a blend of landmark and niche journals to capture both broad and field-specific research.\n\nYou might miss important articles published in journals that fall outside your alert list. When browsing long tables of contents, especially under time pressure, it’s easy to skim over titles that later prove relevant. Still, for many researchers, ToC alerts remain a first line of defence against information overload.\n\nLet PubMed do the work\n\nMoving beyond broad overviews, use platforms such as PubMed and Google Scholar to create a personalized surveillance system that monitors the literature for the topics, authors or keywords that matter to you. Users can set up saved searches and automated alerts, which can be configured to arrive weekly or monthly by e-mail.\n\nQueries can incorporate Boolean operators (such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’) and be polished to reduce the number of irrelevant hits. This method is particularly useful for capturing articles that appear in lesser-known journals or are outside your usual reading scope.\n\nThe same can be done for preprint servers such as bioRxiv and medRxiv, which allow users to set up RSS (really simple syndication) feeds or e-mail alerts on the basis of keywords, authors or subject areas. Including preprints in your alerts can give you early insight into emerging findings, methods and controversies because they frequently appear weeks or even months before peer-reviewed publication.\n\nThat said, custom alerts require maintenance. Poorly constructed queries can return overwhelming — and often irrelevant — results. And even well-designed alerts can pile up in your inbox, adding to the very overload they’re meant to reduce. Still, when used properly, search alerts across both peer-reviewed databases and preprint repositories can surface important literature with remarkable precision.\n\nFollow the people, not the papers\n\nAlthough many tools focus on topics or journals, an increasingly effective way to filter literature is to follow the researchers themselves. Professional networks such as ResearchGate and LinkedIn allow scientists to receive updates directly from the people and labs they care about. This person-centred approach can be particularly powerful for those who already know the key players in their field and want to monitor their scientific output in a more digestible, progressive format. For instance, ResearchGate can notify you when someone you follow uploads a new publication, preprint or data set. It also generates curated suggestions on the basis of your reading habits, recommendations and profile interests. These help to surface work that might otherwise be missed. Unlike static e-mail alerts, these feeds evolve as your network grows, offering a dynamic way to stay informed.\n\nThis approach also has the advantage of reinforcing professional awareness. Associating papers with specific individuals or groups can help to contextualize findings, track thematic trajectories in laboratories and even identify potential collaborators or competitors. Some authors also post supplementary materials or tutorials that aren’t always accessible through conventional journals, adding important context.\n\nOf course, not all researchers upload their work promptly, and some don’t use these platforms at all. As with social media, the quality of your feed is only as strong as the network you build. Still, for those willing to invest the time, following the people behind the papers offers a valuable, filtered window into the scientific landscape. A good tip for getting started is to identify active users in your field and screen their followers and followings for inspiration.\n\nUse social media wisely\n\nResearchers increasingly use social-media platforms such as X and Bluesky to share their latest publications, discuss preprints, highlight interesting studies and comment on scientific developments. Following the right accounts can provide a curated stream of relevant papers and ideas, often before they appear in journals or search alerts. These platforms also allow you to interact with researchers you might otherwise meet only at conferences — or perhaps be too shy to approach in person.",

          "abstract": "The US government ceased many operations early on Wednesday after Congress failed to pass legislation to fund agencies’ activities.Credit: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty\n\nThe US government shut down at 12:01 et on 1 October, after lawmakers in Congress failed to agree on a funding bill to keep the government running. Threats of federal shutdowns have become routine in the past decade, but this closure could be different: US President Donald Trump’s administration has encouraged mass firings of federal workers — a group that includes tens of thousands of scientists — during the lapse in funding.\n\n“When you shut it down, you have to do lay-offs. So, we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected,” Trump said on 30 September. It’s not clear when such lay-offs would begin, whether they would survive legal challenges or how extensive they would be. Even without any shutdown-driven lay-offs, the Trump administration projects that it will cut 300,000 people from the roughly 2.4-million-person federal workforce by the end of the year as part of its efforts to downsize the government.\n\nNASA begins mass firings of scientists ahead of Trump team’s deadline\n\nIn the meantime, the federal government has stopped non-essential operations. Science-agency staff members have been sent home, their research suspended. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had planned to halt its in-house basic research and stop admitting new people to the NIH hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. If the shutdown lasts more than a few days, it will directly affect non-government researchers: both the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would stop awarding new grants.\n\nShutdowns “can have a significant impact on the scientific research enterprise, and a lot of that does depend on how long a shutdown is”, says Joanne Padrón Carney, the chief government-relations officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC.\n\nIt’s unclear how long the shutdown could last. The first Trump administration (2017–21) featured a 35-day closure, the longest in US history, that cost roughly US$5 billion and led to disruptions across most US science agencies. There is no set date for the parties to meet for negotiations.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s questions about mass layoffs and the shutdown’s effect on science.\n\nShutdown showdown\n\nIn March, a small group of Senate Democrats voted with Republicans to pass a bill to keep the government open. But this time, Democratic lawmakers have voiced concerns about loss of health-care subsidies and a range of other issues, including attacks on free speech.\n\n‘Scientists will not be silenced’: thousands protest Trump research cuts\n\nAlthough many scientists worry about the effect of a shutdown, some, including some federal researchers, see this as an opportunity for Congress to derail the Trump team’s activities, which have already included substantial lay-offs, budget cuts and disruption to research.\n\nAt a public protest in Washington DC on 29 September, federal employees spoke out against the actions of the Trump administration. “American science, the gold-standard and world-leading science and innovation enterprise, is being destroyed,” said Mark Histed, a neuroscientist at the NIH in Bethesda. “Congress has a rare moment of leverage to check Trump’s executive overreach and it must stand up and do so.”\n\nDrastic reductions\n\nNo previous shutdowns carried the threat of mass firings, officially called reductions in force (RIFs). According to guidance issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the office has directed agencies to consider issuing RIF notices to all employees who are working on certain projects: those whose Congressional funding lapsed on 1 October and whose goals are not “consistent with the President’s Priorities”. Carney says that the memo could be used to close programmes, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge at science agencies.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Thirty years ago this week, two Swiss astronomers announced that they had spotted the first known planet orbiting a Sun-like star. The Nobel-winning discovery, later published in the pages of Nature1, was the culmination of centuries of dreaming, and decades of searching, for worlds beyond the Solar System.\n\nIt was also the start of a whirlwind of discovery. Astronomers have since found more than 6,000 exoplanets, plus hints of thousands more. Many were detected by NASA’s Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions, with other telescopes also contributing (see ‘Alien worlds’).\n\nThe exoplanetary zoo hosts a diversity of beasts. There are ‘hot Jupiters’ that whirl closely around their stars, including the planet discovered 30 years ago, which is orbiting the star 51 Pegasi. There are ‘super-Earths’ and ‘mini-Neptunes’ — categorized because of how their masses compare with those of planets in the Solar System — which are some of the most common exoplanets found so far. There are systems crammed with multiple planets that move in almost musical rhythms with one another; rogue planets floating freely in the Galaxy; and alien worlds that circle two stars at once, just like the fictional Star Wars planet Tatooine.\n\nSource: NASA Exoplanet Archive\n\n“Each is a whole brand-new world, brimming with possibility and potential, usually unlike anything we’ve seen before and challenging our notions of what ‘normal’ planets and planetary systems look like,” says Jessie Christiansen, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nNature asked some astronomers about their favourite exoplanets — and got wide range of suggestions.\n\nProxima Centauri: Nearby and visitable\n\nAt the top of many recommendation lists are the two — or possibly three — small planets that orbit Proxima Centauri, which is the closest star to the Sun — just 1.3 parsecs away in the constellation Centaurus.\n\nThe first Proxima planet was found in 2016 using the European Southern Observatory in Chile2. It is probably Earth-sized and orbits within its star’s habitable zone, the distance at which liquid water could exist on its surface. A second confirmed planet lies just outside the habitable zone and is probably a little smaller than Earth.\n\nThe nearness of Proxima Centauri means that these planets are the best choices for an interstellar spacecraft to visit, says Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory in France. The first effort to develop such a craft — a US$100-million project known as Breakthrough Starshot — has reportedly floundered.\n\nStill, “before the end of the century we will go there”, Schneider says.\n\nThere are seven Earth-sized planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt, T. Pyle (IPAC)\nTRAPPIST-1: Earth worlds all in a row\n\nAnother favourite is the planetary system around the star TRAPPIST-1, which lies around 12 parsecs from Earth in the constellation Aquarius. Seven Earth-sized worlds orbit the star, discovered in 2016 and 20173.\n\nNASA exoplanet hunter racks up bizarre worlds and exploding stars\n\nSome of the TRAPPIST-1 planets lie in the habitable zone, making the system an ideal laboratory for exploring the evolution of Earth-sized planets at different distances from their star. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), in particular, has been scouring the TRAPPIST-1 planets for any sign of an atmosphere. So far, the news has been mostly negative — perhaps not surprisingly, because the star is extremely active.\n\nBut astronomers say there’s plenty to learn about the conditions that could lead to habitable conditions on some of the TRAPPIST-1 planets. Last month, for instance, astronomers using JWST reported that planet ‘e’ still has a chance of having an atmosphere4.\n\n“Plus, if you were on its surface, the other planets would look like moons in its sky,” says Néstor Espinoza, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. “Isn’t that just beyond sci-fi?”\n\nK2-138: Musical resonances\n\nThe planetary system K2-138 has six planets lined up around its star, around 200 parsecs away in the constellation Aquarius.\n\nFirst discovered by citizen scientists who were trawling through data from NASA’s Kepler mission5, the K2-138 planets move in a series of 3:2 resonances. That means that some planets orbit the star three times in the same time it takes others to orbit twice. Researchers have turned this resonance, which is similar to the perfect fifth interval in music, into a sonification of the planets.\n\nThe existence of the resonances suggests that the planets ended up in their final configurations through some slow, gradual process, Christiansen says. Many other planetary systems, including the Solar System, have experienced violent and chaotic reshuffling that destroyed such resonances. K2-138 thus preserves rare clues about the formation of planetary systems, she says.\n\nThe motions of the planets orbiting K2-138 can be converted into musical rhythms. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R.

          "authors": "Holly Else",
          "abstract": "Some research-assessment frameworks rank individual departments or staff members.Credit: Getty\n\nSteve Goodman had just completed a three-page referee’s letter for an academic colleague who was going for promotion in a law department, when he received a bundle of papers that surprised him. The package contained the recommendation letters of other referees. “They were eight to ten pages long,” he says, adding that he had never seen letters like these before.\n\nGoodman, an epidemiologist at Stanford University in California, describes what he read as having been written by people who had digested the colleague’s books, engaged with their arguments and produced a commentary similar to something you’d publish. His letter, by contrast, took half a day to write. His legal academic colleagues told him it was standard for law researchers to set aside a week to write referee letters, and that they received credit towards their own career development for doing so.\n\nGoodman was stunned. The idea that you would do a deep dive into someone’s scholarship to write a recommendation letter is “inconceivable in biomedicine”, he says, where it is standard to focus on a researcher’s publications and assess the importance and value of their contributions. Goodman did not know the scholar in question, but was asked to write the letter because their work bridged law and biomedicine.\n\nUnbeknown to him, Goodman had stumbled across the patchwork nature of research assessment in the United States. Even within an institution, the process by which the work of researchers in different disciplines is evaluated can vary widely. It is a similar picture elsewhere.\n\nSome countries run huge nationwide programmes to assess the quality of research, often drilling down to measure the success of individual departments or staff members so that they can be compared.\n\nThe exercises cost millions of dollars and require countless hours that, some argue, could otherwise be dedicated to research. But governments champion them because they help to ensure accountability in the distribution of taxpayers’ money. In other countries, the United States among them, there are no formal mechanisms to assess research nationwide, and evaluations are reserved for individuals’ grant applications or hiring and promotion decisions.\n\nResearchers have mixed views on assessment. Some say it drives improvements in quality, but others argue that it has a negative impact on research culture and morale. And in some countries, such as Argentina, many scientists have earned themselves a promotion but are yet to see it because of budgetary constraints, fostering distrust of the evaluation process.\n\nBut across the diverse ecosystem of research assessment, some things remain constant. Assessors often use shortcuts, such as quantitative metrics based on citation data, to judge research quality. Although quicker, such metrics lack the nuance of more time-consuming qualitative peer review, causing tension for those being evaluated.\n\nMany systems are now changing, having recognized the negative effects of assessment on research culture, and some are grappling with how artificial intelligence could support decision-making.\n\nHistory\n\nForty years ago, the United Kingdom wanted to have a better way to distribute research funding. The current system is called the Research Excellence Framework (REF), and is run every six or seven years. The stakes are high because the results dictate how £2 billion (US$2.7 billion) in public research funding is distributed annually among the country’s universities, which number more than 150. It aims to capture a wider picture of research, including measurements of the social, economic and political impact and how the public engages with it. The next REF, expected to run in 2029, is likely to place greater emphasis on these elements and on the environment in which research takes place, in a bid to improve research culture.\n\nThe UK model inspired a wave of countries and territories to follow suit. In the early 2000s, for example, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Australia adopted regular nationwide exercises.\n\nMany of these schemes focus on researchers’ outputs, which can include journal articles, data sets and contributions to conferences, and which are set before an expert panel for critical appraisal. At the nationwide level, these panels might convene world-leading authorities with specific criteria to consider, but for other assessments, such as hiring decisions, the panels might involve more-informal gatherings of departmental members to discuss applicants, for example.\n\nResearch-policy specialist James Wilsdon cautions against using journal impact factors when recruiting researchers.Credit: Layton Thompson\n\nThese deliberations take time, and so assessors use shortcuts to help them to understand research quality, shortcuts that often rely on bibliometric data to attempt to describe the significance of their publications. Metrics such as paper or citation counts could feed into discussions or be used alone to determine research quality.\n\nAs research assessments rose in prominence, scientists became increasingly concerned about the limitations of the evaluation methods, and in particular, with one metric — the journal impact factor, a measure of the average number of citations that articles published by a journal in the previous two years have received in the current year. It was originally designed to help librarians to decide which journals to subscribe to, but is often used as a proxy for the quality of individual journal papers, or even the authors. Critics say that such a proxy loses all the nuances of how research contributes to advancing knowledge in a field, innovations or benefits to society. “It’s when you are using the journal impact factor to determine whether someone should get a job that you are in very dodgy terrain,” says James Wilsdon, who studies research policy at University College London (UCL).\n\nDuring the 2010s, a wave of initiatives began to flag concerns about journal impact factors and other metrics in evaluations, and to suggest better ways to use these measures (see ‘Four initiatives that champion responsible research assessment’). These ideas have received widespread support, but metrics continue to be widely used. A global survey of almost 4,000 researchers by Springer Nature, Nature’s publisher, published in April, found that 55% of respondents are mostly or entirely assessed using metrics, with just 12% saying they were mostly or entirely assessed by qualitative means. (Nature is editorially independent of its publisher.) The full anonymized survey data are available here.\n\nThe survey found that metrics-based evaluations are often focused narrowly on journal articles, with little consideration of other research outputs, such as data sets. Most reseachers also wished for a balanced weighting of quantitative and qualitative factors, but have concerns about the subjectivity, bias and workload of the latter.\n\nIn some countries, metrics, although imperfect, can be helpful, argues Wilsdon. In systems in which nepotism or corruption are rife, using metrics to compare citation counts of researchers, for example, could be useful and corrective, he says.\n\nBut he adds that there has been a “growing clamour” to approach research assessment in a more sensitive and holistic way. Many research-assessment programmes look at past work . However, a report1 published in May on behalf of the Global Research Council (GRC), which represents more than 50 government research funders worldwide, found that evaluations over the past five years show a gradual shift towards more forward-looking elements. These components, known as formative assessments, can include giving weight to more than just the research output — the REF scores UK institutions on the impact of their work in society, for example. Researchers know that they can use these examples of impact in their CVs. “That’s quite an important axis of change in assessment, because it’s using assessment in a much more deliberate way to try and shape research systems,” says Wilsdon, who heads the Research on Research Institute (RORI), a non-profit organization based at UCL, which led the work on the report for the GRC.\n\nPromotion policies\n\nFunders are also experimenting with fresh ways to assess researchers. One method that is gaining traction is the narrative CV. These offer a structured, written description of a scientist’s broad contributions and achievements, in contrast to the conventional CV, which typically lists publication and employment histories, with little context.\n\nNarrative CVs really tell you about the researcher, says Yensi Flores Bueso, a cancer researcher at University College Cork, Ireland. The format helps to level the playing field for researchers from different countries and backgrounds, who might not have access to the same resources.\n\nIn January, Bueso and her colleagues published an analysis2 of more than 300 promotion policies in more than 120 countries, covering how institutions and government agencies promote people to full professorships. The analysis broadly suggests that countries in the global south tend to use quantitative metrics, whereas high-income countries tend to prioritize qualitative aspects such as a researcher’s visibility and engagement.\n\nMuch of how research is assessed is cultural, says Bueso, adding that in some African countries, ”the emphasis is on social commitments”. Promotion documents ask for more details about how a researcher has served civil society, which committees they sit on and their voluntary work, rather than their publication history, she adds. By contrast, some southeast Asian countries rely heavily on metrics and point scoring, with researchers being awarded points according to where in a paper’s author list their name appears or the journal’s impact factor, for example.\n\nYensi Flores Bueso advocates the use of narrative CVs.Credit: Young Academy of Ireland\n\nBueso knows from her own experience about the flaws of relying on metrics such as paper counts or the prestige of journals in which work is published. Originally from Honduras, she started her career there by establishing a laboratory where her research fulfilled a social need: determining the rates of disease in certain populations and which diagnostic assays worked best. But the facility was poorly resourced. In 2020, she moved to the United States, where she worked in a series of large, well-funded labs and made contributions to big projects, which are likely to be published in high-impact journals.\n\n“There is not a chance that my contributions from my work in Honduras will ever be seen in any peer-reviewed journal” owing to lack of funds, she says. “What matters at the end is the quality of the research and how you adapt to a team,” she adds.\n\nIn some countries, huge nationwide assessment programmes have driven changes to the research landscape. In the United Kingdom, for example, research assessment previously helped to concentrate research funding in a number of elite institutions. And in Australia, where administrators have been evaluating research nationwide since 2010, a 2023 review found that the exercise had negative effects on research culture. Policymakers were left questioning the benefit of the system, and the programme, called Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), was halted, with researchers wondering what would come next.\n\nRegional reform\n\nThe most recent ERA exercise, in 2018, saw institutions submit research outputs and data on funding and citations across eight subject areas. Expert committees then evaluated the work in various ways. The extent to which panels relied on bibliometrics depended on the discipline, with science and engineering subjects relying on metrics more heavily than did the humanities and social sciences, which leant more on peer review.\n\nThe results of the exercise — a score on a five-point scale, ranging from below to well above world standard — had only limited impact on institutional funding in some years, and were mostly used by policymakers to compare institutions across disciplines and internationally.\n\nThe original idea for ERA was prompted by concerns to do with quality and value for money in Australian research, says Jill Blackmore, an education researcher at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. It was introduced after a period in which many institutions amalgamated and policymakers felt that research capacity was lacking. “It was very much a focus of quantity, not quality,” she adds.\n\nThe 2023 ERA review by the Australian government found that the exercise pitted universities against each other and saw them poaching staff and duplicating expertise, rather than working together. The process was also onerous and costly. Evidence provided to the review by the University of Sydney, for example, found that its submission, due every three years in line with the assessment cycle, required more than 40,000 hours of staff time, costing in excess of Aus$2 million (US$1.3 million) in salaries alone.\n\nAlthough researchers are now breathing a sigh of relief, they are awaiting what might come next, says Blackmore. Institutions have been doing pre-emptive work around assessment, just in case, she says, adding, “There is no magic bullet to this, because you’re trying to measure value for money.” She also argues that ERA has served its purpose. Now, in education, she says, “we have got high-quality research, and we didn’t for a while”. She doesn’t think ERA is necessary any longer. “Other countries produce quality research without it.”\n\nResearch-policy specialist Takayuki Hayashi says that Japanese researchers are often indifferent about assessment exercises.Credit: Takayuki Hayashi\n\nAs in Australia, policymakers in Japan began assessing research on a nationwide scale as part of broader higher-education reforms. Since 2004, Japan has run the National University Corporation Education and Research Evaluation programme every six years. However, the results have little bearing on funding; instead, they inform university planning and higher-level government policy.\n\nBut this has downsides, with many universities “feeling the process lacks tangible incentives or impact”, says Takayuki Hayashi, a research-policy scholar at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the national assessment programme carries huge weight, in Japan “many researchers view the current evaluation system with a sense of detachment or fatigue, largely because the results have minimal influence on funding or career advancement”.",

          "title": "China’s research hospitals push for prominence",
          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that the geographical centre of medical research might be moving, as the amount and quality of research produced by China’s research hospitals rises, and the United States’ grip on the sector loosens.\n\nChina increased its investment in science by more than 3,800% between 1996 and 2023, says Bilal Demirel, who studies science and innovation at the Rathenau Institute in The Hague, the Netherlands, and is now coming close to matching what the United States spends. With China currently increasing its annual R&D budget by 7% — while US funding looks set to fall under President Donald Trump — there is every chance China will lead on research investment in the coming years.\n\nThanks to this growing government support, some of China’s research hospitals are rapidly moving up the Nature Index rankings. But questions remain about the quality of research in the Chinese health-care sector, with some of its hospitals also topping global lists for retracted papers — and it is not yet clear how effective efforts to rein in the problem will be.\n\nHospitals on the up\n\n“Chinese hospitals used to be quite weak in research, but that is changing rapidly,” says Yi Rao, director of the IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research at Peking University.\n\nRao says the trend is driven by an increase in the number of physicians who have had good training in rigorous research, more encouragement and support from the government for selected hospitals to carry out research, and an increase in collaboration between biomedical scientists and clinical scientists.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\n“Past experiences in the West have shown clearly, and China is learning quickly, that research in hospitals is integral for innovating new treatments and for validating good treatments,” says Rao.\n\nDemirel’s data show that medical research is growing rapidly in the country. In 2003, about 10% of China’s research publications indexed in the Web of Science database were in medical fields. By 2023, that had grown to almost 20%. “They are really going hard on medical sciences,” he says.\n\nHospitals in China now make a significant contribution to the research output published in Nature Index journals. Of the leading 200 research hospitals in the world, ranked by Share, more than one-quarter — 51 in total — are in China, second only to the United States with 69. Germany lies at third with 20. The country’s top performer overall is West China Medical Center in Chengdu, home to the medical school of Sichuan University. It is ranked ninth among the world’s leading 200 research hospitals, based on research published from 2020 to 2024, and has been rising steadily through the ranks for the past few years, up from 24th in 2019. China’s hospitals are rapidly increasing their output as well. Among the top 25 fastest-rising research hospitals globally, ranked by how much their adjusted Share increased between 2023 and 2024, 16 are in China.\n\nAreas of strength\n\nChenkai Wu, who studies global health at Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China, says that in 2024, the Chinese government launched initiatives to promote four priorities in health research, linked to China’s specific strengths and needs. These are new and emerging diseases, building on lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic; cancer and cardiovascular disease — two priorities that are growing issues in an ageing population; and rare diseases, leveraging China’s huge population. “Rare diseases are of course rare, but considering the population of China, we still have a lot of cases,” says Wu.\n\nThe initiatives are currently seeking input from the scientific community on specific research questions and its total funding has not yet been announced, says Wu, but he expects it to be worth hundreds of millions of yuan over a few years.\n\nSource: Nature Index\n\nChinese researchers are also making strides in the field of global population health, says Wu. That is partly a legacy of China’s long-standing practice of providing medical services to developing countries throughout Asia and Africa, as part of its international aid programme.\n\n“The government sent many teams overseas to provide medical aid, but until recently it didn’t involve a clear research component,” he says.\n\nIn 2013, the China Consortium of Universities for Global Health was launched by 10 leading universities in public health to build research capacity in the field, and it has since grown to 29 members. Wu and his colleagues carried out a bibliometric analysis of publications by the original 10 members between 2014 and 2020 (C. Wu et al. Glob. Health Res. Policy. 8, 10; 2023). They found that the number of publications in the field of global health that included data from outside China has steadily increased over that time, from just 10 in 2014 to 58 in 2020.\n\nThe most-studied research topic by far was chronic non-communicable diseases, totalling more publications than the next three most common topics combined. That reflects China’s “epidemiological shift” in recent years, says Wu, as the country has become better at dealing with infectious diseases while chronic illnesses become more common in the ageing population.\n\n“Over 90% of deaths in China now are due to chronic illnesses, not infectious disease,” says Wu. “So they are the national priority for public health.” Child and maternal health, neurological disorders and infectious disease were also common topics.\n\nBut Wu also found that relatively few of the studies, just 16%, involved primary data collection — most were secondary analyses of existing data sets. Of the primary studies, most had study populations in Asia and Africa. Several involved studying malaria in Myanmar and its neighbouring regions in China, whereas the African studies tended to focus on child and maternal health.\n\nThere has been a surge in interest in China in building new large data sets that can support this kind of research, with the government investing a great deal of money over the past five years, says Wu. But Chinese scientists are now facing issues that are familiar to their colleagues in the West — these data sets can be expensive and challenging to maintain over the long term. “Funding agencies are very interested in building them, but less interested in maintaining them,” says Wu.\n\nChina has also now surpassed the United States in the number of ongoing clinical trials, according to an analysis (E. H. Lee et al. J. Clin. Epidemiol. 183, 111791; 2025) co-authored by John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at Stanford University in California. China took the lead in 2019 and has maintained that lead in the years since. In 2023, China was home to 16,612 registered trials, compared with 9,100 for the United States.\n\nCancer, cardiovascular disease and metabolic diseases were prominent fields of study, but the trials cover the full gamut of medical research. “China is working on practically every disease, they’re not lagging behind in any area,” says Ioannidis.\n\nSurgery takes place at a hospital in Huai’an using an orthopaedic surgical robot. Credit: CFOTO/Sipa USA/Alamy\n\nAlthough one of the biggest issues facing sponsors of trials is increasing costs, the per-patient cost is lower in China, and is not rising as it is in the United States and elsewhere. This potentially offers new outsourcing and partnership opportunities for international sponsors, Revati Tatake, a researcher at London-based analysis firm GlobalData, told a clinical-trials industry conference in San Francisco in February.\n\nCurrently, however, China is involved in relatively few international trials conducted across multiple sites. Most of its trials are single-centre studies conducted only in China — with 70% run by sponsor companies based in the country.\n\n“That doesn’t mean they’re not trustworthy, but they are less likely to be the pivotal trials that change the health-care landscape internationally,” says Ioannidis. “At the very top, China is not challenging the US just yet.”\n\nThese shifts in research output towards China are likely to accelerate in the coming years, as the Trump administration’s cuts to science agencies such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) begin to bite.\n\nFor example, many grants from the NIH have been abruptly cancelled for political reasons. The future of the agency also looks bleak — the Trump administration is proposing that the NIH’s budget be cut by almost 40% next fiscal year and its 27 institutes consolidated into just 8.\n\n“It is a loss to the US, but also a loss to patients of the whole world,” says Rao. “Fortunately, the cut in the US coincides with some dramatic increases in Chinese support for science and medical research.”\n\nRao says that if the United States keeps cutting back on funding then China will eventually be able to pick up the slack. “It will take a while for China to pick up all that is cut by the US,” he says — perhaps 10 or 20 years — but if the cuts continued he would be “confident that China will surpass the current level of US support for medical research”.\n\nPersistent problems\n\nDespite the rise of China’s research hospitals in international rankings such as the Nature Index, some of the country’s medical institutions have a spotty reputation when it comes to research quality and integrity.\n\nA Nature analysis found that Chinese hospitals and medical schools dominate the list of institutions that had the greatest proportion of their research output retracted between 2014 and 2024 (see Nature 638, 596–599; 2025). Retractions can represent attempts to correct unintentional errors, but they can also be a result of fraud and misconduct. The top three spots in the Nature analysis, and seven of the top ten, were all taken by hospitals in China, although there was no overlap with institutions topping the Nature Index.",

          "authors": "Séverine Toussaert",
          "abstract": "The open-science movement has promoted the sharing of scientific protocols, statistical-analysis programs and data files. These efforts have undoubtedly made it easier to see how researchers come to their conclusions. But methods and findings are just the tip of the iceberg. Research often involves a long journey, during which scientists reassess their expectations, pivot and adapt to unexpected challenges and constraints. All too often, this is hidden from view.\n\nIs my study useless? Why researchers need methodological review boards\n\nI vividly remember the first experiment I conducted for my PhD in economics, investigating the conditions under which trust forms between strangers. I had built a solid theoretical framework, designed the experiment — in which students played a trust game — carefully, and optimistically named my database ‘AwesomeData’. But when I ran my first sessions, the results made no sense. My participants weren’t behaving as theory — or even common sense — would suggest, because my set-up made the task too confusing.\n\nThe fall was hard. Despite all my preparation, no one had told me what the research process looks like. The project ended up going through many iterations, a completely redesigned experiment and six rejections from journals before a paper was published. These setbacks remain invisible to anyone reading the final manuscript.\n\nFor science to be truly open, we need to pay more attention to these twists and turns, which happen in all research. Not disclosing this information causes three key problems.\n\nFirst, it prevents readers of research from properly understanding a project’s robustness and generalizability. In some fields, small pilot tests are used to fine-tune an experiment’s design — such as showing that a programme works only if participants receive incentives, or if a message is phrased in a particular way. Details of these pilots (and so the lessons learnt) rarely appear in print. Policymakers might then assume that the intervention can be scaled up regardless of incentives or wording.\n\nImpact factors are outdated, but new research assessments still fail scientists\n\nSecond, lack of disclosure stops other researchers from learning how to work more efficiently and invest their resources wisely. This can exacerbate inequities. Researchers with sparse social networks can struggle to access the informal knowledge held by veterans in their field, yet this is easier for well-connected researchers, who often come from wealthier regions or groups.\n\nFinally, sharing the trial-and-error aspects of research matters for mental health. Humans have a hard time learning from missing evidence — the ‘what you see is all there is’ phenomenon described by psychologist Daniel Kahneman. Hiding failures can lead researchers to overestimate how much others succeed, fuelling impostor syndrome.",

          "authors": "Carlos Garcia-Soto",
          "abstract": "The sea bed holds vast reserves of cobalt, nickel and other minerals, yet no international rules govern how such extraction might proceed or how its impacts should be contained. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is mandated to set those rules, but in its July session, it failed to agree on a mining code. Meanwhile, 30 contracts for resource exploration remain in force and are edging closer to industrial extraction. This contradiction is not accidental. It stems from how the authority works — licensing first, restraining later. Transparency and independent review are needed to restore the balance.\n\nGuess how much of the ocean floor humans have explored\n\nDecision-making is concentrated in the ISA Council, which is responsible for rule-making, licensing and oversight. In other multilateral policy settings, guardianship and licensing are separated and public reporting is mandatory. The council deliberates mainly in closed sessions. Scientists and civil-society representatives can attend as observers, but rule 75 restricts them to a seat without a vote — they are present in the room, yet absent from the decision-making.\n\nThree structural gaps currently erode the ISA’s credibility as a body to govern the sea bed on behalf of all humankind. A representation gap: decisions are dominated by states with mining interests, whereas nations without mining capacity — and independent scientists and civil-society groups — remain marginal. A mandate gap: safeguards are applied mainly as formalities, with weak links to science. And a legitimacy gap: baseline data produced largely by contractors are subject to little independent review or oversight — unlike in other governance regimes such as regional fisheries bodies or the International Whaling Commission.\n\nThese gaps date back to the 1990s, when the ISA’s architecture was designed — before deep-sea ecosystems were understood, before biodiversity was recognized as a pillar of sustainable development and before transparency became a norm in multilateral negotiations. The ISA was established in 1994 under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) with a dual mandate: to safeguard the sea bed as humanity’s common heritage and to regulate its exploitation for the benefit of all. Three decades on, that balance has tilted towards exploitation, with the authority pressed to consider mining applications before binding rules or environmental standards exist.\n\nFive priorities for a sustainable ocean economy\n\nIn July 2021, the state of Nauru triggered a clause in UNCLOS obliging the ISA to finalize a mining code within two years. When no code was adopted by July 2023, this period’s expiry entitled states to submit applications in the rules’ absence. Although negotiations and drafting of the code have advanced since, progress on environmental baselines and benefit-sharing mechanisms has stalled. In practice, the precautionary principle has been applied unevenly across ISA sessions, reflecting divergent legal interpretations, standards of evidence and political alignments.\n\nNorway’s January 2024 vote to allow exploratory sea-bed mining has heightened environmental concerns. Moreover, independent research usually arrives too late to shape outcomes, whereas data generated by contractors dominate the evidence base and raise doubts about independence. Proposals to embed independent review in ISA procedures have repeatedly stalled, leaving trust in the authority’s decisions fragile.\n\nThree gates would give the ISA enforceable checkpoints before any mining licence is granted. These focus squarely on institutional reform, not on individuals or countries, and would help the ISA to fulfil its mandate.",

          "title": "Public trust in science has declined since COVID — virologists need to unite around safety standards",
          "authors": "Melanie Ott, Olivier Schwartz, Alex Sigal",
          "abstract": "In an opinion piece published in The New York Times in March, two leading virologists argued that experiments on a coronavirus found in bats and similar to those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) had been conducted without sufficient safety measures. The experiments involved infecting human cells with the live bat virus to see how the virus behaved1.\n\nRegulatory authorities in many countries where research on potentially dangerous viruses is conducted, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, would require such studies to be conducted in biosafety level (BSL) 3 or 4 facilities. (There are four biosafety levels, with BSL-4 being the most stringent.) But for these experiments — which were approved by the equivalent authorities in China — the 25 researchers across 7 institutes and universities in China (including the Guangzhou National Laboratory and the Wuhan Institute of Virology) used BSL-2 procedures. They also used a negative pressure ventilation system designed to prevent microorganisms from spreading outside the laboratory.\n\nIn our view, this work and the discussion it has provoked highlights a broader and growing problem that the entire virology community needs to address. On the one hand, the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases is growing2,3 (see ‘A growing threat’), making investigations of potentially dangerous viruses more important. On the other hand, since the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in virology and science more broadly has declined and work on viruses has become more politicized.\n\nTo improve trust in science — and to ensure that essential work on viruses can continue — international, standardized and transparent biosafety guidance is urgently needed. Here, we lay out how such guidance might be developed.\n\nSource: Ref. 6\nPatchwork regulation\n\nOver the past 30–40 years, various protocols and procedures have been introduced to reduce the risk of viruses escaping from labs, or of people being infected by viruses used in research.\n\nToday, researchers in many countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States, can work on certain ‘dangerous’ viruses only if they use biosafety cabinets, personal protective equipment and strict standardized procedures for BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities. The use of negative pressure, which ensures that the air in a facility leaves through a filter that captures pathogens, and strict controls over access to the facility are also required.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nWhich viruses qualify as dangerous is decided by the government of each country, and is usually listed as an appendix to the regulations governing the work. In the United States, federal funding for research involving the enhancement of viruses that cause influenza, MERS and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — whether through the use of genetic manipulation or by harnessing natural evolutionary processes — was banned in 2014. The ban was lifted in 2017, but research is only permitted after a stringent review process and with the use of BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities4. These rules are likely to change again under the current US administration.\n\nIn China, national biosafety laws were updated in 2004 and 2020. These require investigators undertaking studies on potentially pathogenic living organisms to use BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities, among other strict precautions5. It is unclear exactly how these rules are enforced, however. They don’t seem to have been applied to the experiments on the MERS-like coronavirus found in bats, which were approved by the Wuhan Institute of Virology institutional biosafety committee.\n\nThe level of detail included in regulations also varies. For example, Canada uses the Canadian Biosafety Standard, which lays out exactly how containment is to be achieved. The United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union, Australia and New Zealand have similar standards. Many other countries, however, do not provide such detailed information, although they might provide details of the containment levels necessary for certain pathogens.\n\nAvian influenza viruses can infect and spread among domestic poultry, including chickens.Credit: Andres Kudacki/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nThis patchwork regulation has led to confusion in the field. And the lack of transparency has probably made it easier for people to spread misinformation and fake news around the handling of live viruses in research.\n\nMore than five years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the controversy about its origins shows no sign of abating. According to the lab-leak theory (now promoted by the administration of US President Donald Trump), research on bat viruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led to the accidental infection of lab personnel, which in turn sparked the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the institute is known to have been doing research on coronaviruses before the pandemic, there is no firm evidence that it possessed or conducted work on a SARS-CoV-2 precursor virus. Meanwhile, findings indicating that the pandemic resulted from a natural ‘spillover’ event, the epicentre of which was the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, continue to accumulate. (A spillover event is the transmission of what is called a zoonotic virus from other animals to humans.)\n\nTrump freezes ‘gain of function’ pathogen research ― threatening all US virology, critics say\n\nIn our experience, virologists are often reluctant to engage in discussions about work that involves the enhancement of live viruses — either genetically or through natural evolutionary processes — for fear of being caught in the crosshairs or of their own work being shut down, even if it is low risk. But now is not the time to lie low.\n\nThe number of outbreaks and deaths caused by viruses such as those that cause SARS, Ebola and mpox has been increasing. Data scientists predict that, if current trends continue, Nipah virus, Machupo virus, coronaviruses and filoviruses will, compared with 2020, cause 4 times as many spillover events and 12 times as many deaths by 2050 because of global travel, climate change, tropical deforestation, and wild-animal hunting and trade6,7.\n\nAnd although virologists now have various ways of studying viruses that can spread between animals and humans, besides growing fully functional zoonotic viruses in the lab, experiments involving live viruses are key to testing antiviral drugs and vaccines. It’s hard to imagine how it would have been possible for researchers to develop COVID-19 vaccines, for instance — estimated to have saved millions of lives since 2021 — without studies on live SARS-CoV-2 (and earlier work on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) in animal models.\n\nGiven the crisis of mistrust in science and institutions, and an increasingly fractured geopolitical world, unified international guidelines are crucial for protecting essential research involving dangerous viruses.\n\nA global standard\n\nCentralized, standardized guidelines would be analogous to the guidelines for research on human embryos produced by the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) — an organization that includes investigators in more than 80 countries. They would be similar to national regulations for research on dangerous viruses, but on a global level. They could lay out what factors might make the use of a particular virus or approach high risk or what benefit-to-cost ratio might justify a research project being pursued or blocked, for example.\n\nSome scenarios should not be allowed to happen. If an investigator is working on the H5N1 bird flu virus in a BSL-3 facility, for instance, they should take strict precautions to prevent viral strains that cause human seasonal flu from entering the facility, even though seasonal flu is not considered a dangerous virus. This is because strains of flu virus can exchange RNA fragments. Such exchange could make H5N1 more transmissible in humans.",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "FlyBase, a database for the model organism Drosophila, has lost government funding. Credit: Konstantin Nechaev/Alamy\n\nA key repository for the world’s fruit-fly research community became an unexpected casualty of Harvard University’s continuing conflict with the administration of US President Donald Trump. In May, the administration froze more than US$2.2 billion in federal funds that were awarded to the university, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant that supported the repository, called FlyBase. Harvard University, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, filed a lawsuit to end the funding freeze, and the case has been making its way through the courts.\n\nBut the damage to FlyBase was immediate and extensive. Its eight staff members were laid off — including database curators Sian Gramates and Victoria Jenkins, both at Harvard — and subawards that funded collaborators at three other universities also disappeared. Gramates has been at FlyBase for more than 20 years, and was looking forward to retiring. Jenkins says she is now seeking opportunities outside science. When they depart, they will take with them decades of institutional knowledge about one of the best-studied model organisms in biology, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nUS Supreme Court allows NIH to cut $2 billion in research grant\n\nFlyBase’s situation is unique, but it’s not the only resource that’s struggling. Similar model organism databases (MODs) exist for mice, rats, zebrafish, yeast, frogs, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Collectively, these repositories — which support hundreds of thousands of researchers between them — have underpinned decades of scientific discoveries and served as hubs for their research communities. All of them have been heavily supported by the NIH, and now, they face losing that funding owing to broad cuts to federal research support, prompting lay-offs and disruptions that risk setting back basic science.\n\n“It’s hard to overstate the value of these resources and the teams overseeing their curation, which is truly what makes them such valuable tools,” says Jenkins. “Without them, it’s hard to imagine research continuing at anything near the pace and quality we’ve seen in the past.”\n\nThe MOD squad\n\nSince the early 1990s, as advances in sequencing technology created gluts of new information in need of curating, MODs have emerged as authorities for the genomes of their individual species. These websites typically contain curated, annotated data on gene function and expression, phenotypic alleles and variants, human-disease associations and protein interactions — as well as community resources such as researcher directories and forums. Despite their importance, a preprint published last month noted that such centralized repositories might be vulnerable, partly owing to shifting political or funding priorities1.\n\nIn 2016, the NIH launched an effort to consolidate eight of these repositories into a single flagship organization, the Alliance of Genome Resources, reasoning that housing these MODs together would unify their information and infrastructure and make them easier to use. Each member group was given until 2029 to migrate their data and was told that their funding would diminish over time. Now, with less than five years to go and amid a period of scientific upheaval in the United States, MOD leadership is facing a daunting challenge.\n\nMany MODs have integrated only a small portion of their data into the Alliance — in some cases, less than 10%, sources say. Part of the issue, says Stacia Engel, the project manager at the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), who is based at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, is that harmonizing so much information isn’t trivial. Each group has different needs, data types and protocols, and researchers have failed to reach a consensus for a single, unified vision for the Alliance.\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAs funding has been siphoned away, the problem has compounded: MODs cannot retain their staff, and with fewer staff, data integration becomes harder. Meanwhile, the total amount from individual grants that each MOD currently receives is not being allocated in full to the Alliance, which faces its own cuts. “We simply don’t have enough time or resources to make things happen as effectively as we would like,” says Carol Bult, a geneticist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and a co-principal investigator of the Alliance and principal investigator of the Mouse Genome Informatics database.\n\nIn the interim, some MODs have put out calls for donations, considered enforcing what were previously voluntary fees for using the platforms or ceased operations. The nematode database WormBase, launched in 2000, announced that October would mark its last major update so that it could dedicate itself fully to integrating into the Alliance, whereas the SGD noted in a newsletter in April that cuts from the NIH were continuing to “strain” its finances. (Representatives at both the SGD and WormBase say they have also lost staff or had to cut ties with collaborators owing to budget cuts.)\n\n“You can see that everyone is scrambling to make ends meet,” Engel says. “In some ways it feels like we’ve been handed an impossible task.”",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "AI agents can help with literature reviews, handling data sets and writing code.Credit: sanjeri/Getty\n\nMillions of people consult chatbots every day. But artificial intelligence (AI) advocates are betting that ‘AI agents’ are the application of this technology that will impact society the most.\n\nAgentic AI involves using a large language model (LLM) to carry out multi-step tasks, by connecting it to external tools such as Internet browsers or coding suites. The hope is that AI assistants can be created that simplify real-world tasks. In science, some think that AI agents — perhaps even several working together — will not just save time, but also eventually run their own experiments and generate knowledge.\n\nAI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool\n\nBut this dream is not yet a reality. Although access to AI agents is already being sold by technology firms, many such agents are either limited in scope or exist in beta versions that require significant human oversight. Because they are based on LLMs, which are, at heart, statistical prediction machines, they are prone to making mistakes known as hallucinations. In a trial earlier this year by Anthropic in San Francisco, California, to see whether its agent Claudius could run a vending-machine-based shop, the agent conjured up fake bank account details and sold some items at a loss.\n\nNature spoke to researchers developing, evaluating and using AI agents to find out how scientists can make use of the bots and mitigate the risks.\n\nWhat is an AI agent?\n\nResearchers already use automated tools, for example, citation managers that organize and format references, and workflow packages that process and analyse data. But AI agents are different. Rather than follow prescribed instructions for each task, agents use LLMs to make and refine plans on the fly for a variety of multi-step goals. Unlike lone LLMs, they also harness tools to take actions in the real world — for instance, to write and run code or navigate databases — with some interacting with each other and using working memory to remember user preferences and previous actions.\n\nWhat can they do?\n\nStreamlining everyday research tasks is one goal. “In my group, every PhD student now has their own AI agent that effectively serves as a research assistant,” says Marinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. These home-made agents help Zitnik’s team to perform low-stakes tasks, such as curating data sets, turning text into tables and writing certain pieces of code, she says.\n\nWe need a new ethics for a world of AI agents\n\nOne appealing application of agents lies in using them to emulate the collaboration of several researchers with different expertise. An example is the AI ‘tumour board’ being developed by Microsoft. In this case, agents, each with access to different data sets and training, interact to mimic the deliberations of the multidisciplinary team that determines an individual treatment plan for a person with cancer. Because tumour boards are usually formed only for patients with the most complicated cases, using health-care agents to assist clinicians could allow personalized care to be provided for more people, says Ece Kumar, who leads the AI Frontiers laboratory at Microsoft Research, based in Redmond, Washington. (In a statement in May, Microsoft said that its health-care AI models were intended for research use and were not to be deployed in clinical settings “as-is”.)\n\nCan AI agents help to make discoveries?\n\nThis is an idea that excites researchers, but the answer remains unclear. Google and many other firms and academic groups have developed ‘co-scientist’ agents, which generate hypotheses by looking for hidden insights in existing data. The co-scientist uses multiple agents to, for example, evolve and improve ideas, or test them against each other.\n\nZitnik and her colleagues are also exploiting an agent’s ability to access live data and ‘reason’ on the basis of that data, in drug discovery. In unpublished work, they used an AI agent to tap into and analyse data on clinical trials, on adverse effects and in regulatory documents, to look for drugs that have protective effects against diseases they were not prescribed for. They found, for example, that people with diabetes who were given dapagliflozin had a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s disease later in life than those who were not prescribed it. The team is also running in silico ‘clinical trials’ using electronic health records to test hypotheses, she says.\n\nWhat kind of expertise do you need?\n\nFor simple uses such as literature reviews, agentic AI already exists as packages that “anybody can use”, says Doug Downey, an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (Ai2) in Seattle, Washington. Although more advanced systems require machine-learning expertise, some researchers are trying to democratize access. Zitnik and her colleagues are developing ToolUniverse, an open online environment that allows researchers to connect LLMs to commonly used tools in different scientific domains, using only natural language commands. This should “make AI agents more broadly accessible to other fields and scientists who do not write code”, she says.\n\nHow well do agents work?\n\nThe ultimate agent — one that can get anything done autonomously in a reliable way — is “almost an artificial general intelligence problem”, says Kumar. “We are far from having those agents.” But researchers are attempting to benchmark how well agents perform now.\n\nHow AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",

Experience is often seen as key, with success coming from years of knowledge building and collaboration. This is certainly true for most Nobel Prize laureates, who have an average age of 58.\n\nHowever, research teams with high fractions of beginners — authors with no prior publication history — tend to be more disruptive and innovative, found a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 12 September1.\n\nActively integrating beginners into research groups could boost the disruptive and innovative qualities of the work by having fewer collaborators who are burdened by knowledge, the authors say. “Beginner scientists have less loyalty to prevailing assumptions, and they can take more intellectual freedom,” says co-author Raiyan Abdul Baten, a computational social scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\n\nCan creativity in science be learnt? These researchers think so\n\nBeginner’s charm\n\nThis pattern was first noticed by researchers during a study of whether artificial intelligence can predict how innovative and disruptive a paper will be in its scientific domain2. In the new study, the team analysed more than 28 million articles from SciSciNet-v2, a data lake for the science of science research. These scientific papers spanned 146 fields and were published between 1971 and 2021.\n\nDisruption scores were calculated by comparing how many citations a paper has garnered compared with the papers that it referenced. A disruptive paper that was cited more times than were the papers it referenced could, for example, disprove an established theory and offer an alternative hypothesis.\n\nDuring the analysis, Baten and his colleagues noticed a link between a paper’s disruptiveness and the number of beginner authors, which led them to partition data by authors’ ‘career age’ — defined as the number of years since their first publication. Beginner authors were those with no previous publications.\n\nThey were surprised to find that papers with a higher proportion of beginner authors tended to be more disruptive than were papers with more early-career or senior authors. Disruption scores were highest when beginners made up the entire team, but they were also high when beginners were paired with co-authors with track records of producing disruptive work. Papers with the highest ratio of beginner authors consistently showed a positive correlation between disruption and citation count.\n\n“As the fraction of beginners increases in teams, the disruptivity and innovation go up,” says Baten. “Across team sizes, decades and disciplines, we found these results to be robust,” he adds.\n\nWhat makes a good PhD student?\n\nDiversity boosts scientific progress\n\nWhy do collaborations with more beginners tend to be more disruptive? The researchers speculate that these scientists offer new perspectives because they are less attached to previous theories and knowledge than are their more experienced colleagues. “Sometimes, it is difficult to unlearn the prevailing assumptions then adopt radically new ones,” says Baten. This could allow early-career scientists to be more receptive to new ideas and more likely to take risks by exploring experimental approaches, he says.",

It was co-founded by New Zealander Reagan Jarvis, a physician and biochemist who is now the company’s chief executive, and Mikael  Blomqvist, a Swedish entrepreneur who sits on the board of directors. Jarvis describes how they chose a name that, to them, felt memorable and distinctive, but “not too sciencey”. This is the fourth article in a six-part series about company names and how they came about.\n\nIn 2013, when we decided to set up our company, naming it was one of the first steps we took. At the time, I was at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany, doing my second postdoctoral placement; my first had been in New Zealand, where I did my PhD. A Swedish colleague introduced me to Mikael Blomqvist, a serial entrepreneur who has built a lot of companies.\n\nMikael and I talked about the business concept behind the company, which was to create a purpose-built platform to decipher T-cell immunity. At that point, it was just an idea on paper: it wasn’t going to be a spin-off or an incremental adaptation of existing laboratory methodologies.\n\nWe wrote a business plan, and all that stuff, but in parallel, we initiated a branding strategy with a small Swedish communications firm called Milou, based in Karlskrona, which Mikael had used previously. I quit my job and moved to Sweden in December 2013.\n\nWhy a silly-sounding name suits the serious mission of our biotech spin-off\n\nWe were quite methodical in the name-selection process. We wanted something that would be memorable and that would roll off the tongue. We wanted a name that would look nice, generate positive feelings and be distinctive.\n\nWe had a longlist of ten contenders — including Genevie and Genovia, reflecting the strong focus on genetics behind the company. I personally didn’t like these, because I thought they were too sciencey. I think something distinctive, unique, was the right way to go.\n\nThere was a very memorable moment when we decided to prioritize a name that started with an ‘A’. Published research1 had shown a benefit to starting a name with a letter that occurs early in the alphabet, so we decided to apply that concept to the company name.\n\nOnce we’d decided to start with an ‘A’, we wanted to end with an 'A', too, to make the name soft and approachable. And we wanted to have a double consonant in the middle.\n\nWe also wanted a name that had a sort of symmetry, and that’s when we came up with Anocca. Although not palindromic, the word has the visual appearance of a palindrome, particularly with the font we selected for the branding.\n\nAnocca is a made-up name with no direct scientific or technical meaning (from our own investigations, we couldn’t see that it had any meaning in any language). It was selected on the basis of cognitive-recall principles (designed to aid memorability), and we tested it among ourselves, and with friends and family.\n\nThe business of science",

But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nIn March 2020, just before borders closed and labs were shuttered by the COVID-19 pandemic, around 100 scientists gathered in Kampala to discuss forming a pan-African research consortium. Their idea: what if Africa’s many longitudinal population studies — some of which have been running for decades — could be brought together?\n\nAlthough Africa is home to more than 1.5 billion people and has some of the world’s most pressing health challenges, those at the meeting felt the reach and impact of its population studies were less powerful than they could be.\n\nThat meeting marked the beginning of the African Population Cohorts Consortium (APCC), an initiative designed to connect and strengthen large-scale longitudinal studies across the continent. The 60-plus studies within the consortium, from 16 countries, have already contributed to important evidence-based health-care policies — from the first measles vaccine trials in Senegal to the roll out of malaria bed nets in The Gambia — but until now, they’ve remained largely siloed.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nMany cohorts have contributed a great deal to science, but their potential is far from fully realized,” says Kobus Herbst, interim steering committee co-chair and director of population health at the Africa Health Research Institute, based in Durban, South Africa.\n\nThe consortium was supported in its early stages by charitable funders the Wellcome Trust, based in London, and the Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, as well as the UK Medical Research Council. In 2024, Wellcome awarded £4 million (US$5.37 million) to establish a permanent secretariat, hosted by the Science for Africa (SFA) Foundation in Nairobi, and to launch the consortium’s first initiatives.\n\n“Wellcome has a long history of supporting health-data platforms such as longitudinal population studies,” says Victoria Pelly, a senior research manager at Wellcome. “Although we fund some in lower- and middle-income countries, a lot of the large-scale studies are still based in high-income countries.” Wellcome’s support for the APCC was driven “by a recognition that there’s a wealth of research capacity and context-specific data on the African continent that’s underutilized”, she adds.\n\nThe APCC’s blueprint, which sets out its goals, governance structures and priorities, was developed by a team led by Herbst and Evelyn Gitau, chief scientific officer at the SFA Foundation, and has been endorsed by the teams and institutions running the studies.\n\nEach cohort study has a seat on a members council, which elects the steering committee. A separate participant forum makes sure that communities involved in the cohorts have a role in shaping research priorities. Delegates from each cohort meet to share views on the research planned and how it’s carried out.\n\nDorcas Kamuya, another co-chair of the interim steering committee, is keen to emphasize the importance of the participant forum as a way of directing the research. “We’re creating a platform informed by values we hold dear — friendship, reciprocity, togetherness,” she says. “It’s essential we don’t undermine them as we build systems.”\n\nKey facts: African Population Cohorts Consortium\n\nStudy name: African Population Cohorts Consortium (APCC).\n\nNumber of participants: Brings together 67 African studies, covering around 6 million people.\n\nPopulation being studied: Populations across the African continent, with a focus on diverse geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, including rural and underserved communities.\n\nData collected: Data vary by cohort but includes demographic, health, environmental, behavioural and — in some cases — biological and genomic data.\n\nLaunch year: Formally initiated in 2020.\n\nDuration: Ongoing initiative building on existing cohort studies, many of which have been running for years or decades.\n\nFunding: Initial funding that culminated in the APCC Blueprint was around £1 million (US$1.35 million), with the bulk coming from the Wellcome Trust and additional contributions from the Gates Foundation and UK Medical Research Council. In 2024, Wellcome awarded £4 million to establish a permanent secretariat and launch the consortium’s first initiatives.\n\nThe APCC has already actively engaged 67 existing studies, which together represent data from around 6 million participants. Most are Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) studies — long-running observations that track births, deaths and migrations in certain communities to monitor population health over time. Others include birth cohorts that follow children from infancy, genomic studies looking at genetic and environmental risk factors, and platforms that host clinical trials in everyday settings.\n\nMany of these studies operate in under-resourced settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 64% of countries in Africa lack the capacity to accurately count and register births and deaths. Health data availability and quality remain insufficient in many countries in the region, it says. “These cohorts provide ideal environments to engage with communities, involve them in the science, and build capacity of young data scientists and epidemiologists in Africa,” says Herbst.\n\nThat’s another goal of the APCC creators: to expand opportunities for African researchers. “One of the things I hope to see is a large cohort of African scientists whose careers have been launched through this work,” Herbst says. “People who’ve done their master’s projects using cohort data, completed their PhDs within these studies, and gone on to postdocs and beyond.”\n\nAs well as a way of bringing the science together, collaborating scientists say the APCC acts as a research community, where the cohort researchers and institutions can share results with others in the field, get inspiration on questions to pursue and identify follow-up collaborations and funding opportunities. Herbst adds that the APCC can also “amplify their voices to have policy impact on the continent”, for example by pooling results or testing whether findings from one study apply in another region of Africa.\n\nTo guide those collaborations and to inform its own future funding calls, the APCC has set out three strategic research programmes: health across the life course, climate and health, and universal health coverage.\n\nSource: Ramsey, M., Crampin, A. C., Bawah, A. A., Gitau, E. & Herbst, K. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Data Sci. 7, 277–294 (2024).\n\nTesfahun Melese, coordinator of the Dabat Research Centre in Gondar, Ethiopia, says being part of the APCC has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and capacity-building. The centre, based at the University of Gondar, runs three HDSS sites in the region, tracking data on indicators such as births, deaths and migration. “Being a member of the APCC, we can disseminate our research and data to the scientific community,” he says. “We can collaborate with other HDSS sites, get support for data management and analysis, co-write papers, and apply for grants together. That makes a big difference.”\n\nThrough connections made at an APCC event, Melese is setting up a partnership with another surveillance site in South Africa to do a study of youth employability, which is in the stages of securing funding from the Mastercard Foundation, a charitable Canadian funder supporting young people in Africa and Indigenous young people in Canada.",

I guessed he hadn’t slept in a comfortable bed or had a decent meal in a long time — just like me; just like everyone else.\n\nBut when he saw me, the terror on his face faded, to be replaced by a sense of relief, a kind of peace.\n\nI understood why.\n\nI saw myself in his eyes: a 14-year-old girl. A victim of the colonizers. A child who posed no threat.\n\nSixty days ago\n\nThe alien colonizers arrived on Earth, bringing guns, carriers, cannons — and the nanobot plague. The nanobots burrowed into our bodies through our spinal cords, roaming inside us, slowly eating us from the inside out.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“These nanobots will torment you,” the colonizers said, “until only one of you remains. Then they will stop.”\n\nWe understood — they wanted us to kill each other.\n\nThat way, the colonizers didn’t have to risk fighting us directly. They only had to wait, and then reap the benefits.\n\nThe adults exchanged glances, seeing the same thing in each other’s eyes — eyes like those of wolves.\n\nPeople are willing to pay any price to survive.\n\nNow\n\nI am the last survivor.\n\nThe colonizers have taken me aboard their mothership.\n\nThey have no homeland. They merely drift through the Universe, searching for a place to stay awhile. Like locusts, they devour everything in their path before moving on to the next world.\n\nI stand before the Chief Governor as it scrutinizes me, its eyes filled with doubt.\n\nThis is the first time they have brought the survivor onto their mothership. I suppose because I am a just harmless child.\n\n“The nanobots never make mistakes. You are indeed the last survivor.” The Governor’s voice is sharp and surprised. “But you are just a weak child. How did you kill everyone else and live to the end?”\n\nI refuse to kneel. Instead, I meet its gaze head-on.\n\nLike all the other colonizers, the Governor resembles a jellyfish, with a small, stunted body. I am only 14 — a mere child — yet I tower above it.\n\nThe Governor shrinks into its throne, shifting uncomfortably.\n\nI stand here a slave, a prisoner — yet, somehow, it feels as though I am the one looking down on it.\n\nI say, “We possess a power you cannot comprehend.”\n\nNow\n\nTo study my power, they keep me aboard the ship.\n\nBut they are lax in guarding me — because I am no threat, because they have won the war with ease and are now busy enjoying the spoils of their victory.\n\nAnd so, I wander freely around the ship.\n\nAt last, I find what I need: a hidden room, large enough to contain a complete set of reproductive equipment.\n\nSixty days ago\n\nPeople were willing to pay any price to survive, not through slaughtering one another, but by sacrificing for each other.\n\nAfter a selection process, millions of test subjects were sent to the lab. There, a DNA sequence was added to their genetic code — one that would be passed down through generations. This sequence contained trillions of strings, representing the genetic code of all humanity.\n\nAfter the experiment, only 1,000 participants survived. Of those, only 23 showed no rejection of the modification. I was one of those 23.\n\nDay after day, I witnessed people sacrificing themselves — first my grandmother and grandfather, then my father and mother.

          "abstract": "After looking for words that rhymed with lime, Sublime was the immediate and obvious winner.Credit: Mikhail Glabets\nThe meaning behind our moniker\n\nSublime Systems, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, has developed a way to manufacture ‘clean’ cement using an electrochemical process which improves efficiency, durability and aesthetics, and avoids the carbon release caused by conventional production. The firm was set up in 2020 and now has more than 100 employees. In the penultimate article of a six-part series about science company names and how to choose them, co-founder and chief executive Leah Ellis reveals how she came up with Sublime Systems.\n\nFor about 18 months, I was doing my postdoc at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, working on what was to become Sublime Systems. At that point, my co-founder, Yet-Ming Chiang, a materials scientist at MIT, engineer and serial entrepreneur, recognized it was the right time to spin it off from the university as a start-up company. At that stage, it needed a name.\n\nIn my view, coming up with a name is both important, because it sets the tone, and not important. The name is just a label.\n\nThe key reactive ingredient in cement — and the most carbon intensive — is lime, calcium oxide. So, I started there, browsing a rhyming dictionary for words that rhymed with lime. Sublime was the immediate and obvious winner.\n\nIn contrast to the grey cement made through the conventional process of burning limestone with bituminous coal, the manufacturing process we use to create cement results in a whiter version that is more purified, consistent in terms of both colour and quality, and beautiful.\n\nI felt that the word Sublime encapsulated the spirit of excellence, transcendence and purity that we intend to exemplify as we build a technology and a company that we hope will change the world — and the inherent properties of cement itself.\n\nEveryone quickly agreed on the name; it wasn’t a contentious decision. There was no ‘back and forth’, no other candidates. It immediately jumped out.\n\nStriving for the sublime\n\nWe added ‘Systems’ because Sublime had already been taken by a cupcake company. But there was a second, more meaningful reason: our technology takes rocks and breaks them into their constituent minerals. That ‘Systems’ is plural is important. Although we’re addressing cement first, we hope that this technology can be applied to mining broadly, to process minerals from sources in which they were previously inaccessible, such as industrial wastes. So that is why the name references multiple systems — first, for cement manufacturing, and others in the future, such as sourcing material from incinerated electronic devices.\n\nSome people, even those in the cement business, don’t get the meaning right away, and only months later do they understand. I think that’s kind of fun. Others are confused because there’s no sublimation in our process. But I do think that it’s evocative of something that transcends.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder before the age of six tend to have different traits from those who are diagnosed later in life.Credit: Matt Roth for The Washington Post/Getty\n\nThe age at which a person is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is sometimes linked to their genetic make-up and their risk of developing mental-health conditions, according to an analysis of behavioural and genetic data1. Children who are diagnosed early — typically before six years old — are more likely to experience social and behavioural challenges during infancy and early childhood, whereas those who are diagnosed later experience higher rates of conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression.\n\nDifferences in genetic profiles seem to account for about 11% of this distinction. The findings, published today in Nature, counter previous assumptions that later diagnoses occur mainly in children who exhibit milder autistic traits overall, or who experience delays in diagnosis owing to social factors, such as access to health care, says Varun Warrier, who studies neurodevelopment at the University of Cambridge, UK, and is a lead author on the study.\n\nGestational diabetes linked to autism in study: what scientists say\n\nBut the results do not mean that autistic people fall neatly into two categories, he adds. “What we are looking at are the averages underlying these groups,” he says. And the age at diagnosis is an imperfect proxy for the developmental and genetic differences the study found: factors such as delays in accessing health care can still have a big effect.\n\nThe findings could spark further research to improve diagnoses and better personalize support for autistic people, Warrier adds. “The more you understand about a condition and what gives rise to the risk for it, the better your understanding of how to diagnose it and how to treat it,” says Elliot Tucker-Drob, who studies developmental psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nNo single cause\n\nAutism is a complex condition that affects brain development and can cause repetitive behaviours and difficulties with social communication. There is no single cause of autism. Last week, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr called the search for genetic drivers of the condition “entirely fruitless”, but, in fact, researchers have found the heritabilty of autism to be about 80%.\n\nThose genetic factors, and the traits that they influence, are extraordinarily diverse. “It’s been such a challenge to really parse the genetics of autism,” says Natalie Sauerwald, who studies genomics at the Flatiron Institute in New York City. In one study published this year, for example, Sauerwald and her colleagues incorporated data on nearly 240 characteristics of autism, including behavioural traits2. “It’s not exactly a two-question questionnaire,” she says.\n\nDiagnostic patterns\n\nWarrier’s research into this complexity began with a simple question: why are some children diagnosed with autism at a young age, and others diagnosed later, sometimes well into adolescence or beyond?\n\n‘I am not a broken version of normal’ — autistic people argue for a stronger voice in research\n\nThis has often been attributed to social factors, such as cultural stigmas around autism or a lack of access to care, that delays diagnosis, says Warrier. Another explanation has been that early diagnoses might occur in people whose autistic traits are more pronounced, whereas later diagnoses could reflect milder challenges that are not noticed as quickly.",

          "title": "AI is dreaming up millions of new materials. Are they any good?",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "When the pioneering artificial intelligence (AI) firm Google DeepMind announced almost two years ago that it had used a deep-learning AI technique to discover 2.2 million new crystalline materials, it seemed to herald a thrilling new era of accelerated materials research1.\n\nComposed of elements from across the periodic table, the materials in the trove included 52,000 simulations of layered compounds similar to the wonder material graphene, 528 potential lithium-ion conductors that might be used to improve rechargeable batteries, and much more.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nBut the effort — and similar ones that followed, involving the technology firms Microsoft and Meta — quickly came under fire from researchers who say that some of the compounds that the AI systems dreamed up were unoriginal, unfeasible or not fit for purpose.\n\n“We found quite a lot of things that were ridiculous,” says materials scientist Anthony Cheetham at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), after looking through DeepMind’s list of hypothetical crystals. He and his UCSB colleague Ram Seshadri note that more than 18,000 of the compounds predicted by the project include extremely scarce radioactive elements such as promethium and protactinium, which they doubt could ever be useful materials2. “It’s one thing to discover a compound, and a totally different thing to discover a new functional material,” says Cheetham.\n\nWork involving Meta suggested more than 100 materials that might capture carbon dioxide directly from the air and help to reduce global warming3. However, these provoked similar criticism. Computational chemist Berend Smit at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) says that the candidates are not viable for that purpose. He suggests that the AI tool used in the work seemed so exciting that the authors were “a little bit blinded to the reality”.\n\nSo will AI really revolutionize materials discovery, or is it drowning in its own hype? Since the initial criticisms, materials scientists have examined the results from these firms in more detail to assess the true potential of AI. The teams behind the work have responded, in some cases toning down the initial claims or proposing workarounds. Many researchers conclude that AI holds great promise in materials science, but that more collaboration with experimental chemists — and some humility about the current limitations of these systems — will be crucial for realizing their full potential.\n\nCrystal balls\n\nFrom the mixture of copper and tin that sparked the Bronze Age to the invention of stainless steel, the discovery of materials has driven innovation throughout human history. In the past decade, the use of AI in materials science has taken off (see ‘AI’s material growth’). Many of the latest efforts, which use AI to speed up the discovery of materials, focus on crystalline inorganic solids, a subset of chemical compounds that are essential components of countless technologies, from semiconductors to lasers.\n\nSource: Scopus\n\nThe properties of crystalline inorganic solids are determined not only by the atoms they contain, but also by how those atoms are arranged in repeating patterns. So when scientists plan to make new inorganic crystals, they don’t just come up with fresh combinations of atoms — they often try to predict what structure those atoms might adopt.\n\nBefore the advent of AI, researchers used more-conventional computational methods to do so. One of the most powerful methods is density functional theory (DFT), a way to approximate the complicated mathematics that describes how electrons behave in materials. For a hypothetical inorganic compound, this can reveal which structure is the most stable — and therefore most likely to exist — as well as the compound’s properties.\n\nScientists have used DFT to predict new materials that have spectacular properties and that went on to be made in the lab — including super-strong magnets and ‘superconductors’ that transmit electricity without resistance but, unlike most superconducting materials, don’t require extremely cold temperatures4. The Materials Project, at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California, has recorded DFT-calculated structures for roughly 200,000 crystals in an open-access database5.\n\nBut DFT is computationally hungry. Most academic labs can access enough computing power to run DFT calculations on a handful of compounds, but surveying millions at a time would be unfeasibly expensive.\n\nGoogle AI and robots join forces to build new materials\n\nThat’s where the high-profile AI efforts come in. In the case of DeepMind, rather than relying solely on intensive DFT calculations, the London firm fed a machine-learning algorithm the results of calculations that had already been recorded by, for example, the Materials Project. The algorithm, which the team called graph networks for materials exploration, or GNoME, learnt from these examples how to predict the stability of randomly generated crystal structures, and did so much faster than conventional DFT does. The system then checked the most promising of these predictions using DFT and poured the results back into GNoME to improve its performance. That ultimately enabled GNoME to dream up an enormous collection of compounds that it expects to be stable1.\n\n“I’m completely convinced that if you’re not using these kinds of method within the next couple of years, you’ll be behind,” says materials scientist Kristin Persson at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, who is the director of the Materials Project.\n\nIn another effort involving DeepMind researchers, AI has also been used to help synthesize materials. Persson co-wrote a paper6, published alongside the GNoMe results, which described the robotic ‘A-Lab’. The system was fed tens of thousands of published papers describing how to make various inorganic compounds. It learnt to devise recipes for synthesizing a list of target compounds that had not been made before but for which structures had been predicted by DFT and logged by the Materials Project. A-Lab then deployed physical robots to make those compounds and analyse the products to check that they match the targets, tweaking the recipes if necessary.\n\nShortly after the GNoME and A-Lab teams published their papers, Microsoft unveiled its own AI tool for materials discovery7. Like GNoME, MatterGen is a machine-learning model that has been trained to generate stable crystal structures. But MatterGen was designed to be more targeted than GNoME: it is able to suggest hypothetical materials that have specific properties. “You can directly generate the crystals that satisfy your design criteria,” says Tian Xie, a researcher at Microsoft Research AI for Science in Cambridge, UK, who led the effort. “This is much more efficient than using brute force to create millions of candidates.”\n\nThe project involving Meta is even more targeted. The firm’s Fundamental AI Research team worked with scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, to identify porous materials called metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) that might efficiently suck CO2 directly from the air.\n\nThe researchers used DFT to calculate the ability of more than 8,000 experimentally reported MOFs to bind to CO2. Then, they used those results to train an AI model to perform the same task, and showed that it offered similar accuracy and was much faster than DFT. In a May 2024 paper3, the researchers predicted that more than 100 of these MOFs contained regions that would strongly bind to CO2, offering proof of principle that AI tools could accelerate the development of MOFs for direct air capture.\n\nOut of order\n\nBut all of these forays have engendered controversy. When solid-state chemist Robert Palgrave at University College London looked at the A-Lab results, he quickly concluded that the project had mischaracterized some of the 41 inorganic compounds that it claimed to have produced, and in some cases had synthesized materials that had already been made. Palgrave has since produced a more extensive critique of A-Lab’s work, in collaboration with Leslie Schoop at Princeton University in New Jersey and others, in which they detail shortfalls in the characterization of the products and conclude that no new materials were discovered in the A-Lab paper8.\n\nThey also identify a more fundamental problem, rooted in the limitations of the DFT technique that supplied A-Lab with its target structures. Palgrave notes that the DFT method usually predicts highly ordered crystal structures, which might be stable only if temperatures could plunge to the limit of absolute zero (–273 °C). But in reality, the arrangements of atoms in crystalline materials are often much messier. Although many of the ordered DFT structures that A-Lab was told to make seemed new, they had, in fact, been made before as disordered structures — and it was those known, disordered forms that A-Lab eventually made, says Palgrave.\n\nGerbrand Ceder, who is at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, and co-led the A-Lab work, disagrees. He says that a detailed reanalysis by researchers showed that A-Lab’s characterizations were reliable. “A-Lab made the compounds that it claimed it made, and for which it had no synthesis information,” he says. “Making disordered versions of predicted ordered compounds is typically characterized as a success, and the standard in comparing theory predictions and experiments,” he adds.\n\nThe A-Lab project deployed robots to make new compounds using recipes devised by AI.Credit: Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley Lab\n\nThe disorder issue also affects AI-based DFT surrogates such as GNoME, says Johannes Margraf, a computational chemist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany. Together with colleagues, he trained a machine-learning system on crystal structures that have been determined by experimental measurement, rather than DFT. The model learnt to forecast whether a compound is likely to be disordered owing to similar elements swapping places in a crystal9. It suggested that of about 380,000 stable compounds that the DeepMind team highlighted as promising targets for synthesis — all with apparently ordered crystal structures — 80–84% would be disordered in real life.\n\nThis finding implies that many of GNoME’s suggestions are unlikely to be realized in the lab, at least in their ordered forms, and might have different properties from those predicted. AI models trained on DFT data can also miss potentially useful properties that arise from a structure’s disorder, which the models don’t account for, says Margraf. “If you ignore the presence of disorder, you can have both false negatives and false positives,” he says. “It’s not a small detail.”\n\nRobot chemist sparks row with claim it created new materials\n\nMaterials scientist Ekin Dogus Cubuk, one of the lead authors of the GNoME paper1 who has now left DeepMind to found the start-up company Periodic Labs in California, accepts that many of the ordered structures predicted by GNoME will probably turn out to be disordered. He says that the tool’s main purpose is to provide a signpost towards promising compounds that require further investigation. “It’s not like somebody can just simulate a material and it just becomes an incredible product.”\n\nSome, however, were riled by DeepMind’s suggestion in their paper1 that they had achieved “an order-of-magnitude expansion in stable materials known to humanity”, which sounded too good to be true. “It was kind of a red rag to a bull,” says Cheetham. “Our hackles were raised.”\n\nMachine-learning engineer Jonathan Godwin, who worked for DeepMind before leaving in 2022 to found his own AI-materials firm, Orbital Materials in London, agrees: “It’s pretty implausible to say that 2.2 million things you haven’t synthesized are new materials.”\n\nA DeepMind spokesperson points out that more than 700 of the compounds GNoME predicted were independently made by other researchers, and that GNoME structures helped to guide the synthesis of several previously unknown caesium-based compounds that might be of interest for applications such as optoelectronics and energy storage10.\n\nNot actually new",

The procedure — the first of its kind — could improve access to donor organs, specialists say, because the blood type of the donor would no longer matter.\n\nCurrently, organs from deceased donors can be transplanted into people only if they have a compatible blood type. This is because the recipient’s immune system can produce antibodies to attack and destroy the donated organ if the donor and recipient have different antigens, which come in two types: A and B. Organs that are blood type O do not have A or B antigens, so anyone can receive them.\n\nResearchers from Canada and China used an enzyme to remove type-A antigens from a donor kidney1. The enzyme converts type-A blood into type-O, says study author Stephen Withers, a chemist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. The type-O kidney was then transplanted into a 68-year-old brain-dead man in Chongqing, China. The organ remained healthy for two days before showing signs of rejection. It produced urine for six days. The results are published in Nature Biomedical Engineering today.\n\nThe enzyme was first identified in 2019 by some members of the same team2. In 2022, they showed that a type-A lung could be converted into a type-O one3, although the organ wasn’t transplanted into a person.\n\nThe results are groundbreaking, says Natasha Rogers, a transplant clinician at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia. They could improve access to donor organs and reduce transplant wait lists. If the blood type of the organ was no longer a barrier for transplantation, physicians could focus on things such as matching other antigens unrelated to blood type, which are important in terms of how long a transplant will last, she adds\n\nWhat’s next?",

          "abstract": "A patient has a blood sample collected for the Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS) longitudinal study.Credit: Charlene Winfred for Nature\nBroadening the long view\n\nLongitudinal studies — which follow individuals to collect data about health, lifestyle and environment over a period of months, years or even decades — have helped researchers understand disease risk, inform prevention strategies and improve public health planning. But the majority of large-scale longitudinal research has historically taken place in Europe or North America, meaning many populations remain under-represented in the data.\n\nA new generation of longitudinal studies is aiming to better reflect population diversity — not just by recruiting from underserved groups, but by embedding community involvement, local scientific leadership and context-specific questions into their design. This article is one of a series of three profiles about studies taking this approach.\n\nWhen John Chambers first shared his genetic studies on Asian populations in London two decades ago, they were scientifically accepted but the international response was muted. “They weren’t always taken seriously,” Chambers, a cardiovascular epidemiologist recalls, “partly because they focused on a small migrant group in London. And that’s not where most Asians live.”\n\nOne of those early studies, published in 20141, analysed the full genetic sequence of more than 300 South Asians and revealed millions of previously undocumented genetic variants. It helped show why South Asians are more vulnerable to conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. However, it had become clear to Chambers, who was based at Imperial College London at the time, that the research needed to be rooted in Asia, to fully capture the region’s cultural, behavioural and genetic diversity.\n\nIn 2015 he got a call from James Best, then the dean of the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, which was at the beginning of a collaboration with Imperial and Singapore’s National Healthcare Group to create a state-of-the-art cohort study. Best wanted Chambers involved as one of the six principal investigators.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research hospitals\n\nIt marked the start of an ambitious longitudinal population cohort study called Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS). Since it began in 2018, HELIOS has recruited 10,004 people across Singapore’s three main ethnic groups — Chinese, Malay and Indian — and is collecting an unusually rich set of biological, clinical, behavioural and environmental data. The goal is to understand why Asian populations face such high rates of chronic disease, and how prevention, diagnosis and treatment can be improved.\n\n“Cardiovascular mortality has dropped dramatically in the US and Europe over the past two decades,” says Chambers, who is now based at NTU. “But in Asia it’s gone the other way.”\n\nThere are around 296 million people in Asia with diabetes, more than half the estimated 589 million adults around the world with the condition. Cardiovascular disease deaths in Asia rose by 93% from 5.6 million in 1990 to 10.8 million in 2019, whereas the population only increased by 45%. Despite these trends, people of Asian ancestry remain under-represented in global biomedical studies.\n\nAs Singapore’s population grows older and chronic disease rates rise, the need for well-designed, long-term health studies has grown. By 2030, one in four Singaporean citizens will be aged 65 or older, and already around one in three adults has high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\n\nAnurag Agrawal, dean of biosciences and health research at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India, says that large, long-term health studies that collect detailed biological and lifestyle data, such as HELIOS, are key to closing this gap. “They are some of the richest sources of information from which biological insights can be gleaned and it is critical that people of the south and southeast Asian regions be represented,” he says. It is particularly important as artificial intelligence becomes “the language of biology”, he adds, with growing use of machine learning to analyse biological data, detect patterns and guide health-care decisions.\n\nKey facts: Health for Life in Singapore\n\nStudy name: Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS).\n\nLead institutions: Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University. Partner institutions: Imperial College London, Singapore’s National Healthcare Group.\n\nParticipant goal: 10,000 adults aged 30–84 across Chinese, Malay and Indian groups.\n\nData collected: Imaging, biosamples (blood, urine, saliva, stool, skin), physical tests and validated questionnaires on lifestyle, diet, mental health and cognition. Includes genomic and metabolomic profiling.\n\nLaunch year: 2018\n\nDuration: Long term; now part of SG100K, Singapore’s national precision-medicine programme.\n\nFunding: Part of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine programme, which has committed S$114 million so far.\n\nThe HELIOS participants, aged 30 to 84, undergo extensive baseline phenotyping, including bone-density scans, retinal imaging, electrocardiograms and testing for lung function and physical fitness. They provide blood, urine, saliva, stool and skin cell samples. They also complete detailed lifestyle, dietary and mental-health questionnaires, all validated in local languages. This is all taken over three to four hours, as participants move through 11 dedicated stations, each focused on a different aspect of health.\n\nIt sounds onerous but HELIOS has budding participants lining the block, keen to receive a comprehensive analysis of their health that dedicated doctors will assess. Participants will be contacted if previously unknown health issues surface in the results. “At one point the waiting list was 12 months,” Chambers laughs. “It’s been an amazing success.”\n\nData from the study are already revealing health disparities among ethnic groups2. Indian and Malay participants show higher rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and anxiety symptoms than Chinese participants, despite reporting higher physical activity and, in some cases, better diet quality. “A huge global conundrum is why South Asians have a higher risk of diabetes than Europeans,” Chambers says. “What’s often not appreciated is those same disparities exist even within Asian populations.”\n\nThe detail of the HELIOS study means that researchers can build an in-depth picture of participants. It combines whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variation, RNA sequencing to capture gene activity, and metabolomic profiling to measure compounds in the blood related to diet and disease. These data are linked to national health records — including laboratory tests, prescriptions and clinical diagnoses — providing researchers with a long-term view of each participant’s health across multiple systems.\n\n“This is a step change in how we assess diet and health,” Chambers says. Most studies rely on asking participants to recall how often, or what, they ate “but let’s be honest, most people can’t remember what they ate yesterday”. Instead, HELIOS uses what’s known as plasma phenotyping: analysing chemical markers in the blood to identify diet-related biological patterns without relying on self-reporting. It “lets us identify dietary phenotypes objectively, at scale, across hundreds of thousands of samples”, Chambers says.\n\nA recent analysis3 used data from HELIOS to identify a genetic variant that alters the levels of a coenzyme involved in removing cholesterol from the blood stream, reducing the efficiency of cholesterol transport, and which is common in Asians but rare or absent in other populations, he says. “That’s why its effect is so much more visible in our cohort.” It’s exactly the kind of region-specific insight HELIOS was built to reveal, and a reminder of why diverse representation in biomedical research matters.\n\nJimmy Lee Chee Keong, one of the six principal investigators on HELIOS, and a psychiatrist in the National Healthcare Group, says that at the project’s conception both academic and health-care leaders were thinking about “how to drive the health insights of the future”.",

          "abstract": "Engineer John Logie Baird used ventriloquist dummies in early experiments of his invention: the television.Credit: Hulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty\n\nLong before modern technology, the principle of the common good existed. It was not born with society itself, but later, with an awareness that if it were neglected, a society might collapse.\n\nPrinciples that promote social cohesion and well-being are found in most cultures. Early examples include the millennia-old Code of Hammurabi, which punished certain liars with a humiliating haircut1, and ancient Biblical law, which required landowners to leave part of their harvest for orphans, widows, foreigners and poor people.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThe real difficulty has been recognizing the boundaries that humans tend to draw when applying such codes. Do we include others, or only our species, culture, country or family? That ambiguity is where the problems begin.\n\nLack of commitment to the common good is evident in many of today’s challenges — conflict, inequality, humanitarian crises and environmental degradation. And now, it clearly extends beyond the physical world, to the digital universe, in which people spend an ever-growing portion of their lives.\n\nIt’s a good time to take stock, 100 years after inventor John Logie Baird successfully transmitted human faces through television, paving the way for today’s countless streams of online content, shaped by algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAre we, as a society, ensuring that communication technologies preserve the common good, or at least do not harm it? I think we’re not, but we should. Here, I set out a manifesto calling for algorithms to be designed and used with the common good in mind.\n\nNew media, old problem\n\nIn the twentieth century, television stood out as one of the main technologies shaping people’s perception of reality. People nowadays associate the word ‘television’ with the device, but when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi first used the term in 1900, he was naming a broader idea: the transmission of images at a distance2.\n\nBuilding on that concept, the world of images that now surrounds us — from streaming to social media — can be considered as just one more evolution of television. Technological progress is clear, but social progress is stagnant.\n\nA man’s face transmitted in a public demonstration of television in 1926.Credit: Ann Ronan Pictures/Print Collector/Getty\n\nIn the early days of television, despite the many private interests surrounding it, there were concrete efforts, in several regions at least, to steer it towards the common good. Broadcasts were guided by principles such as public interest and public service.\n\nNow, however, these pursuits are increasingly being held hostage to algorithms, AI and a handful of private companies (legitimately driven by self-interest and profit). In many ways, this is far from what people experienced in the past century. Yet the pursuit of the common good must remain. After all — and this is not mere rhetoric — our future depends on it.\n\nFortunately, we have acquired a century of learning.\n\nThe great rewiring: is social media really behind an epidemic of teenage mental illness?\n\nThe habit of seeing images from afar is not new — it has been part of humanity since the first expressions of imagination and storytelling. Fireside stories and artworks in ancient times, for example, reveal not only the earliest seeds of television — in images conjured by the imagination — but also their dual potential. They either served the public by reinforcing social values and creating shared references, or they neglected that role in favour of private interests, by fostering exclusion or spreading misinformation.\n\nTelevision, and what followed, merely technologized this practice. On 2 October 1925, Baird reported a symbolic moment. He transmitted, in greyscale, the recognizable image of a face — first, a dummy’s head, and then the face of a young man called William Taynton. This was the first time that such a feat had been achieved3.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1960, television technology consolidated and acquired a social dimension. As more people used it, concerns arose about its role. Two models emerged, which shaped the evolution of television around the world, and drew on principles already established for radio, such as the BBC Royal Charter and the US Radio Act of 1927.\n\nThe public-service model — focused on citizens — aims to always promote social cohesion and well-being. This model was favoured in the United Kingdom, and still drives the ethos of the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation).\n\nCrowds gathered to watch the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1969 on large television screens. Credit: CBS Photo Archive/Getty\n\nThe commercial model — focused on profit — aims not to compromise those values in the pursuit of gain. The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) pioneered this service in the United States. Even using the commercial model, working for the common good cannot be ignored. Because these companies operate inside society, they are also expected to act in the public interest.\n\nThe lesson is this: it is up to society to ensure, through regulation, not only that the main players shaping our digital landscape do no harm, but also that they ‘pay back’ for occupying social space, through concrete actions in favour of the common good, at a local or global scale.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1990, the television set became one of the most influential objects in the world. A common idea of global reality began to take hold through mass audiences that watched global events, such as the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing and news reports from the Vietnam War. Yet, as the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO warned in a 1980 report4, the vision people got was sometimes incomplete, filtered by the producing countries. Although controversial then, from today’s perspective, this criticism seems less like calling out censorship and more like a plea for fairness.\n\nWhy we need mandatory safeguards for emotionally responsive AI\n\nA further lesson can be drawn: a freer, more globally connected and technologically dependent world must not seek to homogenize everything and everyone, but to ensure that all differences are seen, respected and heard.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, the generalist logic of television, in which large mixed audiences receive the same programming, was increasingly replaced by diverse and specialized interests in production and consumption — a trend that was tremendously amplified by the popularization of the Internet. It was the start of the transition to our current world, which is awash with information. Yet, as UNESCO also noted in 20055, one challenge was to ensure that all this information was not only accessible and respectful of freedom of expression, but also transformed into knowledge that benefited people and societies.\n\nToday, this remains a crucial challenge. Free access to the digital ecosystem and all that it offers is not enough. It is equally essential to ensure that its use serves the good of both the individual and the collective.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2025, users of smartphones and people with Internet access have increasingly shaped the media. To enhance that experience, other protagonists entered the scene, notably social-media algorithms and AI tools. Ideas, generality and predictability gradually gave way to emotion, personalization and randomness. The sense of community shifted: it no longer depends so much on physical space, but on shared interests, habits and online content.\n\nThe digital world is no longer separate from everyday life — it is officially part of it, with access required for schools, public services, banking and work. That changes everything. As UNESCO reminded us in 2023, respect for human rights must be the fuel of the digital world, not left at the doorstep6.\n\nThe concern of a century ago is not so different from now: to give social and democratic meaning to the images that surround us. In the past, those images were shaped by human hands. Today, non-human agents have entered the scene, filtering, organizing and directing much of what we see, read and hear.\n\nWe need a new ethics for a world of AI agents\n\nAt this stage, the most important question might no longer be: where is technological progress heading? Rather, after all this technological advancement, where does social and democratic progress stand? Is the idea of public service still included in social media and AI today?",

But in the past few years, a flurry of other prizes have popped up — in some cases to fill gaps in the subject areas covered by the Nobels, and in others, to offer a bigger financial reward. With the Nobel prizes set to be announced next week, how do these prizes compare with one another?\n\nAlthough these newer awards (see ‘Prize money’) are becoming more significant, none match the Nobels, at least not yet, says biotechnologist Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, who has been awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, the Kyoto Prize and the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience. “In my opinion none are at that level,” he says.\n\nSara Seager, a planetary scientist at MIT and a winner of the 2024 Kavli Prize in Astrophysics, agrees. “The other awards want to catch up,” she says. “But for now, a Nobel prize is just so far ahead of the others. It was the first one and I just don’t think anything competes.”\n\nIt’s an opinion shared by many researchers, demonstrated in the way other awards borrow the Nobel moniker — the A.M. Turing Award, for example, is often referred to as the Nobel prize of computer science. Others, such as the Wolf Prize in Chemistry, are seen as good predictors for the Nobels.\n\nLeft out of the picture\n\nYet, the prizes leave many scientific fields out in the cold, such as mathematics, technology and climate science. “For many wonderful discoveries, there is no Nobel prize,” says Seager, giving the example of mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz, whose work elucidated chaos theory, otherwise known as the butterfly effect. History also indicates that the scientists with the best chance of winning a Nobel prize are men from Europe or North America.\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n\nOver the years, awards have been created to fill the gaps. Some also offer a lot more money than the Nobel prizes. The Breakthrough prizes, for example, founded in 2012, offer winners in mathematics, fundamental physics and life sciences the largest award of US$3 million, although not without accusations of borrowing the prestige of the Nobels. The million-dollar threshold is also met by the Tang, Shaw, Turing, Kavli and Millenium prizes.\n\nBut no prize is faultless. Researchers tend to work in teams, and yet most prizes, not just the Nobels, single out individuals for plaudits.\n\n“Only a small fraction of the excellence happening in academia is acknowledged with these prizes,” says environmental scientist Zahra Kalantari at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, who is a winner of the Frontiers Planet Prize.\n\nLack of women",

          "authors": "Huiwen Alex Yang, Bill D. Thompson, Celeste Kidd",
          "abstract": "Efficient algorithms can enhance problem-solving in many cognitive domains but can be difficult to discover and use. For example, classical studies of seriation suggest that children struggle to apply algorithmic strategies in a simple sorting problem. We investigated the spontaneous discovery of algorithmic solutions across development. We gave children a variant of the sorting problem with hidden object ranks: children sort animated bunnies into the right order, from the shortest to the tallest, when the bunnies are standing behind a wall so their heights are not visible. Children performed far above chance on this difficult sorting task, potentially because higher demands in memory and reasoning incentivized strategic behaviours. Children also independently discovered at least two efficient algorithmic solutions to the sorting problem: selection sort and shaker sort. Additionally, our developmental results show that older children were more effective sorters than younger children and used efficient sorting algorithms more frequently. These results indicate that children are far more competent at applying algorithmic solutions to sorting tasks than previous research would suggest, and performance on sorting tasks improves throughout development. Our work demonstrates that children have the ability to spontaneously organize their behaviours and find effective solutions to challenges in the world.",

          "authors": "Hampton Gaddy, Rebecca Sear, Laura Fortunato",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.",

          "authors": "Pablo J. Ordóñez, Protensia Hadunka, Gemma Del Rossi, Kathy Baylis",
          "abstract": "As climate change makes agricultural production shocks more frequent and severe, it is vital to understand their effect on farmer welfare, land use, and deforestation. Theoretically, a change in agricultural productivity could increase or decrease deforestation by changing demand for agricultural land and/or through the consumption of forests as a coping strategy. This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.",

          "abstract": "Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.",

          "authors": "Shijia Peng, Aaron M. Ellison, Charles C. Davis",
          "abstract": "Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.",

          "abstract": "Arguably, the most fundamental question in population ecology is what drives patterns in the abundance of populations? Small rodents exhibiting regular multiannual cycles in abundance have long been a test bed for addressing this question. The prevailing orthodoxy, the predation hypothesis, contends that nonmigratory, specialist predators are necessary, and specialist and generalist predators, combined, are both necessary and sufficient, for causing population cycles. Thus, variations in survival, from predation, are the key drivers of the cycles. However, this, and other competing theories, have hitherto lacked supportive demographic evidence and hence a solid evidential foundation. Here, we provide such evidence, analyzing 10 y of monthly data from a cyclic field vole population. We find, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, that recruitment, not survival, varied substantially from phase to phase in the cycles, made the major contribution to variations in population growth rate, and had cycle-phase-specific negative delayed density dependence. These results, their consistency with what is known from other systems, and the weak demographic foundations of the predation hypothesis, together suggest recruitment, specifically breeding-season length, not predation, as the cycles’ driving force. They therefore suggest that re-evaluation of the importance of the various determinants of population abundances, more generally, may be necessary.",

          "abstract": "Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.",

          "abstract": "Biological tissues exhibit sharp phase transitions where cells collectively transition from disordered to ordered states at critical densities. We demonstrate through bio-chemo-mechanical modeling that this emergent behavior arises from a nonmonotonic dependence on nonlinear extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics: mechanical communication between cells is optimized at intermediate stiffness values where cells can both generate sufficient forces and create strain-stiffened tension bands in the ECM. This balance establishes a critical cell spacing threshold for cell–cell communication ( ∼ 100 to 200 μ m) that is conserved across experimental observations for a broad range of cell types and collagen densities. Our model reveals that the critical stretch ratio at which fibrous networks transition from compliant to strain-stiffening governs this threshold through the formation of tension bands between neighboring cells. These mechanical communication networks drive collective phase transition in tissue condensation when cell density exceeds an effective percolation threshold. Our model explains how microscale cell–ECM interactions control emergent mechanical properties in biological systems and offers insight both into the physics of inhomogeneous materials under active stress, and into potential mechanical interventions for wound healing and fibrotic disorders.",

          "authors": "Ziling Wang, David W. McLaughlin, Douglas Zhou, Songting Li",
          "abstract": "Neurons process information by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs along their dendrites. Understanding the computational principles underlying neuronal information processing requires a reliable measure of synaptic conductance dynamics that accurately represents the input sources before signal integration and processing. Prevailing approaches to measuring synaptic conductances typically employ a voltage clamp at the soma of a neuron and assume the neuron as an isopotential point when processing electrical signals. However, owing to the presence of the well-known space clamp effect, the measurement of synaptic conductances through these methods often leads to significant errors, impeding the elucidation of dendritic signal features and subsequent signal integration processes. To address this issue, here we first develop a two-step clamp method at the soma that separately recovers the mean and time constant information of local synaptic conductance on the dendrite with high accuracy when a neuron receives a single synaptic input. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions of multiple synaptic inputs, we propose an intercept method to extract effective net excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from measurements of synaptic currents at the soma. Both methods are grounded in mathematical perturbation analyses of a conductance-based passive cable model and are validated across multiple biologically detailed multicompartment neuron models with active channels, including Purkinje neuron, pyramidal neuron, and fast-spiking interneuron. Results demonstrate that our methods effectively circumvent the space clamp effect, offering reliable means to assess the role of measured conductances and synaptic activity in neuronal information processing.",

Our findings show that neuronal activity is often influenced by multiple biophysical model parameters, in a nonadditive (i.e. synergistic) fashion.

The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes.

          "abstract": "Diverse factors, including environmental features and cognitive processes, can drive animals’ movements and space use, with far-reaching implications. For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.",

          "abstract": "Trigger waves, self-regenerating fronts of biochemical activity that spread without losing speed or amplitude, are widespread in cell signaling. Apoptosis is one example of a process that propagates through the cytoplasm via trigger waves. Curiously, in some contexts, like synaptic pruning, apoptotic caspase activation is confined to specific subcellular regions. We hypothesized that at junctions between a thin cytoplasmic extension, like a dendritic spine, and a thicker one, like a dendrite, trigger wave propagation may be blocked even though diffusion is not, as a result of the general properties of trigger waves and bistable systems. This hypothesis was explored theoretically through modeling studies and dimensional arguments, which confirmed that trigger wave compartmentalization was possible and that the critical channel width required for compartmentalization was likely to be biologically relevant. These predictions were then tested experimentally with undiluted Xenopus egg extracts that were induced to undergo apoptosis. We found that channels that are less than a few microns in diameter are small enough to compartmentalize apoptosis, and that the critical width is inversely proportional to trigger wave speed. Thus, cellular projections and tubules can allow for the compartmentalization of biochemical states within a spatially continuous cytoplasm, a fundamental yet previously overlooked mechanism for controlling biochemical signaling and cellular functions.",

          "abstract": "The ideal delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) to specific sites requires evading immune clearance and selectively binding target cells. Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.",

However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.",

We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology.",

Hippocampal area CA2, which processes social memory, also makes direct connections to CA1. However, the function of these connections is unknown. To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture. Taken together, CA2-CA1 connections can significantly impact CA1 plasticity and memory consolidation. The inclusion of CA2 into hippocampal circuitry and function broadens the role of the hippocampus as an integrative memory hub.",

          "abstract": "T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.",

          "abstract": "Understanding complex living systems requires identifying universal phenomenological laws that are independent of species and molecular-biological details. The Monod equation is a cornerstone of phenomenological microbial growth laws, depicting the growth rate as a saturating function of a single substrate. Because of its similarity in functional form to the Michaelis–Menten equation, cellular growth is often thought to be limited by a single reaction. However, cellular growth generically results from the coordination of thousands of metabolic reactions and diverse intracellular limited resources. Consequently, the mechanistic origins of the Monod equation remain controversial, and its extension has encountered limitations. Here, we propose the global constraint principle for cellular growth: As one nutrient becomes more available, other intracellular resources become limiting, driving transitions to distinct modes of resource allocation. Based on a general framework of constraint-based modeling and its dual formulations, we mathematically prove that, in general, microbial growth kinetics curves are monotonically increasing and concave with respect to nutrient availability. Numerical simulations using genome-scale Escherichia coli models with proteome allocation, molecular crowding, and membrane capacity constraints reproduce these features in a multiphasic manner. In contrast to the original Monod’s growth law, the global constraint principle also captures the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, by generalizing the Liebig’s law of the minimum, another phenomenological growth law for higher organisms, into a terraced landscape of diminishing returns. It thus integrates the classical phenomenological laws proposed by Monod and Liebig into a comprehensive theory of cellular growth.",

Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.",

          "abstract": "One of the reproductive barriers between diverging populations during formation of a new species is the sterility of their hybrids. The Prdm9- driven hybrid male sterility of Mus musculus musculus × Mus musculus domesticus hybrids depends on the interaction between PRDM9, a histone methyltransferase that determines the positions of meiotic recombination hotspots, and an as yet unknown X-linked genetic factor within the Hybrid sterility X2 ( Hstx2 ) locus. Here, we report that the Mir465 microRNA (miRNA) gene cluster is the predicted Hstx2 hybrid sterility factor. We show that removal of the Mir465 genes restores the fertility of sterile hybrids and improves meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Mir465 knockout also restores spermatogenesis in sterile chromosomal translocation carriers, demonstrating that Mir465 acts as a meiotic checkpoint that can be activated independently of Prdm9 intersubspecific incompatibility. Furthermore, the Mir465 knockout increases the global recombination rate in hybrids and in parental Mus m. domesticus mice. This demonstrates that Mir465 is responsible for the phenotypes of the two overlapping genetic loci, the Hstx2 engaged in fertility of hybrids and the Meiotic recombination 1 ( Meir1 ) controlling the recombination rate. The finding of enlarged Mir465 clusters in all European Mus m. musculus samples tested and the identification of differentially expressed targets suggest that the reproductive barrier between the two subspecies is sensitive to copy number variation of Mir465 genes. Together, the underdominant interaction between Prdm9 and Mir465 provides a rare example of Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility in hybrids of closely related species, making it accessible for further analysis at the molecular level.",

This is especially true for the higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often nonhomologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.",

Four metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed to produce one of four oxygenated precursors of BTEX—phenol, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, or 2,5-xylenol—from glucose or glycerol. After in situ two-phase extractive fermentation of the individual engineered strains using isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the organic solvent, the organic phase containing one of the oxygenated precursors was separated from the aqueous phase and subjected to distinct chemical deoxygenation reactions to reduce the precursor to the corresponding BTEX compound. This modular approach, based on the compatible organic solvent, streamlines biotransformation and consecutive chemical derivatization, providing a practical and viable route to sustainable BTEX production.

          "abstract": "One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.",

The processes of heme biosynthesis, transport, and degradation are responsible for the supply of heme in mitochondria and its insertion into other downstream proteins. What remains unresolved is how these processes interconnect and the wider implications for the cell in the restoration of homeostasis when heme concentrations change. We demonstrate a wide-ranging and coordinated response to changes in intracellular heme in HEK293 cells through a network of complementary mechanisms that extend well beyond the direct regulation of heme biosynthesis and degradation. These responses connect changes in heme homeostasis to mitochondrial function, including core metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as to enzymes involved in the control and storage of iron. Our findings demonstrate far-reaching consequences to perturbations of heme homeostasis and provide insights into the complexity of the cellular hemome.",

Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.",

          "abstract": "Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, yet no approved vaccines or antivirals exist. The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wild-type and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to nonclustering strains and outcompete nonclustering strains in replication assays exhibited by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and an HBGA nonbinding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in postattachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and nonclustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.",

We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations, it would imply a DS embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of DSs, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.",

Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (&gt;90%) and high-yield (&gt;90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods. This offers an environmentally friendly and economically viable pathway for sustainable REE recycling and recovery.",

Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements.

However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of newly identified lysine acylation modifications in cancer therapy remain to be elucidated. Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.",

          "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, is characterized by sickle erythrocytes that are prone to hemolysis, leading to anemia and vaso-occlusion crises. In sickle erythrocytes, hemoglobin aggregation is followed by altered cation permeability and subsequent dehydration. Interventions that restore cation permeability can decrease hemolysis and ameliorate the symptoms associated with SCD. PIEZO1 is a nonselective mechanosensitive cation channel that regulates erythrocyte volume. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1 cause hemolytic anemia by increasing cation permeability, leading to erythrocyte dehydration in humans and mice. Although PIEZO1 plays a key role in erythrocyte homeostasis, its role in SCD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the function of the PIEZO1 channel is upregulated in sickle erythrocytes of humans and mice, and this enhancement can be restored through a dietary intervention. We found that PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes resembles that of the GOF mutation causing hemolytic anemia. A diet enriched in the ω -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid decreases PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes, attenuates hemolysis, and reduces hypoxia-induced sickling. Furthermore, EPA reduces inflammatory markers. We propose that PIEZO1 contributes to the increase in nonselective cationic conductance (i.e., Psickle), which leads to dehydration downstream of hemoglobin polymerization. Our results suggest that reducing PIEZO1 function represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reestablishing normal cation permeability in SCD.",

It can have a large impact on host–parasite interactions and investigating this effect is vital both for understanding current parasite distribution and epidemiology, and predicting how this will change in the future. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether temperature and precipitation have an overall effect on parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals. This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.",

CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 &lt; 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent.

A recent two-state model proposed for high-pressure potassium, which exhibits a similar melting anomaly, attributes this behavior to changes in the distribution of non-nuclear localized electrons (electrides), resulting in distinct liquid phases. To test this hypothesis for sodium, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine its atomic dynamics and electronic properties under high pressure. Our results reveal no discontinuities in atomic or electronic transport properties, nor any evidence of multiple inherent structural forms. Furthermore, the electronic screening potential governing liquid structure remains largely unchanged above 50 GPa. Instead, we find that the key parameter responsible for the melting anomaly arises from differences in the average number of electrons per non-nuclear maximum, which affects the relative packing densities of the liquid and solid phases.",

Together, our findings indicate that anthracycline drugs function as potent and selective epigenomic modulators, with the capacity to further target the 3D genome to exert anticancer effects, highlighting their potential for personalized therapy in tumors with aberrant 3D chromatin architecture.",

          "abstract": "Reactive hydrodynamic turbulence is an inherently multiscale phenomenon, characterized by the separation between energy-containing, viscous, and molecular length and time scales. The separation between the viscous scale (the Kolmogorov scale) and the molecular mean free path ostensibly justifies a macroscopic description of reactive turbulence via the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. However, here we use molecular-level simulations to demonstrate that exothermic bimolecular reactions can cause the NS description of turbulence to break down in the near-continuum regime. Sufficiently energetic heat-releasing reactive collisions strongly distort the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution function, modifying not only the macroscopic chemical rate law but the kinetic-energy-transfer processes as well. This translational nonequilibrium ultimately introduces significant departures from the NS description in the kinetic energy spectra at scales orders of magnitude larger than both the molecular mean free path and the Kolmogorov length scale. These departures prove substantial enough to meaningfully alter integrated quantities, including the overall turbulence kinetic energy itself.",

However, the complete repertoire of cargoes and regulators associated with individual AP complexes remains poorly defined. Intriguingly, AP-4-mediated TGN export operates independently of clathrin, suggesting the involvement of uncharacterized accessory factors in vesicle biogenesis. To address these gaps, we developed an in vitro vesicle formation assay using wild-type HeLa cells or cells deficient in AP1γ1 or AP4ε, reconstituting their roles in packaging their known clients, Vangl2 and ATG9A, respectively. Coupling this assay with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, we mapped distinct cargo profiles for AP-1 (which buds from the TGN and ARF1-positive endosomes) and AP-4, identifying the 45 kDa calcium-binding protein (CAB45) as an AP-1-dependent cargo and the Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) as an AP-4-dependent cargo. Additionally, we uncovered PRRC1 and WDR44 as cytosolic regulators essential for AP-4-mediated TGN export. Our study advances the mechanistic understanding of AP-1 and AP-4 in secretory trafficking and provides a robust strategy to systematically identify cargo clients and accessory factors for specific adaptor complexes.",

          "abstract": "With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.",

          "abstract": "Tertiary plastids derived from diatoms in “dinotom” dinoflagellates offer a rare view of organellogenesis in action, while the genomic and metabolic processes underlying their conversion remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of two dinotoms at different plastidial levels: Durinskia capensis at the kleptoplastidy state, alongside its kleptoplastid-source diatom Nitzschia captiva , and its close relative Durinskia kwazulunatalensis at an early permanent state. We show that in both dinotoms, the diatom nucleus retains high transcriptional autonomy, but its expression profile is plastid biased, signaling early host influence. In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.",

While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition. These findings establish mesoscale avalanche evolution as a central mechanism underlying granular yielding rheology.",

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying SCOPE enable the capture of proteins bound to, in theory, any genomic location, facilitating the study of the cell context–dependent DNA–protein interactions. Using SCOPE, we identified the OCT4/SOX2/CARHSP1 complex binding to the NANOG promoter to maintain pluripotency in hPSCs. During ectoderm differentiation, ZIC2 acts as a competitive inhibitor, binding the same promoter region to downregulate NANOG expression and promote differentiation. Additionally, SCOPE identified that ZNF8 binds to the distal regulatory region of OCT4 to maintain naïve pluripotency. In summary, SCOPE provides a robust system for uncovering cell context–dependent, site-specific genome regulators, offering valuable insights into gene regulation networks driving cell fate transitions.",

The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.",

Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges.

          "abstract": "The homeostatic link between the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitophagy plays a significant role in how cells respond to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.",

          "abstract": "Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.",

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.",

Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ &lt; ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.",

The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol.

Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.",

To assay the relevance of GC1 transnitrosation under physiological conditions and in oxidative pathologies, we studied a knock-in mouse in which C610 was replaced with a serine (KI αC 610S ) under basal or angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated conditions. Despite similar GC1 expression and NO responsiveness, the Ang II-treated KI mice displayed exacerbated oxidative pathologies including higher mean arterial pressure and more severe cardiac dysfunctions compared to the Ang II-treated WT. These phenotypes were associated with a drastic decrease in global S-nitrosation and in levels of SNO-Trx1 in the KI mice. To investigate the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of blood pressure, pressure myography and in vivo intravital microscopy were conducted to analyze the vascular tone of resistance vessels. Both approaches indicated that, even in the absence of oxidative stress, the single mutation C610S led to a significant disruption of the endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation while NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation remained unchanged. Mechanistically, the vasorelaxation defect was associated with decreased endothelial calcium influx and membrane hyperpolarization, independent of NO bioavailability. These findings indicate that the C610S mutation uncouples two NO signaling vasodilatory pathways (endothelial SNO and smooth muscle NO-cGMP) and suggest that GC1 transnitrosation activity is essential for endothelium-derived hyperpolarization.",

Through interaction mapping, we show that DIORA1 binds three distinct modules of MRCK kinases, including the conserved kinase inhibitory motif, C1-PH, and citron homology domains. DIORA1 knockdown in human cells altered cellular phosphorylation patterns and reduced phosphorylation of known MRCK targets. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses revealed upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition genes and proteins, and functional analyses confirmed increased cell invasion, following knockdown of DIORA1.

Combined pesticide markedly elevated the abundance of phage-encoded ARGs under nitrogen deposition. By enhancing phage–host interactions and increasing the co-occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes with ARGs, phages may further facilitate the transfer of ARGs to bacterial hosts, conferring hosts a competitive edge in intensified microbial competition driven by combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition. The phage-driven mechanism was supported by in vitro cultivation experiments, demonstrating that phages harboring ARGs, shaped by long-term combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition, can infect bacterial hosts and confer resistance. Collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of phages in ARG mobilization under environmental stressors, reinforcing the importance of accounting for phage activity in ARG risk assessments under global change.",

          "abstract": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) have been identified to associate with various neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. Damage to MLVs can exacerbate the pathological progression of these diseases and significantly impede therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, targeted repair of the damaged MLVs has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we find that inorganic Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs mediated by Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson’s disease in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases.",

          "abstract": "The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) has two great topographic divisions—brain and spinal cord—that together integrate the body’s internal physiology and behavioral interactions with the environment. To clarify the architecture of intra-CNS connectivity supporting this integration in a mammal (rat), network science analyses were applied at the level of gray matter regions (nodes) connected by directed and weighted axonal projections. Neuroanatomical evidence indicates a bilateral, predominantly sexually monomorphic neuronal network of 840 nodes and a projected 81,434 direct interconnections (of the 704,760 possible connections), representing a projected network density of 12%; 32% of identified connections terminate contralaterally, and 41% of identified connections participate in bidirectionally linking a pair of nodes. Local network differentiations examined with unsupervised multiresolution consensus cluster analysis revealed a nested hierarchy of interconnected modules (clusters or subsystems) that were conservatively assigned putative functional roles. This structure–function hierarchy includes only three first-order modules, indicating a tripartite systems architecture (distinct from the bipartite brain-spinal cord topographic division): a bilaterally symmetric module pair centered in the forebrain-midbrain, associated with behavior control, cognition, and affect; and a single bilateral module centered in the rhombicbrain-spinal cord, associated with behavior execution and reflex integration. This modular spatial patterning suggests possible developmental and phylogenetic correlates. Additional analyses of the CNS’s basic structural network plan included global neuronal network features—specifically, measures of centrality, rich club, and small world topology—that transcend modular boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains with explicit Coulomb interactions, also including counterions and salt ions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.",

          "abstract": "Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 58 million people worldwide are believed to be infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of chronic liver diseases. Hepacivirus ratti strain rn-1, which was discovered from Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and designated Norway rat hepacivirus 1 (NRHV1), shares similar properties with HCV in terms of genetic homology, target cell tropism, pathogenicity, and the immune response. In vivo infection systems for NRHV1 will help overcome the challenges in HCV research for vaccine development. However, the virological characteristics of NRHV1, such as the mechanisms of cell entry, remain largely unexplored, in part owing to a paucity of cell culture systems for NRHV1. Here, we identified the host factors that facilitate NRHV1 entry by profiling the gene expression of two cell lines with different susceptibilities to NRHV1 infection. NRHV1 employs rodent orthologues of HCV entry factors, including scavenger receptor class BI, CD81, and occludin, and utilizes claudin-3 (CLDN3) but not claudin-1. The expression of rat and mouse, but not human, CLDN3 facilitates the entry of NRHV1 into murine cell lines that are nonsusceptible to NRHV1 infection. The host-specific cell entry of CLDN3 is determined by two amino acid residues, Ile 44 and Trp 46 , in extracellular loop 1. These findings suggest that CLDN3 serves as an entry factor for rat hepacivirus.",

          "abstract": "Over the past 3 years, the idea that artificial intelligence (AI) development should be accelerated without restraint to drive radical societal change—a phenomenon known as AI accelerationism—has gained traction in Silicon Valley. The most prominent form of this belief is known as “ effective accelerationism ,” and adherents view unrestricted progress in AI as a solution to humanity’s problems. Rooted in the broader political ideology of accelerationism, this movement positions itself directly in opposition to “AI doomers” or “decelerationists,” who advocate for AI safety and slow, cautious development. Effective accelerationists often dismiss concerns about existential risk, arguing that technological stagnation is a greater danger than uncontrolled advancement. Public interest AI inverts AI accelerationism, promoting more equitable, sustainable, and democratically accountable technological progress. This approach directly addresses the risks and potential harms of unregulated acceleration by aligning AI with public values rather than solely with private interests.",

However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription.

          "abstract": "The underlying reaction mechanism in lithium-ion batteries remains poorly understood. We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that lithium intercalation occurs by coupled ion-electron transfer, where ion transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface is facilitated by electron transfer to a neighboring redox site. Electrochemical measurements for a variety of common electrode and electrolyte materials reveal a universal dependence of the (de-)intercalation rate on Li + vacancy fraction, as well as temperature and electrolyte effects consistent with the theory, which could be used to guide the molecular design of lithium-ion battery interfaces.",

However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming. We predict that, by recapitulating past evolution, warm alleles will continue to facilitate adaptation under future climate change.",

Multiple absorption lines due to phosphine are detected around 4.3 μm, from which we calculate a phosphine abundance of 0.100 ± 0.009 parts per million. This abundance is consistent with disequilibrium atmospheric chemistry models that reproduce the phosphine abundances in Jupiter and Saturn, and is much higher than abundances previously reported for other brown dwarfs or exoplanets. This difference may be related to the low abundance of elements heavier than helium in Wolf 1130C.",

The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.",

How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.",

We evaluated the ability of open-source AI-powered protein design software to create variants of proteins of concern that could evade detection by the biosecurity screening tools used by nucleic acid synthesis providers, identifying a vulnerability where AI-redesigned sequences could not be detected reliably by current tools.

Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.",

For ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transitions through intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation, with these transitions shaping the post-synaptic response. Here, we determine structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. Agonist binding to a single site stabilizes a closed structure where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit transitions to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Uniting this intermediate structure with single-channel recordings informs a sequential activation mechanism where asynchronous subunit transitions prime the receptor for activation, a finding with implications for an entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.",

Traditional waste-to-energy methods such as incineration and pyrolysis, as well as most chemical upcycling methods for PVC utilization, require thorough, high-temperature dechlorination to prevent the release of toxic chlorinated compounds. We present here a strategy for upgrading discarded PVC into chlorine-free fuel range hydrocarbons and hydrogen chloride in a single-stage process catalyzed by chloroaluminate ionic liquids. This approach offsets endothermic dechlorination and carbon-carbon bond cleavage with exothermic alkylation and hydrogen transfer by isobutane or isopentane in a low-temperature tandem process. The light isoalkanes are available from refinery processes and partly from recycling of the product stream. This process is suitable for handling real-world mixed and contaminated PVC and polyolefin waste streams.",

In this study, we generated 61 capture-enriched M. columbi mitogenomes from the Basin of Mexico, located in Central Mexico. Our analysis reveals that these mitogenomes belong to a mitochondrial lineage distinct from that of other North American mammoth mitogenomes. These divergent mitogenomes suggest a deep population structure in their ancestors and challenge prior assumptions based on geographically restricted samples. Our findings underscore the importance of wider spatial sampling to reconstruct mammoths’ evolutionary history and demonstrate the feasibility of studying megafauna from tropical latitudes.",

Our analysis expanded the seismicity catalog from around 12,000 to more than 54,000 earthquakes. The more complete picture of seismicity revealed a sharply defined caldera ring fault system (RFS) featuring a very narrow depth range of seismicity, clearly illuminated shallow faults in the northern part of the caldera, and uncovered a source of very shallow hybrid earthquakes likely related to the hydrothermal system. To date, we have not observed any direct signature of upward migration of magma, nor have we observed seismic activity at depths below 3.7 kilometers on or inside the RFS.",

          "abstract": "Millions of Americans must attend mandatory court dates every year. To boost appearance rates, jurisdictions nationwide are increasingly turning to automated reminders. However, previous research paints an incomplete picture of their effectiveness—in particular, there has been little work assessing the impact of reminders on downstream arrests and incarceration. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment. The effectiveness of reminders bolsters the theory that lapses in memory or comprehension contribute to missed court appearances.",

          "abstract": "The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.",

          "abstract": "The distinct compositions of metallic cores from noncarbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) iron meteorite parent bodies (IMPBs) reflect differences in accretion and differentiation histories of earliest inner and outer Solar System planetesimals. Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.",

However, existing projections often do not align with past data, complicating adaptation planning, impact assessments, and communication. We present a spatial Bayesian model that generates local projections at tide gauge sites from historical records. The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The model enables projections of local relative sea level rise for any given global temperature trajectory, illustrated with three IPCC AR6 Working Group III pathways.",

We show that floods driven by compound space-time storm clustering have higher peaks, volumes, and durations compared to those from isolated storms or single-mode clustering. Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically. These findings highlight the need to incorporate storm clustering and its changes into design flood analysis and management strategies for the LMRB.",

To investigate how these architectures shape bacterial behavior, we generated near-isogenic strains representing each configuration in Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, an important soil bacterium widely used for plant genetic transformation. Strains with a single-chromosome architecture, whether linear or circular, exhibited faster growth, enhanced stress tolerance, and greater interstrain competitiveness. In contrast, bipartite chromosome strains showed higher virulence gene expression and enhanced transient plant transformation efficiency, suggesting a pathogenic adaptation. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed architecture-dependent gene expression patterns, underscoring the profound impact of chromosome organization on Agrobacterium fitness and virulence.

We report a systematic study for dissecting the molecular basis underlying Eut BMC assembly in Salmonella . We determined the functions of individual constituent proteins in the structure and function of Eut BMCs and demonstrated that EutQ is essential for cargo encapsulation and Eut BMC formation through specific association with the shell and cargo enzymes. We found that Eut proteins can self-assemble to form cargo and shell aggregates independently in vivo and that the biogenesis of Eut BMCs follows a “shell-initiated” pathway. Cargo enzymes exhibit dynamic liquid-like organization within the Eut BMC.

Nonvolatile switches with zero static power are promising, but current phase change material approaches face challenges including unreliable durability, high switching energy, complicated fabrication, and compromised scalability. Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonvolatile silicon photonic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switch enabled by tailored stiction effect based on van der Waals (vdW) force. The device uses a unique split waveguide crossing (SWX) with a push-pull MEMS actuator to efficiently switch the mode propagation. The vdW force between two halves of the combined SWX with zero gap provides reliable nonvolatility. The device features 0.23-decibel excess loss, 44.4-decibel extinction ratio, 200-nanometer bandwidth, and ~1-picojoule theoretical switching energy. Furthermore, excellent scalability is validated by a fabricated high-performance 16 by 16 nonvolatile photonic switch array, which has never been reported before.",

However, the kinetics of T reg generation across different tissues remains unclear. Here, we investigate T reg ontogeny from birth to adulthood in various tissues. In lymphoid organs, the adult T reg pool is continuously replenished with cells generated at different ages. In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics. Notably, neonatal T regs that persist into adulthood display a more activated phenotype and express markers associated with tissue-resident T regs and type 2 immunity.

At this sub-epsilon precision level, the half-life of 234 U is refined to 245,670 ± 260 years. For U-Th geochronology, systematic uncertainties from decay constants largely cancel, effectively reducing the uncertainty in the 234 U half-life to ~±25 years. This improved measurement precision consequently reduces total 2σ age uncertainties to ±3 thousand years (kyr) at ~600 thousand years ago (ka) and ±6 kyr at ~700 ka, a substantial improvement over earlier methods with uncertainties of tens of thousands of years.",

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.",

This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating.

Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI.

This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization.

          "abstract": "Markerless keypoint trackers, algorithms trained to identify specific points on an animal, have transformed neuroscience and enabled movement quantification without the attachment of surface markers. However, while these approaches represent a major advancement, they have yet to achieve the precision of motion capture in humans and have not been benchmarked against ground-truth datasets in common model organisms . Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to reliably track movement kinematics remains unclear. Here, we describe a tracking method that uses near-infrared quantum dots as injectable markers. We demonstrate that our tags can be injected beneath the skin or into joints and imaged for months in freely moving mice noninvasively using standard cameras. Last, we create a large ground-truth dataset for training the next generation of markerless systems. By using injectable landmarks in the joints, this method brings us closer to understanding how the brain controls skeletal movements.",

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in intelligent sports. However, the complexity and volume of TENG-generated data pose challenges for manual analysis. Machine learning (ML), with strengths in pattern recognition and adaptive processing, provides a powerful solution to enhance TENG-based sensing signal interpretation. This review systematically explores the integration of ML and TENG technology for intelligent sports. First, the fundamental theory and basic knowledge of TENGs are introduced, highlighting their versatility in sports sensing systems. Subsequently, a comprehensive overview of ML models for TENG signal analysis is discussed. Recent advancements of ML-assisted TENG-based intelligent sports applications, including sports training evaluation, sports health monitoring, and virtual/augmented reality sports, are then highlighted. Last, current challenges and future prospects of TENG-based intelligent sports systems are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Worldwide, exploited fish populations are increasingly affected by the combined effects of warming and fishing. Disentangling the relative effects of these factors is challenging yet crucial for designing management strategies. We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.",

Mitochondria are also a key source of intracellular ROS, yet their contribution to plant immunity is poorly characterized. Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.",

How FAK becomes activated in response to cell-ECM adhesive forces at single FAs to facilitate directional motion is poorly understood. Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding.

This ensures both selective pressure against deleterious mutations and the high expression of the GOI. By leveraging a machine learning framework, we predict optimal GOI-EG pairs on the basis of bioinformatic and biophysical features, identify linkers likely to minimize protein misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated substantial improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin.

Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy.

Here, we find a water-flow electric-gating effect on graphene, WSe 2 , and MoS 2 without dangling bonds or functional groups. It is an intrinsic electric effect, different from a traditional ion-reliant or functional group–dependent fluid electrokinetic effect. On the basis of this finding, we develop a water-flow gated transistor (WGT) capable of transducing flow signals down to 600 nanometers per second into electrical signals, achieving a voltage responsivity up to 1.53 × 10 4 volts per meter-second, about two orders of magnitude higher than existing hydroelectronic devices.

Here, we show a one-step, acid-free, and alkali-free extraction process for Li from mineral ores with an initial Li content of only 4.8%. By applying flash Joule heating to α-spodumene under an atmosphere of Cl 2 (FJH-Cl 2 ), LiCl immediately distills from the remaining nonvolatile aluminum and silicon oxides. LiCl with a 97% purity and 94% yield can be achieved, enormously reducing costs and waste emissions.

Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration.

Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions.

Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure.

A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively.

Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene.

          "abstract": "Broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in superconductors can induce not only spontaneous magnetization by the finite angular momentum of Cooper pairs but also the anomalous thermal Hall effects (ATHEs), whose detection has been extremely challenging. Here, we report the successful observation of an ATHE developing below the superconducting transition temperature at zero magnetic field in the kagome-lattice superconductor CsV 3 Sb 5 . This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting states.",

          "abstract": "Intracellular Ca 2+ controls various cellular functions, and local Ca 2+ dynamics are tightly regulated upon environmental cues. How cellular Ca 2+ balance is maintained during stress remains unresolved. Here, we identify an intracellular phosphoregulatory module comprising calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK)–ER-type Ca 2+ -ATPases 1 (ECA1) that integrates [Ca 2+ ] cyt flux with abscisic acid (ABA) homeostasis to modulate root growth under osmotic stress. Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth. Our work resolves a critical gap by elucidating how plants couple ionic and hormonal messengers to balance plant growth and stress resilience.",

We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.",

Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.",

Anticipating severe outbreaks would facilitate public health preparedness, but the extent to which this is possible is unclear. We conducted a data-driven investigation into the predictability of outbreak severity, using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a case study. For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .",

When adequately filled with cargo, P116 undergoes a rapid conformational change that modulates membrane binding.

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.",

However, research to date has focused primarily on phase and retardance aberrations, whereas another major source of aberration—diattenuation—remains largely unexplored. Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems. This work paves the way for high-dimensional aberration correction, introduces a previously unidentified use of optical skyrmions, and provides insights that will aid the development of vectorial measurement systems.",

The key for the success of this reaction relies on the formation and configurational instability of the transient seven-membered cyclic hemiacetal intermediate. The axially chiral biaryl aldehyde products obtained via this method can undergo a series of further transformations.

Posttranslational modifications provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms of disorders, yet their role in depression remains underexplored.

In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.",

On the basis of accurate chronological frames and faunal quantitative data, we demonstrate that extinct megafauna were the principal prey item of early foragers from ~13,000 to 11,600 calibrated years before the present, and this fact had likely been obscured by lumping together pre- and postextinction archaeological faunal assemblages within a single chronological window. We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened.

Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events.

We demonstrate that cervical organoids closely resemble native tissue at transcriptional and cellular levels, identifying epithelial subtypes with region-specific immune specializations. Upon infection, ectocervical epithelia reinforce barrier integrity, whereas endocervical epithelia, particularly uninfected bystander cells, exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming characterized by robust interferon activation, antigen presentation, and antimicrobial defense. Infection profoundly reshapes epithelial intercellular communication, positioning bystander cells as major contributors to signaling networks coordinating immune responses and tissue regeneration.

          "abstract": "Stress granules, cytoplasmic assemblies of RNA binding proteins and messenger RNAs formed during cellular stress, are implicated in translational control. However, their exact functions remain elusive. Here, we used cryogenic correlative light and electron microscopy to visualize stress granules in their native environment and reconstructed them in three dimensions using tomography. This approach provided the first quantitative and spatial analysis of the translational machinery within stress granules. Our findings suggest that stress granules have a limited impact on global translation regulation but serve to protect small ribosomal subunits and preinitiation complexes from degradation. Numerical simulations based on a phase-field model accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of ribosomal components inside and outside the stress granules, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles governing this process.",

          "abstract": "Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are typically embedded in the bulk of their hosts, making their electronic transitions inaccessible to surface modification. In contrast, two-dimensional materials, with their all-surface nature, offer a platform for tuning quantum emitters via chemical functionalization. Because of its semiconducting properties that enable electrical addressability, monolayer WSe 2 is a promising candidate for quantum emission, although the complex interplay between point defects and the localized strain needed to activate quantum emission leads to poor spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing monolayer WSe 2 with conformal adlayers of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) improves quantum emission spectral purity. Optical spectroscopy reveals that PTCDA functionalization lowers defect activation energies by 10 meV and induces a 30 nm redshift in quantum emission wavelength, while preserving the bright and dark exciton energies of monolayer WSe 2 . First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, thus providing molecular-level insight into the underlying mechanism of enhanced spectral purity.",

          "abstract": "The recently found superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a unique platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multiband systems toward high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO 2 exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 tesla at optimal doping—more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced toward the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO 2 , contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.",

Here, we analyzed adult life expectancy in 528 mammal and 648 bird species in zoos. Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.",

          "abstract": "Climate change risks triggering abrupt weakening in two climatically important North Atlantic Ocean circulation elements, the subpolar gyre and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.",

          "abstract": "Paleogeography of the Ediacaran Period has remained poorly understood because of paleomagnetic studies commonly yielding perplexing or conflicting data. Here, we report new magnetostratigraphic data from the Ediacaran Ouarzazate Group in the Anti-Atlas Mountains of Morocco, which have primary magnetizations supported by a positive conglomerate test and stratigraphically consistent directions within volcanic units across multiple localities. Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation. Our analysis produces a late Ediacaran paleogeographic reconstruction that is consistent with paleomagnetic and geologic constraints.",

However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting substantial challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia (SCZ), yet its mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the functional role of NKAPL (nuclear factor κB activating protein-like)—an SCZ risk-associated gene—and the single nucleotide polymorphism rs1635 in cognitive deficits related to SCZ. We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.",
