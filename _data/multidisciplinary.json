          "abstract": "During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1,2,3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1,2,3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.",

          "authors": "Shiheng Liu, Tiantian Su, Xian Xia, Z. Hong Zhou",
          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.",

          "authors": "Gabriel N. Santos-Durán, Rory L. Cooper, Ebrahim Jahanbakhsh, Grigorii Timin, Michel C. Milinkovitch",
          "abstract": "Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units 1 , the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system 2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback 4,5 . The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm 6 . However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.",

However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination.",

          "abstract": "The ring-shaped chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC; also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1, CCT) is an ATP-driven protein-folding machine that is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis 1,2 . Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease 3,4 . Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells. Defining the TRiC cycle and function inside cells lays the foundation to understand its dysfunction during cancer and neurodegeneration.",

          "authors": "Sixie Yang, Yigang Wang, Hui Pan, Ping He, Haoshen Zhou",
          "abstract": "In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.",

          "abstract": "The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest 1–13 . However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms 14–24 , the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate 11 . These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived.",

          "abstract": "Aromatic compounds are used across chemistry and materials science as a result of their stability, characteristic interactions, defined molecular shape and the numerous synthetic approaches for their synthesis by a diversity of cyclization reactions1. In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3. However, despite remarkable advancements, strategies to open aromatic compounds by metathesis remained elusive4. Here, we report aromatic ring-opening metathesis (ArROM) for the cleavage of aromatic rings, including tetraphene, naphthalene, indole, benzofuran and phenanthrene by employing Schrock-Hoveyda molybdenum catalysts. The reactions for each of the ring systems proceed through unique alkylidene intermediates. We further show the possibility for stereoselective aromatic ring-opening metathesis with exquisite catalyst control over the configuration of atropisomers. Aromatic ring-opening metathesis is therefore a viable and efficient approach to catalytically transform and interconvert various aromatics without the requirement for any reagents or photoexcitation.",

          "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1,2,3,4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5,6,7,8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain. ZMQ-1 has high thermal and hydrothermal stability with tunable framework Si/Al molar ratios. ZMQ-1 is the first aluminosilicate zeolite with an intrinsic meso-microporous channel system. The Brønsted acidity of ZMQ-1 imparts high activity and unique selectivity in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites.",

They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",

          "abstract": "Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6,7,8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.",

However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution —which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies significantly among models10−14. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids (⪆ 10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the asteroids’ emission peaks15 and synthetic tracking techniques16−18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects’ distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ~ 100 m (debiased cumulative slopes of q = − 2.66 ± 0.60 and − 0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than ~ 100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families —most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia— according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 “in-situ”.",

          "abstract": "Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of \\(\\varLambda \\mathrm{=2.14}\\pm 0.02\\) when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of \\(2.4\\pm 0.3\\). Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or \\(3\\)\\(\\times \\)\\({10}^{9}\\) cycles. Our results present device performance that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large scale fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization 1–4 . So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes 4–19 . Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre - scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe) 2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21 . We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism 12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices 3,14,22–24 .",

          "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, NCT04725474), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer.",

          "abstract": "The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.",

However, it remains uncertain how changes in daily rainfall variability are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis and growth3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we use several satellite-based vegetation indices and field observations indicative of photosynthesis and growth, and find that global annual-scale vegetation indices are sensitive to the daily frequency and intensity of rainfall, independent of the total amount of rainfall per year. Specifically, we find that satellite-based vegetation indices are sensitive to daily rainfall variability across 42 per cent of the vegetated land surfaces. On average, the sensitivity of vegetation to daily rainfall variability is almost as large (95 per cent) as the sensitivity of vegetation to annual rainfall totals. Moreover, we find that wet-day frequency and intensity are projected to change with similar magnitudes and spatial extents as annual rainfall changes. Overall, our findings suggest that daily rainfall variability and its trends are affecting global vegetation photosynthesis, with potential implications for the carbon cycle and food security.",

Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4,5,6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments. More generally, these results indicate that fragmentation features inherent to chemical synthesis can empower rapid data-rich experimentation.",

Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation 8 , comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states 9,10 . However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.",

          "abstract": "Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia.",

          "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system.",

The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine. This ambitious mission will be implemented by an international collaborative force of multidisciplinary research teams worldwide across academic, industrial and government sectors.",

The rapid development of highly effective vaccines2,3 against SARS-CoV-2 has altered the trajectory of the pandemic, and antiviral therapeutics4 have further reduced the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that encode various structural and non-structural proteins, including those critical for viral RNA replication and evasion from innate immunity5. Here we report the discovery and development of a first-in-class non-covalent small-molecule inhibitor of the viral guanine-N7 methyltransferase (MTase) NSP14. High-throughput screening identified RU-0415529, which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 by forming a unique ternary S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound complex. Hit-to-lead optimization of RU-0415529 resulted in TDI-015051 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 61 pM and a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 11 nM, inhibiting virus infection in a cell-based system. TDI-015051 also inhibited viral replication in primary small airway epithelial cells and in a transgenic mouse model of SARS CoV-2 infection with an efficacy comparable with the FDA-approved reversible covalent protease inhibitor nirmatrelvir6. The inhibition of viral cap methylases as an antiviral strategy is also adaptable to other pandemic viruses.",

          "abstract": "The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1,2,3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6,7,8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.",

Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analyzing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from ~45,000 year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbor Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to ~45,000-49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced to-date resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations.",

Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at z spec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS) 1 . The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 10 5 M ⊙ to 10 6 M ⊙ . These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (&gt;10 3 M ⊙ pc − 2 ), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function. These observations provide our first spectrophotometric view of a typical galaxy in its early stages, in a 600-million-year-old Universe.",

Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface.",

Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100), one of the largest proteins in the genome, is the primary structural and functional component of LDL, yet its size and complex lipid associations have posed major challenges for structural studies3. Here we present the first structure of apoB100 resolved to sub-nanometer resolution in most regions using an integrative approach of cryo-electron microscopy, AlphaFold24, and molecular dynamics-based refinement5. The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions. We further compare our structure to a comprehensive list of >200 intramolecular crosslinks and find close agreement between the two. These results suggest a mechanism for how the various domains of apoB100 act in concert to maintain LDL shape and cohesion across a range of particle sizes. More generally, they advance our fundamental understanding of LDL synthesis, form and function and will help accelerate the design of potential new therapeutics.",

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction. These data suggest that NRPSs C domains use a concerted reaction mechanism, where the active site histidine likely serves not a as general base, but as a crucial stabilizing hydrogen bond acceptor for the developing ammonium.",

          "abstract": "Io experiences tidal deformation due to its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s ongoing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been hypothesized to support the large-scale melting of Io’s interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5-7 Doppler data from the Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125±0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4±3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming due to rapid melt ascent, intrusion, and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating – like that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10 – may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies.",

However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks 1–3 . These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis 4–8 . Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4 + T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness 9–11 . Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.",

But what if you wanted to produce spaces in a material that is soft and delicate, and that can’t survive the high temperatures typically used to remove the template?

          "abstract": "Researchers at Google have built a chip that has enabled them to demonstrate the first ‘below threshold’ quantum calculations — a key milestone in the quest to build quantum computers that are accurate enough to be useful.\n\nThe experiment, described on 9 December in Nature1, shows that with the right error-correction techniques, quantum computers can perform calculations with increasing accuracy as they are scaled up — with the rate of this improvement exceeding a crucial threshold. Current quantum computers are too small and too error-prone for most commercial or scientific applications.\n\nGoogle uncovers how quantum computers can beat today’s best supercomputers\n\n“This has been a goal for 30 years,” said Michael Newman, a research scientist at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California, at a press conference announcing the feat. The achievement means that by the end of the decade, quantum computers could enable scientific discoveries that are impossible even with the most powerful classical supercomputers imaginable, said Charina Chou, the chief operating officer of Google’s quantum-computing arm. “That’s the reason we’re building these things in the first place,” Newman added.\n\n“This work shows a truly remarkable technological breakthrough,” says Chao-Yang Lu, a quantum physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai.\n\nDelicate states\n\nQuantum computers encode information in states that can represent a 0 or a 1 — like the bits of ordinary computers — but can also use infinite possible combinations of several 0s and 1s. However, these quantum-information states are notoriously delicate, explains Julian Kelly, a physicist at Google who leads the company’s quantum-hardware division. To get a quantum computer to perform useful calculations, “you need quantum information, and you need to protect it from the environment — and from ourselves, as we do manipulations on it”, he says.\n\nAiming for such protection — without which quantum computing would be a non-starter — theoreticians began in 1995 to develop ingenious schemes for spreading one qubit of information across multiple ‘physical’ qubits. The resulting ‘logical qubit’ is resilient to noise — at least on paper. For this technique, called quantum error correction, to work in practice, it would be necessary to show that this spreading of information over multiple qubits robustly lowered error rates.",

          "abstract": "Javier Milei took office as Argentina’s President on 10 December last year.Credit: Tomas F. Cuesta/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nIt has been one year since libertarian President Javier Milei took office in Argentina, and the nation’s science is facing collapse, researchers say. Milei’s agenda to reduce the country’s deficit and lower inflation — which had topped 211% last year — has meant that, as his administration’s slogan says, “there is no money” for science or anything else.\n\n‘Extremely worrying’: Argentinian researchers reel after election of anti-science president\n\n“We are in a very, very critical situation,” says Jorge Geffner, director of the Institute for Biomedical Research in Retroviruses and AIDS (INBIRS) in Buenos Aires. He adds that the Innovation, Science and Technology Secretariat, once the country’s main science ministry but downgraded by Milei to a secretariat with less power, is working with a budget that is one-third lower than last year.\n\nArgentinian scientists who are paid by the government have lost up to 30% of their income, Geffner says. (As of 2022, the government funded about 60% of research and development in Argentina, and the rest came from the private sector and international contributions.) As a result, the country is facing massive brain drain. At INBIRS, about half of its staff members are either considering finding jobs in other countries or already doing the paperwork, Geffner adds.\n\n“With six more months like this, there will be nothing left” of the scientific community, says Mariano Cantero, director of the Balseiro Institute in Bariloche, Argentina, which trains physicists and engineers.\n\nThe chainsaw strategy\n\nMilei promised to take a “chainsaw” to the Argentine government’s spending when he campaigned for president, to bring the economic crisis under control. Although the monthly inflation rate has dropped from 25.5% last December, when Milei took office, to 2.7% as of this October, poverty in the country has increased by 11 percentage points. Argentina’s gross domestic product is expected to shrink by 3.5% by the end of 2024, but recover by 5% in 2025.\n\nThe slashing of budgets has hit science particularly hard. The National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, which is the main funder of research projects in Argentina, has nearly halted work under Milei, despite 85% of its money coming from international agencies such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Alicia Caballero, who was president of the agency, resigned in September because the government did not authorize her to use the agency’s budget.\n\nStudents protested the Milei administration’s budget cuts, which have affected universities, in October.Credit: Luis Robayo/AFP via Getty",

          "abstract": "Most neutrinos that stream through Earth are produced by fusion reactions in the Sun.Credit: NASA/Goddard/SDO\n\nPhysicists in Italy and China have for the first time observed glimmers of the ‘neutrino fog’, signals from neutrinos that mimic those expected to be produced by dark matter.\n\nThe observations are a double-edged sword, says Nicole Bell, a theoretical physicist at the University of Melbourne, Australia. On the one hand, it means that detectors have become sensitive enough to pick up signals of dark matter — the mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the Universe. On the other, it means that the neutrino signals could obscure the dark-matter signals that scientists are so eager to observe. The findings were published in two papers in Physical Review Letters last month1,2.\n\nEvery second, trillions of neutrinos stream through Earth — unnoticed, because they barely interact with ordinary matter. Most of these almost massless particles are produced by fusion reactions in the Sun, such as those that trigger the radioactive β-decay of the isotope boron-8.\n\nPhysicists have long predicted that dark-matter experiments will eventually catch a glimpse of this neutrino fog, formerly known as the neutrino floor, says Fei Gao, an experimental particle physicist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He works on the XENONnt dark-matter experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory just outside L’Aquila, Italy.\n\nThe neutrino fog is also exciting because measuring it confirms that dark-matter experiments are capable of observing all ‘flavours’ of neutrinos flying in from the Sun and even from exploding stars in nearby galaxies, says Kate Scholberg, an experimental particle physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “You could learn something about the total spectrum of all neutrinos,” she says.",

The 3,200-kilogram lander — about as heavy as a pickup truck — spent two days drilling and scooping material on the lunar surface before sending the samples back to Earth.\n\nLi was central to deciding where on the Moon the spacecraft would land and was among the first to analyse the rocks it ferried back. He and his team of 70 or so staff members oversee the data collected during China’s space missions, and that includes storing and distributing samples. “What he is really good at, is coordination,” says James Head, a planetary geoscientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who has collaborated extensively with Li.\n\nWhen he was a young researcher studying geology and cosmic chemistry, Li says he never imagined holding samples from the Moon. But he has been involved in determining the science objectives of China’s lunar exploration programme since its inception, when Chang’e-1 was sent to orbit the Moon in 2007. This is Li’s second sample-return mission for the China National Space Administration. He had a similar role during the Chang’e-5 mission, which brought back soil and rock from the Moon’s near side.\n\nThe latest shipment, containing almost two kilograms of lunar material from the hemisphere hidden from Earth’s view, could unravel many mysteries about the Moon’s early evolution, and the planets beyond, say researchers.\n\n“We have been dreaming of having samples from the far side of the Moon,” says Patrick Pinet, a planetary scientist at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France.",

The publication is hosted on a platform aiming to make science more open and efficient, and rewards users with a token called ResearchCoin for engaging with content.\n\nThe platform, called ResearchHub, launched in 2020 and is backed by billionaire entrepreneur Brian Armstrong, who developed Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.\n\n“It’s a strange oddity of history that peer reviewers don’t get paid. It’s a valuable thing that they do and we should recognize, reward it,” Armstrong said last month at the launch of the ResearchHub Journal in San Francisco, California. The move came as Bitcoin — the world’s most established cryptocurrency — reached an all-time-high value of US$100,000, fuelling renewed fervour for the notoriously volatile sector.\n\nExperts say ResearchHub addresses some of the issues in science but might struggle to gain a foothold in research publishing because of its radical nature.\n\nOpen-source science\n\nArmstrong first floated the idea for ResearchHub in a 2019 blogpost in which he expressed frustration at the speed and quality of scientific research. He suggested that science should operate in a similar way to open-source software, where users build on each other’s work, with elements of successful online platforms such as social-media site Reddit, the code repository GitHub and crowd-funding website Kickstarter. As part of his plan, he wanted to provide a viable alternative to conventional journals.\n\nThe ResearchHub Journal promises that preprints uploaded to the site will be peer reviewed within 14 days and a publication decision will be made in seven days after that. Authors pay a $1,000 article-processing charge (APC), and papers and the accompanying peer reviews are published under a liberal CC-BY licence. The journal is yet to publish a paper and is not indexed on bibliometric databases such as Web of Science or Scopus.\n\nAuthors can also earn ResearchCoin as a reward for using good research practices, such as preregistering studies and sharing data openly. Users of ResearchHub can already earn ResearchCoin for uploading preprints and papers to the site, and commenting on or voting for these uploads. Users can also tip each other for good work or pay others to complete research-related tasks, such as generating data for a review. Currently, ResearchHub takes a 7% cut of any ResearchCoin transactions on the site, 2% of which is ploughed back into the community.\n\nBrian Armstrong, chief executive of the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange, set up the ResearchHub platform that combines elements of sites such as Reddit and GitHub.Credit: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty",

Many, especially those in government research laboratories, are underestimating the importance of the patent and licensing rules that surround tools such as CRISPR.\n\nThe holders of patents on the CRISPR–Cas9 system have rights over discoveries made with it, because their invention makes those discoveries possible. Indian researchers have been able to use CRISPR–Cas9 legally since 2022, when the Indian Patent Office granted a local patent on the tool to the Dublin-based company ERS Genomics. ERS sets the rules of the tool’s use. As a result, scientists can use CRISPR for academic purposes, but cannot commercialize any resulting scientific breakthroughs.\n\nCRISPR cures and cancer vaccines: researchers can help to shepherd them to market\n\nIn agriculture, that’s a problem. I made a similar mistake when starting my career in 1997. As a biotechnologist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), I was assigned as one of the principal investigators of the project to develop genetically modified, pest-resistant Bt cotton.\n\nProducing transgenic crops such as Bt cotton involves incorporating foreign DNA — in this case, genes from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (hence ‘Bt’) — into a crop’s genome to induce desired traits. Indian scientists published a lot of research on transgenic crops in the 2000s, but the patent on the relevant Bt gene was held by the agrochemical company Monsanto (now owned by Bayer in Leverkusen, Germany), which did not allow commercial use of the research results. Ultimately, Indian farmers could not reap the benefits of state-subsidized seed varieties; those using Bt cotton now rely on expensive proprietary seeds.\n\nHaving witnessed one failed project, I urge scientists in low- and middle-income countries to pay more attention to who owns CRISPR–Cas9 patents and under what terms they are willing to license this innovation.",

I was glad they were putting the crew names on a projection so I could see mine up there with Peter O’Riley’s and Leslie Neumann’s, so that I had confirmation it was not my imagination but the real thing.\n\nEveryone applauded, and the other engineers from my training group were clapping me on the back and congratulating me, so many of them that their words blurred together: good show, Lauren, well done, babes, knew you’d be the one. There was champagne — well, sparkling something, anyway — there was cake. I called my mother, everybody called everybody else’s mother, they had us pose for the first crew picture ever, which frankly looked demented and they had to take at least nine of them to get one good one. Because we were all dazed — we were going to Mars. Yes, it was what we’d been training for, but so had everyone else in our groups. We, us personally: we were going to Mars.\n\nSo when I got out in the corridor alone for a moment of fresh air and Betsy Donnelly from my training group was pointing a gun at me, it just seemed like one more moment detached from reality. Houston, we have a problem, the Texas kind of problem? I wanted to giggle, but the gun looked very, very real. “Betsy, what are you doing,” I said. The cooler air of the corridor suddenly felt very, very cold.\n\n“I have time-travelled to change this timeline forty-three times,” she said. “Forty-three times, Lauren!

If anybody would know if time travel was real, it would be me. Wouldn’t it? Wouldn’t I? I squinted at the weird wires on Betsy’s belt and the determined look in her eye.\n\n“You went off and invented time travel,” I said.\n\n“It wasn’t easy. We were closer to it than you’d think,” she added reluctantly, “but it still wasn’t easy. But watching you go to Mars in my place — everyone I went to high school with knew your name.

          "authors": "Nathaniel Comfort",
          "abstract": "The Genetic Book of the Dead: A Darwinian Reverie Richard Dawkins Yale Univ. Press (2024)\n\nRichard Dawkins, the ethologist, is widely known for two ideas encapsulated in the titles of his first two books: The Selfish Gene (1976) and The Extended Phenotype (1982). In the former, he argues that selection operates at the level of the gene, rather than the level of the ‘animal’ — Dawkins makes all organisms ‘honorary animals’ (a dubious distinction for, say, a sequoia tree). For Dawkins, genes have agency; an organism is a mere vehicle that genes use to make more genes. In the latter book, he argues that the full collection of an animal’s traits, known as its phenotype, should extend beyond the boundary of the body to include behaviours and their outcomes. Examples range from beaver (Castor spp.) dams to the unfortunate life of the marsh warbler (Acrocephalus palustris) that is duped into receiving, incubating and raising eggs of the cuckoo, a completely different bird.\n\nIt’s time to admit that genes are not the blueprint for life\n\nMost of his books have since been developments and reframings of these ideas, and his latest work, The Genetic Book of the Dead, is one of these. The titular allusion to ‘books of the dead’ — ancient texts meant as guides for passing from death to the afterlife — isn’t especially apt. As a prominent atheist, has there ever been an author less concerned with the afterlife? Dawkins’s real interest is the long-dead animals of the past, who leave their fossil impressions in clay — a book by, not of, the dead.\n\nMore productive for him is the image of the palimpsest, an ancient scroll or tablet from which the text has been scraped away to make room for fresh messages. Where the erasure is incomplete, ghosts of earlier texts peek through the veil, sending shadow messages forward to later readers. Analogously, bodies and genomes — phenotypes and genotypes — often reveal things about their ancestors. Think of the vestigial floating leg bones in a whale, or the scraps of Neanderthal DNA afloat in the genomes of modern Europeans.\n\nDawkins extends this textual metaphor to suggest that we can “read” an organism for clues as to its forms, functions, environment and history. Comparative anatomists have been doing this for centuries with body parts, and geneticists are beginning to do it with genomes. Dawkins invents a corny “scientist of the future”, named “SOF”, on whom he projects his speculations of what genomics might someday be capable of. None of this is very helpful in understanding evolution. The central metaphors of earlier books, such as The Blind Watchmaker (1986) and The Ancestor’s Tale (2004), did more analytical work for him.\n\nSurvival of the nicest: have we got evolution the wrong way round?\n\nLike those books, this one recapitulates the basics of Darwinian evolution, the selfish gene and the extended phenotype. He explains them crisply, sometimes lyrically, with examples from natural history. Although the arguments are familiar, the animal stories are often marvelous. It’s easy to forget, perhaps, what a fine natural-history writer Dawkins is. He gamely brings up the palimpsest or the book of the dead now and again, but I found it forced and gimmicky. Metaphor can be a powerful tool for gaining insight into a complex subject, but push it too hard and it shatters.\n\nDawkins is an observant Darwinian and an unapologetic adaptationist — one who thinks that essentially any trait you can observe or measure reflects the action of natural selection. Biologist Stephen Jay Gould called this view the Panglossian paradigm (S. J. Gould and R. C. Lewontin Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 205, 581–598; 1979). For Dawkins, as for French philosopher Voltaire’s endlessly optimistic Dr. Pangloss, “all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds” (Candide, 1759). Hence, to Dawkins, almost any organism is perfectly adapted to its environment, with the exception of several of what he calls “constraints on perfection”.\n\nFor example, in mammals, the recurrent laryngeal nerve — which controls breathing, swallowing and the vocal cords — seems far from ideal. It overshoots the larynx and is halfway to the sternum before it doubles back up through the neck to reach its targets. This might seem to be bad design, but it’s explained by evolutionary history. The nerve originated in fishes, which have no necks. When reptiles invented necks, the short arc of the laryngeal nerve was pulled and stretched into its current loopy form.\n\nRichard Dawkins argues that behaviour, such as dam building, count as a phenotype.Credit: Rosanne Tackaberry/Alamy\n\nEvolution has to work with what it’s got; it has no way to go back to the drawing board and redesign that nerve along a more direct path. “Imagine,” Dawkins writes, “what the jet engine would look like if the designer had had to start with a propeller engine on his drawing board, which he then had to modify, step by tinkering step, until it became a jet engine.”\n\nThis is a fine way to make the point that evolution must work inside the constraints of history. But why must we invoke this language of designers and engineers and perfection, rather than just writing about evolution as a historical process?",

The pact is narrower in scope than its predecessor, covering only collaboration on basic science projects between departments and agencies of the two governments and excluding work on ‘critical and emerging technologies’ potentially important to national security, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors. Unlike its predecessor, the pact does not include any information about collaboration among Chinese and US universities and private companies.\n\nWhy the US border remains ‘a place of terror’ for Chinese researchers\n\nExperts in US–China relations welcome the agreement, saying that it will enable scientists to pursue projects with confidence.\n\n“I am relieved to see this pact renewal,” says Duan Yibing, a science-policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, who hopes the pact will do what it’s designed to: promote collaboration in basic research between the two countries.\n\n“It appears they scrubbed everything and started from scratch,” says Caroline Wagner, a specialist in science, technology and international affairs at The Ohio State University in Columbus. The narrow focus “seems appropriate” given China’s new status as a scientific and economic power. “The United States has recognized its relationship with China is now more symmetrical” than when the original agreement was signed 45 years ago, she says.\n\nThe agreement, “demonstrates a pragmatic, if constrained, approach to maintaining scientific collaboration amid geopolitical rivalry”, says Marina Zhang, an innovation researcher who focuses on China at the University of Technology Sydney in Australia.\n\nA modernized agreement\n\nThe original pact was forged in 1979 to thaw diplomatic relations between China and the United States.

          "abstract": "Ekkehard Peik thought it would take only a few months to create the basic ingredients of a radical new clock. That was back in 2001, when he and his colleague Christian Tamm proposed a device with the potential to be even more precise and portable than the world’s best atomic clocks.\n\nPeik’s estimate was off by more than two decades. But this year, his team and two other groups managed to finally achieve what he and Tamm had proposed, generating the first tick of a clock based on tiny energy shifts inside an atomic nucleus.\n\nThe world’s best atomic clocks rely on the energy transitions of electrons that orbit an atomic nucleus. These clocks are so accurate that they gain or lose only a second every 40 billion years.\n\nPeik and Tamm, both physicists at the PTB, Germany’s national metrology institute in Braunschweig, came up with the idea of a nuclear approach. “We thought we could very quickly do a kind of demonstration experiment,” says Peik. For more than a year, they tried different ways to nudge nuclei of radioactive thorium-229 into an excited state. Then they would need to tune a laser to the energy of the nuclei’s transition and eventually use its frequency to mark time. “But the experiments all failed,” he says. The pair published their unproven proposal in 2003 (E. Peik and C. Tamm Europhys. Lett. 61, 181; 2003).\n\nTamm later retired but Peik kept at the problem. His perseverance paid off this year when his was the first of three groups to excite the nucleus to make it ‘tick’. There is still a way to go before this kind of system can replace the most precise clocks. But a starting gun has been fired. “Now everybody wants a piece,” says Thorsten Schumm, an atomic physicist and Peik’s collaborator at the Vienna University of Technology.\n\nPeik always found precision clocks fascinating. He was thrilled by their fusion of fundamental physics and practical applications. The idea of creating an entirely new kind of clock came when his PTB colleague, metrologist Uwe Sterr, noted a quirk in the nuclear physics literature. Studies showed that the thorium-229 nucleus must have a strangely low-energy excited state — one so low that it would be possible to induce that transition with a precision laser. For nuclear physicists, this transition was a curiosity. But Peik and Tamm saw that they could use it to make a clock. “It was quite logical for us to follow up,” says Peik. “Nobody had done this.”",

Scrolling through Twitter (now X) one day in 2020 — during the pandemic and at the time of the Black Lives Matter protests — Graham found photographs of Carlee Jackson-Bohannon, like her, a Black woman and shark scientist. The pair connected and then two more Black women, who were also marine biologists, got in touch and a movement was born — Minorities in Shark Sciences (MISS). This part family memoir, part manifesto charts Graham’s love of sharks — comparing their struggle to survive and thrive with the challenges faced by Black women in science. As an independent scientist without a PhD, Graham cannot apply for grants that are earmarked for projects led by people with a doctorate, and her first summer of going “rogue” with no academic affiliation, involved “hustling for funding and boat time”. Graham used some grant money to erect a prefabricated one-person laboratory, her science shed, in her backyard. In doing this and building her MISS network, Graham creates her own research study group and finds her place, realizing that she doesn’t miss the prestige, routine and rigour of the academic career track.\n\nThe Algorithm\n\nHilke Schellmann Hachette Books (2024)\n\nNature’s 2024 survey of hiring managers in science suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) is yet to transform recruitment, although almost half of industry hirers report using the tools either to design interview questions or to screen and manage applications. Overall, 25% of respondents across academia, industry and other sectors worry about applicants using AI for writing their cover letters and CVs.\n\nBut as Schellmann’s book suggests, AI is set to revolutionize the workplace — but the potential for misuse is huge. Although most warnings about AI and work are about humans being replaced by robots, Schellmann, who is an investigative journalist, predicts that AI will become like an evil and unaccountable human-resources director: screening CVs; conducting interviews; and spying on employees. For example, if a student writes a negative review of a lecturer, AI could pick that up and use it against the teacher. AI is not immune to bias, and a biased algorithm that is used on a large-scale “making high-stakes decisions, including hiring, is one of the most important civil rights issues of our time”, Schellmann warns.\n\nThe Future-Proof Career\n\nIsabel Berwick Pavilion (2024)\n\nThis book, by the host of the Financial Times’s ‘Working It’ podcast and weekly newsletter, looks at the human side of work and getting on with people. It’s divided into two sections, one for employees, which includes advice on dealing with toxic managers and the post-pandemic workplace, and a section for managers that covers, among other things, poor communication, micromanagement and bullying. Berwick advises employees who are seeking a pay rise to create a narrative for why they should get more money and back it up with data.\n\nIn April, at a launch event for her book at the London School of Economics and Political Science, Berwick said: “Treat any pay negotiation as an adult–adult scenario. Too often we get trapped in dynamics where we feel we’re the child and our boss is an adult and that infantilizes us. We get nervous.” She adds: “We have a perfect right to ask for more money. Decouple your sense of worth from what you’re paid. Bosses can make you feel bad for asking.” Berwick says pay-rise negotiations are often about more than money, and instead of getting a rise you might get useful training, an interesting secondment or a better job title.\n\nLeaving Academia\n\nEmma Williams Intellectual Perspective (2024)\n\nEmma Williams, a medical physicist turned professional trainer and coach, aims her latest book at postdocs (which she defines as someone working on a fixed-term contract on a project that someone else got the money for) who want to leave academia but aren’t yet ready to take the plunge. The book is split into three parts: the first looks at your working life as it is now, including the sobering reminder that an average career swallows up 80,000 hours. Section two focuses on getting ready to make the leap into the unknown and thinking about your strengths and values — and how courageous you are.\n\nWilliams advises you to curate a network of people — some you might already know, some you might not. Ask them for advice, don’t beg or plead, respect their time and never directly ask for a job in your introductory e-mail. She also urges you to stop looking like a postdoc by rewriting your CV so that it focuses on your skills, rather than grants. When the time comes to tell your principal investigator (PI) you’re leaving academia, William urges tact, saying: “Be mindful you are choosing a career course your PI has not; try not to malign their career.” The final section looks at post-postdoc life. You’ve got the new job — so what now? Williams gives advice on how not to create a new comfort blanket after abandoning the “itchy scratchy” one that cocooned you in academia. Have monthly check-ins with your new boss, to ensure you’re on the right track. Look at others in your industry — where are they and how did they get there?\n\nOver Work\n\nBrigid Schulte Henry Holt (2024)\n\nIt’s not you, it’s the system, is the message of this book. If you’re feeling burnt out you can try deep breathing and yoga, but that’s only tackling the symptoms and not the causes. Brigid Schulte, gender equity advocate and director of the Better Life Lab at New America, a think tank in Washington DC, investigates the reasons for toxic workplaces — lack of employee representation, profits over people, weak labour laws — and what can be done to fix them.",

          "abstract": "DNA fragments extracted from archaeological human remains can be sequenced to identify the microorganisms that caused disease.Credit: Microgen/Getty\n\nOver the past ten years or so, investigations of degraded or ‘ancient’ DNA have skyrocketed. By extracting DNA fragments from diverse sources —from human teeth and faeces to soil samples and ice cores — researchers have uncovered the stories of all sorts of organisms and ecosystems stretching back for millennia.\n\nInvestigators have used ancient genomics to discover the previously unknown Denisovan hominin, an evolutionary cousin and contemporary of Neanderthals that left hardly any fossil record; to identify which microorganisms caused human disease thousands of years ago; and to establish the geographical origins of domesticated plants and animals, including maize (corn) and horses1. Ancient genomics has also been used to reconstruct the composition of Pleistocene ecosystems that existed up to two million years ago2; and even to identify the wearers of ice-age jewellery3.\n\nMost DNA sequence data are now archived in dedicated, publicly accessible databases, and the ancient DNA field has been heralded by some as a poster child for best practices in genetic data sharing4,5. However, as the pace of ancient DNA research has increased — largely thanks to the latest capabilities in DNA sequencing (see ‘A sampling surge’) — so, too, have problems with data archiving.\n\nSource: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14203618. Analysis by A. Bergström et al.\n\nOften, only some of the data obtained in any one study are uploaded to publicly available databases. Furthermore, the associated metadata — information on the age of the sample, where it was found, how the DNA was extracted and chemically treated, and so on — are frequently inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nHere, we set out the nature of these problems and outline steps to overcome them, so that this astonishing record of the genetic past can be digitally preserved and used again and again.\n\nData loss\n\nAncient genomic data have been obtained from more than 10,000 humans6, some 700 microbes and viruses7 and, by our estimate, more than 2,000 plant and non-human animal samples. At least 2,200 ancient host-associated and environmental microbiomes (communities of microorganisms) have been sequenced7 (see also go.nature.com/3bcaxtv).\n\nOne major problem, however, is that not all sequences end up being archived.\n\nEarlier this year, one of us (A.B.) assessed what data and metadata had been uploaded into publicly accessible databases by the authors of 42 studies of ancient DNA. All studies involved the analysis of ancient DNA extracted from humans or non-human animals, and had been published in 2021, 2022 or 2023 in the journals Nature, Science and Cell. In about half of the papers, researchers archived only those sequences that they had managed to align to a reference genome, such as that for ancient human remains, leaving no record of the unaligned sequences (see ‘A snapshot of data-archiving troubles’). This represents a permanent loss of data for more than 3,000 ancient samples analysed in just these studies8.\n\nSource: Ref. 8\n\nIt might seem that any sequence that does not align to the reference genome is irrelevant. But improvements in computational methods and more-complete reference genomes could enable researchers to align such sequences in the future. Also, even if some of the unaligned sequences are not from the species of interest, this does not mean that they have no scientific value. On the contrary, these sequences could be among the most interesting in the data set, especially if they originated from pathogenic microbes that infected the host.\n\nFirst DNA from Pompeii body casts illuminates who victims were\n\nThe study of ancient microbes has become a field in its own right, and is transforming our understanding of microbial evolution and the history of many infectious diseases. Until 2015, for instance, archaeologists and historians thought that plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) emerged as a significant human disease only around 1,500 years ago. Analyses of non-aligned sequences from Neolithic and Bronze Age human remains have revealed, however, that outbreaks of the plague were occurring 5,000 years ago9. Researchers have likewise used studies of non-aligned sequences extracted from human remains to illuminate the evolutionary history of infectious agents such as smallpox, hepatitis B virus and parvovirus during the past 10,000 years10. Such work could help scientists to improve their understanding of current infectious-disease threats.\n\nAnother problematic archiving practice is the uploading of digitally trimmed sequences. In their analyses, researchers sometimes remove the last few nucleotides from DNA fragments (usually the most degraded parts of the molecule) to increase the likelihood that the fragments will align to a reference genome. Just as with the exclusion of non-aligned sequences, uploading only these trimmed sequences to public databases limits future researchers’ abilities to replicate findings and to authenticate that the data carry the expected patterns of degradation. It leads to the permanent loss of potentially useful data from the scientific record.\n\nTo further complicate efforts to reuse data, some researchers upload merged data that have been collected at different times and obtained using various laboratory protocols. We have also found that data sets obtained from different samples are sometimes incorrectly reported as coming from the same sample, and that data sets from a single sample are sometimes incorrectly registered to multiple samples8,11.\n\nMetadata mess",

          "abstract": "Children’s use of social-media platforms such as TikTok worries some parents.Credit: Jens Kalaene/dpa-Zentralbild/ZB/dpa via Alamy\n\nA year from now, children under the age of 16 in Australia will be barred from many social-media platforms — the highest minimum-age limit in the world. Other countries or regions have introduced similar bans and more say they’re considering them, owing to parents’ concerns that children are being exposed to cyberbullying, scams and adult content on these platforms. But researchers say there is minimal evidence to suggest such bans will keep children safe from online harm.\n\nThe Australian government says that social media is impacting children’s well-being. It hasn’t said which platforms will be off-limits under the new law, but the legislation will include those that allow users to post content and interact with two or more users, such as Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). Social-media companies could face fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$32 million) if they don’t take “reasonable steps” to prevent children younger than the minimum age from signing up for accounts.\n\nMany parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren’t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.\n\nThere is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. “It doesn’t line up with the scientific consensus,” he says.\n\nEvidence so far\n\nSo what does the research show? A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms’ transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.\n\nAustralia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",

          "abstract": "The Internet is a vast ocean of human knowledge, but it isn’t infinite. And artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have nearly sucked it dry.\n\nThe past decade of explosive improvement in AI has been driven in large part by making neural networks bigger and training them on ever-more data. This scaling has proved surprisingly effective at making large language models (LLMs) — such as those that power the chatbot ChatGPT — both more capable of replicating conversational language and of developing emergent properties such as reasoning. But some specialists say that we are now approaching the limits of scaling. That’s in part because of the ballooning energy requirements for computing. But it’s also because LLM developers are running out of the conventional data sets used to train their models.\n\nA prominent study1 made headlines this year by putting a number on this problem: researchers at Epoch AI, a virtual research institute, projected that, by around 2028, the typical size of data set used to train an AI model will reach the same size as the total estimated stock of public online text. In other words, AI is likely to run out of training data in about four years’ time (see ‘Running out of data’). At the same time, data owners — such as newspaper publishers — are starting to crack down on how their content can be used, tightening access even more. That’s causing a crisis in the size of the ‘data commons’, says Shayne Longpre, an AI researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who leads the Data Provenance Initiative, a grass-roots organization that conducts audits of AI data sets.\n\nThe imminent bottleneck in training data could be starting to pinch. “I strongly suspect that’s already happening,” says Longpre.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nAlthough specialists say there’s a chance that these restrictions might slow down the rapid improvement in AI systems, developers are finding workarounds. “I don’t think anyone is panicking at the large AI companies,” says Pablo Villalobos, a Madrid-based researcher at Epoch AI and lead author of the study forecasting a 2028 data crash. “Or at least they don’t e-mail me if they are.”\n\nFor example, prominent AI companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic, both in San Francisco, California, have publicly acknowledged the issue while suggesting that they have plans to work around it, including generating new data and finding unconventional data sources. A spokesperson for OpenAI, told Nature: “We use numerous sources, including publicly available data and partnerships for non-public data, synthetic data generation and data from AI trainers.”\n\nEven so, the data crunch might force an upheaval in the types of generative AI model that people build, possibly shifting the landscape away from big, all-purpose LLMs to smaller, more specialized models.\n\nTrillions of words\n\nLLM development over the past decade has shown its voracious appetite for data. Although some developers don’t publish the specifications of their latest models, Villalobos estimates that the number of ‘tokens’, or parts of words, used to train LLMs has risen 100-fold since 2020, from hundreds of billions to tens of trillions.\n\nIn AI, is bigger always better?\n\nThat could be a good chunk of what’s on the Internet, although the grand total is so vast that it’s hard to pin down — Villalobos estimates the total Internet stock of text data today at 3,100 trillion tokens. Various services use web crawlers to scrape this content, then eliminate duplications and filter out undesirable content (such as pornography) to produce cleaner data sets: a common one called RedPajama contains tens of trillions of words. Some companies or academics do the crawling and cleaning themselves to make bespoke data sets to train LLMs. A small proportion of the Internet is considered to be of high quality, such as human-edited, socially acceptable text that might be found in books or journalism.\n\nThe rate at which usable Internet content is increasing is surprisingly slow: Villalobos’s paper estimates that it is growing at less than 10% per year, while the size of AI training data sets is more than doubling annually. Projecting these trends shows the lines converging around 2028.\n\nAt the same time, content providers are increasingly including software code or refining their terms of use to block web crawlers or AI companies from scraping their data for training. Longpre and his colleagues released a preprint this July showing a sharp increase in how many data providers block specific crawlers from accessing their websites2. In the highest-quality, most-often-used web content across three main cleaned data sets, the number of tokens restricted from crawlers rose from less than 3% in 2023 to 20–33% in 2024.\n\nSeveral lawsuits are now under way attempting to win compensation for the providers of data being used in AI training. In December 2023, The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner Microsoft for copyright infringement; in April this year, eight newspapers owned by Alden Global Capital in New York City jointly filed a similar lawsuit. The counterargument is that an AI should be allowed to read and learn from online content in the same way as a person, and that this constitutes fair use of the material. OpenAI has said publicly that it thinks The New York Times lawsuit is “without merit”.\n\nIf courts uphold the idea that content providers deserve financial compensation, it will make it harder for both AI developers and researchers to get what they need — including academics, who don’t have deep pockets. “Academics will be most hit by these deals,” says Longpre. “There are many, very pro-social, pro-democratic benefits of having an open web,” he adds.\n\nFinding data",

In the first stage of pre-eclampsia, incomplete placental development leads to compromised blood flow through the vasculature and a lack of oxygen in placental tissue. In the second stage, the placenta releases vascular toxins, such as the protein sFlt-1 — a circulating inhibitor of the signalling protein VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor). These toxins cause dysfunction of the endothelial cells that line maternal blood vessels and lead to the clinical syndrome of pre-eclampsia. Levels of sFlt-1 and related biomarkers in the blood can now be measured and are routinely used for early diagnosis in women with suspected pre-eclampsia2–4.",

In a career spanning six decades, he’s made a name for himself by testing ideas to fight poverty. Using research to inform decisions and understanding systems from first principles is at the core of how Yunus solves problems, say those who know him. “He is in his eighties, but has energy, physical and mental health. He has empathy and is a great communicator,” says Alex Counts, who has worked with Yunus for more than 30 years.\n\nYunus was born in Chittagong in British-occupied India. His birthplace became part of East Pakistan when India was partitioned in 1947. In the 1960s, he left for the United States and studied under Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, one of the founders of ecological economics, which aims to understand the interplay between economies and the natural world. He returned shortly after East Pakistan became Bangladesh, an independent nation, after the war of liberation against West Pakistan in 1971; he was determined to play his part in building the new country.\n\nYunus is best known for his innovative approach to microcredit, small loans often of less than US$100. Companies that lend small amounts have a reputation for exploiting the poor by charging exorbitant interest rates. But Yunus showed how small loans can also transform lives for the poorest in society if administered fairly.",

          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "Credit: Getty\n\nBar charts are ubiquitous in the life-science literature, yet a study suggests that they’re often used in ways that can misrepresent research findings. The preprint1, which was first posted on bioRxiv in September and has yet to be peer reviewed, found that in a collection of nearly 3,400 papers from 2023 that included at least one bar chart, almost one-third distorted the data in some way, highlighting a need for increased data literacy among scientists and for a system of checks throughout the writing and publishing processes.\n\n“Data are getting more complex all the time, and data literacy doesn’t always keep pace with that. Even still, I do think it’s surprising how common some of these mistakes are,” says Rebecca Goldin, a mathematician at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. “It’s good to see more attention being paid to how we visualize our work.”\n\n‘Spell-checker for statistics’ reduces errors in the psychology literature\n\nTo quantify the amount of data distortion she often saw in published bar charts, Markita Landry, a nanobiotechnology researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and her colleague Teng-Jui Lin analysed 3,387 life-science papers published in 15 journals last year, including several Nature and Science journals, as well as Cell, Bioengineering & Translational Medicine and ACS Nano.\n\nThe pair found that 88% of the papers contained at least one bar chart; of those papers, 29% had a bar chart with some form of data distortion. The most common types of distortion included failing to start the y axis at zero, as well as mistakes that related to logarithmic axes. The former often inflates the difference between two values to make small disparities look larger, and the latter can minimize differences because our brains are prone to perceive scales as linear. Papers with multiple co-authors were most likely to include these distortions, the team found. “More collaborators may make it easier for mistakes to fall through the cracks,” Landry explains.",

          "abstract": "Early this year, cases of mpox erupted across Central Africa, killing hundreds. Seeing the events unfold so soon after the still-simmering outbreak of 2022 “felt like scientific amnesia”, says Placide Mbala, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nMbala led a team of researchers who sounded the alarm about the latest outbreak when they spotted a suspicious cluster of mpox cases among young adults and sex workers in an eastern region of the DRC. The team predicted that the disease would move quickly and urged health officials both in the DRC and in neighbouring countries to devise plans to contain the monkeypox virus’s spread.\n\nHe and his colleagues analysed the genome of the virus (E. H. Vakaniaki et al. Nature Med. 30, 2791–2795; 2024), revealing that it was a new strain, capable of passing from human to human and distinct from the virus that caused the 2022 outbreak and other previous outbreaks in the DRC. It has since been detected in Sweden, Thailand, India, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and six African countries that had never before reported mpox infections.\n\nMbala has been instrumental in leading these research projects, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who collaborates with Mbala. Furthermore, Mbala has “been coordinating response and community-engagement activities across the country, and doing all this in the least selfish, most diplomatic and democratic ways”, Kindrachuk adds.\n\nIt’s a role that Mbala has long trained for. After finishing medical school in 2006 and spending a year as a clinician in Kinshasa, he met Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, a microbiologist who directs the centre where Mbala works. Mbala was impressed by Muyembe-Tamfum’s work — in particular his dogged efforts to find the animal reservoir of Ebola, having co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976. Muyembe-Tamfum took Mbala under his wing, and in 2008 they worked to improve the country’s capacity for mpox testing and treatment. Later, Mbala helped to diagnose and confirm, through genetic sequencing, the first infections with the Ebola virus during the DRC’s 2014 outbreak.",

Weather forecasts for the city can be wildly incorrect depending on the location. Even state-of-the-art weather forecasts can’t predict the city’s microclimates and how they will vary.\n\nLam has spent a lot of time thinking about weather and how to forecast it. As a researcher at Google DeepMind, the artificial intelligence (AI) firm based in London, Lam has been pioneering the use of machine learning to improve weather prediction. This field has made rapid advances in the past few years, and Lam and his colleagues have been at the forefront of these efforts.\n\nThey’re not alone. A number of groups are racing to develop AI-aided weather forecasts, including those at Microsoft, Nvidia, Huawei and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Reading, UK. But for much of this year, the leading AI in terms of accuracy was a project called GraphCast, led by Lam (R. Lam et al. Science 382, 1416–1421; 2023).\n\n“GraphCast raised the bar up in terms of skill of forecasting,” says Matthew Chantry, who leads research on AI-based weather prediction at the ECMWF.\n\nConventional weather forecasts are sophisticated programs that simulate the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere on the basis of known physics of how air, heat and water vapour move around the planet. GraphCast is an artificial neural network that is shaped like a grid covering the globe. Lam and his collaborators ‘trained’ it with data based on real atmospheric measurements, but without giving it any explicit knowledge of physical laws. Still, the AI forecasts were by many measures better than the conventional ones. “I was surprised it outperformed the physics-based forecasts so quickly — I thought it would take longer,” says Lam.",

He spoke on 12 December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Washington DC.\n\nResearchers hope that the rocks outside of Jezero Crater hold signs of whether Mars might have once sustained extraterrestrial life, when it was warmer and wetter than today. The rover landed in Jezero nearly four years ago and has been exploring the crater’s floor and a fossilized river delta for such signs ever since. Over the course of its 32-kilometre journey, it has drilled rock samples and stored 15 of them in its belly; there are 11 empty tubes remaining that could be filled with additional intriguing rocks from the fresh Martian terrain it now faces.\n\nPerseverance has already placed 10 tubes on the crater floor in a ‘sample depot’ where a future mission could pick them up. NASA is trying to figure out how to bring any of the samples back to Earth for analysis — the only way that researchers can study them thoroughly to confirm signs of life. The original plan for bringing them back was estimated to cost up to US$11 billion, and the agency’s budget won’t support such a mission.\n\nEpic trek\n\nMeanwhile, Perseverance trundles along. Reaching the crater rim on 11 December meant that the rover climbed more than 500 metres in elevation — by far its steepest climb since it landed in February 2021. The crater’s edge is a geologically interesting region because Jezero was once filled with an ancient lake, making the rim a shoreline at one time.",

Abalkina, a Russian citizen now working in Berlin, tries not to worry about it. There shouldn’t be a risk if she were to return to Russia, she reasons. “But the problem is, you never know.” Her colleagues advise against it.\n\nThe reason that she has come under the watchful eye of the Russian state is that she has spent 13 years rooting out fraud in the scientific literature. Her work on plagiarism and on uncovering businesses that sell fake papers — called paper mills — has focused most heavily on Russia and ex-Soviet countries, and more recently on Iran and India.\n\nGlobally, she’s also tracked hijacked journals, which are scam websites that clone authentic journal titles to con authors out of publication fees. Abalkina showed that the hijackers launder their way into respectability by becoming indexed in research databases such as Scopus. Last December, Scopus’s owner Elsevier deleted all of its links to journal home pages to counteract the problem — acknowledging Abalkina’s work. But this June, she reported that several hijacked journals continue to infiltrate Scopus.\n\n“Cases of journal hijacking can be complex and ever-changing,” a spokesperson for Elsevier said, adding that the publisher was continually adjusting its processes so that Scopus indexed only high-quality, trusted content.\n\nThen, this November, Abalkina flagged an unusually bold effort to clone journal sites from major publishers. They say they’re looking into the scam.\n\nAbalkina is one of a growing cohort of sleuths working to decontaminate the literature. But she’s unusual in studying activity in Russia, in being funded to do some of this work — at the Free University of Berlin’s Institute of East European Studies — and in her focus on how fraud systems operate.\n\n“She has considerable skills in doing the sorts of analyses that allow her to explore networks of people,” says Dorothy Bishop, a neuropsychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who collaborated with Abalkina to document a paper mill that got six illegitimate papers published in a psychology journal (which were subsequently retracted). “She is doing very important work,” Bishop adds.",

Credit: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty\n\nExposure to extreme heat events is linked to molecular changes that could reflect accelerated ageing, according to a preliminary analysis of DNA markers in more than 3,000 people.\n\nThe US-based work, presented at the Gerontological Society of America’s Annual Scientific Meeting in Seattle, Washington, last month, joins a host of other efforts to understand the effects of rising temperatures on human health, as heatwaves strike countries around the world with increasing frequency.\n\nHeat is known to strain the heart and kidneys and to slow cognition. But extreme heat could also have effects that are invisible — at least at first. “The physical toll might not immediately manifest as an observable health outcome, but rather could affect our body at the cellular and molecular level,” says co-author Eun Young Choi, a gerontologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. “And that biological deterioration could later develop into disability.”\n\nSpeeding up the clock\n\nTo find a sensitive measure of heat on the body, Choi and her colleagues turned to the ‘epigenetic clock’, a collection of chemical modifications to DNA that tend to change as people age. Although there is some debate as to how well such measures serve as a stand-in for ageing, previous studies have linked changes in these markers to environmental and social stress, as well as pregnancy and some health conditions.\n\nThe researchers analysed 2016–17 data on such markers from about 3,800 people aged 56 or older. They then cross-referenced this data with temperature maps of the United States and looked for correlations between the status of molecular markers and the number of days over various time periods in which the heat index — a measure of perceived temperature that factors in both heat and humidity — exceeded either 26.7 °C or 32.2 °C at the participant’s location.",

But finding and quantifying it is inherently challenging.\n\nA reliable system urgently needs to be put in place for methane monitoring. And there has been a lot of buzz lately around using satellites. In March, the MethaneSAT satellite was launched for this purpose. Some are heralding this technology as the next big thing in environmental monitoring.\n\nHow AI is improving climate forecasts\n\nAs someone who has spent decades working on satellite systems, I can appreciate the allure. Satellites offer the ability to cover vast expanses of land, capturing data from regions that are difficult to monitor by other means.\n\nBut, before we get too carried away, it’s worth pausing to consider what satellites can — and, more importantly, cannot — do. Although satellites can provide crucial insights into methane releases, they are not a comprehensive solution. Their effectiveness is often hampered by limited spatial resolution, atmospheric interference and the challenge of accurately identifying specific emission sources.\n\nSatellites’ broad spatial coverage tends to come at the cost of precision. Take the Permian Basin — a prolific oil- and gas-producing area in the southwestern United States. Overlapping infrastructure, such as pipeline networks and storage facilities, combined with varying topography, fluctuating weather patterns and diverse land uses, make specific emission sources hard to pinpoint.\n\nWeather patterns can distort satellite readings, and offshore emissions are frequently missed. Given that oceans cover more than two-thirds of our planet, this is no small oversight.",

          "abstract": "Concealing some of the information on job applications led to more women being hired.Credit: Christopher Ames/Getty\n\nIn 2017, when Sherri Christian returned to her institution after a year-long sabbatical, she looked around the biochemistry department and realized that she was the last female hire, seven years earlier. At the time, there were 19 members, just 6 of them women, including her.\n\nDuring her sabbatical, Christian attended a talk about diversity and inclusion at a Canadian Society for Immunology meeting at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Inspired by what she learnt, Christian and her colleagues set about making hiring diversity a priority.\n\nBy this year, her department at the Memorial University of Newfoundland Faculty of Medicine in St John’s, Canada, had managed to achieve gender parity. The changes made to hiring processes are described in a preprint posted to the bioRxiv server last month1. It has not been peer reviewed.\n\nChristian’s department is not alone in taking action to boost gender diversity among their staff. In 2022, leaders of several departments at the University of Melbourne, Australia, reported the details of affirmative-action recruitment initiatives that led to more female hires.\n\nAnd this year, the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands revealed the results of a five-year policy stating that only female applicants would be considered for permanent academic roles during the first six months of recruitment. The controversial policy led to 50% of all new hires being women, up from 30% previously.\n\nLoneliness\n\nWhen the Newfoundland project started in 2020, Christian was the only woman to have been hired in ten years. “It was a bit lonely,” she says. “You’d look around and there’d be no women on the committee you are sitting in, or it would be the same other person over and over again because there are only so many people to choose from.”\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, the department’s job postings emphasized the equity, diversity and inclusion aspects of the application process for entry-level tenure-track faculty positions.\n\nBut the main change was anonymizing job applications in an attempt to stamp out implicit bias on search committees.\n\nCommittee members were given copies of application documents in which candidates’ names and contact information were redacted, as were references to their institution, country and leaves of absence. Gender, religion, ethnicity, race, age and nationality were also removed. This task was done by the head of the department, Mark Berry, who was not involved in evaluating candidates. His work took, on average, 90 minutes per application.\n\nThe degree type and year of completion remained, as did the location and title of any national or international conference presentations. Publication titles, including the year of publication and journal, also remained. Berry also added candidates’ authorship position in the publications and presentations.\n\nThe redacted versions were then used to draw up a shortlist of around ten candidates for each of the five roles being filled during the study period.",

          "abstract": "Some researchers worry that if AI systems become conscious and people neglect or treat them poorly, they might suffer.Credit: Pol Cartie/Sipa/Alamy\n\nThe rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought to the fore ethical questions that were once confined to the realms of science fiction: if AI systems could one day ‘think’ like humans, for example, would they also be able to have subjective experiences like humans? Would they experience suffering, and, if so, would humanity be equipped to properly care for them?\n\nA group of philosophers and computer scientists are arguing that AI welfare should be taken seriously. In a report posted last month on the preprint server arXiv1, ahead of peer review, they call for AI companies not only to assess their systems for evidence of consciousness and the capacity to make autonomous decisions, but also to put in place policies for how to treat the systems if these scenarios become reality.\n\nIf AI becomes conscious: here’s how researchers will know\n\nThey point out that failing to recognize that an AI system has become conscious could lead people to neglect it, harming it or causing it to suffer.\n\nSome think that, at this stage, the idea that there is a need for AI welfare is laughable. Others are sceptical, but say it doesn’t hurt to start planning. Among them is Anil Seth, a consciousness researcher at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. “These scenarios might seem outlandish, and it is true that conscious AI may be very far away and might not even be possible. But the implications of its emergence are sufficiently tectonic that we mustn’t ignore the possibility,” he wrote last year in the science magazine Nautilus. “The problem wasn’t that Frankenstein’s creature came to life; it was that it was conscious and could feel.”\n\nThe stakes are getting higher as we become increasingly dependent on these technologies, says Jonathan Mason, a mathematician based in Oxford, UK, who was not involved in producing the report. Mason argues that developing methods for assessing AI systems for consciousness should be a priority. “It wouldn’t be sensible to get society to invest so much in something and become so reliant on something that we knew so little about — that we didn’t even realize that it had perception,” he says.\n\nPeople might also be harmed if AI systems aren’t tested properly for consciousness, says Jeff Sebo, a philosopher at New York University in New York City and a co-author of the report. If we wrongly assume a system is conscious, he says, welfare funding might be funnelled towards its care, and therefore taken away from people or animals that need it, or “it could lead you to constrain efforts to make AI safe or beneficial for humans”.",

The budget included huge boosts to both the number and value of government scholarships. “There was absolute excitement and giddiness when I saw those numbers,” she says.\n\nIt was the culmination of a years-long campaign; Kharas had been leading the project for the past six months.\n\nThe Support Our Science (SOS) campaign began in 2022. From the start, organizers knew it needed to be led by graduate students speaking in their own voice, says Marc Johnson, a biologist at the University of Toronto Mississauga who helped to launch the campaign.\n\nSOS’s first executive director was Sarah Laframboise, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa. When she stepped down in November 2023, Johnson and the board chose Kharas, who was doing a PhD in paediatric brain cancer at the University of Toronto, as her replacement. “Kaitlin had distinguished herself as professional, well spoken and up to date on the issues,” says Johnson. “She and Sarah have been our face and voice, and the people who put our vision into action.”\n\nThe campaign involved rallies, meetings with cabinet ministers and e-mail campaigns. In the months leading up to the budget, the campaign held a press conference and encouraged supporters to write to the prime minister and finance minister.

One study1 finds that modern humans swapped genes with our sister species in a roughly 7,000-year period starting around 50,500 years ago; the other2 finds that the mixing took place between 45,000 and 49,000 years ago.\n\nThe data also suggest that some genetic variants from Neanderthals were helpful to modern humans encountering new climates and diseases outside of Africa. The findings are published today by separate teams, in papers in Science1 and Nature2.\n\nThat both papers reinforce the idea that the ancestors of all people outside Africa got their Neanderthal ancestry in a single swoop is “striking”, says Alexander Platt, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who was not involved with either study. “It’s eye-opening”, he says, that this model of human evolution is correct.\n\nDating details\n\nNeanderthals and modern humans shared the planet for thousands of years. Whether our two species mingled was hotly debated for decades — until research revealed that Neanderthal DNA makes up a small percentage of the genomes of all humans currently living, other than people whose ancestry comes solely from sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nSince then, the details of the human–Neanderthal meet cute have remained “one of the main questions” in human evolutionary biology, says Benjamin Peter, a population geneticist at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the Science study.\n\nNeanderthals, who lived in what’s now Europe and western Asia, and modern humans, who evolved in Africa, probably met and mingled throughout our shared time on Earth. Previous research estimated that any gene flow between them did not leave a mark until more recently ― as early as 65,000 years ago.\n\nKoněprusy cave at the Zlatý kůň site in the Czech Republic, where blasting in 1950 led to the discovery of the remains of a woman who lived some 45,000 years ago.Credit: Martin Frouz\n\nThe authors of the Nature paper reassessed the timing of that interbreeding by examining the DNA of a male Homo sapiens found near Ranis, Germany, and that of a female Homo sapiens whose remains were discovered in a cave at a site called Zlatý kůň in the Czech Republic.

The findings could pave the way for the development of needle-free vaccines that can be applied to the skin.\n\nAlthough scientists have previously seen immune responses in the skin during infections, finding similar reactions in healthy skin is “a surprise”, says Daniel Kaplan, a dermatologist and immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. “The idea of a semi-autonomous immune system in a peripheral tissue is very exciting,” he says.\n\nDual role\n\nThe immune system has to fight off harmful pathogens without attacking the helpful microorganisms that inhabit the body. Previous research showed3 that the skin of adult mice that had been raised without microbes could be colonized by Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common and harmless bacterium found on human skin. This long-term colonization triggered the production of specific immune cells, called T cells, which helped to strengthen local immunity.\n\n“The next and maybe main chapter in this saga is that the response to this ubiquitous skin colonist is much more potent than we had realized,” says Michael Fischbach, a microbiologist at Stanford University in California, who co-authored both of the latest studies.\n\n“When the immune system sees a friendly bacterium, you would think that it would just give a friendly wave and walk in the other direction, but that’s not at all what happens,” he says.\n\nIn experiments with mice, Fischbach and his colleagues discovered that S. epidermidis triggers the activation of B cells, the immune cells necessary to produce antibodies1. The skin then made antibodies against S. epidermidis; these persisted for at least 200 days and could form without previous exposure to other microbes.\n\nThe skin was able to generate this immune response even when lymph nodes — the immune hubs that help to activate immune cells — were disabled. The presence of S. epidermidis also induced the formation of specialized immune structures in the skin that attract T and B cells, boosting the production of antibodies.\n\nImmune memory",

          "abstract": "In May 2023 Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI in San Francisco, California, embarked on a 17-city world tour to promote artificial intelligence (AI) tools. One of the stops in the first week of the tour was Lagos, Nigeria. Yet, research assessing the performance of OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT on a data set of 670 languages shows that African languages have the least support1. The large language model GPT-4, which underlies ChatGPT, recognizes sentences written in Hausa, Nigeria’s most widely spoken language, only 10–20% of the time.\n\nAs a computer scientist and former machine-learning engineer at Google AI in Accra, I have long known about the limitations of importing AI tools devoid of local context into Africa. And we need to give African computer scientists the opportunity to develop home-grown solutions.\n\nWhy AI might be a game-changer for Africa\n\nFor instance, in 2018, when my colleagues and I set out to track changes in the built environment of South Africa’s historically Black townships, we quickly discovered the limitations of AI models commonly used to detect features such as houses and street patterns in aerial images. Because the post-Apartheid constitution prioritizes uplifting disenfranchised communities, our project aimed to assess whether improvements in well-being were visible in satellite imagery. Unfortunately, available AI models — trained on Western cities, which often have grid-like layouts — struggled to adapt to the nation’s unique urban landscapes.\n\nIt took us four years to develop an AI model tailored to the local context. Meanwhile, Western researchers who had access to similar satellite and census data focused on using night-time light levels to estimate poverty rates in several African countries2 — an approach that is doomed to fail in South African townships. There, well-lit streets, a legacy of Apartheid-era discriminatory policing, could easily be misread as signalling economically prosperous urban zones.\n\nOur challenging experience with ‘state-of-the-art’ AI models highlights the importance of local context and lived experience. That’s why African-built small language models, such as Lesan AI — a language translation and transcription tool — can match and even outperform Western counterparts on tasks such as speech-to-text transcription. To build the model, Lesan’s co-founder, Asmelash Hadgu in Berlin, hired fluent speakers of Tigrinya and Amharic to create unique data sets and then used those to train the AI. As a technologist who speaks both languages, Hadgu was able to build a rich data set by focusing on the most descriptive parts of his language.",

Schonfeld says that the list documents only public agreements, and that there are probably several others that remain undisclosed.\n\nMany publishers are considering questions such as how licensing — or not licensing — content to generative-AI companies will affect revenue, and the risks or benefits of being among the first to act in this space, Schonfeld says. “Every publisher of a certain scale and above is absolutely grappling with this issue.”\n\nGrowing trend\n\nSeveral big publishers have cashed in on AI licensing deals this year. In May, Informa, the parent company of the UK academic publisher Taylor & Francis, announced that it made a US$10-million deal to license content to Microsoft. The next month, the US academic publisher Wiley announced to its investors that it had earned $23 million from a deal with an unnamed firm developing generative-AI models. In September, the company said that it expected to earn another $21 million from such agreements this financial year. Nature’s news team contacted several other publishers including Elsevier and Springer Nature, Nature’s publisher, about whether they had plans for licensing deals, but received no comment. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\n“We are providing data and content under license for the purposes of training AI, such as LLMs, so that those models become more accurate and relevant for the benefit of everyone who uses them,” a spokesperson for Taylor & Francis said in a statement. “Licensing activities such as this are a key responsibility for research publishers and part of our ongoing commitment to ensuring authors’ ideas make the fullest possible contribution.”",

          "authors": "Richard Monastersky",
          "abstract": "Eight years of legal fighting came down to this one moment.\n\nOn 9 April, Cordelia Bähr and the 2,500-plus women she represented in a landmark climate lawsuit were waiting to hear how the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) would rule.\n\n“I was very, very, very nervous,” says Bähr. But at the same time, she expected her side to prevail.\n\nIn 2015, as a young lawyer in Zurich, Bähr began working on a revolutionary concept in climate-change litigation. While poring over research on the 2003 heatwave in Europe that killed 70,000 people, Bähr learnt that older women died at unusually high rates during that disaster, and that they are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This fact, she realized, opened the door to a lawsuit against the Swiss government for violating the rights of older women by failing to take steps to prevent climate change.\n\nWorking with colleagues and the environmental campaign group Greenpeace Switzerland, Bähr built a case and assembled an association that initially included a few dozen older women, named the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz, or Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection. After filing its first lawsuit in 2016, the group worked its way through the Swiss judicial system, eventually losing its appeal to the federal supreme court in May 2020. Later that year, Bähr and the KlimaSeniorinnen took their case to the European court.\n\nOn that fateful day in April this year, they won. The court ruled that Switzerland was violating the human rights of the KlimaSeniorinnen’s members by not taking adequate measures to limit global warming.\n\nBähr deserves credit as the “brain of the whole thing”, says Elisabeth Stern, a board member of the KlimaSeniorinnen. “She is somewhat of a shy person; she is never in the foreground,” says Stern, who adds that Bähr “was the only one in Switzerland who could have done it”.\n\nOne of the key legal issues was the court deciding that the KlimaSeniorinnen association qualified to claim victim status under the European Convention on Human Rights, by showing that the members’ rights had been violated. Once it established that, the court found that Switzerland had failed to meet its obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "For decades, scientists have disagreed about a fundamental question: how quickly is the Universe expanding? But this year, astronomer Wendy Freedman announced results that could help to put the controversy to rest.\n\nThe long-standing puzzle has been that two methods to measure the cosmic expansion rate, known as the Hubble constant, give stubbornly different answers. Studies using fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background — the afterglow of the Big Bang — suggest that for every megaparsec (Mpc; or 3.2 million light years) farther out one looks, galaxies rush away 67 kilometres per second faster. But when scientists, including Freedman, measured the recession rate of far galaxies and estimated their distance, they got a larger Hubble constant: variously 72–74 km s−1 Mpc−1.\n\nThe method for estimating the distance of galaxies is crucial. It relies on observing the brightness of supernovae (exploding stars) in those galaxies. To calibrate how a supernova’s apparent brightness relates to its distance, researchers rely on comparisons to ‘standard candles’: well-studied stars found relatively nearby, in the Milky Way’s cosmic neighbourhood.\n\nAnalyses led by Adam Riess at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, use stars known as Cepheids and give the higher Hubble constant. So Freedman, at the University of Chicago in Illinois, worked with collaborators to perfect two other types of standard candle that would serve as a cross-check. “She really started building up this independent path,” says Kristen McQuinn, an astronomer at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. That is courageous, says McQuinn, because it requires a lot of telescope observations and painstaking analysis.\n\nThis year, Freedman revealed her findings, which used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). As she announced at conferences in April, and in a preprint posted in August, when she combined the two newer standard candles with supernova data, both analyses put the Universe’s expansion rate within the error margin of the 67 km s−1 Mpc−1 cosmic microwave background results (W. L. Freedman et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/nq36; 2024).",

          "abstract": "Huji Xu’s team was on tenterhooks after delivering the first treatments. “We couldn’t sleep, because all these cases are very sick patients,” says Xu, a rheumatologist at the Naval Medical University in Shanghai, China, who published the first results of a revolutionary cellular therapy for autoimmune diseases in September (X. Wang et al. Cell 187, 4890–4904; 2024).\n\nTwo weeks after receiving engineered immune cells, the first patient — a woman with a debilitating disorder characterized by extreme muscle weakness — told nurses that she had regained enough strength to lift her arms and comb her hair. Two other recipients, both men, with a different condition, said that their symptoms began fading within days. More than six months later, all three recipients were in remission, according to Xu. “We are a little bit more relaxed” now, he says.\n\nThe engineered cells are known as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and have been designed to hunt down and eliminate B cells, a type of immune cell that sometimes runs amok in people with autoimmune disorders. CAR-T-cell therapy is widely used to treat blood cancers involving malignant B cells, but it has also shown some promise for autoimmune diseases.\n\nLast year, teams in Germany revealed that they had used CAR T cells to treat at least 15 people with several autoimmune conditions, with stunning success. Xu’s trial differs from these because it used cells taken from an independent donor, whereas the German teams used cells taken from the person being treated. If successful, the donor strategy could allow for mass production of CAR-T-cell treatments, reducing their costs and extending their reach.\n\nXu trained as a medical doctor in Shanghai. In 1990, he moved to Adelaide, Australia, to start a PhD in immunology and rheumatology, looking at the role of a specific antibody in rheumatic diseases — inflammatory conditions that affect the joints, muscles and bones. Xu went on to research a broad range of subjects, from the biological mechanism of lupus and several types of arthritis, to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and malaria vaccines.\n\nIn 2008, he returned to Shanghai and established a large clinical and research centre for rheumatology. The CAR-T-cell trial was a good fit, says Xu, because of his interest in the underlying causes of rheumatic disease. The woman his team treated had refractory inflammatory myopathy. The men had a type of systemic sclerosis that causes the skin to harden and affects many organs.",

Overall, we find statistically significant but weak (the highest odds ratio is 1.1 per PGS standard deviation) associations between most professional categories and genetic predisposition for at least one neuropsychiatric trait. Secondary analyses in UK Biobank revealed independence of these associations from observed fluid intelligence and sex-specific effects. By leveraging aggregate population trends, we identified patterns in the public interest, such as the mediating effect of education attainment on the association of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder PGS with multiple professional categories. However, at the individual level, PGS explained less than 0.5% of the variance of professional membership, and almost none after we adjusted for education and socio-economic status.",

Study participants were randomly selected to receive relief from all current and prior fines and fees assessed for criminal charges in the county. Fee relief reduced jail bookings 21 mo after randomization and the effect persisted over 44 mo of follow-up. Although fee relief reduced incarceration, financial sanctions had no effect on indicators of lawbreaking. Instead, the control group (who obtained no relief from fines and fees) were rearrested at significantly higher rates because of open arrest warrants for nonpayment. These results indicate the long-term and criminalizing effects of legal debt, supporting claims that financial sanctions disproportionately harm low-income defendants while contributing little to public safety.",

          "abstract": "Institutions allow cooperation to persist when reciprocity and reputation provide insufficient incentives. Yet how they do so remains unclear, especially given that institutions are themselves a form of cooperation. To solve this puzzle, we develop a mathematical model of reputation-based cooperation in which two social dilemmas are nested within one another. The first dilemma, characterized by high individual costs or insufficient monitoring, cannot be solved by reputation alone. The second dilemma, an institutional collective action, involves individuals contributing to change the parameters of the first dilemma in a way that incentivizes cooperation. Our model demonstrates that this nested architecture creates a leverage effect. While insufficient on its own to incentivize cooperation in the first dilemma, reputation incentivizes contributions to the institutional collective action, which, in turn, strengthen the initially weak incentives for cooperation in the first dilemma. Just as a pulley system transforms minimal muscular strength into significant lifting capability, institutions act as cooperative pulleys, transforming initially weak reputational incentives into powerful drivers of cooperative behavior. Based on these results, we suggest that institutions have developed as social technologies, designed by humans to exploit this social leverage effect, just as material technologies are designed to exploit physical laws.",

          "abstract": "The curious chemistry observed in microdroplets has captivated chemists in recent years and has led to an investigation into their ability to drive seemingly impossible chemistries. One particularly interesting capability of these microdroplets is their ability to accelerate reactions by several orders of magnitude. While there have been many investigations into which reactions can be accelerated by confinement within microdroplets, no study has directly compared reaction acceleration at the liquid|liquid and gas|liquid interfaces. Here, we confine glucose oxidase, one of life’s most important enzymes, to microdroplets and monitor the turnover rate of glucose by the electroactive cofactor, hexacyanoferrate (III). We use stochastic electrochemistry to monitor the collision of single femtoliter water droplets on an ultramicroelectrode. We also develop a measurement modality to robustly quantify reaction rates for femtoliter liquid aerosol droplets, where the majority of the interface is gas|liquid. We demonstrate that the gas|liquid interface accelerates enzyme turnover by over an order of magnitude over the liquid|liquid interface. This is the first apples-to-apples comparison of reaction acceleration at two distinct interfaces that indicates that the gas|liquid interface plays a central role in driving curious chemistry.",

The Sap S-layer represents an important virulence factor and cell envelope support structure whose paracrystalline nature is essential for its function. However, the spatial organization of Sap in its lattice state remains elusive. Here, we employed cryoelectron tomography and subtomogram averaging to obtain a map of the Sap S-layer from tubular polymers that revealed a conformational switch between the postassembly protomers and the previously available X-ray structure of the condensed monomers. To build and validate an atomic model of the lattice within this map, we used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, X-ray crystallography, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and biophysics in an integrative structural biology approach. The Sap lattice model produced recapitulates a close-to-physiological arrangement, reveals high-resolution details of lattice contacts, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the stability of the Sap layer.",

          "abstract": "Le Chatelier in 1887 and Powers in 1947 demonstrated that the volume of nanoscale C-S-H (calcium silicate hydrate) particles formed during hydration is smaller than the combined volume of the reactants—the anhydrous Portland cement and water. Hydration has thus been considered as contractive. An experiment shows that the opposite is true above the nanoscale. The porous skeleton of cement paste expands as the growing C-S-H particles push each other apart, similar to crystal growth pressure. This is significant for high-performance concretes (HPC) with low water-cement ratios (w/c ≤ 0.4), where chemical self-desiccation lowers pore relative humidity by 40%, compared to just 1% in traditional concretes (w/c ≈ 0.5). Standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C1608 tests, using 10 mm thick water-immersed specimens, show large shrinkage because the half-time of water ingress is many decades, unable to offset shrinkage-causing self-desiccation. The present experiment, using a laser microscopy-topography technique, proves the opposite—expansion, evidenced by measuring the length changes of water-immersed HPC shards 0.5 mm thick in which the diffusion halftime, only about one hour, allows continuous resaturation of pores, canceling self-desiccation. The faster diffusion (halftime of one hour) enables continuous pore resaturation, preventing shrinkage. When sealed with paraffin oil, the shards self-desiccate and shrink. These findings align with studies since 2015, showing that models excluding hydration expansion cannot fit test data across various specimen sizes and sealing conditions. The results suggest that standardized ASTM tests for the so-called chemical shrinkage in modern concretes with very low water-cement ratios are misleading and need revision.",

          "abstract": "Climate change has emerged as a key threat to biodiversity, leading to broad-scale shifts in distributions of marine and terrestrial species as they attempt to track thermally suitable habitat. By contrast, our understanding of climate responses of freshwater species is relatively undeveloped, limiting our knowledge of whether projected warming will lead to freshwater biodiversity loss. Here, we linked a multicontinental database of riverine fish population abundance time series collected from 1958 to 2019 to temperature data from the same period. Across the sampled localities, waters warmed by 0.21 °C per decade (annual maximum of monthly temperatures). We tested whether fish responded to this change by i) increasing abundance at the cooler poleward limit of species distributions—predicted if warming has opened new opportunities—and ii) decreasing abundance toward the equatorward limit of distributions—predicted if temperatures have exceeded tolerance thresholds. We found that observed population trends were consistent with both of these expected patterns from climatic warming and that the trends were more pronounced in time series covering the longer time periods of 30+ y. The responses consistent with climate change were most evident in species with larger body sizes, higher trophic levels, river–sea migratory behavior, and more widespread distributions. Moreover, positive abundance responses to warming were more likely at higher altitudes where conditions tend to be cooler. These findings indicate that projected future warming will likely lead to widespread shifts in riverine community structure, including abundance declines at the trailing edge of species distributions.",

With electrophysiology, unbiased molecular docking and clustering, molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental validation with mutant cycle analysis, we show that magnolol and honokiol utilize different drug-binding sites, pore and nonpore pockets. The pore blocker utilizes amino acids crucial for chloride passage, whereas the nonpore blocker allosterically modulates the pore residues to hinder ion permeation. Among 17 inhibitors tested, 11 were pore blockers and 6 were nonpore blockers, indicating the importance of this nonpore pocket. Our study provides insights into drug-binding mechanism in TMEM16A together with a rationale for future drug development.",

FTO is ubiquitinated by its E3 ligase DTX2, followed by UFD1 recruitment and subsequent degradation in the proteasome. VES binds to FTO and DTX2, leading to enhanced FTO–DTX2 interaction, FTO ubiquitination, and degradation in FTO-dependent tumor cells. VES suppressed tumor growth and enhanced antitumor immunity and response to immunotherapy in vivo in mouse models. Genetic FTO knockdown or VES treatment increased m 6 A methylation in the LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) gene and decreased LIF mRNA decay, and thus sensitized melanoma cells to T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together, our findings reveal the underlying molecular mechanism for FTO protein degradation and identify a dietary degrader for FTO that inhibits tumor growth and overcomes immunotherapy resistance.",

          "abstract": "High pressure can create extreme conditions that enable the formation of novel materials and the discovery of new phenomena. However, the ability to preserve the desirable characteristics of materials obtained under high pressure has remained an elusive challenge, as the pressure-induced changes are typically reversible, except for the pressure-induced chemical reactions such as polymerization of hydrocarbons. Here, we propose the concept of “pressure aging” (PA) that enables the permanent locking-in of high-pressure structures and their associated enhanced properties in functional materials. Specifically, through the application of PA at 3.3 GPa for 24 h, the two-dimensional ferroelectric CuInP 2 S 6 exhibits a permanent change in Cu configuration after the pressure is fully released. This leads to a 2.5-fold enhancement in remanent polarization and an increase in T c from 317 K to 583 K. In contrast, the samples underwent a compression–decompression cycle but without PA showed only reversible changes in their characteristics. We elucidate the relaxation dynamics during PA using the Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function, providing valuable insights into the temporal evolution of both structural and property changes. Furthermore, the broad applicability of PA strategy has been validated across different materials, underscoring its versatility. Notably, the pressures involved are industrially attainable, and the sample sizes are scalable. Consequently, the implementation of this impactful PA approach introduces a groundbreaking unique dimension to high-pressure research, with significant potential across various scientific domains.",

Yet, training PNN is difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e., training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via an autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources. Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN), and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of the physical process. Using magnetic texture–defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja’s learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform toward efficient autonomous training directly in materials.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the way that digital artists zoom out of the canvas to assess the visual impact of their works, we introduce a conceptually simple yet effective metric for quantifying the clarity of digital images. This metric contrasts original images with progressively “melted” counterparts, produced by randomly flipping adjacent pixel pairs. It measures the presence of stable structures, assigning the value zero to completely uniform or random images and finite values for those with discernible patterns. This metric respects the color diversity of the original image and withstands image compression and color quantization. Its suitability for diverse image analysis problems is demonstrated through its effective evaluation of textural images, the identification of structural transitions in physical systems like the Potts model, and its consistency with color theory in digital arts. This allows us to demonstrate that color in visual art functions as a state variable, akin to the spin configuration in magnets, driving artistic designs to transition between states with distinct clarity. When combined with the Shannon entropy, which quantifies color diversity, the structural stability metric can serve as a navigation tool for artists to explore pathways on the complex structural information landscape toward the completion of their artwork. As a practical demonstration, we apply our metric to refine and optimize an emote design for a video game. The structural stability metric emerges as a versatile tool for extracting nuanced structural information from digital images, which may enhance decision-making and data analysis across scientific and creative domains.",

This cell plasticity is particularly prominent in more regenerative vertebrates such as zebrafish, yet the molecular basis by which cells transdifferentiate into another cell type upon injury remains unclear. Here, we investigate the epigenetic basis of regenerative transdifferentiation in the inner ear, where supporting cells (SCs) generate mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) upon damage. By comparing the chromatin landscapes in regenerative zebrafish and green anole lizards versus nonregenerative mice, we identified a class of enhancers that function in progenitors to generate HCs and then are selectively maintained in SCs of regenerative vertebrates to regenerate HCs. In particular, we uncovered a syntenic class of long-range enhancers for Atoh1 , a master transcription factor for HC differentiation. In the absence of injury, these enhancers maintain accessibility in SCs through adulthood but are prevented from driving zebrafish atoh1a expression through Notch repression. Deletion of these enhancers not only impaired atoh1a expression and HC formation during development but also blocked the ability of SCs to transdifferentiate into HCs during regeneration. Moreover, defects were specific to the inner ear versus the lateral line, revealing distinct mechanisms of regeneration in these mechanosensory organs. These findings reveal a class of regenerative enhancer that maintains competency of inner ear SCs to upregulate atoh1a and transdifferentiate into HCs upon damage. We propose that the continued accessibility of developmental enhancers for one cell fate in lineage-related cells may be a common theme underlying adult cell plasticity in regenerative vertebrates.",

Rare fold-switching events by KaiB provide a critical delay in the negative feedback loop of this posttranslational oscillator. In this study, we experimentally and computationally investigate the temperature dependence of fold switching and its mechanism. We demonstrate that the stability of gsKaiB increases with temperature compared to fsKaiB and that the Q10 value for the gsKaiB → fsKaiB transition is nearly three times smaller than that for the reverse transition in a construct optimized for NMR studies. Simulations and native-state hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR experiments suggest that fold switching can involve both partially and completely unfolded intermediates. The simulations predict that the transition state for fold switching coincides with isomerization of conserved prolines in the most rapidly exchanging region, and we confirm experimentally that proline isomerization is a rate-limiting step for fold switching. We explore the implications of our results for temperature compensation, a hallmark of circadian clocks, through a kinetic model.",

The latest cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures provide unique insights into channel function and pharmacology, opening avenues for different therapeutic strategies against human diseases associated with KCNQ1 mutations. However, these structures also raise fundamental questions about the mechanisms of ion permeation. Cryo-EM structures thought to represent the open state of the channel feature a cavity region not wide enough for accommodation of hydrated K + . To understand how K + passes through the cavity constriction, we utilized microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the KCNQ1/KCNE3 cryo-EM structure, characterized mutants at the G345 residue situated at the narrowest point of the cavity, and recorded single channels. The findings indicate that ions become partially dehydrated at the constriction, which enables permeation. MD simulations demonstrate that the constriction can impede the flow of ions through the channel’s pore, a finding that is corroborated by mutational screening and single-channel recordings. Reduced channel conductance is the key mechanism underlying reported pathological KCNQ1 mutations at or near the constriction site.",

Notably, the temporal correlation of neural activity at rest, known as the intrinsic timescale, increases systematically along this hierarchy in both primates and rodents, analogous to the increasing scale and complexity of spatial receptive fields. However, how the timescales for task-related activity vary across brain regions and whether their hierarchical organization appears consistently across different mammalian species remain unexplored. Here, we show that both the intrinsic timescale and those of task-related activity follow a similar hierarchical gradient in the cortices of monkeys, rats, and mice. We also found that these timescales covary similarly in both the cortex and basal ganglia, whereas the timescales of thalamic activity are shorter than cortical timescales and do not conform to the hierarchical order predicted by their cortical projections. These results suggest that the hierarchical gradient of cortical timescales might represent a universal feature of intracortical circuits in the mammalian brain.",

For example, empirical evidence suggests that water was delivered to the Earth by hydrated planetesimals from distant regions of the Solar System. Recently, several morphologically inactive near-Earth objects were reported to experience significant nongravitational accelerations inconsistent with radiation-based effects, and possibly explained by volatile-driven outgassing. However, these “dark comets” display no evidence of comae in archival images, which are the defining feature of cometary activity. Here, we report detections of nongravitational accelerations on seven additional objects classified as inactive (doubling the population) that could also be explainable by asymmetric mass loss. A detailed search of archival survey and targeted data rendered no detection of dust activity in any of these objects in individual or stacked images. We calculate dust production limits of ∼ 10, 0.1 , and 0.1 kg s − 1 for 1998 FR 11 , 2001 ME 1 , and 2003 RM with these data, indicating little or no dust surrounding the objects during the observations. This set of dark comets reveals the delineation between two distinct populations: larger, “outer” dark comets on eccentric orbits that are end members of a continuum in activity level of comets, and smaller, “inner” dark comets on near-circular orbits that could signify a different different population. These objects may trace various stages in the life cycle of a previously undetected, but potentially numerous, volatile-rich population that may have provided essential material to the Earth.",

Despite our substantial understanding of plant responses to low humidity, molecular mechanisms underlying the high humidity (HH) response are much less well understood. In this study, we investigated early responses to HH in Arabidopsis . Expression of CYP707A3 , encoding an abscisic acid (ABA) 8′-hydroxylase, is induced by HH within 10 min, which leads to a decrease in foliar ABA level. We identified that the combined action of CAMTA3 and CAMTA2 transcription factors regulate this response. This regulation requires a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain of CAMTA3. Transcriptomes of HH-regulated genes are enriched in those related to calcium signaling, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGCs). Moreover, HH induces CNGC2- and CNGC4-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations in leaves within a few minutes. We also found that CNGC2, CNGC4, and CAMTAs participate in HH-induced hyponastic movement of petioles. Taken together, our results indicate that CNGC2/CNGC4-Ca 2+ -CaM-CAMTA3/CAMTA2 acts as a primary regulatory module to trigger downstream HH responses.",

          "abstract": "The routing of blood flow throughout the brain vasculature is precisely controlled by mechanisms that serve to maintain a fine balance between local neuronal demands and vascular supply of nutrients. We recently identified two capillary endothelial cell (cEC)-based mechanisms that control cerebral blood flow in vivo: 1) electrical signaling, mediated by extracellular K + -dependent activation of strong inward rectifying K + (Kir2.1) channels, which are steeply activated by hyperpolarization and thus are capable of cell-to-cell propagation, and 2) calcium (Ca 2+ ) signaling, which reflects release of Ca 2+ via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP 3 R)—a target of G q -protein-coupled receptor signaling. Notably, Ca 2+ signals were restricted to the cell in which they were initiated. Unexpectedly, we found that these two mechanisms, which were presumed to operate in distinct spatiotemporal realms, are linked such that Kir2.1-dependent hyperpolarization induces increases in the electrical driving force for Ca 2+ entry into cECs through resident TRPV4 channels. This process, termed electrocalcium (E-Ca) coupling, enhances IP 3 R-mediated Ca 2+ release via a Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ -release mechanism, and allows focally induced hyperpolarization, including that initiated by ATP-dependent K + (K ATP ) channels, to travel cell-to-cell via activation of Kir2.1 channels in adjacent cells, providing a mechanism for the “pseudopropagation” of Ca 2+ signals. Computational modeling supported the basic features of E-Ca coupling and provided insight into the intracellular processes involved. Collectively, these data provide strong support for the concept of E-Ca coupling and provide a mechanism for the spatiotemporal integration of diverse signaling pathways in the control of cerebral blood flow.",

          "abstract": "The cyclopentadiene (C 5 H 6 ) molecule has emerged as a molecular building block of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous nanostructures such as corannulene (C 20 H 10 ), nanobowls (C 40 H 10 ), and fullerenes (C 60 ) in deep space. However, the underlying elementary gas-phase processes synthesizing cyclopentadiene from acyclic hydrocarbon precursors have remained elusive. Here, by merging crossed molecular beam experiments with rate coefficient calculations and comprehensive astrochemical modeling, we afford persuasive testimony on an unconventional low-temperature cyclization pathway to cyclopentadiene from acyclic precursors through the reaction of the simplest diatomic organic radical—methylidyne (CH)—with 1,3-butadiene (C 4 H 6 ) representing main route to cyclopentadiene observed in TaurusMolecular Cloud. This facile route provides potential solution for the incorporation of the cyclopentadiene moiety in complex aromatic systems via bottom–up molecular mass growth processes and offers an entry point to the low-temperature chemistry in deep space leading eventually to nonplanar PAHs in our carbonaceous Universe.",

Germline gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in CARD11, a pivotal regulator of lymphocyte antigen receptor signaling, cause the lymphoproliferative disease B-cell expansion with NF-κB and T-cell anergy, which is frequently associated with HLH development. Given that CARD11 is physiologically expressed not only in lymphocytes but also in dendritic cells (DCs), we explored whether enforced CARD11 signaling in DCs contributes to immunopathology. We demonstrated that exclusive DC-intrinsic expression of CARD11-GOF in mice was sufficient to induce a lethal autoinflammatory syndrome that mimicked human HLH. Mechanistically, DC-intrinsic CARD11-GOF signaling triggered cell-autonomous inflammatory cytokine production via MALT1 paracaspase engagement. Genetic deletion of Malt1 in CARD11-GOF-expressing animals reversed the hyperinflammatory phenotype. These results highlight the significant role of enforced CARD11/MALT1 signaling in DCs as a contributor to HLH pathology and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for HLH treatment.",

However, the underlying mechanism for governing the migration mode switching is still unclear. Here, we revealed that epithelial tumor cells could develop a stable directional mode driven by hyperactivated ERK activity. This highly activated and dynamically changing ERK activity, called pERK transition, is crucial for inducing the switch from pauses state to directional movement and is also necessary for maintaining epithelial tumor cells in the directional mode. PERK transition integrated pERK surf, the dynamic and localized ERK activity at the leading edge. The sequential activation of RhoA and Rac1 by pERK transition played critical roles in generation of pERK surf activity through a movement feedback mechanism. PERK transition activity converted the orderly collective migration into the disordered dispersal movement, enhanced the invasiveness of epithelial tumor cells, and promoted their metastasis in immune-deficient mice. These findings revealed that the exquisite spatiotemporal organization of ERK activity orchestrates migration and invasion of tumor cells and provide evidence for the mechanism underlying migration mode switching in epithelial tumor cells.",

However, the extent of such high-integrity forest habitats remaining for biodiversity is unknown. Here, we quantify the amount of high-integrity tropical rainforests, as a fraction of total forest cover, within the geographic ranges of 16,396 species of terrestrial vertebrates worldwide. We found up to 90% of the humid tropical ranges of forest-dependent vertebrates was encompassed by forest cover. Concerningly, however, merely 25% of these remaining rainforests are of high integrity. Forest-dependent species that are threatened and declining and species with small geographic ranges have disproportionately low proportions of high-integrity forest habitat left. Our work brings much needed attention to the poor quality of much of the forest estate remaining for biodiversity across the humid tropics. The targeted preservation of the world’s remaining high-integrity tropical rainforests that are currently unprotected is a critical conservation priority that may help alleviate the biodiversity crisis in these hyperdiverse and irreplaceable ecosystems. Enhanced efforts worldwide to preserve tropical rainforest integrity are essential to meet the targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity’s 2022 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework which aims to achieve near zero loss of high biodiversity importance areas (including ecosystems of high integrity) by 2030.",

This study provides evidence indicating the practice of deep cave collective rituals in the Levant during the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) period. It is demonstrated that these gatherings occurred within a distinct ritual compound and were centered around an engraved object in the deepest part of Manot Cave, a pivotal EUP site in southwest Asia. The ritual compound, segregated from the living areas, encompasses a large gallery partitioned by a cluster of remarkable speleothems. Within this gallery, an engraved boulder stands out, displaying geometric signs suggesting a unique representation of a tortoise. Isotopic analysis of calcite crusts on the boulder’s grooves revealed alignment with values found in speleothems from the cave dated to ~37 to 35 ka BP. Additionally, meticulous shape analysis of the grooves’ cross-section and the discernible presence of microlinear scratches on the grooves’ walls confirmed their anthropogenic origin. Examination of stalagmite laminae (36 ka BP) near the engraved boulder revealed a significant presence of wood ash particles within. This finding provides evidence for using fire to illuminate the dark, deep part of the cave during rituals. Acoustic tests conducted in various cave areas indicate that the ritual compound was well suited for communal gatherings, facilitating conversations, speeches, and hearing. Our results underscore the critical role of collective practices centered around a symbolic object in fostering a functional social network within the regional EUP communities.",

          "abstract": "Retinal rods and cones underlie scotopic and photopic vision, respectively. Their pigments exhibit spontaneous isomerizations (quantal noise) in darkness due to intrinsic thermal energy. This quantal noise, albeit exceedingly low in rods, dictates the light threshold for scotopic vision. The same quantal noise in cones, however, is too low to explain the much higher diurnal light threshold. Separately, a dark continuous noise is present in rods, long accepted to originate from an intrinsic random activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase enzyme mediating phototransduction downstream of the pigment. Here, we report the surprising finding that most of this rod dark continuous noise actually originates from rhodopsin itself. Importantly, we found the same continuous noise with a much higher magnitude from cone pigments. The rod and cone continuous noises are apparently both associated with a hitherto unrecognized “metastable” pigment conformational state physiologically resembling that in apo-opsin (opsin devoid of chromophore) and is intermittently active for very brief moments. The cone holopigment’s high continuous noise is expected to act as an intrinsic equivalent light and adapt the cone dramatically, accounting for a major part of the light-sensitivity difference between rods and cones in darkness.",

Multiple chaperones interact with and disaggregate amyloid fibrils, which impacts amyloid propagation and cellular phenotypes. However, it remains poorly understood whether and how site-specific binding of chaperones to amyloids facilitates the concerted disaggregation process and modulates physiological consequences in vivo. Here, we identified binding sites of Ssa1, Sis1, and Hsp104 chaperones for Sup35, the protein determinant of yeast prion [ PSI + ] yeast. Our biophysical and genetic analyses with various Sup35 deletion mutants and amyloid conformations revealed that the Ssa1-binding to the region outside amyloid core plays a key role in facilitating disaggregation and propagation of yeast prions both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we developed a reconstitution system, including the Ssa1-binding tag and the HAP/Caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) hybrid chaperones, and found that this reconstitution system successfully degraded distinct prion strain conformations. Together, these results show that the properly positioned, exposed Ssa1-binding region in amyloid fibrils influences the efficiency of amyloid disaggregation and propagation, and eventually prion strain phenotypes. More broadly, our findings provide molecular foundations for previous, puzzling observations of prion propagation in vivo, and offer insights into elimination of amyloid deposits in cells.",

In contrast to Frenkel exciton–polarons, an excimer is long-lived and energetically low-lying due to stabilization resulting from a substantial reorganization of the intermolecular geometry. Here, we show that ultrafast electron diffraction can follow the dynamics of solid-state excimer formation in polycrystalline thin films of a molecular semiconductor, revealing both the key reaction modes and the eventual structure of the emitting state. We study the prototypical organic semiconductor zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in its crystallographic α -phase as a model excimeric system. We show that the excimer forms in a two-step process starting with a fast dimerization (approx. 0.4 ps) followed by a subsequent slow shear-twist motion (14 ps) leading to an alignment of the π -systems of the involved monomers. This structural distortion persists well beyond 300 ps. Furthermore, we show that while the same excimer geometry is present in partially fluorinated derivatives of ZnPc, the formation kinematics slow down with increasing level of fluorination.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax parasites can lie dormant in the liver as hypnozoites, activating weeks to months after sporozoite inoculation to cause relapsing malarial illness. It is not known what biological processes govern hypnozoite activation. We use longitudinal data from the most detailed cohort study ever conducted in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax were endemic to fit a simple within-host mathematical model of P. vivax hypnozoite activation. 1,344 children living on the Thailand–Myanmar border were followed daily for 21 mo. There were 2,504 vivax and 1,164 falciparum malaria symptomatic episodes recorded over 1988 person-years. The model assumes that hypnozoites activate independently at a constant rate (“exponential clock model”). When this model was embedded in a stochastic framework for repeated infectious mosquito bites, with seasonality inferred from the incidence of clinical falciparum malaria episodes, it explained the observed temporal patterns of multiple (up to 13) recurrent vivax malaria episodes. Under this model, we estimate the mean dormancy period for a single hypnozoite to be 6 mo (i.e., a half-life of 4 mo). We use the calibrated within-host model to characterize population-level overdispersion in the risk of relapse, and assess the potential utility of a serological test for radical cure in low transmission settings. We show that mefloquine treatment of falciparum malaria eliminates early vivax relapses; and that there are substantially more P. vivax recurrences than expected under the model following artesunate monotherapy treatment for falciparum malaria. These results suggest that hypnozoites can be activated by symptomatic malarial illness.",

Epidemiological studies have reported potential carcinogenic risks of PFAS based on their widespread occurrence and population exposure. In this study, we observed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a common PFAS, functions as a mechanical regulator in lung cancer cells. PFOA exposure reduces cell stiffness, thereby decreasing cell adhesion and enhancing immune evasion, ultimately exacerbating tumor metastasis. In various lung cancer models, more aggressive tumor metastases have been observed in the PFOA exposure group. Additionally, serum PFOA levels in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma were significantly higher than those in patients with early-stage disease. Mechanistically, the interaction between PFOA and transmembrane integrins in cancer cells triggers changes in cellular mechanical properties, leading to the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and activation of the intracellular FAK-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that in individuals with lung adenocarcinoma, PFOA can increase the risk of cancer metastasis even at daily exposure levels.",

          "abstract": "Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to understand why defense chemistry in individual plants is so diverse. A major challenge has been teasing apart the importance of concentration vs. composition of defense compounds and resolving the mechanisms of diversity effects that determine plant resistance against herbivores. Accordingly, we first outline nonexclusive mechanisms by which phytochemical diversity may increase toxicity of a mixture compared to the average effect of each compound alone. We then leveraged independent in vitro, in vivo transgenic, and organismal experiments to test the effect of equimolar concentrations of purified milkweed toxins in isolation vs. mixtures on the specialist and sequestering monarch butterfly. We show that cardenolide toxin mixtures from milkweed plants enhance resistance against this herbivore compared to equal concentrations of single compounds. In mixtures, highly potent toxins dominated the inhibition of the monarch’s target enzyme (Na + /K + -ATPase) in vitro, revealing toxin-specific affinity for the adapted enzyme in the absence of other physiological adaptations of the monarch. Mixtures also caused increased mortality in CRISPR-edited adult Drosophila melanogaster with the monarch enzyme in vivo, whereas wild-type flies showed lower survival regardless of mixture type. Finally, although experimentally administered mixtures were not more toxic to monarch caterpillars than single compounds overall, increasing caterpillar sequestration from mixtures resulted in an increasing burden for growth compared to single compounds. Phytochemical diversity likely provides an economical plant defense by acting on multiple aspects of herbivore physiology and may be particularly effective against sequestering specialist herbivores.",

          "abstract": "Pannexin 1 (Panx1) constitutes a large pore channel responsible for the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from apoptotic cells. Strong evidence indicates that caspase-mediated cleavage of the C-terminus promotes the opening of the Panx1 channel by unplugging the pore. However, this simple pore-plugging mechanism alone cannot account for the observation that a Panx1 construct ending before the caspase cleavage site remains closed. Here, we show that a helical region located immediately before the caspase cleavage site, referred to as the “C-terminal activating domain (CAD)”, plays a pivotal role in facilitating Panx1 activation. Electrophysiology and mutagenesis studies uncovered that two conserved leucine residues within the CAD play a pivotal role. Cryoelectron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis of the construct ending before reaching the CAD demonstrated that the N terminus extends into an intracellular pocket. In contrast, the construct including the CAD revealed that this domain occupies the intracellular pocket, causing the N terminus to flip upward within the pore. Analysis of electrostatic free energy landscape in the closed conformation indicated that the intracellular side of the ion permeation pore may be occupied by anions like ATP, creating an electrostatic barrier for anions attempting to permeate the pore. When the N terminus flips up, it diminishes the positively charged surface, thereby reducing the drive to accumulate anions inside the pore. This dynamic change in the electrostatic landscape likely contributes to the selection of permeant ions. Collectively, these experiments put forth a mechanism in which C-terminal cleavage liberates the CAD, causing the repositioning of the N terminus to promote Panx1 channel opening.",

Production (or activation) of radical PAHs and propagation of their resulting reactions require efficient dehydrogenation, but the preferred method of hydrogen loss is not well understood. Unimolecular hydrogen ejection (i.e., direct C─H bond fission) and bimolecular radical abstraction are two main candidate pathways. We performed a computational study to characterize the role of H ejection, particularly as a driver for radical-centric hydrocarbon-growth mechanisms and particle formation. Electronic structure calculations establish that C─H bond strengths span a broad range of energies, which can be weaker than 30 kcal/mol in some C 9 and C 13 PAH radicals. At T &gt; 1200 K, calculated thermal rates for hydrogen ejection from weak C─H bonds at zigzag sites on PAH radicals are significantly larger than typical H-abstraction rates. These results are highly relevant in the context of chain reactions of radical species and soot inception under fuel-rich combustion conditions. Furthermore, calculated microcanonical rates that include the additional internal energy released by bond formation (e.g., ring closure to yield C 9 H 9 ) yield significantly higher rates than those associated with full thermalization. These microcanonical considerations are relevant to the astrochemical processes associated with hydrocarbon growth and processing in the low-density interstellar environment.",

This study employs a multiproxy approach (phytolith, starch, and fungi) to analyze microfossil remains associated with pottery vessels from the earliest phase of the Shangshan site (ca. 10,000 to 9,000 cal. BP). The results indicate that rice was consumed as a dietary staple and used for brewing fermented beverages with a qu starter containing Monascus mold and yeast as fermentation agents. The fermentation ingredients included rice, supplemented with other cereals (Job’s tears, Panicoideae, and Triticeae), acorn, and lily. This rice-fungi-based multiplant brewing method marked the earliest-known alcoholic fermentation technique in East Asia. The emergence of this fermentation technology is attributable to the early development of rice domestication and the arrival of the wet-warm Holocene climate, which was favorable for fungal growth. These alcoholic beverages likely played a pivotal role in ceremonial feasting, highlighting their ritual function as a driving factor that may have stimulated the intensive utilization and widespread cultivation of rice in Neolithic China.",

Many imaging techniques exist for mapping the distribution of medical agent-carrying nanoparticles in tissues, but they cannot capture the three-dimensional context of tissues with single nanoparticle resolution. Here, we developed 3DEM-NPD, a three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D EM) machine learning strategy to image and map single nanoparticle distributions (NPD) in tissues. 3DEM-NPD provides unbiased visualization and quantification of individual nanoparticles within organs. We applied this technique to quantify nanoparticle transport through tumor blood vessel endothelial cells. We measured the cell diameter, surface area, and volume and found that traditional 2D EM cannot accurately measure these features. We used machine learning to locate over 550,000 nanoparticles in less than 3 h with an accuracy of over 82%. The 3DEM-NPD method allowed us to establish a metric to quantify nanoparticle transport at the single nanoparticle level and to quantify the morphological features of ~2,800 vesicles. We find that on average there are only 2.4 nanoparticles per vesicle with a theoretical maximum of 158 nanoparticles per vesicle (~66x increase). These surprising results suggest the need to increase vesicle encapsulation efficiency for improved transport and they provide a benchmark for increasing nanoparticle transport and delivery. This technique may provide unique insights into the interactions between medical agents, drug carriers, emerging materials, and cells at the single-nanoparticle level throughout tissues.",

We study a generic class of active matter systems with nonreciprocal interactions and demonstrate the existence of true long-range polar order in two dimensions and above, both at the linear level and by including all relevant nonlinearities in the Renormalization Group sense. We achieve this by uncovering a mapping of our scalar active mixture theory to the Toner–Tu theory of dry polar active matter by employing a suitably defined polar order parameter. We then demonstrate that the complete effective field theory—which includes all the soft modes and the relevant nonlinear terms—belongs to the (Burgers-) Kardar–Parisi–Zhang universality class. This classification allows us to prove the stability of the emergent polar long-range order in scalar nonreciprocal mixtures in two dimensions, and hence a conclusive violation of the Mermin–Wagner theorem.",

          "abstract": "Mn 2+ coordinated by orthophosphate (Pi), metabolites, or peptides acts as a superoxide dismutase (SOD), and these Mn antioxidant complexes are universally accumulated in extremely radiation-resistant cell types across the tree of life. This behavior prompted design of decapeptide DP1 (DEHGTAVMLK) as a Mn 2+ ligand, and development of a highly potent Mn 2+ -antioxidant (MDP) containing [Pi] = 25 mM, and [DP1] = 3 mM, the ratio found in the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans , with [Mn 2+ ] = 1 mM. MDP is an exceptional antioxidant, both in vitro and in vivo, and has reinvigorated the development of radiation-inactivated whole-cell vaccines. This study investigates the nature of the active Mn 2+ complex in MDP. We measure the affinity of DP1 for the substitutionally labile Mn 2+ ion using isothermal-titration calorimetry (ITC) and use changes in the Mn 2+ solution EPR spectrum to determine affinities of Mn 2+ for DP1 and for Pi, and to monitor Mn 2+ ligation while titrated with the fixed Pi/DP1 ratio of MDP, 25/3, using ENDOR/ESEEM to characterize DP1 ligation to Mn 2+ . In parallel, 1 H NMR of DP1 was used to monitor binding interactions between Pi and DP1, and DP1 binding to the diamagnetic Ca 2+ . We report: i) DP1 forms an extremely weak, dynamic Mn 2+ complex (K a ≈ 40 M −1 ) ii) Mn 2+ binds Pi much more strongly (K a ≈ 390 M −1 ) as shown previously, but iii) DP1 and Pi jointly bind to Mn 2+ in MDP to form a ternary Mn 2+ (Pi) (DP1) complex with greater formation-constant than Pi alone (K a app ≈ 670 M −1 ). It is this ternary complex that is the superb antioxidant in MDP.",

Despite its importance, the multiphase photochemistry of BBOA after light absorption remains poorly understood due to challenges in determining the oxidant concentrations and the reaction kinetics within aerosol particles. In this study, we explored the photochemical reactivity of BBOA particles in multiphase S(IV) oxidation to sulfate. We found that sulfate formation in BBOA particles under light is predominantly driven by photosensitization involving the triplet excited states ( 3 BBOA * ) instead of iron, nitrate, and S(IV) photochemistry. Rates in BBOA particles are three orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the bulk solution, primarily due to the fast interfacial reactions. Our results highlight that the chemistry of 3 BBOA * in particles can greatly contribute to the formation of sulfate, as an example of the secondary pollutants. Photosensitization of BBOA will likely become increasingly crucial due to the intensified global wildfires.",

          "abstract": "Proteins play a central role in most biological processes within the cell, and deciphering how they interact is key to understand their function. Cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry is an essential tool for elucidating protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Despite its importance, we still know surprisingly little about the principles that underlie the process of chemical cross-link formation itself and how it is influenced by different physicochemical factors. To understand the molecular details of cross-link formation, we have set up a comprehensive kinetic model and carried out simulations of protein cross-linking on large protein complexes. We dissect the contribution on the cross-link yield of parameters such as amino acid reactivity, cross-linker concentration, and hydrolysis rate. Our model can compute cross-link formation based solely on the structure of a protein complex, thereby enabling realistic predictions for a diverse set of systems. We quantitatively show how cross-links and mono-links are in direct competition and how the hydrolysis rate and abundance of cross-linker and proteins directly influence their relative formation. We show how cross-links and mono-links exist in an “all-against-all” competition due to their simultaneous formation, resulting in a nonintuitive network of interdependence. We show that this interdependence is locally confined and mainly limited to direct neighbors or residues in direct vicinity. These results enable us to identify the optimal cross-linker concentration at which the maximal number of cross-links is formed. Taken together, our study establishes a comprehensive kinetic model to quantitatively describe cross-link formation for PPIs.",

The S-MIF effect, experimentally demonstrated to result from photochemical reactions, has now been observed in coal combustion, expanding our understanding of this phenomenon. Our study reveals that the negative Δ 33 S anomalies produced by coal combustion are consistent with similar anomalies observed in present-day sulfate aerosols in Beijing, China, and the black crust sulfates formed on building stones, monument walls, and sculptures in Europe that contribute to carbonate stone deterioration and cultural heritage damage. This finding provides independent evidence for a critical role of atmospheric sulfate from coal combustion in maintaining isotopic balance and offers an effective method for tracing sulfate aerosol sources. These insights are vital for developing more effective regulatory policies to control air pollution and protect public health. Given that coal energy production remains a significant issue in climate science, accurately mapping the global distribution of its by-products is imperative.",

          "abstract": "DNA repair systems are essential to maintain genome integrity and stability. Some obligate endosymbionts that experience long-term symbiosis with the insect hosts, however, have lost their key components for DNA repair. It is largely unexplored how the bacterial endosymbionts cope with the increased demand for mismatch repairs under heat stresses. Here, we showed that ibpA, a small heat shock protein encoded by Buchnera aphidicola , directly interacted with the cytoskeletal actin to prevent its aggregation in bacteriocytes, thus reinforcing the stability of bacteriocytes. However, the succession of 11 adenines in the promoter of ibpA is extremely prone to mismatching error, e.g., a single adenine deletion, which impairs the induction of ibpA under heat stress. Coinfection with a facultative endosymbiont Serratia symbiotica remarkably reduced the mutagenesis rate in the Buchnera genome and potentially prevented a single adenine deletion in ibpA promoter, thereby alleviating the heat vulnerability of aphid bacteriocytes. Furthermore, Serratia encoded mutH, a conserved core protein of prokaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR), accessed to Buchnera cells, which complemented Buchnera mutL and mutS in constituting an active MMR. Our findings imply that a full complement of a prokaryotic MMR system assembled by two bacterial endosymbionts contributes significantly to the thermostability of aphid bacteriocytes in an ibpA-dependent manner, furnishing a distinct molecular link among tripartite symbioses in shaping resilience and adaptation of their insect hosts to occupy other ecological niches.",

Here, we reconstructed the origin and evolutionary history of auxin-mediated acid growth. Comparative phylogenomic analysis showed that most core components of acid growth originated in Charophyta and then underwent subclass expansion and functional innovation during plant terrestrialization. In Charophyceae algae Chara braunii, we found that PM H + -ATPase has formed a core regulatory module with TMK and PP2C.D, which can be activated by photosynthesis-dependent phosphorylation through light rather than auxin. Despite the lack of canonical auxin receptor TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB), auxin elicits significant internodal elongation and transcriptional reprogramming in C. braunii , implying the existence of an ancient auxin-mediated growth mechanism. We propose that the evolution of acid growth represents a neofunctional adaptation to terrestrial environments, in which PM H + -ATPase in carbon concentrating for photosynthesis was utilized to acidify apoplast for cell expansion, and the core components responsible for acid growth eventually established a regulatory network in land plants by connecting with the TIR1/AFB pathway.",

More broadly, abiotic abundance might not reflect biotic abundance in the organisms in which the genetic code evolved. Here, we instead identify which protein domains date to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and then infer the order of recruitment from deviations of their ancestrally reconstructed amino acid frequencies from the still-ancient post-LUCA controls. We find that smaller amino acids were added to the code earlier, with no additional predictive power in the previous consensus order. Metal-binding (cysteine and histidine) and sulfur-containing (cysteine and methionine) amino acids were added to the genetic code much earlier than previously thought. Methionine and histidine were added to the code earlier than expected from their molecular weights and glutamine later. Early methionine availability is compatible with inferred early use of S-adenosylmethionine and early histidine with its purine-like structure and the demand for metal binding. Even more ancient protein sequences—those that had already diversified into multiple distinct copies prior to LUCA—have significantly higher frequencies of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine) and lower frequencies of valine and glutamic acid than single-copy LUCA sequences. If at least some of these sequences predate the current code, then their distinct enrichment patterns provide hints about earlier, alternative genetic codes.",

Further, despite significant progress toward a nonhormonal male contraceptive targeting the protein encoded by one of these genes, epididymal peptidase inhibitor (EPPIN), and associations found between mutations in EPPIN and an increased risk of male infertility, neither EPPIN nor any closely related whey acidic protein four-disulfide core (WFDC) gene have been explored functionally. To clarify the involvement of WFDC genes in male fertility, we strategically used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate mice lacking 13, 10, 5, or 4 genes within the cluster and demonstrated that males with deletions of 13, 10, or 4 genes (Wfdc6a, Eppin, Wfdc8, and Wfdc6a) were sterile due to an arrest in spermatogenesis, preventing formation beyond round spermatids. In contrast, the five gene knockout (KO) males (lacking Wfdc16 , Wfdc9 , Wfdc10 , Wfdc11 , and Wfdc13 ), despite normal spermatogenesis and sperm counts, were infertile due to defects in sperm motility and increased sperm death. Similarly to our previously reported Spint3 single gene KO, Wfdc3 single KO mice were fertile with no obvious reproductive phenotype. Our KO mouse studies to explore the entire WFDC locus of closely related genes have clarified the functional requirements of WFDC locus genes in different aspects of male fertility. Our research has implications for improving clinical diagnoses of male infertility and identifying additional targets for nonhormonal male contraception.",

Desynchrony between the SCN and the external environment leads to metabolic dysfunction in shift workers. Similarly, mice with markedly shortened endogenous period due to the deletion of circadian REV-ERBα/β nuclear receptors in the SCN (SCN DKO) exhibit increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity (DIO) on a 24 h light:dark cycle while mice with REV-ERBs deleted in hepatocytes (HepDKO) display exacerbated hepatosteatosis in response to a high-fat diet. Here, we show that inducing deletion of hepatocyte REV-ERBs in SCN DKO mice (Hep-SCN DDKO) rescued the exacerbated DIO and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, without affecting the shortened behavioral period. These findings suggest that metabolic disturbances due to environmental desynchrony with the central clock are due to effects on peripheral clocks which can be mitigated by matching peripheral and central clock periods even in a desynchronous environment. Thus, maintaining synchrony within an organism, rather than between endogenous and exogenous clocks, may be a viable target for the treatment of metabolic disorders associated with circadian disruption.",

Intra-articular injection of BTB resulted in GPR65-dependent sensitization of knee-innervating neurons and nocifensive behaviors in mice.

We conducted host genomic data mining and uncovered two genetically divergent rodent-associated hepeviruses, and two bat-associated hepeviruses genetically related to known bat-associated strains. We thus analyzed 2,565 liver specimens from 108 rodent and shrew species sampled from globally understudied regions and hosts in Africa, Asia, and Latin America during 2011-2018 for hepeviruses by RT–PCR. We detected 63 positive field samples (2.5%, 95% CI 1.9-3.1) from 14 animal species, including two coinfections with genetically divergent strains and significant variation ( X 2 , P &lt; 0.001) in detection rates between study sites. Strain-specific qRT–PCR assays showed virus concentrations between 9.2 × 10 2 and 3.2 × 10 9 copies/g. We recovered 24 near-complete hepeviral genomes from rodents, shrews, and bats, all showing three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), some including putative late domains that may be associated with quasi-envelopment. Rodent-derived hepeviruses grouped into five clades clustering in basal sister relationship to human- (31 to 84% distance in translated ORF1-3) and rat-associated HEV. Parsimony-based analyses and cophylogenetic reconciliations revealed that rodents were predominant sources of hepeviral cross-order host shifts. Bayesian ancestral state reconstructions substantiated a direct origin of human-associated HEV in ungulates such as swine and camelids (posterior probability 0.8), whereas the nonrecent evolutionary origins of human- and ungulate-associated HEV were projected to rodent hosts (posterior probability &gt; 0.9). Our results elucidate the genealogy of human HEV and warrant increased surveillance and experimental risk assessments for rodent-associated hepeviruses.",

In this Perspective, we make the case that the study of these unique, divergent, and poorly characterized organisms represents an exciting frontier in microbiology. This burgeoning field has already achieved several critical breakthroughs, including metagenomic sequence-based reconstructions of the metabolic and biosynthetic capabilities of diverse Patescibacteria and the development of generalizable strategies for their cultivation and genetic manipulation. We argue these that advances, among others, should pave the way toward a molecular understanding of the complex interactions that undoubtedly underpin the relationship between Patescibacteria and their hosts.",

          "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster , successful development relies on the precise coordination of both spatial and temporal regulatory axes. The temporal axis governs stage-specific identity and developmental transitions through a number of genes, collectively forming the Metamorphic Gene Network . Among these, Ecdysone inducible protein 93F (E93) serves as the critical determinant for adult specification, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we found that, rather than acting mainly as an instructive signal, E93 promotes adult differentiation through the repression of the pupal specifier broad ( br ). In the absence of E93, sustained high levels of Br during the pupal stage strongly represses pupal-specific enhancers that are essential for the terminal differentiation of the wing. Notably, RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the majority of E93-dependent transcriptomic changes in pupal wings are primarily driven by br repression. In addition, we also show that Br represses the pupal-enhancers during the larval and prepupal stages preventing the premature implementation of the adult genetic program, and that it also dampens the activity of larval enhancers during the latter stages of larval development. This mechanism of action seems to be a derived feature acquired in Diptera, as in the coleopteran Tribolium castaneum , repression of br by E93 is not sufficient to allow adult differentiation. In summary, our study elucidates the crucial role of the intricate interplay between E93 and Br as the governing mechanism in the process of terminal differentiation in Drosophila . This finding holds significant implications for advancing our understanding of the evolution of insect metamorphosis.",

          "abstract": "Insects employ terpenoids for communication both within and between species. While terpene synthases derived from isoprenyl diphosphate synthase have been shown to catalyze terpenoid biosynthesis in some insects, canonical terpene synthases (TPS) commonly found in plants, fungi, and bacteria were previously unidentified in insects. This study reveals the presence of TPS genes in insects, likely originating via horizontal gene transfer from noninsect arthropods. By examining 361 insect genomes, we identified TPS genes in five species of the Sciaridae family (fungus gnats). Additionally, TPS genes were found in Collembola (springtails) and Acariformes (mites) among diverse noninsect arthropods. Selected TPS enzymes from Sciaridae, Collembola, and Acariformes display monoterpene, sesquiterpene, and/or diterpene synthase activities. Through comprehensive protein database search and phylogenetic analysis, the TPS genes in Sciaridae were found to be most closely related to those in Acariformes, suggesting transfer of TPS genes from Acariformes to Sciaridae. In the model Sciaridae Bradysia coprophila , all five TPS genes are most highly expressed in adult males, suggesting a sex- and developmental stage-specific role of their terpenoid products. The finding of TPS genes in insects and their possible evolutionary origin through intraphylum gene transfer within arthropods sheds light on metabolic innovation in insects.",

Recently created large-scale marine protected areas are potentially big enough to protect highly migratory species such as tuna, possibly leading to increases in abundance (a conservation benefit) and consequent spillover near protected area boundaries (an economic benefit). Using publicly available data from nine large-scale marine protected areas across the Pacific and Indian oceans, we find that catch-per-unit-effort in tuna purse seine fisheries has increased by an average of 12 to 18% near protected area boundaries, and this increase declines with distance from the boundaries. The increase is larger for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ) than for skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ), in line with fisheries science simulation models.",

These operations include tasks demanding millisecond-level responses to prevent irreparable damage, such as quickly stabilizing a slipping package or halting a knife just before it cuts into a table. Although recent advances in intelligent robot control have considerably expanded—and will continue to expand—the range and complexity of tasks that robots can perform, AI, data, and control theory alone are not enough.

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation.",

We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies &gt;10 34 erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun’s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism.",

These changes result in a significant upstream shift in streamflow experienced by about 29% of the global land surface. We found the most changes in the smallest steams in our study: increases in erosion potential (approximately 5% increase in stream power), flood frequency (approximately 42% increase in 100-year floods), and likely nutrient dynamics (altered seasonal flow regimes). We revealed these changes using “detail at scale” by mapping millions of individual rivers. Widely adopting this approach could reveal other changes to the hydrosphere.",

This metabolic switch increased citrate-dependent histone acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferase KAT2A-ACLY interactions, at TEX signature-genes while reducing acetate-dependent histone acetylation, dependent on p300-ACSS2 complexes, at effector and memory T cell genes. Nuclear ACSS2 overexpression or ACLY inhibition prevented TEX differentiation and enhanced tumor-specific T cell responses.

          "abstract": "Severe lung injury causes airway basal stem cells to migrate and outcompete alveolar stem cells, resulting in dysplastic repair. We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5 + epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra + mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Recent marine heatwaves have had pervasive effects on marine ecosystems, from declines in primary production to die-offs of top predators. Seabird mortalities are often observed in association with heatwaves, but population impacts are not well understood. In this work, we report the rapid mortality of approximately half of Alaska’s common murre ( Uria aalge ) population in response to an extreme marine heatwave. Between the 7-year period before (2008–2014) and after (2016–2022) the heatwave, murre numbers plummeted 52 to 78% at 13 colonies across two large marine ecosystems. We calculated a loss of 4.00 million common murres, the largest documented wildlife mortality event in the modern era. No evidence of recovery has yet been observed, suggesting that these ecosystems may no longer support historic numbers of seabird top predators.",

In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions. We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain of Escherichia coli until the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host.",

It remains unknown whether adaptation can keep pace with warming and maintain reef functioning. We have developed an eco-evolutionary metapopulation model for Acropora , an ecologically important yet thermally sensitive coral taxon. We found that, although corals have some adaptation capacity, they will suffer severe heatwave-induced declines over the coming decades. For a future in which emissions lead to ~3°C of global warming, natural selection could allow populations to persist, albeit in severely depleted states with elevated extinction risk and potential loss of ecosystem functioning. Yet, for thermally sensitive coral populations to thrive beyond 2050, there must be rapid reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that limit global warming to 2°C.",

Coherent Raman scattering integrated with microfluidics enables high-throughput cell analysis, but faces challenges with small cells (&lt;3 μm) and tissue sections. Here, we report stimulated Raman-activated cell ejection (S-RACE) that enables high-throughput single-cell sorting by integrating stimulated Raman imaging, in situ image decomposition, and laser-induced cell ejection. S-RACE allows ejection of live bacteria or fungi guided by their Raman signatures. Furthermore, S-RACE successfully sorted lipid-rich Rhodotorula glutinis cells from a cell mixture with a throughput of ~13 cells per second, and the sorting results were confirmed by downstream quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Beyond single cells, S-RACE shows high compatibility with tissue sections. Incorporating a closed-loop feedback control circuit further enables real-time SRS imaging-identification-ejection. In summary, S-RACE opens exciting opportunities for diverse single-cell sorting applications.",

This review article is centered on the synthesis of functional oxide membranes, encompassing various approaches to their synthesis, exfoliation, and transfer techniques. First, we explore the characteristics of thin-film growth techniques with emphasis on molecular beam epitaxy. We then examine the fundamental principles and pivotal factors underlying three key approaches of creating membranes: (i) chemical lift-off, (ii) the two-dimensional layer–assisted lift-off, and (iii) spalling. We review the methods of exfoliation and transfer for each approach. Last, we provide an outlook into the future of oxide membranes, highlighting their applications and emerging properties.",

We found that Wnt7a is secreted long distance on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs) following muscle injury. We defined a signal peptide region in Wnts required for secretion on EVs, termed exosome-binding peptide (EBP). Addition of EBP to an unrelated protein directed secretion on EVs. Palmitoylation and the signal peptide were not required for Wnt7a-EV secretion. Coatomer was identified as the EV-binding protein for the EBP. Analysis of cocrystal structures, binding thermodynamics, and mutagenesis found that a dilysine motif mediates EBP binding to coatomer with a conserved function across the Wnt family. We showed that EBP is required for Wnt7a bioactivity when expressed in vivo during regeneration. Overall, our study has elucidated the structural basis and singularity of Wnt secretion on EVs, alternatively to canonical secretion, opening avenues for innovative therapeutic targeting strategies and systemic protein delivery.",

          "abstract": "Label-free imaging through two-photon autofluorescence of NAD(P)H allows for nondestructive, high-resolution visualization of cellular activities in living systems. However, its application to thick tissues has been restricted by its limited penetration depth within 300 μm, largely due to light scattering. Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to more than 700 μm in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber-based, low repetition rate, high peak power, three-photon excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having more than 0.5 megawatts peak power at the band of 1100 ± 25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the eightfold increase in pulse energy enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a substantial advance for deep and dynamic imaging of intact living biosystems. The modular design is anticipated to allow wide adoption for demanding imaging applications, including cancer research, immune responses, and tissue engineering.",

          "abstract": "Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate notable potential for developing advanced separation membranes, contemporary COF membranes still lack controlled stacking and highly efficient sieving. Here, Turing-architecture COF membranes were constructed by engineering a reaction-diffusion assembly process via heterogeneous nucleation synthesis with tannic acid (TA). TA covalently binds with amine monomers to form a composite precursor with increased reactivity and decreased diffusivity. This altered the pathway of Schiff base reactions with aldehyde monomers, fulfilling suitable reaction-diffusion conditions, and ultimately formed the labyrinthine stripe or spot-patterned Turing COF film with controlled stacking and uniform pore structure. This endows our COF membrane with highly efficient molecule sieving ability for organic solvent nanofiltration while exhibiting a flux that is 621% greater than that of commercial membranes. Thus, this study provides a paradigm for the in situ synthesis of highly efficient COF membranes for diversely sustainable separations.",

However, most HEMs are burdened by cost-, energy-, and carbon-intensive extraction, synthesis, and manufacturing protocols. Recycling and reusing HEMs are challenging because their design relies on high fractions of expensive and limited-supply elements in massive solid solutions. Therefore, we review the basic sustainability aspects of HEMs. Solutions include using feedstock with lower carbon and energy footprints, sustainable primary synthesis routes from minerals, attenuation of the equimolar alloying rule, and a preference for scrap and dumped waste for secondary and tertiary synthesis. The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials. We also discuss thermodynamic and kinetic design strategies to reconcile good material properties with high impurity tolerance and variable compositions.",

Operated at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, this technique eliminates the need for additional electricity or radiation, thereby substantially reducing carbon dioxide emissions compared to the traditional Haber-Bosch process. In laboratory experiments, we further optimized the reaction conditions and scaled up the process. After 2 hours of spraying, the ammonia concentration increased to 270.2 ± 25.1 μM. In addition, we present a portable device designed for onsite ammonia production which consistently produces an ammonia concentration that is adequate for some agricultural irrigation purposes.",

We produced viable CESA-deficient mutants of the moss Physcomitrium patens to investigate CSLD function without interfering CESA activity. Microscopy and spectroscopy showed that CESA-deficient mutants synthesize cellulose microfibrils that are indistinguishable from those in vascular plants. Correspondingly, freeze-fracture electron microscopy revealed rosette-shaped particle assemblies in the plasma membrane that are indistinguishable from CESA-containing rosette cellulose synthesis complexes (CSCs). Our data show that proteins other than CESAs, most likely CSLDs, produce cellulose microfibrils in P. patens protonemal filaments.

Using a single-molecule magnetic tweezers assay that directly measures how much twist is induced by individual SMCs in each LE step, we demonstrate that all three SMC complexes induce the same large negative twist (i.e., linking number change Δ L k of ~−0.6 at each LE step) into the extruded loop, independent of step size and DNA tension. Using ATP hydrolysis mutants and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, we find that ATP binding is the twist-inducing event during the ATPase cycle, coinciding with the force-generating LE step. The fact that all three eukaryotic SMC proteins induce the same amount of twist indicates a common DNA-LE mechanism among these SMC complexes.",

Knowledge of the occurrence and behavior of natural hydrogen on Earth has been combined with information from geologic analogs to construct a mass balance model to predict the resource potential. Given the associated uncertainty, stochastic model results predict a wide range of values for the potential in-place hydrogen resource [10 3 to 10 10 million metric tons (Mt)] with the most probable value of ~5.6 × 10 6 Mt. Although most of this hydrogen is likely to be impractical to recover, a small fraction (e.g., 1 × 10 5 Mt) would supply the projected hydrogen needed to reach net-zero carbon emissions for ~200 years. This amount of hydrogen contains more energy (~1.4 × 10 16 MJ) than all proven natural gas reserves on Earth (~8.4 × 10 15 MJ).

Nonetheless, extravasation-dependent tumor accumulation is susceptible to variations in tumor vasculature; therefore, PLGA-PEG was modified with sulfates to actively target P-selectin–expressing cancers. Here, we show the potential of our platform in unique three-dimensional (3D) in vitro and in vivo models. The P-selectin–targeted nanoparticles showed enhanced accumulation in 3D spheroids and tissues of P-selectin–expressing BRAF-mutated melanomas and BRCA-mutated breast cancers, resulting in superior in vivo efficacy and safety.

Haploinsufficiency of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly. However, whether MLL has a function at the centrosome is not clear. Here, we show that loss of the MLL/WDR5 complex affects microtubule nucleation and regrowth. MLL/WDR5 localize to the pericentriolar material and interact with centriolar satellite protein Cep72 and γ-tubulin ring complex proteins (γ-TuRCs). MLL/WDR5 promote the localization of γ-TuRCs and structural proteins like AKAP9 to the centrosome during interphase and mitosis, a phenotype also observed in cells derived from patients with WSS. During mitosis, loss of MLL, WDR5, and Cep72 affects spindle formation and leads to misaligned chromosomes. Last, we show that MLL and WDR5 recruit Cep72 to the centrosome.

This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability. These data show that plasticity of the primary sensory organ enables learning of perceptual constancy.",

Our study reveals neural zinc finger (Nzf2) as a crucial orchestrator that controls the timing of OL differentiation both during development and myelin repair, contrasting with its previously suggested role in direct myelin gene regulation. Nzf2 ablation delays the onset of OL differentiation, while hyperactivation stimulates OL differentiation both during development and remyelination. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we pinpoint Nkx2.2 as a critical downstream target of Nzf2. Specific binding of Nzf2 in the Nkx2.2 gene locus inhibits histone deacetylation by disrupting the HDAC1 repressor complex and reducing deacetylase activity. Furthermore, Nzf2 overrides the inhibitory Notch signaling to initiate OL differentiation. Thus, we propose that the Notch-Nzf2-Nkx2.2 axis is a vital component of OL differentiation timing mechanism, suggesting Nzf2 as a potential therapeutic target for stimulating OL differentiation and boosting myelin repair in demyelinating diseases.",

Here, we present a general mechanism where NPEPPS interacts with the volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) to control cisplatin import into cells and thus regulate cisplatin response across a range of cancer types. We also find the NPEPPS/VRAC gene expression ratio is a predictive measure of cisplatin response in multiple cancer cohorts, showing the broad applicability of this mechanism. Our work describes a specific mechanism of cisplatin resistance, which, given the characteristics of NPEPPS as a drug target, has the potential to improve cancer patient outcomes.

These metabolic defects are consistent with blunted sympathetic activity, and indeed, sympathetic responses to a cold stimulus are substantially attenuated in dark-reared mice. Further, long-term dark rearing leads to body weight gain, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Notably, metabolic dysfunction can be partially alleviated by 5 weeks exposure to a regular light-dark cycle. These studies provide insight into circadian-independent mechanisms by which light directly influences whole-body physiology and better understanding of metabolic disorders linked to aberrant environmental light conditions.",

We quantified the impact of the previously implemented 6/10-week Rotarix vaccine (RV1) in Ghana to the model-predicted impact for other vaccine dosing schedules across three hospitals and the entire country. Compared to no vaccination, the model-estimated median percentage reductions in rotavirus ranged from 28 to 85% and 12 to 71% among children &lt;1 and &lt;5 years old, respectively. The median predicted reductions in rotavirus for the whole country ranged from 57 to 66% among infants &lt;1 year and 35 to 45% among children &lt;5 years old. The 1/6/10- and 6/10/14-week schedules provided the best and comparable reductions in rotavirus compared to the original 6/10-week schedule. A third dose could prevent an additional 9 to 14% of deaths. An additional dose of RV1 might be an effective strategy to improve rotavirus vaccine impact, particularly in settings with low vaccine effectiveness.",

The electrodes used for these purposes often face challenges such as signal degradation due to biofouling and limited biocompatibility, which can lead to inaccurate readings and tissue damage over time. Conducting organic polymers are a promising alternative because of their mechanical, chemical, and physical properties, which better match the ones of biological systems. They also can be synthesized in vivo to form bio-templated structures through biologically compatible manufacturing processes. Here, we report a method to achieve conductive polymer structures anchored to cell membranes, creating an intimate interface between the polymer electrode and single cells. We show that the polymer is nontoxic to cells and does not interfere with its activation, thereby making this process an interesting alternative to existing materials and electrode techniques.",

These clusters have precisely controlled structures, decent charge carrier mobility, considerable solubility, suitable energy levels, and functional ligands, which can help passivate perovskite surface defects, form a uniform capping net to immobilize C 60 , and build a robust coupling between perovskite and C 60 . The target inverted PVSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6% without the need for additional surface passivation. Crucially, the unencapsulated device displays excellent stability under light, heat, and bias, maintaining 98% of its initial PCE after 1500 hours of maximum power point tracking.

In this work, we present a trapping particle design to meet this challenge by creating small metamaterial elliptical cylinders with tunable trapping force and torque properties. The optical torque of these cylinders arises from their shape anisotropy, with their optical properties tuned via multilayered SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4 deposition. We demonstrate that these cylinders can be rotated at about three times the rate of quartz cylinders without slippage while enhancing the torque measurement resolution during DNA torsional elasticity studies.

Here, we use high-resolution 3D seismic data to interpret the landforms and sediments of the central North Sea in unprecedented detail. In contrast to previous interpretations of multiple extensive early glaciations, our data suggest that grounded ice extended across the central North Sea only once, from western Norway, during the Early Pleistocene. This ice sheet advance, which probably occurred ~1.1 million years ago, deposited an up to 120-meter-thick layer of till across &gt;10,000 square kilometers of the central basin. During the rest of the Early Pleistocene, elliptical pockmarks and elongate contour-current furrows show that the central basin was instead scoured by along-slope currents. These findings constrain the extent of ice sheets before and during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and reconcile marine and terrestrial evidence for glaciation in northwest Europe.",

          "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is implicated in cardiac ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. During I/R, elevated mitochondrial Ca 2+ triggers mPTP opening, leading to necrotic cell death. Although nonessential regulators of this pore are characterized, the molecular identity of the pore-forming component remains elusive. Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca 2+ -dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation. Together, these data indicate that the ANT family contributes to mPTP opening independently of CypD.",

Additionally, we directly observe 1 H NMR lines spanning 10 MHz.

Using two-dimensional NMR, we demonstrate polarization transfer from hypershifted to bulk nuclei across a spin diffusion barrier.

A genome-wide CRISPR screen revealed that the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporter ABCC1 mediates MRTX849 resistance. Functional studies demonstrated that the transcription factor JUN drives ABCC1 expression, resulting in multidrug resistance.

Our research used DPMD to study how salts affect water by comparing its results with ab initio molecular dynamics, SPC/Fw, AMOEBA, and MB-Pol models. We studied water’s behavior in salt solutions by examining its spatiotemporally correlated movement. Our findings showed that each model’s accuracy in depicting water’s behavior in salt solutions is strongly connected to spatiotemporal correlation.

Tailoring these polaritons via gradient polaritonic surfaces with space-variant response can enable versatile light-matter interaction platforms with advanced functionalities. However, experimental progress has been hampered by the optical losses and poor light confinement of conventionally used artificial nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate natural gradient polaritonic surfaces based on superlattices of solitons—localized structural deformations—in a prototypical moiré system, twisted bilayer graphene on boron nitride. We demonstrate on-off switching and continuous modulation of local polariton-soliton interactions, which results from marked modifications of topological and conventional soliton states through variation of local strain direction. Furthermore, we reveal the capability of these structures to spatially modify the near-field profile, phase, and propagation direction of polaritons in record-small footprints, enabling generation and electrical switching of directional polaritons. Our findings open up new avenues toward nanoscale manipulation of light-matter interactions and spatial polariton engineering through gradient moiré superlattices.",

As an archetypal Andean-type convergent margin, eastern Asia preserves voluminous magmas ideal for quantifying these processes and their impacts on climate. Here, we use Sr/Y and Ce/Y proxies to show that the crust experienced alternating thickening and thinning during the Late Mesozoic. We identify a noticeably thickened (50 to 55 kilometers) crust associated with tectonic shortening at 120 to 105 million years, corresponding to a &gt;2500-meter-high coastal mountain range. Using climate simulation with the Community Earth System Model, we demonstrate that the mountain uplift changed Asian atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns, increased inland aridity (~15%), and prompted the eastward desert expansion, contributing substantially to the arid zonal belt across mid- to low-latitude Asia. These findings—compatible with independent geological, geophysical, and climatic observations—have global implications for broadening our understanding of Earth-system interactions in the Cretaceous greenhouse world.",

Under stress, it rearranges gene cassettes to offer an escape using the tyrosine recombinase IntI, recognizing folded DNA hairpins, the attC sites. Four recombinases and two attC sites form the synaptic complex. Yet, for unclear reasons, the recombination efficiency varies greatly. Here, we established an optical tweezers force spectroscopy assay to probe the synaptic complex stability and revealed, for seven combinations of attC sites, significant variability in the mechanical stability. We found a strong correlation between mechanical stability and recombination efficiency of attC sites in vivo, indicating a regulatory mechanism from the DNA structure to the macromolecular complex stability. Taking into account known forces during DNA metabolism, we propose that the variation of the integron in vivo recombination efficiency is mediated by the synaptic complex stability. We anticipate that further recombination processes are also affected by their corresponding mechanical stability.",

However, their activity patterns at the single-cell level remain poorly understood. Using microendoscopic Ca 2+ imaging in freely moving mouse dams, we demonstrate highly correlated pulsatile activity among individual OT neurons during lactation. The number of OT neurons engaged in the pulsatile activity significantly increased, along with a broadening of individual waveforms in the mid-lactation stage. Notably, only ~10% of the imaged OT neurons exhibited a significantly elevated response during pup retrieval, a hallmark of maternal behaviors, with a magnitude smaller than that observed during lactation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of microendoscopic imaging for PVH OT neurons and highlight the flexible adjustments of their individual activity patterns in freely behaving mouse dams.",

Strikingly, enhancer mobility becomes constrained on transcriptional firing, homogenizing its dynamics with the gene promoter, suggestive of their cotranscriptional sharing of a nuclear microenvironment.

In particular, p53 forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus of cells, which can bind to DNA and perform transcriptional activity. However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53. This work provides mechanistic insights into how the life cycle and DNA binding properties of p53 might be regulated by phase separation.",

To address these challenges, we present parallel ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy (PUV-PAM) with simultaneous scanning of eight optical foci to acquire histology-like images of slide-free fresh specimens, improving the ultraviolet PAM imaging speed limited by low laser repetition rates. The PUV-PAM has achieved an imaging speed of 0.4 square millimeters per second (i.e., 4.2 minutes per square centimeter) at 1.3-micrometer resolution using a 50-kilohertz laser. In addition, we demonstrated the PUV-PAM with eight needle-shaped beams for an extended depth of field, allowing fast imaging of slide-free tissues with irregular surfaces.

Inspired by a flounder skeleton and citrus peels, the microfabricated electrodes are ultrathin, stretchable, and have a scattered configuration, withstanding large balloon deformation (87% compression), high voltage (1200 volts), and owning exceptional tissue conformability (720° twists). Mechanical-electrical coupled stimulation optimizes balloon electrodes with hemispherical electric field uniformity. A water lily–inspired transfer printing method enables one-step integration of multielectrodes with the balloon. A comprehensive PFA system is complemented, achieving ablation depths of 3.8 millimeters (potato), 3.1 millimeters (rabbit), and 2.3 millimeters (swine) with good uniformity and electrophysiological isolation.

Our model captures a full spectrum of trophic modes, in which the optimal investments reflect zero-waste solutions (i.e., growth is colimited by carbon and nitrogen) and accurately reproduces experimental results. By fitting the model to data for Ochromonas , we were able to predict metabolic strategies at a global scale.

          "abstract": "Metal-organic networks have attracted widespread interest owing to their hybrid physicochemical properties. Natural biomolecules represent attractive building blocks for these materials because of their inherent biological function and high biocompatibility; however, assembling them into coordination network materials, especially nanoparticles (NPs), is challenging. Herein, we exploit the coordination between metal ions and phosphonate groups, which are present in many biomolecules, to form metal-biomolecule network (MBN) NPs in aqueous solution at room temperature. Various phosphonate-containing biomolecules, including plant phytate, DNA, and proteins, were used to assemble MBN NPs with tunable physicochemical properties (e.g., size). In addition to excellent biocompatibility and high cargo-loading efficiency (&gt;95%), these two-component MBN NPs have various biological functionalities, including endosomal escape, immune regulation, and molecular recognition, thus offering advantages over nonbiomolecular-based coordination materials. This work expands our understanding of metal-organic chemistry with the emerging class of metal-biomolecule systems and provides a pathway for incorporating biofunctionalities into advanced coordination materials for diverse fields.",

          "abstract": "Modulating the endogenous stores of gastrointestinal hormones is considered a promising strategy to mimic gut endocrine function, improving metabolic dysfunction. Here, we exploit mouse and human knock-in and knockout intestinal organoids and show that agents used as commercial lipid excipients can activate nutrient-sensitive receptors on enteroendocrine cells (EECs) and, when formulated as lipid nanocarriers, can bestow biological effects through the release of GLP-1, GIP, and PYY from K and L cells. Studies in wild-type, dysglycemic, and gut Gcg knockout mice demonstrated that the effect exerted by lipid nanocarriers could be modulated by varying the excipients (e.g., nature and quantities), the formulation methodology, and their physiochemical properties (e.g., size and composition). This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of using nanotechnology to modulate release of multiple endogenous hormones from the enteroendocrine system through a patient-friendly, inexpensive, and noninvasive manner.",
