          "abstract": "In response to intense pressure, technology companies have enacted policies to combat misinformation1,2,3,4. The enforcement of these policies has, however, led to technology companies being regularly accused of political bias5,6,7. We argue that differential sharing of misinformation by people identifying with different political groups8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 could lead to political asymmetries in enforcement, even by unbiased policies. We first analysed 9,000 politically active Twitter users during the US 2020 presidential election. Although users estimated to be pro-Trump/conservative were indeed substantially more likely to be suspended than those estimated to be pro-Biden/liberal, users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites—even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople—and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots. We find similar associations between stated or inferred conservatism and low-quality news sharing (on the basis of both expert and politically balanced layperson ratings) in 7 other datasets of sharing from Twitter, Facebook and survey experiments, spanning 2016 to 2023 and including data from 16 different countries. Thus, even under politically neutral anti-misinformation policies, political asymmetries in enforcement should be expected. Political imbalance in enforcement need not imply bias on the part of social media companies implementing anti-misinformation policies.",

          "authors": "Rachel Young, Solomon Hsiang",
          "abstract": "Natural disasters trigger complex chains of events within human societies 1 . Immediate deaths and damage are directly observed after a disaster and are widely studied, but delayed downstream outcomes, indirectly caused by the disaster, are difficult to trace back to the initial event 1,2 . Tropical cyclones (TCs)—that is, hurricanes and tropical storms—are widespread globally and have lasting economic impacts 3–5 , but their full health impact remains unknown. Here we conduct a large-scale evaluation of long-term effects of TCs on human mortality in the contiguous United States (CONUS) for all TCs between 1930 and 2015. We observe a robust increase in excess mortality that persists for 15 years after each geophysical event. We estimate that the average TC generates 7,000–11,000 excess deaths, exceeding the average of 24 immediate deaths reported in government statistics 6,7 . Tracking the effects of 501 historical storms, we compute that the TC climate of CONUS imposes an undocumented mortality burden that explains a substantial fraction of the higher mortality rates along the Atlantic coast and is equal to roughly 3.2–5.1% of all deaths. These findings suggest that the TC climate, previously thought to be unimportant for broader public health outcomes, is a meaningful underlying driver for the distribution of mortality risk in CONUS, especially among infants (less than 1 year of age), people 1–44 years of age, and the Black population. Understanding why TCs induce this excess mortality is likely to yield substantial health benefits.",

Observations report increased gamma-ray emissions by tens of percent up to two orders of magnitude above the background, sometimes abruptly terminated by lightning discharges1,3,4,5. Glows are produced by the acceleration of energetic electrons in high-electric-field regions within thunderclouds8 and contribute to charge dissipation3. Glows had been considered as quasi-stationary phenomena3,5,12, with durations up to a few tens of seconds and spatial scales up to 10–20 km. However, no measurements of the full extension in space and time of a gamma-ray-glow region and their occurring frequency have been reported so far. Here we show that tropical thunderclouds over ocean and coastal regions commonly emit gamma rays for hours over areas up to a few thousand square kilometres. Emission is associated with deep convective cores; it is not uniform and continuous but shows characteristic timescales of 1–10 s and even subsecond for individual glows. The dynamics of gamma-glowing thunderclouds strongly contradicts the quasi-stationary picture of glows and instead resembles that of a huge gamma-glowing ‘boiling pot’ in both pattern and behaviour.",

They give rise to new combinations of biochemical capabilities that promote innovation and diversification 1,2 . Despite the many examples of known endosymbioses across the tree of life, their de novo emergence is rare and challenging to uncover in retrospect 3–5 . Here we implant bacteria into the filamentous fungus Rhizopus microsporus to follow the fate of artificially induced endosymbioses. Whereas Escherichia coli implanted into the cytosol induced septum formation, effectively halting endosymbiogenesis, Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica was transmitted vertically to the progeny at a low frequency. Continuous positive selection on endosymbiosis mitigated initial fitness constraints by several orders of magnitude upon adaptive evolution. Phenotypic changes were underscored by the accumulation of mutations in the host as the system stabilized. The bacterium produced rhizoxin congeners in its new host, demonstrating the transfer of a metabolic function through induced endosymbiosis. Single-cell implantation thus provides a powerful experimental approach to study critical events at the onset of endosymbiogenesis and opens opportunities for synthetic approaches towards designing endosymbioses with desired traits.",

          "authors": "Tadasu Nozaki, Beth Weiner, Nancy Kleckner",
          "abstract": "A central feature of meiosis is the pairing of homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes (‘homologues’) along their lengths1,2,3. Recognition between homologues and their juxtaposition in space is mediated by axis-associated recombination complexes. Also, pairing must occur without entanglements among unrelated chromosomes. Here we examine homologue juxtaposition in real time by four-dimensional fluorescence imaging of tagged chromosomal loci at high spatio-temporal resolution in budding yeast. We discover that corresponding loci come together from a substantial distance (1.8 µm) and complete pairing in a very short time, about 6 min (thus, rapid homologue juxtaposition or RHJ). Homologue loci first move rapidly together (in 30 s, at speeds of roughly 60 nm s−1) into an intermediate stage corresponding to canonical 400 nm axis coalignment. After a short pause, crossover/non-crossover differentiation (crossover interference) mediates a second short, rapid transition that ultimately gives close pairing of axes at 100 nm by means of synaptonemal complex formation. Furthermore, RHJ (1) occurs after chromosomes acquire prophase chromosome organization, (2) is nearly synchronous over thirds of chromosome lengths, but (3) is asynchronous throughout the genome. Finally, cytoskeleton-mediated movement is important for the timing and distance of RHJ onset and for ensuring its normal progression. General implications for local and global aspects of pairing are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Walking is a complex motor programme involving coordinated and distributed activity across the brain and the spinal cord. Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons driving halting 1–6 , the underlying neural circuit mechanisms responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain unclear. Here, using connectome-informed models 7–9 and functional studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first mechanism (‘walk-OFF’) relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the second mechanism (‘brake’) relies on excitatory cholinergic neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of forward walking or turning. The brake neurons, by constrast, override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism was engaged for halting and stability during grooming.",

          "abstract": "Back contact silicon solar cells, valued for their aesthetic appeal by removing grid lines on the sunny side, find applications in buildings, vehicles and aircrafts, enabling self-power generation without compromising appearance1-3. Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, offering benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and causes power loss. Here we employ lasers to streamline back contact solar cell fabrication and enhance power conversion efficiency. Our approach produces the first silicon solar cell to exceed 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are deposited on the wafer for surface passivation and collection of light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, diverging from conventional technology practice, is developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers at different wavelengths are used to create back contact patterns. The developed approach is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of emerging mainstream technology. To meet terawatt demand, we develop rare indium-less cells at 26.5% efficiency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% efficiency. The integration of solar solutions in buildings and transportation is poised to expand with these technological advancements.",

          "abstract": "As connectomics advances, it will become commonplace to know far more about the structure of a nervous system than about its function. The starting point for many investigations will become neuronal wiring diagrams, which will be interpreted to make theoretical predictions about function. Here I demonstrate this emerging approach with the Drosophila optic lobe, analysing its structure to predict that three Dm3 (refs. 1–4 ) and three TmY (refs. 2,4 ) cell types are part of a circuit that serves the function of form vision. Receptive fields are predicted from connectivity, and suggest that the cell types encode the local orientation of a visual stimulus. Extraclassical 5,6 receptive fields are also predicted, with implications for robust orientation tuning 7 , position invariance 8,9 and completion of noisy or illusory contours 10,11 . The TmY types synapse onto neurons that project from the optic lobe to the central brain 12,13 , which are conjectured to compute conjunctions and disjunctions of oriented features. My predictions can be tested through neurophysiology, which would constrain the parameters and biophysical mechanisms in neural network models of fly vision 14 .",

In the optic lobe of Drosophila , rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to be essential for understanding fly vision 4,5 . Here we analyse the fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and integrate information over medium distances in the visual field. Some existing type families (Tm, Li, and LPi) 6–10 at least double in number of types. A new serpentine medulla (Sm) interneuron family contains more types than any other. Three families of cross-neuropil types are revealed. The consistency of types is demonstrated by analysing the distances in high-dimensional feature space, and is further validated by algorithms that select small subsets of discriminative features. We use connectivity to hypothesize about the functional roles of cell types in motion, object and colour vision. Connectivity with ‘boundary types’ that straddle the optic lobe and central brain is also quantified. We showcase the advantages of connectomic cell typing: complete and unbiased sampling, a rich array of features based on connectivity and reduction of the connectome to a substantially simpler wiring diagram of cell types, with immediate relevance for brain function and development.",

However, the most efficient α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs require the inclusion of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive3,4, which generates volatile organic residues (i.e., MA) that limit device stability at elevated temperatures5. To date, the highest certified power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs without MACl was only ~24% (ref.6,7), and has yet to exhibit any stability advantages. Here, we identify interfacial contact loss caused by the Cs+ accumulation for the conventional α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs, which deteriorates the device performance and stability. Through in-situ GIWAXS analysis and DFT calculations, we demonstrate an intermediate phase-assisted crystallization pathway enabled by acetate surface coordination to fabricate high-quality α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 film, without using MA-additive. We herein report a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 25.94% and a reverse-scanning PCE of 26.64% for α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs, exhibiting negligible contact losses and enhanced operational stability. The devices retain >95% of their initial PCEs after over 2,000 hours operating at maximum power point under 1 sun, 85 °C, and 60% relative humidity (ISOS-L-3).",

The recently reported whole-brain fly connectome 1–3 specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each other, but not how strongly they do affect each other in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a combined experimental and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model of the fly brain, which we refer to as the ‘effectome’. Specifically, we propose an estimator for a linear dynamical model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic perturbation data to estimate causal effects and the connectome as a prior to greatly improve estimation efficiency. We validate our estimator in connectome-based linear simulations and show that it recovers a linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of more biophysically realistic simulations. We then analyse the connectome to propose circuits that dominate the dynamics of the fly nervous system. We discover that the dominant circuits involve only relatively small populations of neurons—thus, neuron-level imaging, stimulation and identification are feasible. This approach also re-discovers known circuits and generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, we provide evidence that fly whole-brain dynamics are generated by a large collection of small circuits that operate largely independently of each other. This implies that a causal model of a brain can be feasibly obtained in the fly.",

Here we report unique observations of a different phenomenon, which we call flickering gamma-ray flashes (FGFs). FGFs resemble the usual multi-pulse TGFs22,23,24 but have more pulses and each pulse has a longer duration than ordinary TGFs. FGF durations span from 20 to 250 ms, which reaches the lower boundary of the gamma-ray glow duration. FGFs are radio and optically silent, which makes them distinct from normal TGFs. An FGF starts as an ordinary gamma-ray glow, then suddenly increases exponentially in intensity and turns into an unstable, ‘flickering’ mode with a sequence of pulses. FGFs could be the missing link between the gamma-ray glows and conventional TGFs, whose absence has been puzzling the atmospheric electricity community for two decades.",

          "abstract": "Many animals use visual information to navigate 1–4 , but how such information is encoded and integrated by the navigation system remains incompletely understood. In Drosophila melanogaster , EPG neurons in the central complex compute the heading direction 5 by integrating visual input from ER neurons 6–12 , which are part of the anterior visual pathway (AVP) 10,13–16 . Here we densely reconstruct all neurons in the AVP using electron-microscopy data 17 . The AVP comprises four neuropils, sequentially linked by three major classes of neurons: MeTu neurons 10,14,15 , which connect the medulla in the optic lobe to the small unit of the anterior optic tubercle (AOTUsu) in the central brain; TuBu neurons 9,16 , which connect the AOTUsu to the bulb neuropil; and ER neurons 6–12 , which connect the bulb to the EPG neurons. On the basis of morphologies, connectivity between neural classes and the locations of synapses, we identify distinct information channels that originate from four types of MeTu neurons, and we further divide these into ten subtypes according to the presynaptic connections in the medulla and the postsynaptic connections in the AOTUsu. Using the connectivity of the entire AVP and the dendritic fields of the MeTu neurons in the optic lobes, we infer potential visual features and the visual area from which any ER neuron receives input. We confirm some of these predictions physiologically. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding how distinct sensory features can be extracted and transformed across multiple processing stages to construct higher-order cognitive representations.",

          "abstract": "The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has emerged as a key model organism in neuroscience, in large part due to the concentration of collaboratively generated molecular, genetic and digital resources available for it. Here we complement the approximately 140,000 neuron FlyWire whole-brain connectome 1 with a systematic and hierarchical annotation of neuronal classes, cell types and developmental units (hemilineages). Of 8,453 annotated cell types, 3,643 were previously proposed in the partial hemibrain connectome 2 , and 4,581 are new types, mostly from brain regions outside the hemibrain subvolume. Although nearly all hemibrain neurons could be matched morphologically in FlyWire, about one-third of cell types proposed for the hemibrain could not be reliably reidentified. We therefore propose a new definition of cell type as groups of cells that are each quantitatively more similar to cells in a different brain than to any other cell in the same brain, and we validate this definition through joint analysis of FlyWire and hemibrain connectomes. Further analysis defined simple heuristics for the reliability of connections between brains, revealed broad stereotypy and occasional variability in neuron count and connectivity, and provided evidence for functional homeostasis in the mushroom body through adjustments of the absolute amount of excitatory input while maintaining the excitation/inhibition ratio. Our work defines a consensus cell type atlas for the fly brain and provides both an intellectual framework and open-source toolchain for brain-scale comparative connectomics.",

          "abstract": "Brains comprise complex networks of neurons and connections, similar to the nodes and edges of artificial networks. Network analysis applied to the wiring diagrams of brains can offer insights into how they support computations and regulate the flow of information underlying perception and behaviour. The completion of the first whole-brain connectome of an adult fly, containing over 130,000 neurons and millions of synaptic connections1,2,3, offers an opportunity to analyse the statistical properties and topological features of a complete brain. Here we computed the prevalence of two- and three-node motifs, examined their strengths, related this information to both neurotransmitter composition and cell type annotations4,5, and compared these metrics with wiring diagrams of other animals. We found that the network of the fly brain displays rich-club organization, with a large population (30% of the connectome) of highly connected neurons. We identified subsets of rich-club neurons that may serve as integrators or broadcasters of signals. Finally, we examined subnetworks based on 78 anatomically defined brain regions or neuropils. These data products are shared within the FlyWire Codex (https://codex.flywire.ai) and should serve as a foundation for models and experiments exploring the relationship between neural activity and anatomical structure.",

          "abstract": "The brain helps us survive by forming internal representations of the external world1,2. Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific external stimuli3,4. However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective5. PV interneurons differ from excitatory neurons in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs)6,7. Excitatory neurons express calcium-impermeable AMPARs that contain the GluA2 subunit (encoded by GRIA2), whereas PV interneurons express receptors that lack the GluA2 subunit and are calcium-permeable (CP-AMPARs). Here we demonstrate a causal relationship between CP-AMPAR expression and the low feature selectivity of PV interneurons. We find low expression stoichiometry of GRIA2 mRNA relative to other subunits in PV interneurons that is conserved across ferrets, rodents, marmosets and humans, and causes abundant CP-AMPAR expression. Replacing CP-AMPARs in PV interneurons with calcium-impermeable AMPARs increased their orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Manipulations to induce sparse CP-AMPAR expression demonstrated that this increase was cell-autonomous and could occur with changes beyond development. Notably, excitatory–PV interneuron connectivity rates and unitary synaptic strength were unaltered by CP-AMPAR removal, which suggested that the selectivity of PV interneurons can be altered without markedly changing connectivity. In Gria2-knockout mice, in which all AMPARs are calcium-permeable, excitatory neurons showed significantly degraded orientation selectivity, which suggested that CP-AMPARs are sufficient to drive lower selectivity regardless of cell type. Moreover, hippocampal PV interneurons, which usually exhibit low spatial tuning, became more spatially selective after removing CP-AMPARs, which indicated that CP-AMPARs suppress the feature selectivity of PV interneurons independent of modality. These results reveal a new role of CP-AMPARs in maintaining low-selectivity sensory representation in PV interneurons and implicate a conserved molecular mechanism that distinguishes this cell type in the neocortex.",

          "abstract": "Lysosomes have crucial roles in regulating eukaryotic metabolism and cell growth by acting as signalling platforms to sense and respond to changes in nutrient and energy availability1. LYCHOS (GPR155) is a lysosomal transmembrane protein that functions as a cholesterol sensor, facilitating the cholesterol-dependent activation of the master protein kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)2. However, the structural basis of LYCHOS assembly and activity remains unclear. Here we determine several high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of human LYCHOS, revealing a homodimeric transmembrane assembly of a transporter-like domain fused to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) domain. The class B2-like GPCR domain is captured in the apo state and packs against the surface of the transporter-like domain, providing an unusual example of a GPCR as a domain in a larger transmembrane assembly. Cholesterol sensing is mediated by a conserved cholesterol-binding motif, positioned between the GPCR and transporter domains. We reveal that the LYCHOS transporter-like domain is an orthologue of the plant PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporter family, and has greater structural similarity to plant auxin transporters than to known human transporters. Activity assays support a model in which the LYCHOS transporter and GPCR domains coordinate to sense cholesterol and regulate mTORC1 activation.",

          "abstract": "Mutation of tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (encoded by TET2) drives myeloid malignancy initiation and progression1,2,3. TET2 deficiency is known to cause a globally opened chromatin state and activation of genes contributing to aberrant haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal4,5. However, the open chromatin observed in TET2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, leukaemic cells and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells5 is inconsistent with the designated role of DNA 5-methylcytosine oxidation of TET2. Here we show that chromatin-associated retrotransposon RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) can be recognized by the methyl-CpG-binding-domain protein MBD6, which guides deubiquitination of nearby monoubiquitinated Lys119 of histone H2A (H2AK119ub) to promote an open chromatin state. TET2 oxidizes m5C and antagonizes this MBD6-dependent H2AK119ub deubiquitination. TET2 depletion thereby leads to globally decreased H2AK119ub, more open chromatin and increased transcription in stem cells. TET2-mutant human leukaemia becomes dependent on this gene activation pathway, with MBD6 depletion selectively blocking proliferation of TET2-mutant leukaemic cells and largely reversing the haematopoiesis defects caused by Tet2 loss in mouse models. Together, our findings reveal a chromatin regulation pathway by TET2 through retrotransposon RNA m5C oxidation and identify the downstream MBD6 protein as a feasible target for developing therapies specific against TET2 mutant malignancies.",

          "abstract": "The western boundary currents are characterized by narrow, intense ocean jets and are among the most energetic phenomena in the world ocean. The importance of the western boundary currents to the mean climate is well established: they transport vast quantities of heat from the subtropics to the midlatitudes1, and they govern the structure of the climatological mean surface winds2,3,4,5,6, precipitation4,5,6 and extratropical storm tracks7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Their importance to climate variability is much less clear, as the tropospheric response to extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) variability is generally modest relative to the internal variability in the midlatitude atmosphere12,13,14. Here we exploit novel local analyses based on high-spatial-resolution data to demonstrate that SST variability in the western boundary currents has a more robust signature in climate variability than has been indicated in previous work. Our results indicate that warm SST anomalies in the major boundary currents of both hemispheres are associated with a distinct signature of locally enhanced precipitation and rising motion anomalies that extend throughout the depth of the troposphere. The tropospheric signature closely mirrors that of ocean dynamical processes in the boundary currents. Thus, the findings indicate a distinct and robust pathway through which extratropical ocean dynamical processes influence local climate variability. The observational relationships are also reproducible in Earth system model simulations but only when the simulations are run at high spatial resolution.",

Here we create a leaky integrate-and-fire computational model of the entire Drosophila brain, on the basis of neural connectivity and neurotransmitter identity 3 , to study circuit properties of feeding and grooming behaviours. We show that activation of sugar-sensing or water-sensing gustatory neurons in the computational model accurately predicts neurons that respond to tastes and are required for feeding initiation 4 . In addition, using the model to activate neurons in the feeding region of the Drosophila brain predicts those that elicit motor neuron firing 5 —a testable hypothesis that we validate by optogenetic activation and behavioural studies. Activating different classes of gustatory neurons in the model makes accurate predictions of how several taste modalities interact, providing circuit-level insight into aversive and appetitive taste processing. Additionally, we applied this model to mechanosensory circuits and found that computational activation of mechanosensory neurons predicts activation of a small set of neurons comprising the antennal grooming circuit, and accurately describes the circuit response upon activation of different mechanosensory subtypes 6–10 . Our results demonstrate that modelling brain circuits using only synapse-level connectivity and predicted neurotransmitter identity generates experimentally testable hypotheses and can describe complete sensorimotor transformations.",

We derive a projectome—a map of projections between regions—from the connectome and report on tracing of synaptic pathways and the analysis of information flow from inputs (sensory and ascending neurons) to outputs (motor, endocrine and descending neurons) across both hemispheres and between the central brain and the optic lobes. Tracing from a subset of photoreceptors to descending motor pathways illustrates how structure can uncover putative circuit mechanisms underlying sensorimotor behaviours.

          "abstract": "The Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) bilayer nickelate, La3Ni2O7, was recently found to show signatures of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at pressures above 14 GPa (ref. 1). Subsequent investigations achieved zero resistance in single-crystalline and polycrystalline samples under hydrostatic pressure conditions2,3,4. Yet, obvious diamagnetic signals, the other hallmark of superconductors, are still lacking owing to the filamentary nature with low superconducting volume fraction2,4,5. The presence of a new 1313 polymorph and competing R–P phases obscured proper identification of the phase for HTSC6,7,8,9. Thus, achieving bulk HTSC and identifying the phase at play are the most prominent tasks. Here we address these issues in the praseodymium (Pr)-doped La2PrNi2O7 polycrystalline samples. We find that substitutions of Pr for La effectively inhibit the intergrowth of different R–P phases, resulting in a nearly pure bilayer structure. For La2PrNi2O7, pressure-induced orthorhombic to tetragonal structural transition takes place at Pc ≈ 11 GPa, above which HTSC emerges gradually on further compression. The superconducting transition temperatures at 18–20 GPa reach \\({T}_{{\\rm{c}}}^{{\\rm{onset}}}=82.5\\,{\\rm{K}}\\) and \\({T}_{{\\rm{c}}}^{{\\rm{zero}}}=60\\,{\\rm{K}}\\), which are the highest values, to our knowledge, among known nickelate superconductors. Importantly, bulk HTSC was testified by detecting clear diamagnetic signals below about 75 K with appreciable superconducting shielding volume fractions at a pressure of above 15 GPa. Our results not only resolve the existing controversies but also provide directions for exploring bulk HTSC in the bilayer nickelates.",

Functional decline of NSCs results in the decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration following injury during ageing1,2,3,4. Several genetic interventions have been found to ameliorate old brain function5,6,7,8, but systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs—and more generally in old cells—has not been done. Here we develop in vitro and in vivo high-throughput CRISPR–Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screens in primary cultures of young and old NSCs uncovered more than 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore the activation of old NSCs. The top gene knockouts are involved in cilium organization and glucose import. We also establish a scalable CRISPR–Cas9 screening platform in vivo, which identified 24 gene knockouts that boost NSC activation and the production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of Slc2a4, which encodes the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top intervention that improves the function of old NSCs. Glucose uptake increases in NSCs during ageing, and transient glucose starvation restores the ability of old NSCs to activate. Thus, an increase in glucose uptake may contribute to the decline in NSC activation with age. Our work provides scalable platforms to systematically identify genetic interventions that boost the function of old NSCs, including in vivo, with important implications for countering regenerative decline during ageing.",

          "abstract": "In mice, intestinal tuft cells have been described as a long-lived, postmitotic cell type. Two distinct subsets have been identified: tuft-1 and tuft-2 (ref. 1). By combining analysis of primary human intestinal resection material and intestinal organoids, we identify four distinct human tuft cell states, two of which overlap with their murine counterparts. We show that tuft cell development depends on the presence of Wnt ligands, and that tuft cell numbers rapidly increase on interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 exposure, as reported previously in mice2,3,4. This occurs through proliferation of pre-existing tuft cells, rather than through increased de novo generation from stem cells. Indeed, proliferative tuft cells occur in vivo both in fetal and in adult human intestine. Single mature proliferating tuft cells can form organoids that contain all intestinal epithelial cell types. Unlike stem and progenitor cells, human tuft cells survive irradiation damage and retain the ability to generate all other epithelial cell types. Accordingly, organoids engineered to lack tuft cells fail to recover from radiation-induced damage. Thus, tuft cells represent a damage-induced reserve intestinal stem cell pool in humans.",

Perhaps surprisingly, Earth’s thunderstorms should also be added to this list. Observations from spacecraft, aircraft, balloons and ground-based devices have all shown that ordinary thunderstorms frequently emit γ-rays1. These emissions are typically categorized as either γ-ray glows2, with durations ranging from a fraction of a second to minutes, or powerful bursts known as terrestrial γ-ray flashes (TGFs) that usually last less than one millisecond3. However, two papers in Nature4,5 report observations that blur the line between these two types of emission, suggesting that γ-ray glows often morph into intense pulses resembling TGFs.",

Nature Cities 1, 633–641; 2024). The authors found that the fraction of residents who have 15-minute access to essential services in a city is closely related to the average time it takes to reach these points, suggesting that cities with poor average accessibility are also those with the highest inequality. They also devised an algorithm to assess what proportion of amenities would need to be relocated to make them accessible to everyone.",

Previous structural studies of these filaments suggested a common theme: filaments arise from ordered assembles that are made from single types of protein, such as tau, α-synuclein or amyloid-β. Writing in Nature, Arseni and colleagues1 describe the first observation of a disease-associated filament composed of two distinct proteins — TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and annexin A11 (ANXA11). Using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the authors show how fragments from these two proteins interact to assemble into helical filaments, providing hints about the mechanistic origins of these disease-causing entities.",

          "abstract": "Everything that we do, think or feel arises from the pattern of activity in our brains, which in turn is determined by how our brain cells are connected. Many neuroscientists think that the key to understanding brain function is to map out all of the brain’s neurons and connections — creating a ‘connectome’ or ‘wiring diagram’. This is an unfathomably complex task for the human brain, which contains more than 80 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections. The brain of the tiny fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains one million times fewer neurons than that of humans, yet flies can perform sophisticated behaviours such as navigation, learning, decision-making and social interactions. Writing in Nature, Dorkenwald et al.1 and Schlegel et al.2 describe the first complete connectome of the adult Drosophila brain — a landmark achievement that represents the largest connectome obtained so far. Seven companion papers3–9 demonstrate the utility of the connectome in studying neural processing, providing a glimpse into how this resource will transform the field.",

We examine whether this translates to promotion and tenure (P&T) decisions. Data from five US universities on 1,571 faculty members’ P&T decisions show that URM faculty received 7% more negative votes and were 44% less likely to receive unanimous votes from P&T committees. A double standard in how scholarly productivity is rewarded is also observed, with below-average h-indexes being judged more harshly for URM faculty than for non-URM faculty. This relationship is amplified for faculty with intersectional backgrounds, especially URM women. The differential treatment of URM women was mitigated when external reviewers highlighted candidates’ scholarship more in their review letters. In sum, the results support the double standard hypothesis and provide evidence that different outcomes in P&T decision-making processes contribute to the sustained underrepresentation of URM faculty in tenured faculty positions.",

A potential mechanism for linking memory components is phase precession, during which neurons fire progressively earlier in time relative to theta oscillations. However, no direct link between phase precession and memory has been established. Here we recorded single-neuron activity and local field potentials in the human medial temporal lobe while participants (n = 22) encoded and retrieved memories of movie clips. Bouts of theta and phase precession occurred following cognitive boundaries during movie watching and following stimulus onsets during memory retrieval. Phase precession was dynamic, with different neurons exhibiting precession in different task periods. Phase precession strength provided information about memory encoding and retrieval success that was complementary with firing rates. These data provide direct neural evidence for a functional role of phase precession in human episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "Major initiatives attempt to prevent dementia by targeting modifiable risk factors. Low education is frequently pointed to, due to its relationship with dementia. Impact of education is difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other factors, requiring large population-representative samples to tease the relationships apart. We studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other important factors. Participants were grouped into five education levels and seven cognitive levels. A total of 1,521 were diagnosed with dementia between ages 60 and 69 y. While having compulsory education only was associated with increased risk (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17 to 1.60), this association was markedly attenuated when controlling for cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: 0.91 to 1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later diagnosis, even when controlling for education (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65 to 2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and replicated within pairs of brothers. This suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, e.g., common genetics, parental education, socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, nonfamilial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.",

To generate driver cancellation rate disparities consistent with controlled experiments (up to twice as large for Black riders as for White riders), we estimate that more than 3% of drivers discriminate by race. We find that the capabilities of ride-hailing technology to rapidly rematch after a cancellation and prioritize long-waiting customers heavily mitigates the effects of driver discrimination on rider wait times, reducing average discrimination-induced disparities to less than 1 min—an order of magnitude less than traditional taxis. However, our results suggest that even in the absence of direct driver discrimination, Black riders in Chicago wait about 50% longer, on average, than White riders because of historically informed geographic residential patterns. We estimate that if Black riders in the city had the same wait times as White riders, the collective travel time saved would be worth $4.2 million to $7.0 million per year.",

Identifying risk factors for methamphetamine use is crucial to inform preventive interventions. In this cohort study with 1,296 SGM people assigned male at birth, ages 16 to 29, and who resided in Chicago, Poisson regression analyses indicated the prevalence of methamphetamine use increased from 2015 to 2023 [Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.13; P = 0.02]. This increase was most pronounced among those ages 25 or older at baseline (IRR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.33 to 3.63; P = 0.002), and 23.9 [Interquartile Range (IQR) = 22.1 to 26.9] was the median age of first-time methamphetamine use. In 826 participants with a prior HIV diagnosis or previous inflammatory measurements, Cox proportional-hazards models examined risk factors for incident, first-time methamphetamine use. Adjusting for other substance use, the rate of incident, first-time methamphetamine use was two-fold greater after HIV diagnosis [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.23; P = 0.003]. For each SD higher C-reactive protein, the rate of incident, first-time methamphetamine use was 18% greater (aHR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.34; P = 0.008).

          "abstract": "The long tradition of research on cooperation includes a well-established finding that individuals respond to the degree of conflict between self- and collective interests (that is, the relative benefits from cooperation) in providing public goods. Existing empirical evidence builds upon settings where participants make multiple decisions or strategically consider alternative scenarios. Here, we consider a decision setting where participants face a one-time (single-decision) setting. One-time cooperative encounters often occur in volunteering or donating to immediate needs for crisis relief. For these distinct and highly relevant settings, we report a lack of responsiveness to increases in cooperation benefits, thereby highlighting limits to our understanding of the determinants of one-time cooperation encounters. Across two studies, n = 2,232 individuals participate in treatments where we vary across participants the relative benefit from contributing to a public good (that is, the marginal per capita return, the MPCR). We examine decisions from alternative participant pools (UK general population vs. students), implementations varying the physical distance between participants (online vs. in the laboratory), and more complex decision settings considering group-to-group interactions including not only providers but also donors to public goods. Throughout, neither average contribution levels, nor the distribution of contributions are significantly affected by the increases in cooperation benefits. The mechanism behind these results can be explained by the close correlation between expectations of other’s cooperation and own cooperation, and the fact that these expectations do not increase with higher benefits from cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena. This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement. In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries. Focusing on social science, we investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 5,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. This study offers four important insights. First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public). Second, infrequently paired datasets maintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the atypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics has a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts. Last, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an underutilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries.",

Key to their unmatched ability to control nearly infinite degrees of freedom is the architecture into which muscle fibers are weaved. Their arrangement is, effectively, the instantiation of a sophisticated mechanical program that mediates, and likely facilitates, the control and realization of complex, dynamic morphological reconfigurations. Here, by combining medical imaging, biomechanical data, live behavioral experiments, and numerical simulations, an octopus-inspired arm made of ∼ 200 continuous muscle groups is synthesized, exposing “mechanically intelligent” design and control principles broadly pertinent to dynamics and robotics. Such principles are mathematically understood in terms of storage, transport, and conversion of topological quantities, effected into complex 3D motions via simple muscle activation templates. These are in turn composed into higher-level control strategies that, compounded by the arm’s compliance, are demonstrated across challenging manipulation tasks, revealing surprising simplicity and robustness.",

Ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy revealed the progressive formation and decay of several metastable photo-intermediates, corresponding to the Batho to Meta-II photo-intermediates previously observed with bovine rhodopsin and human green cone opsin, on the picosecond to millisecond timescales following pulsed excitation. The experimental data reveal several interesting similarities and differences between the photobleaching sequences of bovine rhodopsin, human green cone opsin, and human blue cone opsin. While Meta-II formation kinetics are comparable between bovine rhodopsin and blue cone opsin, the transition kinetics of earlier photo-intermediates and qualitative characteristics of the Meta-I to Meta-II transition are more similar for blue cone opsin and green cone opsin. Additionally, the blue cone photo-intermediate spectra exhibit a high degree of overlap with uniquely small spectral shifts. The observed variation in Meta-II formation kinetics between rod and cone visual pigments is explained based on key structural differences.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of research documenting the consequences of naturalized and invasive plant species on ecosystem functions, our understanding of the functional underpinnings of these changes remains rudimentary. This is partially due to ineffective scaling of trait differences between native and naturalized species to whole plant communities. Working with data from over 75,000 plots and over 5,500 species from across the United States, we show that changes in the functional composition of communities associated with increasing abundance of naturalized species mirror the differences in traits between native and naturalized plants. We find that communities with greater abundance of naturalized species are more resource acquisitive aboveground and belowground, shorter, more shallowly rooted, and increasingly aligned with an independent strategy for belowground resource acquisition via thin fine roots with high specific root length. We observe shifts toward herbaceous-dominated communities but shifts within both woody and herbaceous functional groups follow community-level patterns for most traits.

While PIEZO channels participate in diverse physiological processes, from sensing the shear stress of blood flow in the vasculature to detecting touch through mechanoreceptors in the skin, the molecular details that enable these mechanosensors to tune their responses over a vast dynamic range of forces remain largely uncharacterized. To survey the molecular landscape surrounding PIEZO channels at the cell surface, we employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to capture and identify extracellularly exposed proteins in the vicinity of PIEZO1. This PIEZO1-proximal interactome was enriched in surface proteins localized to cell junctions and signaling hubs within the plasma membrane. Functional screening of these interaction candidates by calcium imaging and electrophysiology in an overexpression system identified the adhesion molecule CADM1/SynCAM that slows the inactivation kinetics of PIEZO1 with little effect on PIEZO2. Conversely, we found that CADM1 knockdown accelerates inactivation of endogenous PIEZO1 in Neuro-2a cells. Systematic deletion of CADM1 domains indicates that the transmembrane region is critical for the observed effects on PIEZO1, suggesting that modulation of inactivation is mediated by interactions in or near the lipid bilayer.",

Bacterial type II topos, gyrases and topo IV, are primary drug targets for fluoroquinolones, a class of clinically relevant antibacterials requiring metal ions for efficient drug binding. While the presence of metal ions in topos has been elucidated in biochemical studies, accurate location and assignment of metal ions in structural studies have historically posed significant challenges. Recent advances in X-ray crystallography address these limitations by extending the experimental capabilities into the long-wavelength range, exploiting the anomalous contrast from light elements of biological relevance. This breakthrough enables us to confirm experimentally the locations of Mg 2+ in the fluoroquinolone-stabilized Streptococcus pneumoniae topo IV complex. Moreover, we can unambiguously identify the presence of K + and Cl - ions in the complex with one pair of K + ions functioning as an additional intersubunit bridge. Overall, our data extend current knowledge on the functional and structural roles of metal ions in type II topos.",

However, the experimental T g -gradients showed a linear variation with depth ( z ) from the free surface, while the simulated equilibrium T g -gradients exhibited a double exponential z -dependence. In typical simulations, T g is determined based on the relaxation time of the system reaching a prescribed threshold value at equilibrium. Conversely, the experiments determined T g by observing the unfreezing of molecular mobility during heating from a kinetically arrested, nonequilibrium glassy state. To investigate the impact of nonequilibrium effects on the T g -gradient, we reduced the thermal annealing time in simulations, allowing the system to fall out of equilibrium. We observe a decrease in the relaxation time and the emergence of a modified z -dependence consistent with a linear T g -gradient near the free surface. We further validate the impact of nonequilibrium effects by studying the dependence of the T g on the heating/cooling rate for polymer films of varying thickness ( h ). Our experimental results reveal significant variations in the T g -heating/cooling rate dependence with h below the bulk T g , which are also observed in simulation when the simulated system is not equilibrated. We explain our findings by the reduction in mass density within the inner region of the system under nonequilibrium conditions, as observed in simulation, and recent research indicating a decrease in the local T g of a polymer when placed next to a softer material.",

          "abstract": "Approximately two-thirds of the estimated one-billion metric tons of methane produced annually by methanogens is derived from the cleavage of acetate. Acetate is broken down by a Ni-Fe-S-containing A-cluster within the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) to carbon monoxide (CO) and a methyl group (CH 3 + ). The methyl group ultimately forms the greenhouse gas methane, whereas CO is converted to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) by a Ni-Fe-S-containing C-cluster within the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH). Although structures have been solved of CODH/ACS from acetogens, which use these enzymes to make acetate from CO 2 , no structure of a CODH/ACS from a methanogen has been reported. In this work, we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of a methanogenic CODH and CODH/ACS from Methanosarcina thermophila ( Met CODH/ACS). We find that the N-terminal domain of acetogenic ACS, which is missing in all methanogens, is replaced by a domain of CODH. This CODH domain provides a channel for CO to travel between the two catalytic Ni-Fe-S clusters. It generates the binding surface for ACS and creates a remarkably similar CO alcove above the A-cluster using residues from CODH rather than ACS. Comparison of our Met CODH/ACS structure with our Met CODH structure reveals a molecular mechanism to restrict gas flow from the CO channel when ACS departs, preventing CO escape into the cell. Overall, these long-awaited structures of a methanogenic CODH/ACS reveal striking functional similarities to their acetogenic counterparts despite a substantial difference in domain organization.",

          "abstract": "As ambush-hunting predators that consume large prey after long intervals of fasting, Burmese pythons evolved with unique adaptations for modulating organ structure and function. Among these is cardiac hypertrophy that develops within three days following a meal (Andersen et al., 2005, Secor, 2008), which we previously showed was initiated by circulating growth factors (Riquelme et al., 2011). Postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in pythons also rapidly regresses with subsequent fasting (Secor, 2008); however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the dynamic cardiac remodeling in pythons during digestion are largely unknown. In this study, we employed a multiomics approach coupled with targeted molecular analyses to examine remodeling of the python ventricular transcriptome and proteome throughout digestion. We found that forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) signaling was suppressed prior to hypertrophy development and then activated during regression, which coincided with decreased and then increased expression, respectively, of FoxO1 transcriptional targets involved in proteolysis. To define the molecular mechanistic role of FoxO1 in hypertrophy regression, we used cultured mammalian cardiomyocytes treated with postfed python plasma. Hypertrophy regression both in pythons and in vitro coincided with activation of FoxO1-dependent autophagy; however, the introduction of a FoxO1-specific inhibitor prevented both regression of cell size and autophagy activation. Finally, to determine whether FoxO1 activation could induce regression, we generated an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active FoxO1. FoxO1 activation was sufficient to prevent and reverse postfed plasma-induced hypertrophy, which was partially prevented by autophagy inhibition. Our results indicate that modulation of FoxO1 activity contributes to the dynamic ventricular remodeling in postprandial Burmese pythons.",

Flagellar motility is an energy-demanding process, where the sum of its production (biosynthesis) and operation (rotation) costs has been estimated to total ~10% of the entire energy budget of an Escherichia coli cell. The acquisition of such a costly adaptation process is expected to secure short-term benefits by increasing competitiveness and survival, as well as long-term evolutionary fitness gains. While the role of flagellar motility in bacterial survival has been widely reported, its direct influence on the rate of evolution remains unclear. We show here that both production and operation costs contribute to elevated mutation rates. Our findings suggest that flagellar movement may be an important player in tuning the rate of bacterial evolution.",

Here, we conduct a long-term hypoxia acclimation experiment to assess the relative roles of local adaptation and plasticity in enabling highland and lowland deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ) to sustain aerobic thermogenesis at progressively increasing elevations. We assessed the relative physiological performance capacities of highland and lowland natives as they were exposed to progressive, stepwise increases in hypoxia, simulating the gradual ascent from sea level to an elevation of 6,000 m. The final elevation of 6,000 m far exceeds the highest attainable elevations within the species’ range, and therefore tests the animals’ ability to tolerate levels of hypoxia that surpass the prevailing conditions within their current distributional limits. Our results demonstrate that highland natives exhibit superior thermogenic capacities at the most severe levels of hypoxia, suggesting that the species’ broad fundamental niche and its ability to inhabit such a broad range of elevational zones is attributable to genetically based local adaptation, including evolved changes in plasticity. Transcriptomic and physiological measurements identify evolved changes in the acclimation response to hypoxia that contribute to the enhanced thermogenic capacity of highland natives.",

Common bioluminescence imaging methods often require the addition of an external chemical substrate (luciferin), which can result in a decrease in luminescence intensity over time and limit prolonged observations. Since the bacterial bioluminescence system is genetically encoded for luciferase-luciferin production, it enables autonomous bioluminescence (auto-bioluminescence) imaging. However, its application to multiple reporters is restricted due to a limited range of color variants. Here, we report five-color auto-bioluminescence system named Nano-lanternX (NLX), which can be expressed in bacterial, mammalian, and plant hosts, thereby enabling auto-bioluminescence in various living organisms. Utilizing spectral unmixing, we achieved the successful observation of multicolor auto-bioluminescence, enabling detailed single-cell imaging across both bacterial and mammalian cells.

With this research, we propose a rational strategy to develop robust mechanosensitive fluorescence lifetime probes which can facilitate simultaneous fluorescence lifetime imaging of the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy using the unique mechanosensitive probes reveal a dynamic mechanism for ferroptosis: The membrane tension of both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope decreases during ferroptosis, and the nuclear envelope exhibits budding during the advanced stage of ferroptosis. Significantly, the membrane tension of the plasma membrane is always larger than that of the nuclear envelope, and the membrane tension of the nuclear envelope is slightly larger than that of the nuclear membrane bubble. Meanwhile, the membrane lesions are repaired in the low-tension regions through exocytosis.",

However, determining water’s T g remains a major challenge. Here, we elucidate the glass transition of water by analyzing the calorimetric behavior of nano-confined water across various pore topologies (diameters: 0.3 to 2.5 nm). Our approach involves subjecting confined water to annealing protocols to identify the temperature and time evolution of nonequilibrium glass kinetics. Furthermore, we complement this calorimetric approach with the dynamics of confined water, as seen by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and linear calorimetric measurements, including the fast scanning technique. This study demonstrated that confined water undergoes a glass transition in the temperature range of 170 to 200 K, depending on the confinement size and the interaction with the confinement walls. Moreover, we also show that the thermal event observed at ~136 K must be interpreted as an annealing prepeak, also referred to as the “shadow glass transition.” Calorimetric measurements also allow the detection of a specific heat step above 200 K, which is insensitive to annealing and, thereby, interpreted as a true thermodynamic transition. Finally, by connecting our results to bulk water behavior, we offer a comprehensive understanding of confined water vitrification with potential implications for numerous applications.",

In this study, we identified YkuR, encoded by smu_318 , as a unique protein deacetylase in Streptococcus mutans . Through protein acetylome analysis, we demonstrated that the deletion of ykuR significantly upregulated protein acetylation levels, affecting key enzymes in translation processes and metabolic pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and biofilm formation. In particular, YkuR modulated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis and biofilm formation through the direct deacetylation of glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) in the presence of NAD + . Intriguingly, YkuR can be acetylated in a nonenzymatic manner, which then negatively regulated its deacetylase activity, suggesting the presence of a self-regulatory mechanism. Moreover, in vivo studies further demonstrated that the deletion of ykuR attenuated the cariogenicity of S. mutans in the rat caries model, substantiating its involvement in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Therefore, our study revealed a unique regulatory mechanism mediated by YkuR through protein deacetylation that regulates the physiology and pathogenicity of S. mutans .",

These cells are a prime example of single-cell morphogenesis, branching significantly over time to adapt to the needs of the growing tissue they supply. While the genetic mechanisms governing local branching decisions have been studied extensively, an understanding of the emergence of a global network architecture is still lacking. Mapping out the full network architecture of populations of terminal cells at different developmental times of Drosophila larvae, we find that cell growth follows scaling laws relating the total edge length, supply area, and branch density. Using time-lapse imaging of individual terminal cells, we identify that the cells grow in three ways: by extending branches, by the side budding of new branches, and by internally growing existing branches. A generative model based on these modes of growth recapitulates statistical properties of the terminal cell network data. These results suggest that the scaling laws arise from the coupled contributions of branching and internal growth. This study establishes the terminal cell as a uniquely tractable model system for further studies of transportation and distribution networks.",

Abnormal endometrial receptivity is one of the major causes of embryo implantation failure and infertility. MicroRNA-124-3p is elevated in both the serum and endometrial tissue of women with chronic endometritis, a condition associated with infertility. MicroRNA-124-3p also has a role in cell adhesion, a key function during receptivity to allow blastocysts to adhere and implant. In this study, we aimed to determine the function of microRNA-124-3p on endometrial epithelial adhesive capacity during receptivity and effect on embryo implantation. Using a unique inducible, uterine epithelial-specific microRNA overexpression mouse model, we demonstrated that elevated uterine epithelial microRNA-124-3p impaired endometrial receptivity by altering genes associated with cell adhesion and polarity. This resulted in embryo implantation failure. Similarly in a second mouse model, increasing microRNA-124-3p expression only in mouse uterine surface (luminal) epithelium impaired receptivity and led to implantation failure. In humans, we demonstrated that microRNA-124-3p was abnormally increased in the endometrial epithelium of women with unexplained infertility during the receptive window. MicroRNA-124-3p overexpression in primary human endometrial epithelial cells (HEECs) impaired primary human embryo trophectoderm attachment in a 3-dimensional culture model of endometrium. Reduction of microRNA-124-3p in HEECs from infertile women normalized HEEC adhesive capacity. Overexpression of microRNA-124-3p or knockdown of its direct target IQGAP1 reduced fertile HEEC adhesion and its ability to lose polarity. Collectively, our data highlight that microRNA-124-3p and its protein targets contribute to endometrial receptivity by altering cell polarity and adhesion.",

In particular, mass losses of the Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers have been mostly (&gt;90%) controlled by ice discharge, while the contribution of SMB has been relatively minor. In East Antarctica, SMB accounts for significant portions (&gt;50%) of ice mass imbalances of glaciers in e.g., Dronning Maud Land and Wilkes Land. Ice discharge has also played a notable role in overall mass gain in the region.

Magnetically driven colloidal assembly offers great versatility because of the ability to externally tune particle–particle interactions and to construct a host of particle arrangements. However, despite previous efforts to probe the parameter space, global orientational control in conjunction with two-dimensional microstructural control has remained out of reach. Furthermore, the magnetic relaxation time of superparamagnetic beads has been largely overlooked despite being a key feature of the magnetic response. Here, we take advantage of the magnetic relaxation time of superparamagnetic beads in an alternating rotating magnetic field and show how harnessing this feature facilitates the formation of oriented clusters. The orientation of these clusters can be controlled by field parameters. Using experiments, simulations, and theory, we probe a two-particle system (dimer) under this alternating rotating magnetic field and use its dynamics to provide insights into the collective response that forms clusters. We find that the type of field has significant implications for the dipolar interactions between the colloids because of the nonnegligible magnetic relaxation. Moreover, we find that the competing time scales of the magnetic relaxation and the alternating field generate an anisotropic interaction potential that drives cluster alignment. By exploiting the magnetic relaxation time of magnetic systems, we can tailor new types of interparticle interactions, thereby expanding the capabilities of colloidal assembly in engineering unique materials and devices.",

          "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes characterized by vascular pathology and neuroinflammation. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition molecule that functions at the crossroads between innate immunity, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. DR is known to involve inflammatory pathways, although the potential relevance of PTX3 has not been explored. We found that PTX3 protein levels increased in the retina of diabetic mice. Similarly, evaluation of a publicly available transcriptomic human dataset revealed increased PTX3 expression in DR with diabetic macular edema and proliferative retinopathy, when compared to nondiabetic retinas or diabetic retinas without complications. To further understand the role of PTX3 within DR, we employed the streptozotocin-induced diabetes model in PTX3 knockout mice (PTX3 KO ), which were followed up for 9 mo to evaluate hallmarks of disease progression. In diabetic PTX3 KO mice, we observed decreased reactive gliosis, diminished microglia activation, and reduced vasodegeneration, when compared to diabetic PTX3 wild-type littermates. The decrease in DR–associated pathological features in PTX3 KO retinas translated into preserved visual function, as evidenced by improved optokinetic response, restored b-wave amplitude in electroretinograms, and attenuated neurodegeneration. We showed that PTX3 induced an inflammatory phenotype in human retinal macroglia, characterized by GFAP upregulation and increased secretion of IL6 and PAI-1. We confirmed that PTX3 was required for TNF-α-induced reactive gliosis, as PTX3 KO retinal explants did not up-regulate GFAP in response to TNF-α. This study reveals a unique role for PTX3 as an enhancer of sterile inflammation in DR, which drives pathogenesis and ultimately visual impairment.",

          "abstract": "Despite much research, considerable data suggest that influenza virus remains a serious health problem because i) the effectiveness of current vaccines ranges only from 19% to 60%, ii) available therapies remain ineffective in advanced stages of disease, iii) death rates vary between 25,000 and 72,000/year in the United States, and iv) avian influenza strains are now being transmitted to dairy cattle that in turn are infecting humans. To address these concerns, we have developed zanDR, a bispecific small molecule that binds and inhibits viral neuraminidase expressed on both free virus and virus-infected cells and recruits naturally occurring anti-rhamnose and anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies with rhamnose and DNP haptens. Because the neuraminidase inhibition replicates the chemotherapeutic mechanism of zanamivir and oseltamivir, while rhamnose and DNP recruit endogenous antibodies much like an anti-influenza vaccine, zanDR reproduces most of the functions of current methods of protection against influenza virus infections. Importantly, studies on cells in culture demonstrate that both of the above protective mechanisms remain highly functional in the zanDR conjugate, while studies in lethally infected mice with advanced-stage disease establish that a single intranasal dose of zanDR not only yields 100% protection but also reduces lung viral loads faster and ~1,000× more thoroughly than current antiviral therapies. Since zanDR also lowers secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and protects against virus-induced damage to the lungs better than current therapies, we suggest that combining an immunotherapy with a chemotherapy in single pharmacological agent constitutes a promising approach for treating the more challenging forms of influenza.",

          "abstract": "In proliferating bacteria, growth rate is often assumed to be similar between daughter cells. However, most of our knowledge of cell growth derives from studies on symmetrically dividing bacteria. In many α-proteobacteria, asymmetric division is a normal part of the life cycle, with each division producing daughter cells with different sizes and fates. Here, we demonstrate that the functionally distinct swarmer and stalked daughter cells produced by the model α-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus can have different average growth rates under nutrient-replete conditions despite sharing an identical genome and environment. The discrepancy in growth rate is due to a growth slowdown associated with the cell cycle stage preceding DNA replication (the G1 phase), which initiates in the late predivisional mother cell before daughter cell separation. Both progenies experience a G1-associated growth slowdown, but the effect is more severe in swarmer cells because they have a longer G1 phase. Activity of SpoT, which produces the (p)ppGpp alarmone and extends the G1 phase, accentuates the cell cycle-dependent growth slowdown. Collectively, our data identify a coupling between cell growth, the G1 phase, and asymmetric division that C. crescentus may exploit for environmental adaptation through SpoT activity. This coupling differentially modulates the growth rate of functionally distinct daughter cells, thereby altering the relative abundance of ecologically important G1-specific traits within the population.",

          "abstract": "Progerin causes Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), but how progerin accelerates aging is still an interesting question. Here, we provide evidence linking nuclear envelope (NE) budding and accelerated aging. Mechanistically, progerin disrupts nuclear lamina to induce NE budding in concert with lamin A/C, resulting in transport of chromatin into the cytoplasm where it is removed via autophagy, whereas emerin antagonizes this process. Primary cells from both HGPS patients and mouse models express progerin and display NE budding and chromatin loss, and ectopically expressing progerin in cells can mimic this process. More excitingly, we screen a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening, which can dramatically sequester progerin from the NE and prevent this NE budding through sustaining ERK1/2 activation. Chaetocin alleviates NE budding-induced chromatin loss and ameliorates HGPS defects in cells and mice and significantly extends lifespan of HGPS mice. Collectively, we propose that progerin-induced NE budding participates in the induction of progeria, highlight the roles of chaetocin and sustained ERK1/2 activation in anti-aging, and provide a distinct avenue for treating HGPS.",

Pauses in cholinergic interneuron (CIN) firing are thought to coincide with dopamine pulses encoding reward prediction errors (RPE) to jointly enable synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine the firing of identified CINs during reward-guided decision-making in freely moving rats and compare this firing to dopamine release. Relationships between CINs, dopamine, and behavior varied strongly by subregion. In the dorsal–lateral striatum, a Go! cue evoked burst–pause CIN spiking, followed by a brief dopamine pulse that was unrelated to RPE. In the dorsal–medial striatum, this cue evoked only a CIN pause, that was curtailed by a movement-selective rebound in firing. Finally, in the ventral striatum, a reward cue evoked RPE-coding increases in both dopamine and CIN firing, without a consistent pause. Our results demonstrate a spatial and temporal dissociation between CIN pauses and dopamine RPE signals and will inform future models of striatal information processing under both normal and pathological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is a protective response to pathogens and injury. To be effective it needs to be resolved by endogenous mechanisms in order to avoid prolonged and excessive inflammation, which can become chronic. Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are a group of lipids derived from omega-3 fatty acids, which can induce the resolution of inflammation. How SPMs exert their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects is, however, not clear. Here, we show that SPMs such as protectins, maresins, and D-series resolvins function as biased positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) receptor EP4 through an intracellular binding site. They increase PGE 2 -induced G s -mediated formation of cAMP and thereby promote anti-inflammatory signaling of EP4. In addition, SPMs endow the endogenous EP4 receptor on macrophages with the ability to couple to G i -type G-proteins, which converts the EP4 receptor on macrophages from an anti-phagocytotic receptor to one increasing phagocytosis, a central mechanism of the pro-resolving activity of synthetic SPMs. In the absence of the EP4 receptor, SPMs lose their anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving activity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal an unusual mechanism of allosteric receptor modulation by lipids and provide a mechanism by which synthetic SPMs exert pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory effects, which may facilitate approaches to treat inflammation.",

All the key statistical observables are reconstructed with high precision, allowing for nanoscale resolution of local mobilities and femtonewton inference of conservative or nonconservative forces.

          "abstract": "Systems consolidation is a common feature of learning and memory systems, in which a long-term memory initially stored in one brain region becomes persistently stored in another region. We studied the dynamics of systems consolidation in simple circuit architectures with two sites of plasticity, one in an early-learning and one in a late-learning brain area. We show that the synaptic dynamics of the circuit during consolidation of an analog memory can be understood as a temporal integration process, by which transient changes in activity driven by plasticity in the early-learning area are accumulated into persistent synaptic changes at the late-learning site. This simple principle naturally leads to a speed-accuracy tradeoff in systems consolidation and provides insight into how the circuit mitigates the stability-plasticity dilemma of storing new memories while preserving core features of older ones. Furthermore, it imposes two constraints on the circuit. First, the plasticity rule at the late-learning site must stably support a continuum of possible outputs for a given input. We show that this is readily achieved by heterosynaptic but not standard Hebbian rules. Second, to turn off the consolidation process and prevent erroneous changes at the late-learning site, neural activity in the early-learning area must be reset to its baseline activity. We provide two biologically plausible implementations for this reset that propose functional roles in stabilizing consolidation for core elements of the cerebellar circuit.",

DotO, a distant homolog of the T4ASS ATPase VirB4, associates with the bacterial inner membrane despite lacking hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Employing a genetic approach, we found DotO’s membrane association is mediated by three inner-membrane Dot/Icm components, IcmT, and a combined DotJ–DotI complex (referred to as DotJI). Although deletion of icmT or dotJI individually does not affect DotO’s membrane association, the simultaneous inactivation of all three genes results in increased amounts of soluble DotO. Nevertheless, deleting each receptor separately profoundly affects positioning of DotO, disrupting its link with the Dot/Icm complex at the bacterial poles, rendering the receptors nonredundant. Furthermore, a collection of dotO point mutants that we isolated established that DotO’s N-terminal domain interacts with the membrane receptors and is involved in dimerization, whereas DotO’s C-terminal ATPase domain primarily contributes to the protein’s formation of oligomers. Modeling data revealed the complex interaction between DotO and its receptors is responsible for formation of DotO’s unique “hexamer of dimers” configuration, which is a defining characteristic of VirB4 family members.",

Along with a companion paper by Livraghi et al., we argue that ivory , not cortex , is the color pattern gene of interest at this locus. In J. coenia , a cluster of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in the first intron of ivory are genetically associated with natural variation in seasonal color pattern plasticity, and targeted deletions of these CREs phenocopy seasonal phenotypes. Deletions of different ivory CREs produce other distinct phenotypes as well, including loss of melanic eyespot rings, and positive and negative changes in overall wing pigmentation. We show that the color pattern transcription factors Spineless, Bric-a-brac, and Ftz-f1 bind to the ivory promoter during wing pattern development, suggesting that they directly regulate ivory . This case study demonstrates how cis -regulation of a single noncoding RNA can exert diverse and nuanced effects on the evolution and development of color patterns, including modulating seasonally plastic color patterns.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the motion of particles with multivalent ligand-receptors is important for biomedical applications and material design. Yet, even among a single design, the prototypical DNA-coated colloids, seemingly similar micrometric particles hop or roll, depending on the study. We shed light on this problem by observing DNA-coated colloids diffusing near surfaces coated with complementary strands for a wide array of coating designs. We find colloids rapidly switch between 2 modes: They hop—with long and fast steps—and crawl—with short and slow steps. Both modes occur at all temperatures around the melting point and over various designs. The particles become increasingly subdiffusive as temperature decreases, in line with subsequent velocity steps becoming increasingly anticorrelated, corresponding to switchbacks in the trajectories. Overall, crawling (or hopping) phases are more predominant at low (or high) temperatures; crawling is also more efficient at low temperatures than hopping to cover large distances. We rationalize this behavior within a simple model: At lower temperatures, the number of bound strands increases, and detachment of all bonds is unlikely, hence, hopping is prevented and crawling favored. We thus reveal the mechanism behind a common design rule relying on increased strand density for long-range self-assembly: Dense strands on surfaces are required to enable crawling, possibly facilitating particle rearrangements.",

Here, we find that DNA fragments induced by chemotherapeutic agents trigger the degradation of cGAS, a potent double-strand DNA (dsDNA) sensor, by lysosomes. Mechanically, the lysosome-localized protein LAMTOR1 is up-regulated, and the interaction between LAMTOR1 and cGAS is enhanced upon exposure to DNA fragments, boosting the accumulation and digestion of cGAS in lysosomes through the receptor protein p62. LAMTOR1 deficiency increases cGAS abundance and promotes activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, leading to subsequent production of type I interferons induced by cytosolic DNA stimulation. Loss of LAMTOR1 synergizes with immunotherapy and chemotherapy to inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice by promoting the infiltration of effective T lymphocytes. Thus, our study reveals a regulation of cGAS abundance and provides a potential strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance by targeting LAMTOR1.",

Here, we report genome-wide profiles of primary LNETs’ cis-regulatory elements by H3K27ac ChIP-seq with matching RNA-seq profiles. Analysis of these regulatory landscapes revealed three regulatory subtypes, independent of the typical/atypical classification. We identified unique differentiation signals that delineate each subtype. The “proneuronal” subtype emerges under the influence of ASCL1, SOX4, and TCF4 transcription factors, embodying a pronounced proneuronal signature. The “luminal-like” subtype is characterized by gain of acetylation at markers of luminal cells and GATA2 activation and loss of LRP5 and OTP. The “HNF+” subtype is characterized by a robust enhancer landscape driven by HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA3, with notable acetylation and expression of FGF signaling genes, especially FGFR3 and FGFR4, pivotal components of the FGF pathway. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of LNETs’ regulatory and developmental diversity but also spotlight the HNF+ subtype’s reliance on FGFR signaling. We demonstrate that targeting this pathway with FGF inhibitors curtails tumor growth both in vitro and in xenograft models, unveiling a potential vulnerability and paving the way for targeted therapies. Overall, our work provides an important resource for studying LNETs to reveal regulatory networks, differentiation signals, and therapeutically relevant dependencies.",

Here, we found germ-free models possess elevated polyamine levels in the colon. Mechanistically, intestinal Lactobacillus murinus -derived small RNAs in extracellular vesicles down-regulate host polyamine metabolism by targeting the expression of enzymes in polyamine metabolism. In addition, Lactobacillus murinus delays recovery of dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis by reducing polyamine levels in mice. Notably, a decline in the abundance of small RNAs was observed in the colon of mice with colorectal cancer (CRC) and human CRC specimens, accompanied by elevated polyamine levels. Collectively, our study identifies a specific underlying mechanism used by intestinal microbiota to modulate host polyamine metabolism, which provides potential intervention for the treatment of polyamine-associated diseases.",

We study an electrocatalyst composed of gold–copper alloy nanoparticles known to be active toward the reduction of CO 2 to CO. However, under the action of highly localized electric fields generated by plasmonic excitation of the gold–copper alloy nanoparticles, water splitting becomes favored at the expense of CO 2 reduction. Real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding calculations indicate that optically generated electric fields promote transient-hole-transfer-driven dissociation of the O─H bond of water preferentially over transient-electron-driven dissociation of the C─O bond of CO 2 .

          "abstract": "Central nervous system neurons manifest a rich diversity of selectivity profiles—whose precise role is still poorly understood. Following the striking success of artificial networks, a major debate has emerged concerning their usefulness in explaining neuronal properties. Here we propose that finding parallels between artificial and neuronal networks is informative precisely because these systems are so different from each other. Our argument is based on an extension of the concept of convergent evolution—well established in biology—to the domain of artificial systems. Applying this concept to different areas and levels of the cortical hierarchy can be a powerful tool for elucidating the functional role of well-known cortical selectivities. Importantly, we further demonstrate that such parallels can uncover novel functionalities by showing that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex can be modeled to function as a set of basis functions in a lossy representation such as the well-known JPEG compression. Thus, contrary to common intuition, here we illustrate that finding parallels with artificial systems provides novel and informative insights, particularly in those cases that are far removed from realistic brain biology.",

          "abstract": "Memory effect refers to the phenomenon where past events influence a system’s current and future states or behaviors. In biology, memory effects often arise from intra- or intermolecular interactions, leading to temporally correlated behaviors. Single-molecule studies have shown that enzymes and DNA-binding proteins can exhibit time-correlated behaviors of their activity. While memory effects are well documented and studied in vitro, no such examples exist in cells to our knowledge. Combining single-molecule tracking (SMT) and single-cell protein quantitation, we find in living Escherichia coli cells distinct temporal correlations in the binding/unbinding events on DNA by MerR- and Fur-family metalloregulators, manifesting as memory effects with timescales of ~1 s. These memory effects persist irrespective of the type of the metalloregulators or their metallation states. Moreover, these temporal correlations of metalloregulator–DNA interactions are associated with spatial confinements of the metalloregulators near their DNA binding sites, suggesting microdomains of ~100 nm in size that possibly result from the spatial organizations of the bacterial chromosome without the involvement of membranes. These microdomains likely facilitate repeated binding events, enhancing regulator−DNA contact frequency and potentially gene regulation efficiency. These findings provide unique insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein–DNA interactions in bacterial cells, introducing the concept of microdomains as a crucial player in memory effect–driven gene regulation.",

However, toxic by-products accumulate in cultures due to inefficiencies in metabolic activities and nutrient utilization. In this study, we applied comprehensive 13 C stable-isotope tracing of amino acids and glucose to two Immunoglobulin G (IgG) producing Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines to identify secreted by-products and trace their origins. CHO cells were cultured in media formulations missing a single amino acid or glucose supplemented with a 13 C-tracer of the missing substrate, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to track labeled carbon flows and identify by-products. We tracked the sources of all secreted by-products and verified the identity of 45 by-products, majority of which were derived from glucose, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tyrosine, tryptophan, methionine, and phenylalanine. In addition to by-products identified previously, we identified several metabolites including 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, L-alloisoleucine, ketoisoleucine, 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaleric acid, desmeninol, and 2-aminobutyric acid. When added to CHO cell cultures at different concentrations, certain metabolites inhibited cell growth while others including 2-hydroxy acids, surprisingly, reduced lactate accumulation. In vitro enzymatic analysis indicated that 2-hydroxy acids were metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase suggesting a possible mechanism for lowered lactate accumulation, e.g., competitive substrate inhibition. The 13 C-labeling assisted metabolomics pipeline developed and the metabolites identified will serve as a springboard to reduce undesirable by-products accumulation and alleviate inefficient substrate utilization in mammalian cultures used for biomanufacturing and other applications through altered media formulations and pathway engineering strategies.",

FaNaCs are activated by the short neuropeptide FMRFamide, and HyNaCs by Hydra RFamides, which are not evolutionarily related to FMRFamide. The FMRFamide-binding site in FaNaCs was recently identified in a cleft atop the large extracellular domain. However, this cleft is not conserved in HyNaCs. Here, we combined molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis and identified a putative binding pocket for Hydra-RFamides in the extracellular domain of the heterotrimeric HyNaC2/3/5. This pocket localizes to only one of the three subunit interfaces, indicating that this trimeric ion channel binds a single peptide ligand. We engineered an unnatural amino acid at the putative binding pocket entrance, which allowed covalent tethering of Hydra RFamide to the channel, thereby trapping the channel in an open conformation. The identified pocket localizes to the same region as the acidic pocket of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which binds peptide ligands. The pocket in HyNaCs is less acidic, and both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions contribute to peptide binding. Collectively, our results reveal a conserved ligand-binding pocket in HyNaCs and ASICs and indicate independent evolution of peptide-binding cavities in the two subgroups of peptide-gated ion channels.",

Despite its prevalence, generic mechanisms for this fundamental form of learning remain poorly defined. Drawing inspiration from prior work on systems that respond adaptively to step inputs, we study habituation from a nonlinear dynamics perspective. This approach enables us to formalize classical hallmarks of habituation that have been experimentally identified in diverse organisms and stimulus scenarios. We use this framework to investigate distinct dynamical circuits capable of habituation. In particular, we show that driven linear dynamics of a memory variable with static nonlinearities acting at the input and output can implement numerous hallmarks in a mathematically interpretable manner. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamical substrates of this primitive learning behavior and offers a blueprint for the identification of habituating circuits in biological systems.",

It is unknown if the TCA cycle also regulates epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, after infection-induced immune tolerance. The following studies demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induce changes in DNA methylation that are mediated by the TCA cycle. Infection-induced DNA hypermethylation is mitigated by inhibitors of cellular metabolism (rapamycin, everolimus, metformin) and the TCA cycle (isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors). Conversely, exogenous supplementation with TCA metabolites (succinate and itaconate) induces DNA hypermethylation and immune tolerance.

Most drug candidates for causal therapy of AD cannot either enter the brain or accumulate around hippocampal neurons. Here, we genetically engineered insulin-fusion proteins, called hippocampal neuron–targeting (Ht) proteins, for targeting protein drugs to hippocampal neurons because insulin tends to accumulate in the neuronal cell layers of the hippocampus. In vitro examinations clarified that insulin and Ht proteins were internalized into the cultured hippocampal neurons through insulin receptor–mediated macropinocytosis. Cysteines were key determinants of the delivery of Ht proteins to hippocampal neurons, and insulin B chain mutant was most potent in delivering cargo proteins. In vivo accumulation of Ht proteins to hippocampal neuronal layers occurred after intracerebroventricular administration. Thus, hippocampal neuron–targeting technology can provide great help for developing protein drugs against neurodegenerative disorders.",

In this study, we investigated the spatial form and timing of a population collapse from 2018 to 2022 in Canada lynx ( Lynx canadensis ) across the northwest boreal forest. We analyzed survival, reproduction, and dispersal data from 143 individual global positioning system (GPS) collared lynx from populations across five study sites spanning interior Alaska to determine whether lynx displayed characteristics of a population wave following a concurrent wave in snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus ) abundance. Reproductive rates declined across the study sites; however, site-level reproduction declined first in our easternmost study sites, supporting the idea of a population wave. Despite a clear increase in percent of dispersing lynx, there was no evidence of directional bias in dispersal following a hare population wave. Analysis did show increasingly poor survival for lynx dispersing to the east compared to combined resident and westward dispersal. This pattern is consistent with a survival-mediated population wave in lynx as the driver of the theorized population wave. The combination of these factors supports the idea of a hierarchical response to snowshoe hare population declines with a drop in lynx reproduction followed by increased dispersal, and finally reduced survival. All of this evidence is consistent with the expected characteristics of a population undergoing a traveling wave and supports the hypothesis that lynx presence may facilitate and mirror the underlying wave patterns in snowshoe hare.",

Three different strategies for constructing input sequence alignments are employed for predicting structural models of antigen–antibody complexes. In our initial testing set, which comprises known experimental structures, these strategies collectively yield a significant top-ranked prediction for 61% of cases and a success rate of 47%.

However, a significant challenge arises from the dissolution of both organic acids and alkali cations in a strongly acidic feed stream, resulting in a considerable energy penalty for downstream separation. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) technology to separate organic acids and recover alkali cations from a strongly acidic feed stream (pH ~ 1). We show that organic acids, such as formic acid and acetic acid, are retained in molecular form in the separation chamber, achieving a rejection rate of over 90% under all conditions. Alkali cations, such as K + and Cs + , migrate to the cathode chamber in ionic form, with their removal and recovery significantly influenced by their concentration and the pH of the feed stream, but responding differently to the types and concentrations of organic acids. The energy consumption for the removal and recovery of K + is 4 to 8 times higher than for Cs + , and the charge efficiency is significantly influenced by the types of organic acid products and alkali cations. We conduct a series of electrochemical measurements and analyze the impedance spectroscopy, identifying that hindered mass transfer governed the electrode process.

We argue that to develop a holistic understanding of these systems, we must consider the problem that they were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By recognizing the pressures that this task exerts, we can make predictions about the strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will succeed or fail. Using this approach—which we call the teleological approach—we identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM accuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the target output, and the probability of the provided input. To test our predictions, we evaluate five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.0) on 11 tasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in the hypothesized ways. Many of the experiments reveal surprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4’s accuracy at decoding a simple cipher is 51% when the output is a high-probability sentence but only 13% when it is low-probability, even though this task is a deterministic one for which probability should not matter. These results show that AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we conclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should instead treat them as a distinct type of system—one that has been shaped by its own particular set of pressures.",

          "abstract": "Fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdala (PaFS) is a bifunctional terpene synthase. It contains a prenyltransferase (PT) domain that generates geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from dimethylallyl diphosphate and three equivalents of isopentenyl diphosphate, and a cyclase domain that converts GGPP into fusicoccadiene, a precursor of the diterpene glycoside Fusicoccin A. The two catalytic domains are connected by a flexible 69-residue linker. The PT domain mediates oligomerization to form predominantly octamers, with cyclase domains randomly splayed out around the PT core. Surprisingly, despite the random positioning of cyclase domains, substrate channeling is operative in catalysis since most of the GGPP generated by the PT remains on the enzyme for cyclization. Here, we demonstrate that covalent linkage of the PT and cyclase domains is not required for GGPP channeling, although covalent linkage may improve channeling efficiency. Moreover, GGPP competition experiments with other diterpene cyclases indicate that the PaFS PT and cyclase domains are preferential partners regardless of whether they are covalently linked or not. The cryoelectron microscopy structure of the 600-kD “linkerless” construct, in which the 69-residue linker is spliced out and replaced with the tripeptide PTQ, reveals that cyclase pairs associate with all four sides of the PT octamer and exhibit fascinating quaternary structural flexibility. These results suggest that optimal substrate channeling is achieved when a cyclase domain associates with the side of the PT octamer, regardless of whether the two domains are covalently linked and regardless of whether this interaction is transient or locked in place.",

Here, we employ native mass spectrometry to investigate the interactions of UptA, a member of the DedA family of membrane protein from Bacillus subtilis , with C 55 -P, membrane phospholipids, and cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Our results show that UptA, expressed and purified in Escherichia coli , forms monomer–dimer equilibria, and binds to C 55 -P in a pH-dependent fashion. Specifically, we show that UptA interacts more favorably with C 55 -P over shorter-chain analogs and membrane phospholipids. Moreover, we demonstrate that lipopeptide antibiotics, amphomycin and aspartocin D, can directly inhibit UptA function by out-competing the substrate for the protein binding, in addition to their propensity to form complex with free C 55 -P. Overall, this study shows that UptA-mediated translocation of C 55 -P is potentially mediated by pH and anionic phospholipids and provides insights for future development of antibiotics targeting carrier lipid recycling.",

We consider a spike-coding network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic transmission delays. Previously, it was shown that the performance of such networks varies nonmonotonically with the noise amplitude. Interestingly, we find that in the vicinity of the optimal noise level for efficient coding, the network dynamics exhibit some signatures of criticality, namely, scale-free dynamics of the spiking and the presence of crackling noise relation. Our work suggests that two influential, and previously disparate theories of neural processing optimization (efficient coding and criticality) may be intimately related.",

We present a muscle type that operates based on changes in muscle stiffness caused by volume expansion. This muscle is created by coiling a mechanically strong braid, in which an elastomer hollow tube is adhesively attached inside. We show that the muscle reversibly contracts by 47.3% when driven by an oscillating input air pressure of 120 kilopascals at 10 Hz. It generates a maximum power density of 3.0 W/g and demonstrates a mechanical contractile efficiency of 74%. The muscle’s low-pressure operation allowed for portable, thermal pneumatical actuation. Moreover, the muscle demonstrated bipolar actuation, wherein internal pressure leads to muscle length expansion if the initial muscle length is compressed and contraction if the muscle is not compressed. Modeling indicates that muscle expansion significantly alters its stiffness, which causes muscle actuation. We demonstrate the utility of BCMs for fast running and climbing robots.",

          "abstract": "Many of the relevant electrochemical processes in the context of catalysis or energy conversion and storage, entail the production of gases. This often implicates the nucleation of bubbles at the interface, with the concomitant blockage of the electroactive area leading to overpotentials and Ohmic drop. Nanoelectrodes have been envisioned as assets to revert this effect, by inhibiting bubble formation. Experiments show, however, that nanobubbles nucleate and attach to nanoscale electrodes, imposing a limit to the current, which turns out to be independent of size and applied potential in a wide range from 3 nm to tenths of microns. Here we investigate the potential-current response for disk electrodes of diameters down to a single-atom, employing molecular simulations including electrochemical generation of gas. Our analysis reveals that nanoelectrodes of 1 nm can offer twice as much current as that delivered by electrodes with areas four orders of magnitude larger at the same bias. This boost in the extracted current is a consequence of the destabilization of the gas phase. The grand potential of surface nanobubbles shows they can not reach a thermodynamically stable state on supports below 2 nm. As a result, the electroactive area becomes accessible to the solution and the current turns out to be sensitive to the electrode radius. In this way, our simulations establish that there is an optimal size for the nanoelectrodes, in between the single-atom and ∼3 nm, that optimizes the gas production.",

          "abstract": "Casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ) controls essential biological processes including circadian rhythms and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling, but how its activity is regulated is not well understood. CK1δ is inhibited by autophosphorylation of its intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail. Two CK1 splice variants, δ1 and δ2, are known to have very different effects on circadian rhythms. These variants differ only in the last 16 residues of the tail, referred to as the extreme C termini (XCT), but with marked changes in potential phosphorylation sites. Here, we test whether the XCT of these variants have different effects in autoinhibition of the kinase. Using NMR and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that the δ1 XCT is preferentially phosphorylated by the kinase and the δ1 tail makes more extensive interactions across the kinase domain. Mutation of δ1-specific XCT phosphorylation sites increases kinase activity both in vitro and in cells and leads to changes in the circadian period, similar to what is reported in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of the phosphorylation sites in XCT disrupts tail interaction with the kinase domain. δ1 autoinhibition relies on conserved anion-binding sites around the CK1 active site, demonstrating a common mode of product inhibition of CK1δ. These findings demonstrate how a phosphorylation cycle controls the activity of this essential kinase.",

          "abstract": "The transcription factor E2F1 serves as a regulator of the cell cycle and promotes cell proliferation. It is highly expressed in cancer tissues and contributes to their malignant transformation. Degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system may help to prevent such overexpression of E2F1 and thereby to suppress carcinogenesis. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying E2F1 degradation may therefore inform the development of new cancer treatments. We here identified SCF FBXW7 as a ubiquitin ligase for E2F1 by comprehensive analysis. We found that phosphorylation of E2F1 at serine-403 promotes its binding to FBXW7 (F-box/WD repeat–containing protein 7) followed by its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, calcineurin, a Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase, was shown to stabilize E2F1 by mediating its dephosphorylation at serine-403 and thereby preventing FBXW7 binding. Treatment of cells with Ca 2+ channel blockers resulted in downregulation of both E2F1 protein and the expression of E2F1 target genes, whereas treatment with the Ca 2+ ionophore ionomycin induced upregulation of E2F1. Finally, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 attenuated xenograft tumor growth in mice in association with downregulation of E2F1 in the tumor tissue. Impairment of the balance between the opposing actions of FBXW7 and calcineurin in the regulation of E2F1 abundance may therefore play an important role in carcinogenesis.",

Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the signature initiating event in the most common form of kidney cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Such tumors are usually driven by the excessive HIF2 activity that arises when the VHL gene product, pVHL, is defective. Given the pressing need for a robust immunocompetent mouse model of human ccRCC, we directly injected adenovirus-associated viruses (AAVs) encoding sgRNAs against VHL and other known/suspected ccRCC tumor suppressor genes into the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice under conditions where Cas9 was under the control of one of two different kidney-specific promoters ( Cdh16 or Pax 8) to induce kidney tumors. An AAV targeting Vhl, Pbrm1, Keap1 , and Tsc1 reproducibly caused macroscopic ccRCCs that partially resembled human ccRCC tumors with respect to transcriptome and cell of origin and responded to a ccRCC standard-of-care agent, axitinib. Unfortunately, these tumors, like those produced by earlier genetically engineered mouse ccRCCs, are HIF2 independent.",

Although several panagonists mimicking the endogenous ligand somatostatin are available, the development of more effective and safer somatostatinergic therapies is limited due to a lack of molecular understanding of the ligand recognition and regulation of divergent SSTR subtypes. Here, we report four cryoelectron microscopy structures of G i -coupled SSTR1 and SSTR3 activated by distinct agonists, including the FDA-approved panagonist pasireotide as well as their selective small molecule agonists L-797591 and L-796778. Our structures reveal a conserved recognition pattern of pasireotide in SSTRs attributed to the binding with a conserved extended binding pocket, distinct from SST14, octreotide, and lanreotide. Together with mutagenesis analyses, our structures further reveal the dynamic feature of ligand binding pockets in SSTR1 and SSTR3 to accommodate divergent agonists, the key determinants of ligand selectivity lying across the orthosteric pocket of different SSTR subtypes, as well as the molecular mechanism underlying diversity and conservation of receptor activation. Our work provides a framework for rational design of subtype-selective SSTR ligands and may facilitate drug development efforts targeting SSTRs with improved therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects.",

We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These molecules relocalized CDK9 to BCL6-bound DNA and directed phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. The resulting expression of pro-apoptotic, BCL6-target genes caused killing of diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells and specific ablation of the BCL6-regulated germinal center response.

We measured the fitness effects of ~100 insertion mutations in 42 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in six laboratory environments and found that the global epistasis scaling is nearly invariant across environments. Instead, the environment tunes one global parameter, the background fitness at which most mutations switch sign. As a consequence, the distribution of mutational effects is predictable across genotypes and environments.

Unexpectedly, these 1-year lagged teleconnections are at least as strong as the better-known simultaneous winter connections. However, the 1-year lagged response is opposite in sign to the simultaneous response such that 1 year later, El Niño is followed by a positive NAO, whereas La Niña is followed by a negative NAO. The lagged response may also interfere with simultaneous ENSO teleconnections. We show here that these effects are unlikely to be caused by residual aliasing of ENSO cycles; rather, slowly migrating atmospheric angular momentum anomalies explain both the sign and the timing of the extratropical response.

Subsequently, ~27 million years ago, one ancestral fungal cultivar population became domesticated, i.e., obligately mutualistic, when seasonally dry habitats expanded in South America, likely isolating the cultivar population from its free-living, wet forest–dwelling conspecifics. By revealing these and other major transitions in fungus-ant coevolution, our results clarify the historical processes that shaped a model system for nonhuman agriculture.",

          "abstract": "Early embryogenesis is driven by transcription factors (TFs) that first activate the zygotic genome and then specify the lineages constituting the blastocyst. Although the TFs specifying the blastocyst’s lineages are well characterized, those playing earlier roles remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of the TF Nr5a2 , we show that Nr5a2 −/− embryos arrest at the early morula stage and exhibit altered lineage specification, frequent mitotic failure, and substantial chromosome segregation defects. Although NR5A2 plays a minor but measurable role during zygotic genome activation, it predominantly acts as a master regulator at the eight-cell stage, controlling expression of lineage-specifying TFs and genes involved in mitosis, telomere maintenance, and DNA repair. We conclude that NR5A2 coordinates proliferation, genome stability, and lineage specification to ensure correct morula development.",

          "abstract": "Hydrogen atom abstraction is an important elementary chemical process but is very difficult to carry out enantioselectively. We have developed catalysts, readily derived from the Cinchona alkaloid family of natural products, which can achieve this by virtue of their chiral amine structure. The catalyst, following single-electron oxidation, desymmetrizes meso -diols by selectively abstracting a hydrogen atom from one carbon center, which then regains a hydrogen atom by abstraction from a thiol. This results in an enantioselective epimerization process, forming the chiral diastereomer with high enantiomeric excess. Cyclic and acyclic 1,2-diols are compatible, as are acyclic 1,3-diols. Additionally, we demonstrate the viability of combining our approach with carbon-carbon bond formation in Giese addition. Given the increasing number of synthetic methods involving hydrogen atom transfer steps, we anticipate that this work will have a broad impact in the field of enantioselective radical chemistry.",

Systematically evaluating the effect of a single atom, however, poses synthetic challenges, primarily as a result of thermodynamic mismatches in atomic exchange processes. We present a photocatalytic strategy that swaps an oxygen atom of furan with a nitrogen group, directly converting the furan into a pyrrole analog in a single intermolecular reaction. High compatibility was observed with various furan derivatives and nitrogen nucleophiles commonly used in drug discovery, and the late-stage functionalization furnished otherwise difficult-to-access pyrroles from naturally occurring furans of high molecular complexity. Mechanistic analysis suggested that polarity inversion through single electron transfer initiates the redox-neutral atom exchange processes at room temperature.",

The promise of cancer immunotherapy is that immune effector mechanisms and immunological memory can jointly eradicate cancers and inoperable metastases and de facto vaccinate against recurrence. For some patients with hitherto incurable diseases, including metastatic melanoma, this promise is being realized by game-changing immunotherapies based on αβ T cells. Today’s challenges are to bring benefit to greater numbers of patients of diverse ethnicities, target more cancer types, and achieve a cure while incurring fewer adverse events. In meeting those challenges, specific benefits may be offered by γδ T cells, which compose a second T cell lineage with distinct recognition capabilities and functional traits that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. γδ T cell–based clinical trials, including off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy and agonist antibodies, are yielding promising results, although identifiable problems remain. In addressing those problems, we advocate that immunotherapies be guided by the distinctive biology of γδ T cells, as elucidated by ongoing research.",

For island endemics, proportional losses have been even greater.

Upon bacteriophage infection, a template region of this RNA is reverse transcribed into an array of tandem repeats that reconstitute a promoter and open reading frame, allowing expression of a toxic repetitive protein and an abortive infection response.

Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame ( neo ) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection.

          "abstract": "Pachytene piRNAs, a Piwi-interacting RNA subclass in mammals, are hypothesized to regulate non-transposon sequences during spermatogenesis. Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, the 21URNAs, are implicated in regulating coding sequences; the messenger RNA targets and biological processes they control during spermatogenesis are largely unknown. We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal of plk-3 results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells. Together, these results suggest that the 21URNAs function as pachytene piRNAs during C. elegans spermatogenesis. We identify their targets and meiotic events and highlight the remarkable intricacy of this multi-effector mechanism during spermatogenesis.",

An ancient interval of particularly intense weathering of Western Australian Pleistocene aeolianites is recorded in a spectacular pinnacle karst landscape with associated ferricrete nodules. (U-Th)/He dating of the ferricrete nodules revealed an age of 102.8 + 10.6/−11.4 thousand years, corresponding to marine isotope stage 5c. The (U-Th)/He age thus directly dates the wettest interglacial period in the region over the last 500 thousand years, which was responsible for the dissolution that formed the pinnacles. The reliability of the ferricrete (U-Th)/He age is supported by bounding optically stimulated luminescence and U-Th dates on associated aeolianites and carbonate precipitates, respectively. A (U-Th)/He approach is globally applicable to aeolianites with associated ferricretes, allowing more accurate dating of the environmental changes affecting these lithologies, and temporally constraining rapid Pleistocene climatic oscillations to better contextualize the associated evolution of the biosphere.",

          "abstract": "A broad spectrum of electromagnetic waves has been explored for wireless neuromodulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, with long wavelengths, cannot provide submillimeter spatial resolution. Visible light, with its short wavelengths, suffers from strong scattering in the deep tissue. Microwaves have centimeter-scale penetration depth and have been shown to reversibly inhibit neuronal activity. Yet, microwaves alone do not provide sufficient spatial precision to modulate target neurons without affecting surrounding tissues. Here, we report a split-ring resonator (SRR) that generates an enhanced microwave field at its gap with submillimeter spatial precision. With the SRR, microwaves at dosages below the safe exposure limit are shown to inhibit the firing of neurons within 1 mm of the SRR gap site. The microwave SRR reduced seizure activity at a low dose in both in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy. This microwave dosage is confirmed to be biosafe via histological and biochemical assessment of brain tissue.",

Thus, contrast agents combining T 1 and T 2 effects are sought for multiparameter MRA with clinical promise, yet achieving a balance in T 1 and T 2 contrast enhancement effects remains a scientific challenge. Herein, we developed a hypersensitive multiparameter MRA strategy using dual-modality NaGdF 4 nanoparticles. Because of the longer tumbling time (τ R ), NaGdF 4 nanoparticles can improve the longitudinal relaxivity ( r 1 ), brightening vessels in T 1 -weighted sequences. Simultaneously, the regular arrangement of Gd 3+ in the crystal induces magnetic anisotropy, creating local static magnetic field heterogeneity and generating negative signals in T 2 -weighted sequences. Consequently, the efficacy of NaGdF 4 -enhanced high-resolution multiparameter MRA has been validated in diagnosing ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models. In addition, the dual-contrast imaging has been realized on swine with a clinical 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, highly emphasizing the clinical translation prospect.",

Although many studies have approached this question through linear stability analysis, less is known about how higher-order interactions shape the global organization of different states. Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: They stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by markedly reducing their basin size.

Inducible deletion of Mettl3 in murine keratinocytes results in spontaneous skin inflammation and increases susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation with activation of neutrophil recruitment. Therapeutically, restoration of m 6 A alleviates the disease phenotypes in mice and suppresses inflammation in human biopsy specimens. We support a model in which m 6 A modification stabilizes the mRNA of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme ELOVL6 via the m 6 A reader IGF2BP3, leading to a rewiring of fatty acid metabolism with a reduction in palmitic acid accumulation and, consequently, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis in cutaneous inflammation.

Here, we devise orbit symmetry breaking in MXene (a low-cost scalability, biocompatible, and conductive two dimensionally layered material, which we refer to as OBXene), which exhibits low bioelectronic-tissue impedance, originating from the out-of-plane charge transfer. Furthermore, the Schottky-induced piezoelectricity stemming from the asymmetric orbital configuration of OBXene facilitates interlayered charge transport in the device.

Using a Xenopus model of retinitis pigmentosa, we found that Müller cells actively proliferate upon photoreceptor degeneration in old tadpoles but not in younger ones. Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential. However, both cell cycle reentry and neurogenic gene expression are allowed when applying sequential pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments. This reveals that inflammation benefits Müller glia proliferation in both regenerative and nonregenerative vertebrates and highlights the importance of sequential inflammatory modulation to create a regenerative permissive microenvironment.",

In contrast, generation of the ADO knockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism.",

However, in metal-free systems, the spin orbitals are largely delocalized, and weak coupling between the spins in the lattice hampers long-range ordering. Metal-free magnetism is of fundamental interest to physical sciences, unlocking unprecedented dimensions for strongly correlated materials and biocompatible magnets. Here, we present a strategy to achieve strong coupling between spin centers of planar radical monomers in π-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) polymers and rationally control the orderings. If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer.

To find erg3- and erg1-mediated functions, we generated global Kcnh7 ( erg3 ) and conditional Kcnh2 ( erg1 ) knockout mice. We found that erg3 channels stabilize the resting potential and dampen spontaneous activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas erg1 channels have suprathreshold functions. Lack of erg3 subunits induced hyperexcitability with increased action potential firing in PCs, but not in CA1 neurons. Notably, erg3 depletion caused depressive-like behavior with reduced locomotor activity, strongly decreased digging behavior, and shorter latencies to fall off a rotating wheel, while learning and memory remained unchanged.

Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK + macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype.

          "abstract": "Solid tumors are characterized by dysfunctional vasculature that limits perfusion and delivery of nutrients to the tumor microenvironment. Limited perfusion coupled with the high metabolic demand of growing tumors has led to the hypothesis that many tumors experience metabolic stress driven by limited availability of nutrients such as glucose, oxygen, and amino acids in the tumor. Such metabolic stress has important implications for the biology of cells in the microenvironment, affecting both disease progression and response to therapies. Recently, techniques have been developed to identify limiting nutrients and resulting metabolic stresses in solid tumors. These techniques have greatly expanded our understanding of the metabolic limitations in tumors. This review will discuss these experimental tools and the emerging picture of metabolic limitations in tumors arising from recent studies using these approaches.",

Here, we report the high-pressure synthesis of a metastable nonsymmetrical dicopper-μ-oxo compound with exceptional reactivity toward the mono-oxygenation of aliphatic C─H bonds. The nonequivalent coordination environment of copper stabilizes localized mixed valency and greatly enhances the hydrogen atom abstraction activity of the bridging oxygen, enabling room-temperature hydroxylation of methane under pressure.

Plant-derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TOPGAP, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TOPGAP as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a, a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TOPGAP, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co-opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens.",

Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperone HIRA , consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells.

However, in real systems with the finite thickness of the device material being larger than the magnetic exchange length, the skyrmion spin texture extends into the third dimension and cannot be assumed as homogeneous. Using soft x-ray laminography, we reconstruct with about 20-nanometer spatial (voxel) size the full three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion in an 800-nanometer-diameter and 95-nanometer-thin disk patterned into a 30× [iridium/cobalt/platinum] multilayered film. A quantitative analysis finds that the evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number is nonuniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of the micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile are related to nonuniform competing energetic interactions.

Here, we observed single Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal scanning complexes in real time, finding that they scan diverse mRNA leaders at a rate of 10 to 20 nt s −1 . We show that specific binding of a protein to its mRNA leader sequence substantially arrests scanning. Conversely, impairing scanning-complex guanosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis results in native start-site bypass.

Depending on the organism, multiple PmtAs may be required for producing monomethyl- and dimethyl-PE derivatives along with PC, whereas in organisms such as Rubellimicrobium thermophilum , a single enzyme is sufficient to direct all three methylation steps. In this study, we present the x-ray crystal structures of PmtA from R. thermophilum in complex with dimethyl-PE and S -adenosyl- l -homocysteine, as well as in its lipid-free form.

          "abstract": "Rapid elimination of paternal mitochondria following fertilization is a conserved event in most animals, but its physiological significance remains unclear. We find that modest delay of paternal mitochondrial elimination (PME) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos unexpectedly impairs mating and cognition of adult animals and alters their locomotion behaviors. Delayed PME causes decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in early embryos, which lead to impaired physiological functions of adult animals through an energy-sensing pathway mediated by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase, AAK-2, and a forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16. Treatment of PME-delayed animals with MK-4, a subtype of vitamin K 2 that can improve mitochondrial ATP production, restores ATP levels in early embryos, and rescues physiological defects of adult animals. Our results suggest that moderate PME delay during embryo development adversely affects crucial physiological functions in adults, which could be evolutionarily disadvantageous. These observations provide mechanistic explanations for the need to swiftly remove paternal mitochondria early during embryo development.",

The previously reported increase in cold extremes was overestimated due to an artifact of changing data coverage.

Spatial adiabatic passage (SAP) is a prime example of this phenomenon, where a wave packet is transferred between two uncoupled localized modes by adjusting the tunneling coupling to an intermediate third mode in a counterintuitive sequence. Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves. In this study, we demonstrate this quantum interference effect using massive particles that tunnel between three micro-optical traps (“optical tweezers”). We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in low vibrational eigenstates of one trap, followed by manipulating the distance between the traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth and high-efficiency transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, with a very low population remaining in the central trap. These findings open possibilities for advanced control schemes in optical tweezer array platforms.",

          "abstract": "The PP2A-B55 phosphatase regulates a plethora of signaling pathways throughout eukaryotes. How PP2A-B55 selects its substrates presents a severe knowledge gap. By integrating AlphaFold modeling with comprehensive high-resolution mutational scanning, we show that α helices in substrates bind B55 through an evolutionary conserved mechanism. Despite a large diversity in sequence and composition, these α helices share key amino acid determinants that engage discrete hydrophobic and electrostatic patches. Using deep learning protein design, we generate a specific and potent competitive peptide inhibitor of PP2A-B55 substrate interactions. With this inhibitor, we uncover that PP2A-B55 regulates the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex by binding to an α-helical recruitment module in the RNA binding protein 7 (RBM7), a component of the NEXT complex. Collectively, our findings provide a framework for the understanding and interrogation of PP2A-B55 function in health and disease.",

          "abstract": "The major female ovarian hormone, 17β-estradiol (E 2 ), can alter neuronal excitability within milliseconds to regulate a variety of physiological processes. Estrogen receptor-α (ERα), classically known as a nuclear receptor, exists as a membrane-bound receptor to mediate this rapid action of E 2 , but the ionic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that a membrane channel protein, chloride intracellular channel protein-1 (Clic1), can physically interact with ERα with a preference to the membrane-bound ERα. Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E 2 and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E 2 -induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E 2 on female body weight balance. In conclusion, we identified the Clic1 chloride channel as a key mediator for E 2 -induced rapid neuronal excitation, which may have a broad impact on multiple neurobiological processes regulated by E 2 .",

Elucidating specific structural and dynamic features of proteins and their interactions in the cellular context is crucial for understanding cellular processes. We introduce 19 F dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) combined with fast magic-angle-spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy as a powerful technique to study proteins in mammalian cells. We demonstrate our approach on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 5F-Trp-N NTD protein, electroporated into human cells. DNP signal enhancements of 30- to 40-fold were observed, translating into over 1000-fold experimental time savings. High signal-to-noise ratio spectra were acquired on nanomole quantities of a protein in cells in minutes. 2D 19 F- 19 F dipolar correlation spectra with remarkable sensitivity and resolution were obtained, exhibiting 19 F- 19 F cross peaks associated with fluorine atoms as far as ~10 angstroms apart. This work paves the way for 19 F DNP-enhanced MAS NMR applications in cells for probing protein structure, dynamics, and ligand interactions.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of addiction is the ability of drugs of abuse to trigger relapse after periods of prolonged abstinence. Here, we describe an epigenetic mechanism whereby chronic cocaine exposure causes lasting chromatin and downstream transcriptional modifications in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region controlling motivation. We link prolonged withdrawal from cocaine to the depletion of the histone variant H2A.Z, coupled with increased genome accessibility and latent priming of gene transcription, in D1 dopamine receptor–expressing medium spiny neurons (D1 MSNs) that relate to aberrant gene expression upon drug relapse. The histone chaperone ANP32E removes H2A.Z from chromatin, and we demonstrate that D1 MSN–selective Anp32e knockdown prevents cocaine-induced H2A.Z depletion and blocks cocaine’s rewarding actions. By contrast, very different effects of cocaine exposure, withdrawal, and relapse were found for D2 MSNs. These findings establish histone variant exchange as an important mechanism and clinical target engaged by drugs of abuse to corrupt brain function and behavior.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondria undergo fragmentation in response to bioenergetic stress, mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) recruitment to the mitochondria. The major pro-fission DRP1 receptor is mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kilodaltons (MiD49/51), which can sequester inactive DRP1. Together, they form a trimeric DRP1-MiD-MFF complex. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mediated phosphorylation of MFF is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify MFF as a target of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at Lys 151 , MFF SUMOylation is enhanced following AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and that MFF SUMOylation regulates the level of MiD binding to MFF. The mitochondrial stressor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) promotes MFF SUMOylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. However, CCCP-induced fragmentation is impaired in MFF-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing non-SUMOylatable MFF K151R. These data suggest that the AMPK-MFF SUMOylation axis dynamically controls stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by regulating the levels of MiD in trimeric fission complexes.",

          "abstract": "Certain human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are etiological agents for several anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. During initial infection, HPV16, the most prevalent cancer-causing type, specifically interacts with heparan sulfates (HSs), not only enabling initial cell attachment but also triggering a crucial conformational change in viral capsids termed structural activation. It is unknown, whether these HPV16-HS interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high-affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs.",
