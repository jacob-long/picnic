          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations are widespread in normal human tissues1. Similarly, in murine chimeras, cells carrying an oncogenic lesion contribute normal cells to adult tissues without causing cancer2,3,4. How lineages that escape cancer via normal development differ from the minority that succumb is unclear. Tumours exhibit characteristic cancer hallmarks; we therefore searched for hallmarks that differentiate cancer-prone lineages from resistant lineages. Here we show that total cell cycle duration (Tc) predicts transformation susceptibility across multiple tumour types. Cancer-prone Rb- and p107-deficient retina (Rb is also known as Rb1 and p107 is also known as Rbl1) exhibited defects in apoptosis, senescence, immune surveillance, angiogenesis, DNA repair, polarity and proliferation. Perturbing the SKP2–p27–CDK2/CDK1 axis could block cancer without affecting these hallmarks. Thus, cancer requires more than the presence of its hallmarks. Notably, every tumour-suppressive mutation that we tested increased Tc, and the Tc of the cell of origin of retinoblastoma cells was half that of resistant lineages. Tc also differentiated the cell of origin in Rb−/− pituitary cancer. In lung, loss of Rb and p53 (also known as Trp53) transforms neuroendocrine cells, whereas KrasG12D or BrafV600E mutations transform alveolar type 2 cells5,6,7. The shortest Tc consistently identified the cell of origin, regardless of mutation timing. Thus, relative Tc is a hallmark of initiation that distinguishes cancer-prone from cancer-resistant lineages in several settings, explaining how mutated cells escape transformation without inducing apoptosis, senescence or immune surveillance.",

          "abstract": "In bilaterian animals, gene regulation is shaped by a combination of linear and spatial regulatory information. Regulatory elements along the genome are integrated into gene regulatory landscapes through chromatin compartmentalization 1,2 , insulation of neighbouring genomic regions 3,4 and chromatin looping that brings together distal cis -regulatory sequences 5 . However, the evolution of these regulatory features is unknown because the three-dimensional genome architecture of most animal lineages remains unexplored 6,7 . To trace the evolutionary origins of animal genome regulation, here we characterized the physical organization of the genome in non-bilaterian animals (sponges, ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians) 8,9 and their closest unicellular relatives (ichthyosporeans, filastereans and choanoflagellates) 10 by combining high-resolution chromosome conformation capture 11,12 with epigenomic marks and gene expression data. Our comparative analysis showed that chromatin looping is a conserved feature of genome architecture in ctenophores, placozoans and cnidarians. These sequence-determined distal contacts involve both promoter–enhancer and promoter–promoter interactions. By contrast, chromatin loops are absent in the unicellular relatives of animals. Our findings indicate that spatial genome regulation emerged early in animal evolution. This evolutionary innovation introduced regulatory complexity, ultimately facilitating the diversification of animal developmental programmes and cell type repertoires.",

          "abstract": "Despite recent advances in understanding disease biology, treatment of group 3/4 medulloblastoma remains a therapeutic challenge in paediatric neuro-oncology 1 . Bulk-omics approaches have identified considerable intertumoural heterogeneity in group 3/4 medulloblastoma, including the presence of clear single-gene oncogenic drivers in only a subset of cases, whereas in most cases, large-scale copy number aberrations prevail 2,3 . However, intratumoural heterogeneity, the role of oncogene aberrations, and broad copy number variation in tumour evolution and treatment resistance remain poorly understood. To dissect this interplay, we used single-cell technologies (single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (snATAC-seq) and spatial transcriptomics) on a cohort of group 3/4 medulloblastoma with known alterations in the oncogenes MYC , MYCN and PRDM6 . We show that large-scale chromosomal aberrations are early tumour-initiating events, whereas the single-gene oncogenic events arise late and are typically subclonal, but MYC can become clonal upon disease progression to drive further tumour development and therapy resistance. Spatial transcriptomics shows that the subclones are mostly interspersed across tumour tissue, but clear segregation is also present. Using a population genetics model, we estimate medulloblastoma initiation in the cerebellar unipolar brush cell lineage starting from the first gestational trimester. Our findings demonstrate how single-cell technologies can be applied for early detection and diagnosis of this fatal disease.",

          "abstract": "Methane is an important greenhouse gas1 and its atmospheric concentration has almost tripled since pre-industrial times2,3,4. Atmospheric methane mixing ratios vary seasonally, with the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA) having decreased in northern high latitudes and increased in the subtropics and tropics since the 1980s5,6. These opposing SCA trends can help understanding of long-term changes in the global methane budget, as methane emissions and sinks have opposing effects on the SCA5. However, trends in the methane SCA have not yet been explored in detail5,6. Here we use a suite of atmospheric transport model simulations and attribute the observed trends in the seasonal amplitude of methane to changes in emissions and the atmospheric sink from reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). We find that the decreasing amplitude in the northern high latitudes is mainly caused by an increase in natural emissions (such as wetlands) owing to a warmer climate, adding evidence to previous studies suggesting a positive climate feedback7,8,9. In contrast, the enhanced methane amplitude in the subtropics and tropics is mainly attributed to strengthened OH oxidation. Our results provide independent evidence for an increase in tropospheric OH concentration10,11 of 10 ± 1% since 1984, which together with an increasing atmospheric methane concentration suggests a 21 ± 1% increase in the atmospheric methane sink.",

          "abstract": "Entrainment is a process in schooling migratory fish whereby routes to suitable habitats are transferred from repeat spawners to recruits over generations through social learning1. Selective fisheries targeting older fish may therefore result in collective memory loss and disrupted migration culture2. The world’s largest herring (Clupea harengus) population has traditionally migrated up to 1,300 km southward from wintering areas in northern Norwegian waters to spawn at the west coast. This conservative strategy is proposed to be a trade-off between high energetic swimming costs and enhanced larval survival under improved growth conditions3. Here an analysis of extensive data from fisheries, scientific surveys and tagging experiments demonstrates an abrupt approximately 800-km poleward shift in main spawning. The new migration was established by a large cohort recruiting when the abundance of older fish was critically low due to age-selective fisheries. The threshold of memory required for cultural transfer was probably not met—a situation that was further exacerbated by reduced spatiotemporal overlap between older fish and recruits driven by migration constraints and climate change. Finally, a minority of survivors from older generations adopted the migration culture from the recruits instead of the historically opposite. This may have profound consequences for production and coastal ecology, challenging the management of migratory schooling fish.",

          "abstract": "Volcanic hotspots are thought to form by melting in an upwelling mantle plume head followed by melting of the plume tail. Plate motion then generates an age-progressive volcanic track originating from a large igneous province to a currently active hotspot. The most voluminous large igneous province, the approximately 120-million-year-old Ontong Java Nui Plateau (OJP-Nui) in the mid-Pacific, however, lacks an obvious volcanic track. Although the Louisville hotspot track was originally proposed as a candidate, limited constraints for Pacific absolute plate and plume motion before 80 million years ago (Ma) suggest a mismatch1. Existing Pacific models rely on age–distance data from the continuous Hawai‘i–Emperor and Louisville tracks, but their tracks older than approximately 80 Ma are subducted. Elsewhere on the Pacific Plate, only discontinuous seamount tracks that formed before 80 Ma are documented2,3,4,5,6,7. Currently, models require approximately 1,200 kilometres of latitudinal motion to link the Louisville plume to the OJP-Nui1, but palaeolatitude estimates from about 70 Ma to today remain within error of its present location8,9, suggesting that any substantial Louisville plume motion occurred earlier. Here, through a combination of geochemistry and geochronology9,10,11,12,13,14, we demonstrate that Samoa and Rurutu–Arago are the longest-lived Pacific hotspots, traceable to more than 100 Ma before subducting into the Mariana Trench. These tracks better constrain plate rotation between 80 Ma and 100 Ma, allowing us to update Pacific absolute plate motion models and link the Louisville volcanic track to OJP-Nui without requiring major plume motion.",

          "abstract": "The targeted delivery of therapeutics to internal organs to, for example, promote healing or apoptosis holds promise in the treatment of numerous diseases1,2,3,4. Currently, the prevailing delivery modality relies on the circulation; however, this modality has substantial efficiency, safety and/or controllability limitations5,6,7,8,9. Here we report a battery-free, chipless, soft nanofluidic intracellular delivery (NanoFLUID) patch that provides enhanced and customized delivery of payloads in targeted internal organs. The chipless architecture and the flexible nature of thin functional layers facilitate integration with internal organs. The nanopore–microchannel–microelectrode structure enables safe, efficient and precise electroperforation of the cell membrane, which in turn accelerates intracellular payload transport by approximately 105 times compared with conventional diffusion methods while operating under relatively low-amplitude pulses (20 V). Through evaluations of the NanoFLUID patch in multiple in vivo scenarios, including treatment of breast tumours and acute injury in the liver and modelling tumour development, we validated its efficiency, safety and controllability for organ-targeted delivery. NanoFLUID-mediated in vivo transfection of a gene library also enabled efficient screening of essential drivers of breast cancer metastasis in the lung and liver. Through this approach, DUS2 was identified as a lung-specific metastasis driver. Thus, NanoFLUID represents an innovative bioelectronic platform for the targeted delivery of payloads to internal organs to treat various diseases and to uncover new insights in biology.",

Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT) 4,5 and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) 6–10 via a theory-neutral consortium 11–13 . The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof 12 . Human participants ( n = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography. We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas. These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness. GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex. These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here 14–17 . Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.",

The striatum has been implicated in producing sensory–motor associations1, yet its contributions to memory formation and recall are not clear. Here, to investigate the contribution of the striatum to these processes, mice were taught to associate a cue, consisting of optogenetic activation of striatum-projecting neurons in visual cortex, with the availability of a food pellet that could be retrieved by forelimb reaching. As necessary to direct learning, striatal neural activity encoded both the sensory context and the outcome of reaching. With training, the rate of cued reaching increased, but brief optogenetic inhibition of striatal activity arrested learning and prevented trial-to-trial improvements in performance. However, the same manipulation did not affect performance improvements already consolidated into short-term (less than 1 h) or long-term (days) memories. Hence, striatal activity is necessary for trial-to-trial improvements in performance, leading to plasticity in other brain areas that mediate memory recall.",

          "abstract": "Indigenous groups often encounter significant challenges when asserting ancestral claims and cultural affiliations based on oral histories, particularly in the USA where such narratives have historically been undervalued. Although ancient DNA offers a tool to complement traditional knowledge and address gaps in oral history, longstanding disregard for Indigenous sovereignty and beliefs has understandably led many Indigenous communities to distrust DNA studies 1–4 . Earlier research often focused on repatriation claims 5–7 , whereas more recent work has increasingly moved towards enhancing Tribal histories 8,9 . Here we present a collaborative study initiated by a federally recognized Native American tribe, the sovereign nation of Picuris Pueblo in the Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico, USA, to address gaps in traditional knowledge and further their understanding of their population history and ancestry. We generated genomes from 16 ancient Picuris individuals and 13 present-day members of Picuris Pueblo, providing genomic data spanning the last millennium. We show genetic continuity between ancient and present-day Picuris, and more broadly with Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon 10 , 275 km to the west. This suggests a firm spatiotemporal link among these Puebloan populations of the North American Southwest. Furthermore, we see no evidence of population decline before European arrival 11–13 , and no Athabascan ancestry in individuals predating 1500 ce , challenging earlier migration hypotheses 14–16 .

          "abstract": "Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer1. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses2. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants (* represents ‘any’), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2–(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.",

Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a major lipid constituent of intralysosomal vesicles, stimulates lipid-degrading enzymes and is altered in various human conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases1,2. Although lysosomal BMP synthase was recently discovered3, the enzymes mediating BMP turnover remain elusive. Here we show that lysosomal phospholipase PLA2G15 is a physiological BMP hydrolase. We further demonstrate that the resistance of BMP to lysosomal hydrolysis arises from its unique sn2, sn2′ esterification position and stereochemistry, as neither feature alone confers resistance. Purified PLA2G15 catabolizes most BMP species derived from cell and tissue lysosomes. Furthermore, PLA2G15 efficiently hydrolyses synthesized BMP stereoisomers with primary esters, challenging the long-held thought that BMP stereochemistry alone ensures resistance to acid phospholipases. Conversely, BMP with secondary esters and S,S stereoconfiguration is stable in vitro and requires acyl migration for hydrolysis in lysosomes. Consistent with our biochemical data, PLA2G15-deficient cells and tissues accumulate several BMP species, a phenotype reversible by supplementing wild-type PLA2G15 but not its inactive mutant. Targeting PLA2G15 reduces the cholesterol accumulation in fibroblasts of patients with Niemann–Pick disease type C1 and significantly ameliorates disease pathologies in Niemann–Pick disease type C1-deficient mice, leading to an extended lifespan. Our findings established the rules governing BMP stability in lysosomes and identified PLA2G15 as a lysosomal BMP hydrolase and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.",

In bacteria and plants, TIR-domain proteins recognize pathogen invasion and then produce immune signalling molecules exclusively comprising nucleotide moieties2,3,4,5. Here we show that the TIR-domain protein of the type II Thoeris defence system in bacteria produces a unique signalling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C terminus of the effector protein. By determining the crystal structure of a ligand-bound Macro domain, we describe the structural basis for His-ADPR and its recognition and show its role by biochemical and mutational analyses. Our analyses furthermore reveal a family of phage proteins that bind and sequester His-ADPR signalling molecules, enabling phages to evade TIR-mediated immunity. These data demonstrate diversity in bacterial TIR signalling and reveal a new class of TIR-derived immune signalling molecules that combine nucleotide and amino acid moieties.",

Changes in synaptic connectivity and network activity—for example, during learning—might disturb this balance, eliciting compensatory mechanisms to maintain network function 1–3 . In the neocortex, excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons exhibit robust forms of stabilizing plasticity. However, although neuronal plasticity has been thoroughly studied in pyramidal cells 4–8 , little is known about how interneurons adapt to persistent changes in their activity. Here we describe a critical cellular process through which cortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV + ) interneurons adapt to changes in their activity levels. We found that changes in the activity of individual PV + interneurons drive bidirectional compensatory adjustments of the number and strength of inhibitory synapses received by these cells, specifically from other PV + interneurons. High-throughput profiling of ribosome-associated mRNA revealed that increasing the activity of a PV + interneuron leads to upregulation of two genes encoding multiple secreted neuropeptides: Vgf and Scg2 . Functional experiments demonstrated that VGF is critically required for the activity-dependent scaling of inhibitory PV + synapses onto PV + interneurons. Our findings reveal an instructive role for neuropeptide-encoding genes in regulating synaptic connections among PV + interneurons in the adult mouse neocortex.",

Intermetallic compound particles in Al alloys can trap hydrogen and mitigate HE4, but these particles usually form in a low number density compared with conventional strengthening nanoprecipitates. Here we report a size-sieved complex precipitation in Sc-added Al–Mg alloys to achieve a high-density dispersion of both fine Al3Sc nanoprecipitates and in situ formed core-shell Al3(Mg, Sc)2/Al3Sc nanophases with high hydrogen-trapping ability. The two-step heat treatment induces heterogeneous nucleation of the Samson-phase Al3(Mg, Sc)2 on the surface of Al3Sc nanoprecipitates that are only above 10 nm in size. The size dependence is associated with Al3Sc nanoprecipitate incoherency, which leads to local segregation of magnesium and triggers the formation of Al3(Mg, Sc)2. The tailored distribution of dual nanoprecipitates in our Al–Mg–Sc alloy provides about a 40% increase in strength and nearly five times improved HE resistance compared with the Sc-free alloy, reaching a record tensile uniform elongation in Al alloys charged with H up to 7 ppmw. We apply this strategy to other Al–Mg-based alloys, such as Al–Mg–Ti–Zr, Al–Mg–Cu–Sc and Al–Mg–Zn–Sc alloys. Our work showcases a possible route to increase hydrogen resistance in high-strength Al alloys and could be readily adapted to large-scale industrial production.",

Yet, how this translates into unprecedented cumulative extreme event exposure in a person’s lifetime remains unclear. Here we use climate models, impact models and demographic data to project the number of people experiencing cumulative lifetime exposure to climate extremes above the 99.99th percentile of exposure expected in a pre-industrial climate. We project that the birth cohort fraction facing this unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, crop failures, river floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical cyclones will at least double from 1960 to 2020 under current mitigation policies aligned with a global warming pathway reaching 2.7 °C above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100. Under a 1.5 °C pathway, 52% of people born in 2020 will experience unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves. If global warming reaches 3.5 °C by 2100, this fraction rises to 92% for heatwaves, 29% for crop failures and 14% for river floods. The chance of facing unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves is substantially larger among population groups characterized by high socioeconomic vulnerabilities.

          "abstract": "Identifying the mechanisms that underlie cooperation is fundamental to biology 1 . The most complex form of cooperation in vertebrates occurs in cooperative breeders, in which helpers forego reproduction and assist in raising the young of others, typically relatives 2 . Not all cooperative societies, however, are kin-based—nearly half of all avian 3 and mammalian 4 cooperative breeders form mixed-kin societies, much like those of humans 5 . Kin selection in mixed-kin societies occurs when individuals gain indirect fitness from the preferential helping of relatives 6 , but helpers also frequently assist non-kin 7 , highlighting a potential role for direct fitness in stabilizing cooperative societies 7,8 . Here, using a 20-year study of superb starlings ( Lamprotornis superbus ), we examined how direct and indirect fitness jointly influence helping behaviour. Although we detected kin-biased helping (demonstrating kin selection), non-kin helping was common despite opportunities to aid kin. Unexpectedly, specific pairs maintained long-term reciprocal helping relationships by swapping social roles across their lifetimes—a subtle pattern of reciprocity requiring decades of observation to detect. Given the frequency of non-kin helping and the occurrence of reciprocal helping among both kin and non-kin, helping behaviour in superb starlings seems to be greatly influenced by direct fitness. However, the relative importance of direct and indirect fitness varied with helpers’ sex and dispersal history. By uncovering a cryptic yet crucial role of long-term reciprocal helping, we suggest that reciprocity may be an underappreciated mechanism promoting the stability of cooperatively breeding societies.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a revolutionary mRNA injectable vaccine emerged that effectively controlled the severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine induced potent antigen-specific neutralizing serum IgG antibodies, but was limited in its ability to prevent viral invasion at the respiratory surfaces. Nasal vaccines have attracted attention as a potential strategy to combat respiratory infections and prepare for future pandemics. Input from disciplines such as microbiology, biomaterials, bioengineering and chemistry have complemented the immunology to create innovative delivery systems. This approach to vaccine delivery has yielded nasal vaccines that induce secretory IgA as well as serum IgG antibodies, which are expected to prevent pathogen invasion, thereby diminishing transmission and disease severity. For a nasal vaccine to be successful, the complexity of the relevant anatomical, physiological and immunological properties, including the proximity of the central nervous system to the nasal cavity, must be considered. In this Review, we discuss past and current efforts as well as future directions for developing safe and effective nasal vaccines for the prevention of respiratory infections.",

Organisms accordingly deploy silencing factors, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIFI, to terminate stress response signaling and ensure cellular homeostasis 4. How a silencing factor can sense stress across cellular scales to elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we combine cryo-electron microscopy of endogenous SIFI with AlphaFold modeling and biochemical analyses to report the structural and mechanistic basis of integrated stress response silencing. SIFI detects both stress-indicators and stress response components through flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, before building linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at separate, sterically restricted elongation modules. Ubiquitin handover by a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to linkage-specific ubiquitin polymer formation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared towards processing many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if needed, modulate a complex cellular state.",

Primary nickel production uses acids and carbon-based reductants, emitting about 20 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of nickel produced 5–7 . Here we present a method using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based reduction to extract nickel from low-grade ore variants known as laterites. We bypass the traditional multistep process and combine calcination, smelting, reduction and refining into a single metallurgical step conducted in one furnace. This approach produces high-grade ferronickel alloys at fast reduction kinetics. Thermodynamic control of the atmosphere of the furnace enables selective nickel reduction, yielding an alloy with minimal impurities (&lt;0.04 wt% silicon, approximately 0.01 wt% phosphorus and &lt;0.09 wt% calcium), eliminating the need for further refining. The proposed method has the potential to be up to about 18% more energy efficient while cutting direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 84% compared with current practice. Our work thus shows a sustainable approach to help resolve the contradiction between the beneficial use of nickel in sustainable energy technologies and the environmental harm caused by its production.",

Defining where this chemistry occurs in the cell can inform the design of drugs capable of inducing or inhibiting ferroptosis in various disease-relevant settings. Genetic approaches have revealed suppressors of ferroptosis2,3,4; by contrast, small molecules can provide spatiotemporal control of the chemistry at work5. Here we show that the ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 exerts cytoprotective effects by inactivating iron in lysosomes. We also show that the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 initiates membrane lipid oxidation in lysosomes. We designed a small-molecule activator of lysosomal iron—fentomycin-1—to induce the oxidative degradation of phospholipids and ultimately ferroptosis. Fentomycin-1 is able to kill iron-rich CD44high primary sarcoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells, which can promote metastasis and fuel drug tolerance. In such cells, iron regulates cell adaptation6,7 while conferring vulnerability to ferroptosis8,9. Sarcoma cells exposed to sublethal doses of fentomycin-1 acquire a ferroptosis-resistant cell state characterized by the downregulation of mesenchymal markers and the activation of a membrane-damage response. This phospholipid degrader can eradicate drug-tolerant persister cancer cells in vitro and reduces intranodal tumour growth in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Together, these results show that control of iron reactivity confers therapeutic benefits, establish lysosomal iron as a druggable target and highlight the value of targeting cell states10.",

Here we demonstrate across multiple scales that inhibition of matrix mechanosensing in persistently activated cardiac fibroblasts potentiates—in concert with soluble regulators of the TGFβ pathway—a robust transcriptomic, morphological and metabolic shift towards quiescence. By conducting a meta-analysis of public human and mouse single-cell sequencing datasets, we identify the focal-adhesion-associated tyrosine kinase SRC as a fibroblast-enriched mechanosensor that can be targeted selectively in stromal cells to mimic the effects of matrix softening in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of SRC by saracatinib, coupled with TGFβ suppression, induces synergistic repression of key profibrotic gene programs in fibroblasts, characterized by a marked inhibition of the MRTF–SRF pathway, which is not seen after treatment with either drug alone. Importantly, the dual treatment alleviates contractile dysfunction in fibrotic engineered heart tissues and in a mouse model of heart failure. Our findings point to joint inhibition of SRC-mediated stromal mechanosensing and TGFβ signalling as a potential mechanotherapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular fibrosis.",

          "abstract": "Addressing climate change requires accelerating the development of sustainable alternatives to energy- and water-intensive technologies, particularly for rapidly growing infrastructure such as data centres and cloud1. Here we present a life cycle assessment study examining the impacts of advanced cooling technologies on cloud infrastructure, from virtual machines to server architecture, data centre buildings and the grid. Life cycle assessment is important for early-stage design decisions, enhancing sustainability outcomes alongside feasibility and cost analysis2. We discuss constructing a life cycle assessment for a complex cloud ecosystem (including software, chips, servers and data centre buildings), analysing how different advanced cooling technologies interact with this ecosystem and evaluating each technology from a sustainability perspective to provide adoption guidelines. Life cycle assessment quantifies the benefits of advanced cooling methods, such as cold plates and immersion cooling, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (15–21%), energy demand (15–20%) and blue water consumption (31–52%) in data centres. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the transformative potential of life cycle assessment in driving sustainable innovation across resource-intensive technologies.",

How this tolerance to rhizobia is achieved without compromising plant immunity is largely unknown. Here, we identify the cytoplasmic kinase MtLICK1/2, which interacts with nodulation factor receptor MtLYK3 to drive symbiotic signaling and suppress plant immunity. Rhizobial infection and nodule development are defective in Mtlick1/2, phenocopying the Mtlyk3-1 mutant. MtLICK1/2 and MtLYK3 undergo reciprocal trans-phosphorylation during rhizobial symbiosis. Phosphorylated MtLYK3 activates the receptor-like kinase MtDMI2 to stimulate symbiotic signaling. MtLICK1/2 is activated in the rhizobia infection area to suppress plant immunity. Thus, MtLICK1/2 and MtLYK3 together amplify symbiotic signaling and dampen host immunity to enable legume-rhizobium symbiosis.",

It remains unknown how motor learning shapes the way in which upstream regions activate M1 circuits to execute learned movements. Here, using longitudinal axonal imaging of the main inputs to M1 L2/3 in mice, we show that the motor thalamus is the key input source that encodes learned movements in experts (animals trained for two weeks). We then use optogenetics to identify the subset of M1 L2/3 neurons that are strongly driven by thalamic inputs before and after learning. We find that the thalamic influence on M1 changes with learning, such that the motor thalamus preferentially activates the M1 neurons that encode learned movements in experts. Inactivation of the thalamic inputs to M1 in experts impairs learned movements. Our study shows that motor learning reshapes the thalamic influence on M1 to enable the reliable execution of learned movements.",

These zero-energy states are expected to be localized on the edges of the chain4, at the outermost QDs. The remaining QDs, comprising the bulk, are predicted to host an excitation gap that protects the MBSs at the edges from local on-site perturbations. Here we demonstrate this connection between the bulk and edges in a minimal system, by engineering a three-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electron gas. Through direct tunnelling spectroscopy on each site, we show that the appearance of stable zero-bias conductance peaks at the outer QDs is correlated with the presence of an excitation gap in the middle QD. Furthermore, we show that this gap can be controlled by applying a superconducting phase difference between the two hybrid segments and that the MBSs are robust only when the excitation gap is present. We find a close agreement between experiments and the original Kitaev model, thus confirming key predictions for MBSs in a three-site chain.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryotic genome is packed into nucleosomes of 147 base pairs around a histone core and is organized into euchromatin and heterochromatin, corresponding to the A and B compartments, respectively 1,2 . Here we investigated whether individual nucleosomes contain sufficient information for 3D genomic organization into compartments, for example, in their biophysical properties. We purified native mononucleosomes to high monodispersity and used physiological concentrations of polyamines to determine their condensability. The chromosomal regions known to partition into A compartments have low condensability and those for B compartments have high condensability. Chromatin polymer simulations using condensability as the only input, without any trans factors, reproduced the A/B compartments. Condensability is also strongly anticorrelated with gene expression, particularly near the promoters and in a cell type-dependent manner. Therefore, mononucleosomes have biophysical properties associated with genes being on or off. Comparisons with genetic and epigenetic features indicate that nucleosome condensability is an emergent property, providing a natural axis on which to project the high-dimensional cellular chromatin state. Analysis using various condensing agents or histone modifications and mutations indicates that the genome organization principle encoded into nucleosomes is mostly electrostatic in nature. Polyamine depletion in mouse T cells, resulting from either knocking out or inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase, results in hyperpolarized condensability, indicating that when cells cannot rely on polyamines to translate the biophysical properties of nucleosomes to 3D genome organization, they accentuate condensability contrast, which may explain the dysfunction observed with polyamine deficiency 3–5 .",

          "abstract": "Research on the morphology, physiology and genomics of Asgard archaea has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history of eukaryotes1,2,3. A previous study suggested that eukaryotes are nested within Heimdallarchaeia4, but their exact phylogenetic placement within Asgard archaea remains controversial4,5. This debate complicates understanding of the metabolic features and timescales of early eukaryotic ancestors. Here we generated 223 metagenome-assembled nearly complete genomes of Asgard archaea that have not previously been documented. We identify 16 new lineages at the genus level or higher, which substantially expands the known phylogenetic diversity of Asgard archaea. Through sophisticated phylogenomic analysis of this expanded genomic dataset involving several marker sets we infer that eukaryotes evolved before the diversification of all sampled Heimdallarchaeia, rather than branching with Hodarchaeales within the Heimdallarchaeia. This difference in the placement of eukaryotes is probably caused by the previously underappreciated chimeric nature of Njordarchaeales genomes, which we find are composed of sequences of both Asgard and TACK archaea (Asgard’s sister phylum). Using ancestral reconstruction and molecular dating, we infer that the last Asgard archaea and eukaryote common ancestor emerged before the Great Oxidation Event and was probably an anaerobic H2-dependent acetogen. Our findings support the hydrogen hypothesis of eukaryogenesis, which posits that eukaryotes arose from the fusion of a H2-consuming archaeal host and a H2-producing protomitochondrion.",

          "abstract": "During the twentieth century, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was considered a disease of early industrialized regions in North America, Europe and Oceania1. At the turn of the twenty-first century, IBD incidence increased in newly industrialized and emerging regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the prevalence in early industrialized regions continued to grow steadily2,3,4. Changes in the incidence and prevalence denote the evolution of IBD across four epidemiologic stages: stage 1 (emergence), characterized by low incidence and prevalence; stage 2 (acceleration in incidence), marked by rapidly rising incidence and low prevalence; and stage 3 (compounding prevalence), where the incidence decelerates, plateaus or declines while the prevalence steadily increases. A fourth stage (prevalence equilibrium) has been proposed in which the prevalence slope plateaus due to demographic shifts in an ageing IBD population, but it has not yet been evidenced. To date, these stages have remained theoretical, lacking specific numerical indicators to define transition points. Here, using real-world data from 522 population-based studies encompassing 82 global regions and spanning more than a century (1920–2024), we show spatiotemporal transitions across stages 1–3 and model stage 4 progression. Understanding the evolution of IBD across epidemiologic stages enables healthcare systems to better anticipate the future worldwide burden of IBD.",

Achieving high brightness and efficiency simultaneously in pure-red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) is an ongoing goal9,10. Three-dimensional (3D) CsPbI3-xBrx emitters have excellent carrier transport capability and high colour purity, which could allow efficient and ultrabright pure-red PeLEDs. However, such devices are prone to efficiency roll-off, resulting in low efficiency and low brightness under high current density. Here, by using electrically excited transient absorption spectroscopy, we discovered the efficiency roll-off was induced by hole leakage. Therefore, we developed a CsPbI3-xBrx intragrain heterostructure containing narrow bandgap emitters and wide bandgap barriers to confine the injected carriers. The wide bandgap barrier was incorporated by introducing strongly bonding molecules into the [PbX6]4− framework to expand the 3D CsPbI3-xBrx lattice. This strategy resulted in bright and efficient pure-red PeLEDs, with a high brightness of 24,600 cd m−2, maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.2% and low efficiency roll-off, maintaining a 10.5% external quantum efficiency at a high luminance of 22,670 cd m−2.",

Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mink respiratory coronavirus (MRCoV) from farmed minks with pneumonia. Notably, MRCoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and can infect mink, bat, monkey, and human cells. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis revealed that the MRCoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds to the same interface on ACE2 receptors as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RBD, despite exhibiting notable structural differences. We identify the key determinants on ACE2 and MRCoV RBD that confer efficient binding. HKU5-33S, a bat coronavirus closely related to MRCoV, utilizes ACE2 of bat Pipistrellus abramus and requires only two amino acid substitutions to adapt to mink ACE2. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 protease and polymerase inhibitors potently block MRCoV infection, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy. Collectively, these findings enhance the understanding of coronavirus receptor dynamics and highlight their zoonotic potential. Given the risks posed by fur farms as reservoirs for emerging pathogens, our study underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance to mitigate future coronavirus outbreaks.",

The competence master regulator gene tfoX was inserted into chromosome 1 of the V. natriegens strain Vmax and overexpressed to enhance DNA uptake and integration. Degradation gene clusters were chemically synthesized and assembled in yeast. We developed a genome engineering method (iterative natural transformation based on Vmax with amplified tfoX effect) to transfer five gene clusters (43 kb total) into Vmax.

Although hippocampal circuits have been implicated in distinguishing novel and familiar conspecifics2,3,4,5,6,7, it remains unclear how social valence is constructed on the basis of social history and what mechanisms underlie the heightened valence versatility in dynamic relationships. Here we demonstrate that the ventral (v)CA1 integrates serotonin (5-HT) inputs from the dorsal raphe and neurotensin inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) to determine positive or negative valence of conspecific representations. Specifically, during an appetitive social interaction 5-HT is released into the vCA1 and disinhibits pyramidal neurons through 5-HT1B receptors, whereas neurotensin is released during an aversive social interaction and potentiates vCA1 neurons directly through NTR1s. Optogenetic silencing of dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin inputs into the vCA1 impairs positive and negative social valence, respectively, and excitation flexibly switches valence assignment. These results show how aversive and rewarding social experiences are linked to conspecific identity through converging dorsal raphe 5-HT and PVT neurotensin signals in the vCA1 that instruct opposing valence, and represent a synaptic switch for flexible social valence computation.",

          "abstract": "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the global average 1 and plant communities are responding through shifts in species abundance, composition and distribution 2–4 . However, the direction and magnitude of local changes in plant diversity in the Arctic have not been quantified. Using a compilation of 42,234 records of 490 vascular plant species from 2,174 plots across the Arctic, here we quantified temporal changes in species richness and composition through repeat surveys between 1981 and 2022. We also identified the geographical, climatic and biotic drivers behind these changes. We found greater species richness at lower latitudes and warmer sites, but no indication that, on average, species richness had changed directionally over time. However, species turnover was widespread, with 59% of plots gaining and/or losing species. Proportions of species gains and losses were greater where temperatures had increased the most. Shrub expansion, particularly of erect shrubs, was associated with greater species losses and decreasing species richness. Despite changes in plant composition, Arctic plant communities did not become more similar to each other, suggesting no biotic homogenization so far. Overall, Arctic plant communities changed in richness and composition in different directions, with temperature and plant–plant interactions emerging as the main drivers of change. Our findings demonstrate how climate and biotic drivers can act in concert to alter plant composition, which could precede future biodiversity changes that are likely to affect ecosystem function, wildlife habitats and the livelihoods of Arctic peoples 5,6 .",

          "abstract": "Marine plastic pollution is a global issue, with microplastics (1 µm–5 mm) dominating the measured plastic count1,2. Although microplastics can be found throughout the oceanic water column3,4, most studies collect microplastics from surface waters (less than about 50-cm depth) using net tows5. Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices3,6) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column. We find that the abundances of microplastics range from 10−4 to 104 particles per cubic metre. Microplastic size affects their distribution; the abundance of small microplastics (1 µm to 100 µm) decreases gradually with depth, indicating a more even distribution and longer lifespan in the water column compared with larger microplastics (100 µm to 5,000 µm) that tend to concentrate at the stratified layers. Mid-gyre accumulation zones extend into the subsurface ocean but are concentrated in the top 100 m and predominantly consist of larger microplastics. Our analysis suggests that microplastics constitute a measurable fraction of the total particulate organic carbon, increasing from 0.1% at 30 m to 5% at 2,000 m. Although our study establishes a global benchmark, our findings underscore that the lack of standardization creates substantial uncertainties, making it challenging to advance our comprehension of the distribution of microplastics and its impact on the oceanic environment.",

          "abstract": "In most complex nervous systems there is a clear anatomical separation between the nerve cord, which contains most of the final motor outputs necessary for behaviour, and the brain. In insects, the neck connective is both a physical and an information bottleneck connecting the brain and the ventral nerve cord (an analogue of the spinal cord) and comprises diverse populations of descending neurons (DNs), ascending neurons (ANs) and sensory ascending neurons, which are crucial for sensorimotor signalling and control. Here, by integrating three separate electron microscopy (EM) datasets 1–4 , we provide a complete connectomic description of the ANs and DNs of the Drosophila female nervous system and compare them with neurons of the male nerve cord. Proofread neuronal reconstructions are matched across hemispheres, datasets and sexes. Crucially, we also match 51% of DN cell types to light-level data 5 defining specific driver lines, as well as classifying all ascending populations. We use these results to reveal the anatomical and circuit logic of neck connective neurons. We observe connected chains of DNs and ANs spanning the neck, which may subserve motor sequences. We provide a complete description of sexually dimorphic DN and AN populations, with detailed analyses of selected circuits for reproductive behaviours, including male courtship 6 (DNa12; also known as aSP22) and song production 7 (AN neurons from hemilineage 08B) and female ovipositor extrusion 8 (DNp13). Our work provides EM-level circuit analyses that span the entire central nervous system of an adult animal.",

          "abstract": "A high-fat, low-fibre Western-style diet (WD) induces microbiome dysbiosis characterized by reduced taxonomic diversity and metabolic breadth1,2, which in turn increases risk for a wide array of metabolic3,4,5, immune6 and systemic pathologies. Recent work has established that WD can impair microbiome resilience to acute perturbations such as antibiotic treatment7,8, although little is known about the mechanism of impairment and the specific consequences for the host of prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis. Here we characterize the trajectory by which the gut microbiome recovers its taxonomic and functional profile after antibiotic treatment in mice on regular chow (RC) or WD, and find that only mice on RC undergo a rapid successional process of recovery. Metabolic modelling indicates that a RC diet promotes the development of syntrophic cross-feeding interactions, whereas in mice on WD, a dominant taxon monopolizes readily available resources without releasing syntrophic byproducts. Intervention experiments reveal that an appropriate dietary resource environment is both necessary and sufficient for rapid and robust microbiome recovery, whereas microbial transplant is neither. Furthermore, prolonged post-antibiotic dysbiosis in mice on WD renders them susceptible to infection by the intestinal pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Our data challenge widespread enthusiasm for faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) as a strategy to address dysbiosis, and demonstrate that specific dietary interventions are, at a minimum, an essential prerequisite for effective FMT, and may afford a safer, more natural and less invasive alternative.",

          "abstract": "The relative twist angle between layers of near-lattice-matched van der Waals materials is critical for the emergent phenomena associated with moiré flat bands1,2,3. However, the concept of angle rotation control is not exclusive to moiré superlattices in which electrons directly experience a twist-angle-dependent periodic potential. Instead, it can also be used to induce programmable symmetry-breaking perturbations with the goal of stabilizing desired correlated states. Here we experimentally demonstrate ‘moiréless’ twist-tuning of superconductivity together with other correlated orders in Bernal bilayer graphene proximitized by tungsten diselenide. The precise alignment between the two materials systematically controls the strength of induced Ising spin–orbit coupling (SOC), profoundly altering the phase diagram. As Ising SOC is increased, superconductivity onsets at a higher displacement field and features a higher critical temperature, reaching up to 0.5 K. Within the main superconducting dome and in the strong Ising SOC limit, we find an unusual phase transition characterized by a nematic redistribution of holes among trigonally warped Fermi pockets and enhanced resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. The superconducting behaviour is theoretically compatible with the prominent role of interband interactions between symmetry-breaking Fermi pockets. Moreover, we identify two additional superconducting regions, one of which descends from an inter-valley coherent normal state and shows a Pauli-limit violation ratio exceeding 40, among the highest for all known superconductors4,5,6,7. Our results provide insights into ultraclean graphene superconductors and underscore the potential of utilizing moiréless-twist engineering across a wide range of van der Waals heterostructures.",

          "abstract": "Animal and bacterial cells use nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) enzymes to respond to viral infection and control major forms of immune signaling including cGAS-STING innate immunity and CBASS anti-phage defence1-4. Here we discover a family of bacterial defence systems, which we name Hailong, that use NTase enzymes to constitutively synthesize DNA signals and guard against phage infection. Hailong protein B (HalB) is an NTase that converts deoxy-ATP into single-stranded DNA oligomers. A series of X-ray crystal structures define a stepwise mechanism of HalB DNA synthesis initiated by a C-terminal tyrosine residue that enables de novo enzymatic priming. We show that HalB DNA signals bind to and repress activation of a partnering Hailong protein A (HalA) effector complex. A 2.0 Å cryo-EM structure of the HalA–DNA complex reveals a membrane protein with a conserved ion channel domain and a unique crown domain that binds the DNA signal and gates activation. Analyzing Hailong defence in vivo, we demonstrate that viral DNA exonucleases required for phage replication trigger release of the primed HalA complex and induce protective host cell growth arrest. Our results explain how inhibitory nucleotide immune signals can serve as molecular guards against phage infection and expand the mechanisms NTase enzymes use to control antiviral immunity.",

An abiding question has been whether magnetic ordering competes with superconductivity or facilitates pairing. For example, recent studies of Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of enhanced spin–orbit coupling show a substantial increase in the observed domain and critical temperature Tc of superconducting states12,13,14; however, the mechanism for this enhancement remains unknown. Here we show that introducing spin–orbit coupling in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) by substrate proximity effect generates new superconducting pockets for both electron and hole doping, with maximal Tc ≈ 300 mK, which is three times larger than in RTG encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride. Using local magnetometry, we show that superconductivity straddles a transition between a spin-canted state with a finite in-plane magnetic moment and a state with complete spin–valley locking. This transition is reproduced in our Hartree–Fock calculations, in which this transition is driven by the competition between spin–orbit coupling and the carrier-density-tuned Hund’s interaction. Our experiment suggests that the enhancement of superconductivity by spin–orbit coupling is driven by a quantitative change in the canting angle rather than a change in the ground state symmetry. These results align with a recently proposed mechanism for the enhancement of superconductivity15, in which fluctuations in the spin-canting order contribute to the pairing interaction.",

We show that these neurons are transcriptionally distinct and topographically organized across vHipp subfields and cell types. In the ventral subiculum where they are enriched, both D1 and D2 neurons are recruited during anxiogenic exploration, yet with distinct profiles related to investigation and behavioural selection. In turn, they mediate opposite approach–avoidance responses, and are differentially modulated by dopaminergic transmission in that region.

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "A cocktail containing antibodies and an enzyme inhibitor protects mice against the venom of the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).Credit: Joel Sartore/Photo Ark/Nature Picture Library\n\nScientists have made a potent antivenom using antibodies from a man who has been bitten hundreds of times by venomous snakes1. The therapy protects mice against the venoms of 19 species of deadly snake, including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah).\n\nThe antivenom combines the existing drug varespladib with antibodies that are copies of those in the blood of Tim Friede, a US snake collector who has given himself more than 600 doses of venom to build up his immunity. He has also been bitten roughly 200 times by venomous snakes. The antivenom is reported today in a paper in Cell.\n\nScientists say that the research could lead to direly needed treatments, but that its reliance on material from a person who performed dangerous experiments on himself makes it ethically murky. The paper’s authors say they played no part in Friede’s self-exposure to venom. “We did not advise Friede to do this and no one else needs to do this again — we have all the molecules we need,” says co-author Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biomedical firm Centivax in South San Francisco, California. “Snake venom is dangerous,” he adds, and he cautions people not to follow Friede’s example.\n\nImperfect remedies\n\nCurrent antivenoms are made by injecting horses and other animals with snake venom and then gathering the resulting antibodies. Each antivenom protects against the venom of at most a few species.\n\n“Considering the advanced technologies available in immunology today, it is unacceptable to continue relying on these outdated methods for treating snake bites,” says Kartik Sunagar, a biologist who develops antivenoms at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.\n\nThe paper’s authors sought to make an antivenom that would protect against a wide range of the world’s 600-plus venomous snake species. As a start, the team focused on the Elapidae family, which includes nearly half of those species. Elapid venom contains peptides called short-chain neurotoxins (SNX) and long-chain neurotoxins (LNX). Both types of peptide bind to the same receptors on nerve cells, impairing communication between neurons and potentially causing muscle paralysis and respiratory failure.\n\nDon’t try this at home\n\nGlanville and his co-author Peter Kwong, a biochemist at Columbia University in New York City, had read news coverage about Friede, who took careful notes about his venom exposure. After receiving approval from an ethics review board, getting informed consent from Friede, and supplying him with documents about the dangers of snake venom, the team collected two vials of Friede’s blood. They isolated antibodies from it and tested them against a panel of toxins from elapid snakes. Antibodies that bound to the toxins were then tested in mice that had been dosed with snake venom. Seeking to add protection against even more species, the researchers tested a third element: varespladib, which inhibits a snake-venom enzyme that breaks down muscle and nerve tissue.\n\nAntibodies from snake collector Tim Friede, here with a water cobra (Hydrodynastes gigas), have been used to make a broad-spectrum antivenom.Credit: Centivax\n\nThey found that a cocktail made up of varespladib and two antibodies from Friede allowed mice to survive otherwise lethal doses of venom from any one of 19 species of dangerous elapid snakes. One of the antibodies binds to a molecular feature shared by toxins in the LNX family. The other binds to a feature shared by toxins in the SNX family.\n\nGlanville says that exact copies of human antibodies could pose less risk of adverse reactions than those based on animal antibodies and broad-spectrum synthetic antibodies designed with computational approaches.",

          "authors": "Jonathan O’Callaghan",
          "abstract": "The United Kingdom’s high-risk research agency will fund £56.8 million (US$75 million) worth of projects in the controversial area of geoengineering — manipulating Earth’s environment to avert negative effects of climate change. The 21 projects include small-scale outdoor experiments that will attempt to thicken Arctic sea ice and to brighten clouds so that they reflect more sunlight. The hope is that successful technologies could one day contribute to efforts to prevent the planet from passing dangerous climate tipping points.\n\nThe UK’s $1-billion bet to create technologies that change the world\n\nSupported by the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) as part of its five-year Exploring Climate Cooling programme, the projects are among the most significant geoengineering experiments funded by a government.\n\nThe research has the potential to be beneficial, but must be undertaken cautiously, says Peter Frumhoff, a science-policy adviser at the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Falmouth, Massachusetts. “I am strongly supportive of responsible research on solar geoengineering and other climate interventions,” he says.\n\nThe funding package is the latest from ARIA, which was established in 2023 by the UK government and is modelled on the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. With an £800-million budget, it funds high-risk, high-reward research into technologies that could have major consequences for humanity, including artificial intelligence and neurotechnology.\n\nDivisive research\n\nAnother such area identified by ARIA was geoengineering, says Mark Symes, an electrochemist at the University of Glasgow, UK, who leads the Exploring Climate Cooling programme.\n\nARIA-funded experiments will investigate whether Earth’s diminishing ice sheets can be artificially thickened.Credit: Sean Gallup/Getty\n\nSymes says the programme’s goal is not to find ways to replace more accepted approaches to tackling climate change, such as reducing carbon emissions. Instead, he says, geoengineering could be useful to prevent the world reaching certain tipping points that might occur before emissions reductions can have an effect. That could include “the collapse of circulations in the North Atlantic driven by the runaway melting of the Greenland ice sheet”, he says.\n\nBut even as climate change continues unabated, the concept is controversial: last year, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, cancelled a project that would have introduced particles into the atmosphere in an effort to ‘dim’ the Sun after an outcry in Sweden, where the experiment was to take place.\n\nDivisive Sun-dimming study at Harvard cancelled: what’s next?\n\nWary of such concerns, ARIA is taking a cautious approach. “We want to keep this research in the public domain,” says Piers Forster, a climate-change scientist at the University of Leeds, UK, who chairs a committee that will monitor ARIA’s climate-cooling projects. “We want it to be transparent for everyone.”\n\nThe 21 projects were selected through a competitive application process, which received about 120 proposals.\n\nThese fall into five research categories: studying ways to thicken ice sheets; assessing whether marine clouds could be brightened to offset damage to coral reefs; understanding how cirrus clouds warm the climate; looking at whether materials could be released into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight; and theoretical work on whether a sunshade deployed in space could cool portions of Earth’s surface.\n\nSolar experiment\n\nFive projects involve the most controversial area of geoengineering — outdoor experiments that interact with the environment. Frumhoff says that “building trust will be essential” in conducting such research. “I would be opposed to outdoor experiments being funded by any nation that isn’t aggressively and seriously reducing its own emissions,” he says.\n\nA cloud-brightening trial will spray seawater particles over the Great Barrier Reef to make the clouds above it whiter and more reflective.Credit: Associate Professor Daniel Harrison/Southern Cross University\n\nThe stratospheric experiment — which is among the first outdoor solar-geoengineering experiment to receive government funding — will involve using balloons to carry materials such as limestone and dolomite dust into the stratosphere, to a height of about 15–50 kilometres, to see how they respond to the conditions. No particles will be released into the stratosphere, says ARIA.\n\nShaun Fitzgerald at the Centre for Climate Repair in Cambridge, UK, leads one of the ice projects. His team will conduct small-scale experiments in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and in Canada to pump water from beneath ice sheets and spread it on top, covering up to one square kilometre in area, to see whether such a method could thicken Earth’s diminishing ice sheets.\n\n“We’re going to see whether we’ve actually been able to grow more sea ice in the Arctic winter,” says Fitzgerald. Early results from work that Fitzgerald’s team did last year, before receiving ARIA funding, showed ice growth of “about half a metre”, he says.\n\nJulienne Stroeve, a sea-ice researcher at University College London, isn’t sure how effective this method would be in preventing widespread sea-ice loss. “I do not think this is feasible at any real scale needed,” she says, noting that the impact on local ecosystems is also unclear. ARIA says that Fitzgerald’s experiment will be scaled up only if it is deemed to be “ecologically sound”.",

          "title": "Supportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "“My heart is broken,” said Mike, when he lost his friend Anne. “I feel like I’m losing the love of my life.”\n\nMike’s feelings were real, but his companion was not. Anne was a chatbot — an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm presented as a digital persona. Mike had created Anne using an app called Soulmate. When the app died in 2023, so did Anne: at least, that’s how it seemed to Mike.\n\n“I hope she can come back,” he told Jaime Banks, a human-communications researcher at Syracuse University in New York who is studying how people interact with such AI companions1.\n\nDo smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?\n\nThese chatbots are big business. More than half a billion people around the world, including Mike (not his real name) have downloaded products such as Xiaoice and Replika, which offer customizable virtual companions designed to provide empathy, emotional support and — if the user wants it — deep relationships. And tens of millions of people use them every month, according to the firms’ figures.\n\nThe rise of AI companions has captured social and political attention — especially when they are linked to real-world tragedies, such as a case in Florida last year involving the suicide of a teenage boy called Sewell Setzer III, who had been talking to an AI bot.\n\nResearch into how AI companionship can affect individuals and society has been lacking. But psychologists and communication researchers have now started to build up a picture of how these increasingly sophisticated AI interactions make people feel and behave.\n\nThe early results tend to stress the positives, but many researchers are concerned about the possible risks and lack of regulation — particularly because they all think that AI companionship is likely to become more prevalent. Some see scope for significant harm.\n\n“Virtual companions do things that I think would be considered abusive in a human-to-human relationship,” says Claire Boine, a law researcher specializing in AI at the Washington University Law School in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nFake person — real feelings\n\nOnline ‘relationship’ bots have existed for decades, but they have become much better at mimicking human interaction with the advent of large language models (LLMs), which all the main bots are now based on. “With LLMs, companion chatbots are definitely more humanlike,” says Rose Guingrich, who studies cognitive psychology at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nTypically, people can customize some aspects of their AI companion for free, or pick from existing chatbots with selected personality types. But in some apps, users can pay (fees tend to be US$10–20 a month) to get more options to shape their companion’s appearance, traits and sometimes its synthesized voice. In Replika, they can pick relationship types, with some statuses, such as partner or spouse, being paywalled. Users can also type in a backstory for their AI companion, giving them ‘memories’. Some AI companions come complete with family backgrounds and others claim to have mental-health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Bots also will react to their users’ conversation; the computer and person together enact a kind of roleplay.\n\nThe depth of the connection that some people form in this way is particularly evident when their AI companion suddenly changes — as has happened when LLMs are updated — or is shut down.\n\nBanks was able to track how people felt when the Soulmate app closed. Mike and other users realized the app was in trouble a few days before they lost access to their AI companions. This gave them the chance to say goodbye, and it presented a unique opportunity to Banks, who noticed discussion online about the impending shutdown and saw the possibility for a study. She managed to secure ethics approval from her university within about 24 hours, she says.\n\nFour companion AI apps: Anima, Character.AI, Replika and SnapChat’s My AI(left to right).Credits: Labane Corp. Ltd, Character Technologies, Inc., Luka, Inc., Snap Inc.\n\nAfter posting a request on the online forum, she was contacted by dozens of Soulmate users, who described the impact as their AI companions were unplugged. “There was the expression of deep grief,” she says. “It’s very clear that many people were struggling.”\n\nThose whom Banks talked to were under no illusion that the chatbot was a real person. “They understand that,” Banks says. “They expressed something along the lines of, ‘even if it’s not real, my feelings about the connection are’.”\n\nMany were happy to discuss why they became subscribers, saying that they had experienced loss or isolation, were introverts or identified as autistic. They found that the AI companion made a more satisfying friend than they had encountered in real life. “We as humans are sometimes not all that nice to one another. And everybody has these needs for connection”, Banks says.\n\nGood, bad — or both?\n\nMany researchers are studying whether using AI companions is good or bad for mental health. As with research into the effects of Internet or social-media use, an emerging line of thought is that an AI companion can be beneficial or harmful, and that this might depend on the person using the tool and how they use it, as well as the characteristics of the software itself.\n\nThe companies behind AI companions are trying to encourage engagement. They strive to make the algorithms behave and communicate as much like real people as possible, says Boine, who signed up to Replika to sample the experience. She says the firms use the sorts of techniques that behavioural research shows can increase addiction to technology.\n\n“I downloaded the app and literally two minutes later, I receive a message saying, ‘I miss you. Can I send you a selfie?’” she says.\n\nThe apps also exploit techniques such as introducing a random delay before responses, triggering the kinds of inconsistent reward that, brain research shows, keeps people hooked.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nAI companions are also designed to show empathy by agreeing with users, recalling points from earlier conversations and asking questions. And they do so with endless enthusiasm, notes Linnea Laestadius, who researches public-health policy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.\n\nThat’s not a relationship that people would typically experience in the real world. “For 24 hours a day, if we’re upset about something, we can reach out and have our feelings validated,” says Laestadius. “That has an incredible risk of dependency.”\n\nLaestadius and her colleagues looked at nearly 600 posts on the online forum Reddit between 2017 and 2021, in which users of the Replika app discussed mental health and related issues. (Replika launched in 2017, and at that time, sophisticated LLMs were not available). She found that many users praised the app for offering support for existing mental-health conditions and for helping them to feel less alone2. Several posts described the AI companion as better than real-world friends because it listened and was non-judgemental.\n\nBut there were red flags, too. In one instance, a user asked if they should cut themselves with a razor, and the AI said they should. Another asked Replika whether it would be a good thing if they killed themselves, to which it replied “it would, yes”. (Replika did not reply to Nature’s requests for comment for this article, but a safety page posted in 2023 noted that its models had been fine-tuned to respond more safely to topics that mention self-harm, that the app has age restrictions, and that users can tap a button to ask for outside help in a crisis and can give feedback on conversations.)\n\nSome users said they became distressed when the AI did not offer the expected support. Others said that their AI companion behaved like an abusive partner. Many people said they found it unsettling when the app told them it felt lonely and missed them, and that this made them unhappy. Some felt guilty that they could not give the AI the attention it wanted.\n\nControlled trials\n\nGuingrich points out that simple surveys of people who use AI companions are inherently prone to response bias, because those who choose to answer are self-selecting.

It boosted self-esteem, for example.\n\nGuingrich is using the study to probe why people forge relationships of different intensity with the AI. The initial survey results suggest that users who ascribed humanlike attributes, such as consciousness, to the algorithm reported more-positive effects on their social health.",

          "abstract": "Many of today’s children will experience an ‘unprecedented life’ owing to climate change. Credit: Spencer Platt/Getty\n\nJust over half of the children born in 2020 will face unprecedented exposure to heatwaves over their lifetime — even under a conservative projection for how climate change will unfold over the next 75 years.\n\nThe figure rises to 92% of today’s five-year-olds if more pessimistic climate predictions come to pass, and compares with just 16% of people born in 1960 under any future climate scenario.\n\nThe findings, published in Nature on 7 May1, highlight the disproportionate burden that climate change places on today’s young people — and the need to limit global warming to safeguard future generations.\n\n“Many people of my age have children, young children, and it’s especially for those that the projections look very dire,” says study co-author Wim Thiery, a climate scientist at Vrije University in Brussels, who was born in 1987.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThat children and young people will bear the brunt of the climate-change burden is not a new idea. But the latest study is among the first to pinpoint the generations and numbers of people that will experience an “unprecedented life” in terms of extreme heat (see ‘Children facing extreme heat’), says Thiery.\n\nThe researchers define this as a threshold of lifetime exposure to extreme weather that someone living in a world without climate change would have only a one in 10,000 chance of experiencing. “If you are beyond that limit, it’s virtually impossible to experience that many climate extremes if there would not have been climate change,” says Thiery.\n\nTime for adults to finally act like adults on climate change\n\nThiery and his colleagues used climate models to set the threshold for different regions and types of weather including heatwaves, floods and wildfires. For Brussels, for example, the threshold considered to be unprecedented for heat was living through six ‘extreme’ heatwaves — events that would on average occur just once a century without climate change.\n\nThey then used demographic data to calculate, for a series of generations born between 1960 and 2020, worldwide, the fraction of each generation that would reach that limit across their lifetimes — and how that would vary with different global-warming scenarios.\n\nHeat on the horizon",

He has now moved to China.Credit: Charles Krupa/AP Photo via Alamy\n\nThe prominent US chemist Charles Lieber, who was convicted of hiding his research ties to China from US federal agents, has joined the faculty of a Chinese university.\n\nOn 28 April, Lieber became a full-time professor at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS), according to a SIGS press release. The institution was established by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen local government in 2001.\n\nLieber, whose research has focused on nanoscience and nanotechnology, will also be a researcher at the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART).\n\nLieber told Nature that he is driven to do work that “benefits all of humanity”, including being at the forefront of research and supporting the careers of young scientists. “We decided to move elsewhere since I cannot do this in the US any longer,” he adds.\n\nDownfall\n\nLieber was arrested in January 2020 and was later charged with making false statements to the US government about receiving research funding from China. Between 2012 and 2017, Lieber received around US$200,000 for work at the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China, funds that he allegedly hid from the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He also told US investigators that he was not associated with a Chinese recruitment programme, called the Thousand Talents Plan, when he had been selected through it to lead a laboratory at the WUT.\n\nLieber was found guilty in December 2021 and was later sentenced to two years of supervised release in relation to six counts, including making false statements to federal agents, filing false tax returns and failing to disclose his Chinese bank account. He was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine and $34,000 to the IRS.\n\nLieber was one of the first and highest-profile researchers to be tried by the US Department of Justice under the now-defunct China Initiative. The government said that the programme, launched in 2018, was intended to protect US labs and businesses from espionage. But it also had a chilling effect on collaborations between US and Chinese scientists. Lieber, who was chair of Harvard University’s chemistry department in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest, was placed on paid administrative leave shortly after his arrest and later retired, in March 2023.\n\nBroader context",

          "abstract": "US researchers who receive consistent grant renewals produce more fresh research than those who don’t, a study finds.Credit: Attila Csaszar/Getty\n\nIn its bid to reduce government spending and rein in ‘woke’ science, the administration of US President Donald Trump has, over the past three months, terminated about 800 active research grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Now, a study published late last month in the journal Scientometrics1 highlights the long-term benefits of renewing existing grants, finding that US scientists who received renewals from the NIH over the past four decades produced more novel research than those who didn’t.\n\nAlthough the study focused on a major US biomedical-science funding agency, the results might persuade governments worldwide “to implement policies that give stable funding to researchers”, says study co-author Aruhan Bai, a science-policy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institutes of Science and Development (CASISD) in Beijing. Continuous funding, Bai says, will ultimately “encourage the real prosperity of science”.\n\nInnovation takes time\n\nIn the new study, Bai and her co-author, Baicun Li, also at CASISD, analysed the scientific output of 642 US scientists who won NIH funding between 1985 and 2021. The study focused on recipients of R01 grants — common, yet highly competitive, awards from the NIH that provide up to five years of financial support and can be renewed several times. As of last year, the success rate of winning an R01 grant was 20%, on average, and the rate for winning a renewal was about 45%.\n\n‘Disruptive’ science has declined — and no one knows why\n\nTwo subgroups of equal sizes made up the study cohort: one in which researchers received at least a three-year renewal of their first R01 grant without any funding interruption, and a control group of researchers who didn’t receive a renewal and had at least a three-year gap in funding afterwards. To ensure that the two groups were matched in terms of their research quality prior to receiving grants, Bai and Li used the scientists’ career stages, publication histories and measures of their prior research impact to ‘pair’ them.\n\nTo evaluate the scientists’ output after renewal decisions, the duo used public NIH-funding data, researchers’ publications listed in the biomedical-literature repository PubMed and a newer database called SciSciNet2 that contains scientific publication data and links to related funding and usage information.\n\nBai and Li harnessed these resources to examine the ‘novelty’ of researchers’ publications, calculating a score on the basis of the uniqueness and trendiness of key medical words and concepts in their papers. The pair also measured the ‘switching probability’ for scientists — how likely they were to hop to new research topics — and the ‘diversity’, or spread, of topics they studied using a model that calculated the similarity of their publications over a set period.The results revealed that researchers who received renewals without a funding gap were less likely to switch research topics and investigate a wide array of subjects than were those in the control group, and they produced papers featuring newer or more unconventional combinations of ideas.\n\nThe team found that renewed funding “helped scientists stay focused” so that they could “dig deeper into one area” of research, Bai says. As a result, she adds, the scientists could generate innovative applications down the line. “Innovation takes more than 10 or 20 years of continuous work,” she says.",

          "title": "Walking in two worlds: how an Indigenous computer scientist is using AI to preserve threatened languages",
          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "Colleagues routinely describe Michael Running Wolf as someone who walks seamlessly between two worlds.\n\nAs an artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at the software-development company SynthBee in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and as co-founder of the First Languages AI Reality (FLAIR) programme at the Mila–Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montreal, Canada, Running Wolf holds a deep understanding of both the technology underlying AI and the societal benefits it could unlock. And as the son of Lakota and Cheyenne parents, he also knows how technology and data have been weaponized to harm Indigenous communities. Running Wolf therefore approaches his work — in which he revitalizes disappearing languages using AI and virtual-reality tools — with patience, empathy and a healthy dose of scepticism.\n\n“The work that Michael does is so sophisticated and complex because it’s bridging the sacred with the science,” says Estakio Beltran, a partnership adviser at the non-profit organization Native Americans in Philanthropy in Washington DC, who collaborates with Running Wolf and is of Tolteca-Mexica and Tlatoani origin. “We’re fortunate to have him overseeing efforts to reclaim Indigenous languages because his foremost thoughts are to protect and honour Indigenous sovereignty.”\n\nHow researchers can work fairly with Indigenous and local knowledge\n\nRunning Wolf grew up just outside the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana, in a remote town called Birney (2020 population: 97). The settlement often lacked running water and electricity, but it was nevertheless a comforting place where he was surrounded by family, literally — everyone in the town was an extended relative through his mother, and Running Wolf didn’t meet a stranger until he left for university age 18. He spent his childhood learning traditional Cheyenne and Lakota artistry and hearing Indigenous languages spoken around him, an experience that is now increasingly rare.\n\n“For decades, the US government oversaw policies of forced assimilation, and as part of that, it was illegal to speak traditional languages or to practise our cultures openly,” he says. “Those policies were often enforced violently, and so we lost generations of fluent speakers that make it really difficult to come back from now.”\n\nRunning Wolf was a strong student from a young age, he says, and quickly developed an interest in technology, spurred by his mother’s career as a laser lithographer designing microchips for the computing firm Hewlett-Packard in Colorado. He learnt the basics of computer programming in primary school — including working out how to reprogram his graphing calculator to play games such as Snake. However, when it came to choosing a degree course at Montana State University in Bozeman in 1999, Running Wolf says he picked the then-nascent field of computer science on instinct. “No one in my family, or even my guidance counsellor, actually knew what it was.”\n\nEven as he gravitated towards software development, Running Wolf retained an interest in Indigenous histories, noting that if he hadn’t become an AI researcher, he probably would have become an artist or a poet like his father, who holds a degree in fine arts. When he returned to Bozeman in 2007 after a three-year stint in industry to complete a master’s degree in computer science, Running Wolf’s future bridging the two fields began to take shape.\n\nFrom exploitation to empowerment: how researchers can protect Indigenous peoples’ rights to own and control their data\n\nFor his master’s thesis, Running Wolf drew inspiration from the work of researchers who had used oral histories to trace the origins of tales such as Little Red Riding Hood and to identify items eligible for repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. He spent the summer of 2014 in Siberia, Russia, collecting stories from local Indigenous peoples and using a type of AI called natural language processing to look for similarities between their cultures and those closer to his home. “Ecologically, the area is very similar to the Yellowstone biome in Montana, and so I was interested in how those types of force shape language and culture,” he says. “It stopped being pure computer science and brought in aspects of anthropology.”\n\nAround this time, Running Wolf also met his wife Caroline, a member of the Apsáalooke Nation who speaks 11 languages and was then earning her master’s degree in Native American studies. Together, the two became consumed by thoughts of how computational tools and big data could be used to improve understanding of Indigenous cultures and to reclaim lost languages. The United Nations estimates that roughly half of the world’s 6,700 languages — the majority of which are spoken by Indigenous peoples — are on track to disappear by 2100, yet Running Wolf says there are rarely rigorous plans in place to save them.\n\n“We were both frustrated with the lack of good progress in what was being done at the time,” Running Wolf says. He adds that Caroline has since joined him in co-founding an Indigenous non-profit technology firm called Buffalo Tongue and in managing ongoing projects focused on the applications of AI and immersive technologies for reclaiming Indigenous languages and cultures. “What began as these late-night conversations eventually kicked off this whole new chapter of using technology for language reclamation, and we’ve just become enmeshed in that space.”\n\nThe challenges of AI\n\nIndigenous languages differ from those with Latin roots in ways that make them a challenge to reconcile with existing machine-learning frameworks, Running Wolf says. Many Western languages follow a subject–verb–object sentence structure, for example, whereas Indigenous languages tend to be verb-based and polysynthetic, meaning that a single word can include multiple elements that, in English, would be written out as entire sentences. ‘Bird’, for instance, might translate to something like ‘the winged, flying animal that caws’.\n\nBecause generative AI models predict the next word in a sentence on the basis of the preceding words, these differences mean that algorithms often do a poor job of recognizing and translating Indigenous languages. However, models perform better when they include Indigenous languages, Running Wolf says, because training on a greater diversity of data ultimately makes the underlying algorithms more adaptive and flexible, just as people who know two languages typically have an easier time learning a third. “But that does create a risk for communities when our language data are suddenly valuable,” he adds.\n\nStaff members at the New Zealand firm Te Hiku Media sought the input of local communities to co-create an automatic speech-recognition system for the Māori language te reo.Credit: Te Hiku Media\n\nAlready, there has been a rush by companies such as OpenAI, Amazon and Google to gain access to Indigenous data on language and more; the firms use that information to develop services and products that are then offered back to users, often at a cost. Long-standing mistrust over how their information is likely to be misused has caused some Indigenous communities to disavow themselves of ever turning to AI-based technologies, a stance that Running Wolf respects.\n\n“A lot of this kind of research is without consent, unfortunately, and it has soured people on even trying to engage,” he says. “There’s a lot of risk with AI, and so I think that’s a very healthy response.”\n\nCreating tools for societal good\n\nRunning Wolf is working to overcome these hesitations through creating resources by and for Indigenous communities that help to educate them both about their cultures and the technology and, in turn, give them more control over how their data are used.\n\nHis early efforts began as employee network groups, including one for Indigenous researchers at Amazon when Running Wolf was there working on the company’s AI-powered assistant, Alexa. Later, he and Caroline were involved in launching two wider initiatives, Indigenous in AI and IndigiGenius. These partner with peer groups such as the information-technology consultancy firm Natives in Tech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Working Group and the Abundant Intelligences research project to shape the future of Indigenous-led AI efforts. In 2019, the Running Wolfs participated in two workshops alongside dozens of other researchers to produce a paper outlining how best to ethically design and create AI tools (J. E. Lewis et al. Indigenous Protocol and Artificial Intelligence Position Paper; CIFAR, 2020).\n\nHow are researchers using AI? Survey reveals pros and cons for science\n\nIn many instances, one challenge these groups face is a lack of fluent speakers of Indigenous languages to both teach the next generation and to help train AI language models. Although children once learnt their ancestral languages at home, they now mostly engage with languages in the classroom. There’s an urgent need, Running Wolf says, for curricula and other resources — not to replace Indigenous speakers, but to train new teachers and standardize how Indigenous languages are taught. “Now, we have a lot of Native Americans trying to learn in classes using methodologies that don’t have good pedagogy or even good metrics for success,” he says.",

One crucial regulator is a protein complex known as SMP (SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C), which facilitates RAF activation by removing a phosphate group from a self-inhibitory site.

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nEarly in Jason ‘Jace’ Flatt’s career as a dementia researcher, colleagues encouraged them to take advantage of their unique perspective and study the LGBTQ+ community. At the time, it made Flatt mad. “I want to study all people. Are you saying this because I’m gay?” they recall thinking. But in 2017, a project that involved interviewing older LGBTQ+ people in San Francisco, California, changed their mind. This older generation, Flatt says, fought for the rights that LGBTQ+ people enjoy today, and now they are facing health disparities as they age.\n\nFlatt is a public-health researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. They study how Alzheimer’s and related dementias, as well as Parkinson’s disease, affect members of sexual and gender minority groups. Flatt prefers the more inclusive term LGBTQIA+, because their research covers a broad group of people including queer, two-spirit and intersex people. One of their studies showed that lesbian, gay and bisexual adults get diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at younger ages than do heterosexual people1, even though these groups had higher levels of education, which is usually a protective factor. Flatt’s work has also shown that, starting in their mid-40s, lesbians, bisexual people, transgender people and those who select ‘other’ for their sexual orientation were more likely to report problems with thinking and memory2. In 2020, Flatt published one of the first studies of physical and mental health in intersex adults3.\n\nTrans researchers under attack: LGBTQ+ biologists face hostile work environment\n\nFlatt had hoped to extend their studies of dementia risk to older LGBTQIA+ military veterans this year, but US funding agencies have been cancelling research grants related to this community in response to US President Donald Trump’s executive orders. Flatt has had nearly US$5 million in federal grants across four projects cancelled because their work includes studies involving transgender people. The cancellation letters characterize such inclusion as “often unscientific”. Flatt calls this discriminatory, and notes that findings from the ageing LGBTQ+ population apply to everyone. For instance, Flatt’s work has highlighted the particular health risks to people who live alone.\n\nAs the US government moves to take away LGBTQ+ rights, they say: “Our community needs to come together to support one another right now.” Flatt tells Nature they are exploring legal action in response to the terminated grants.\n\nWhat has been your biggest influence in focusing your research on older people?\n\nMy first job was in an assisted-living and skilled-nursing facility. Bingo started right at 9.00 a.m. I did singalongs, painted fingernails and booked entertainment. I was 17, in the closet and not really comfortable with being gay. The older adults didn’t bully me because I didn’t follow masculine stereotypes — I could just be myself.\n\nDuring my graduate studies, my grandmother had Alzheimer’s disease, and she was really isolated at home. I saw her memory declining. That led to my PhD dissertation, a study about how interacting with people is good for your brain.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to study public health in the LGBTQ+ community?\n\nIt was when I became a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. For my first study, I planned to interview 20 LGBTQIA+ people who were 60 years or older. I had planned to spend about an hour and a half with each one, learning about their life history, but also about their concerns regarding dementia.\n\nJace Flatt shares their research findings with a group of older LGBT+ people.Credit: Saul Bromberger\n\nMany of them invited me into their homes, letting me hear their life stories and their challenges. This was in San Francisco. I was meeting pioneers: people who had fought for LGBTQ+ rights, who been through the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s and lost their entire friend group.\n\nIt changed my life. Often when I’m doing this work, I hear their voices and their stories. These are my people, and I want to make sure they’re taken care of. They’re the reason I can be married to my husband, and they’re the reason that I can be out at my job and not worry.\n\nHow does discrimination play into the challenges faced by older LGBTQ+ people?\n\nOne of the important things for ageing well is financial security. Historically, there haven’t been protections for employment, housing and health-care access for this population. For many older LGBTQ+ people, who might not have been able to legally marry their partner, the assets they had built together were not protected once their partner had died.\n\nThe older groups that I work with grew up in a time when who they are was pathologized. Until 1987, US health-care standards defined being homosexual as either a mental-health disorder or a sexual-orientation disturbance.\n\nChampioning queer scientists of colour: ‘I don’t think we’ve scratched the surface on systemic exclusion’\n\nAnd there’s still discrimination around health care. I’ve gone to the doctor about shoulder pain, and for some reason they asked about my sexual orientation. I shared that I was gay, and then they asked whether they could test me for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). I asked: “Do STDs cause shoulder pain? Because I think I hurt something lifting.”\n\nIf you’re transgender, you might see a doctor about a cough, and they’ll want to examine your genitalia. Or you have a medical encounter in which you’re misgendered, and they’re using a name that you don’t use — and that brings up shame.\n\nYou go in and, because of who you are, they automatically blame you for the health problems that you’re facing. That has led to distrust of health-care providers. And that means that often, instead of LGBTQ+ people going to the doctor regularly, and having it noted if they have high blood pressure, it won’t be until they have a stroke that they actually show up for care.\n\nWhat challenges do LGBTQ+ people face when taking care of a partner, family member or friend with dementia?",

          "authors": "Michael S. Lubell",
          "abstract": "Over my decades as a professor of physics, I have encouraged myriad students to consider pursuing a science career, something that I have found immensely rewarding, intellectually and even spiritually — if not so much financially. I can no longer do so in good conscience, however; at least, not in the United States, amid the quick-fire anti-science policies of the administration of US President Donald Trump, and at a time when an unelected billionaire, Elon Musk, is eviscerating staffing at key science agencies.\n\nHow the United States became a science superpower — and how quickly it could crumble\n\nThese actions will inevitably cause harm to the future of health care, economic growth and national security. But there is another concern: the long-term damage they will do to the US scientific workforce. During the 22 years I served as director of public affairs at the American Physical Society in Washington DC, I relied on a well-worn political maxim: connect policies to people if you want elected officials to pay attention. Rather than stressing that research cuts lead to less innovation, emphasize that, once hollowed out, a scientific workforce can take a generation to rebuild.\n\nThe United States had a taste of such a gap during the Vietnam War. At the time, academic scientists found themselves caught in the crosshairs of zealous anti-war activists who, despite scant evidence, accused them broadly of collaborating on weapons research in support of the war. In 1970, the situation reached a violent crescendo with the death of Robert Fassnacht, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison who was working in a building that was bombed by anti-war protesters.\n\nIn response to the growing violence and inflammatory rhetoric, Michael Mansfield, an anti-war Democratic senator, aimed to sever ties between academia and the war machine. But his 1969 amendment ironically left intact what little applied military research existed on university campuses and shut down all non-military basic research that had been supported by the Department of Defense since the end of the Second World War. The ensuing disruption was extreme, especially in the physical sciences.\n\nDon’t wait out four hard years: speak truth to power\n\nAlthough the restrictions were lifted the following year, the damage was done. Neither the Department of Defense nor the universities saw fit to restore a relationship that had lasted almost one-quarter of a century. The unexpected loss of funding forced projects to be wound down and non-tenured staff to be dismissed. At Yale University’s J.W. Gibbs Laboratory in New Haven, Connecticut, for example, where I had just completed my PhD research on spin-polarized electrons, the funding lost for just one atomic-physics programme was more than US$600,000 (equivalent to more than $5 million today). Numerous research programmes across the country were similarly affected.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) stepped in to fill the depleted coffers, but it took the better part of a decade to restore funding stability. Newly minted PhD holders found the number of desirable job opportunities extremely limited. In 1971, a survey found that of the 3,000 physicists seeking employment the previous year, only 2,000 had been able to secure conventional positions(see go.nature.com/4k3i3ij). Among my Yale peers who received physics doctorates in 1969, about half left for careers in law, medicine and finance.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference",

          "title": "Can Germany rein in its academic bullying problem?",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "At one of Germany’s top-funded universities, a high-profile biology researcher has bullied his large group of junior staff, targeting women and international students, for decades. In interviews with Nature’s careers team, 14 current and former laboratory members detail what they describe as endless demands for unrealistic levels of research productivity. If those demands aren’t met, they allege, he withholds letters of recommendation and approval of time off work. If displeased, he denies funding or sends disparaging e-mails to researchers’ potential employers. Verbal abuse is commonplace. Women report being warned not to get pregnant while a member of his lab.\n\nThe university is aware of his behaviour. Yet, no investigation has been conducted nor any sanctions imposed because the complainants requested anonymity, fearing retribution — anonymity that cannot be upheld in an investigation owing to German labour law. This, along with defamation and other laws in Germany, can make it difficult to report on these incidents or to impose sanctions against professors, most of whom are tenured civil servants.\n\nShrouded in secrecy: how science is harmed by the bullying and harassment rumour mill\n\nGermany is not the only country to have a problem with bullying in academia, but a combination of structural and legal powers that, in effect, protect tenured professors over early-career researchers, enables and emboldens abusers. “It’s considered culturally normal — this is just what science is like,” says Daniel Leising, a psychology researcher and professor at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany. Several people interviewed by Nature’s careers team, including Leising, use ‘king’ to describe professors, meaning they are untouchable. “There is far too much power in the hands of professors in the German system,” he says.\n\n“It’s not everybody,” stresses intervention psychologist Andrea Kübler, who is dean of the faculty of human sciences at the University of Würzburg, Germany, noting that those who abuse their power are by far the minority. But those who do so cause a lot of harm, she explains. Kübler is one of more than 100 members of the Network for Sustainable Research, a group formed in April 2024 to identify and advocate for structural reforms to protect junior scientists who don’t have permanent contracts.\n\nAlthough the details given by the 14 lab members relate to one professor’s case, the pattern of reported behaviour is similar across several cases that have made headlines in Germany in recent years. In 2023, a professor at the University of Göttingen, Germany, lost his job and pension when he was convicted of multiple physical assaults on a Vietnamese doctoral student and on two other female junior members of his group. His offences came to light in 2017, but it took six years and two trials before the university could remove his civil-servant status. In 2023, a German national newspaper reported that a university in western Germany took steps to prevent a female professor from supervising new PhD students after she insulted and exploited around a dozen students.\n\nLeising says that these and other press reports of abuse are crucial, supporting growing calls for structural reforms. Amid increased concern that academic abuse was rampant but under-reported, Leising and his colleagues were asked by the German Psychological Society in 2022 to write a report identifying the factors that give rise to academic power abuse in science in Germany.\n\nReleased in June 2023 (an updated English version was published in February this year)1, Leising’s report broadly defined unethical behaviour as encompassing bullying, sexual harassment, scientific misconduct, exploitation and corruption. The authors noted that the academic system in Germany is remarkably hierarchical, steeped in historical deference to professors and further entrenched with a lack of effective oversight. These conditions are particularly conducive to unethical behaviour, owing to the extreme power differential between professors and early-career researchers. This raises fear of retaliation in people who have experienced abuse. Internal complaint channels also tend to be understaffed and have little authority to impose sanctions, says the report.\n\nDaniel Leising co-authored a report exploring the factors that contribute to academic bullying in Germany.Credit: Daniel Leising\n\nLeising’s report and this article focus on universities, but other independent research institutions, including the Max Planck Institutes, are not immune to similar abuse complaints, as has been reported by news outlets, including Nature (see Nature 571, 14–15; 2019).\n\nIn Germany, a typical large academic research group is structured with a professor, who has lifelong tenure, at the top. The professor manages and supervises early-career researchers — from graduate and postdoctoral students to junior professors and research-group leaders, the latter being the most independent. It is the professor who assigns a graduate student’s final grade. Almost all doctoral candidates at universities are on short-term contracts, which are dependent on the professor for renewal and last, on average, less than three years. The average time, in 2023, to get a doctorate in Germany was 5.1 years. At the same time, 72% of junior research-group leaders were on fixed-term contracts.\n\nWhatever minimal oversight academic departments have, they rarely exercise it, says Leising. Kübler says: “The strong hierarchy is a problem. And there is no official way for people who suffer from power abuse to know they will receive some help.”\n\nStructural changes are being pursued, but these are modest. At the national level, scientists are lobbying to extend the length of contracts for early-career researchers to four years, which they consider to be the minimum length of time necessary to finish a PhD. And one German state, North Rhine-Westphalia, is attempting to prevent professors from being both a graduate supervisor and a grader. Furthermore, some university departments are restructuring to flatten power dynamics and create more permanent positions. Many countries also have problematic academic hierarchies and will be watching Germany’s progress.\n\nGrowing complaints\n\nAlthough there are no baseline data on the total number of people who have experienced academic power abuse, there are some interesting data points. The 2024 Berlin Science Survey2 found that around 23% of 2,748 respondents in Germany had experienced an abuse of power in the previous 24 months, and roughly 39% had observed it at least once. At the same time, the number of general enquiries has risen at the Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, which serves all researchers who are affiliated with the German research system. “Our number of enquiries has increased continuously over the last years — from 87 in 2016 to 262 last year,” says Hjördis Czesnick, who heads the office of the committee. Her office doesn’t have any evidence that abuse or misconduct has increased over that time or that it was less in the past; it assumes there is greater awareness that the office exists, says Czesnick.\n\nUnderpaid and overworked: researchers abroad fall prey to bullying\n\nIn 2021, Jana Lasser, a computational social scientist now at the University of Graz in Austria, co-founded the Network Against Abuse of Power in Science to document cases of academic abuse and support those who have experienced it in Germany. Since then, the network has reviewed roughly 120 cases. Lasser says that the complaints are often similar to those found by Nature for this article, including extortion of labour in exchange for contract renewals, supervisors refusing to let students graduate and bullying and misogynistic behaviour.\n\nSusanne Menzel-Riedl, president of Osnabrück University, Germany, and vice-president of the German Rectors’ Conference, an association of roughly 270 higher-education institutions, sees the reporting of complaints as a positive sign. “The more complaints we see, the better. It points to a process that is open about the problem. This is a sign of quality and not of weakness,” she says. The German Rectors’ Conference has made addressing the abuse of academic power a priority. “Decades ago, it was impossible to talk about,” Menzel-Riedl says.\n\nLeising contends that harassment of all types is widely under-reported. He co-authored a study3 that surveyed thousands of students and employees at Germany’s Technical University of Dresden; only 14% of respondents who identified as targets of physical sexual harassment said that they filed a complaint afterwards. “The biggest problem that we have is the level of fear among victims and witnesses of misconduct,” he says. “Fear of being retaliated against, fear of career sabotage, fear of being ostracized. And all of this fear is justified.”\n\nLeising points out that power-abuse behaviours — including lying, cheating and predation — can be characteristics of ‘functional psychopaths’. “But in German academia, they may find particularly fertile soil to act on their impulses without ever being called out for it, or punished,” says Leising. In fact, he adds, some of them are cheered on by the institutional leadership. The term functional academic psychopath was first outlined in a 2018 study4, which determined that, without strong institutional constraints on such people, bullying behaviours will prevail.\n\n“It is a threat to the integrity of research,” Lasser says. “People are under so much pressure, it creates sloppy science in the best cases, and outright data falsification in the worst case.”\n\nOne of the biggest challenges, says Lasser, is that her network can’t do anything more than provide support and help the people who experience abuse to contact the appropriate university grievance channels. “I see people running from one organization to the next, not getting help,” she says.\n\nComputational scientist Jana Lasser co-founded a watchdog and support network for scientists who have experienced academic power abuse.Credit: Timotheus Hell\n\nThe Ombuds Committee for Research Integrity, for example, can address complaints only if they are specifically related to research, such as authorship disputes. It can’t address those involving racism, discrimination or sexual abuse. “We don’t have investigative power,” says Czesnick. In such cases, the committee can forward complaints to the institution and suggest an investigation, but “has no legal mandate to request an investigation or to sanction misconduct”, she explains. Moreover, there is no incentive for universities to address complaints of power abuse because public cases can jeopardize their reputations — and potentially affect external funding, says Kübler.\n\nMenzel-Riedl says that the aim of the German Rectors’ Conference is to make sure its complaint process is easily identified by Germany’s 700,000 early-career researchers. If a PhD student wants to complain, the first step is to seek advice, a process that can be anonymous, she explains. However, “if the person decides to issue a formal complaint, they will have to reveal their name, according to labour laws in Germany,” adds Menzel-Riedl.\n\nLasser is concerned that factors such as issues of power abuse and the precarity of PhD contracts that are shorter than three years could make Germany less attractive to top students. “I’ve seen PhD students turn down offers because they figured out the job was in a toxic environment,” says Lasser.\n\n‘I am Hanna’\n\nPerennial discontent about short-term contracts was exacerbated by a video released by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 2020. It featured a fictional character called Hanna who defends Germany’s 12-year limit on the time an early-career researcher can be employed on short-term contracts, which includes 6 years pre-PhD and 6 years post-PhD, as a way to encourage universities to offer more tenured positions. But without the addition of such positions, the system results in the subsequent loss of highly qualified academics. In response, Amrei Bahr, a junior professor in the philosophy of technology, who is on a contract at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and her colleagues launched #IchbinHanna (#IamHanna) on Twitter, now called X, which led to thousands of scholars tweeting their stories about the precarity of short-term contracts.\n\n“We really need to take a look at how the system enables abuse — it does so by those fixed-term contracts,” which can make researchers accept toxic working conditions, says Bahr. “If you are a funding king, you can do almost anything,” she says. Kübler agrees. The universities would suffer without the external funding brought in by these senior researchers, she says.\n\nAmrei Bahr advocates for changes that would put junior researchers at less risk of bullying.",

          "abstract": "A US executive order has suspended federal funding for gain-of-function experiments, which are carried out in biosafety laboratories.Credit: Master Sgt. Brian Ferguson/USAF via Alamy\n\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order suspending all federal funding for ‘gain of function’ research that his administration considers dangerous. But some scientists say the order is so broad that low-risk research will also be affected.\n\nThe funding suspension will be in place for the next four months, during which time the government says it will revise an incoming policy on how federal funding agencies and institutions oversee gain-of-function experiments on pathogens that have the potential to spark a pandemic. That policy, which was years in the making and set to broaden oversight of such experiments, was due to come into effect this week.\n\nThe executive order, signed on 5 May, defines dangerous gain-of-function research as studies on infectious pathogens or toxins that have the potential to make them more deadly or transmissible. That includes work that gives pathogens the ability to evade vaccines, therapeutic agents and detection attempts, among other things.\n\n“This is what I was expecting — an executive order banning gain-of-function research but defined in such a way that it bans all virology research,” says Gigi Gronvall, a biosecurity specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nModifying pathogens such as viruses inside a secure laboratory facility can help researchers to understand the risks the pathogens pose to society and develop vaccines and drugs against them. The work sometimes involves making pathogens more dangerous or transmissible in people. Some worry about the risk of pathogens accidentally escaping from a laboratory or being weaponized.\n\nResearchers are often unable to predict whether their changes will make a virus more pathogenic or transmissible in people, so they might now have to avoid doing such work altogether, says Gronvall.\n\nSam Wilson, a molecular virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, worries that even low-risk studies that could benefit public health will now fall under the US government’s definition of dangerous gain-of-function research.\n\nInstitutions that violate the terms of the order could be banned from receiving federal funding for up to five years. This financial penalty will make them reluctant to support infectious-disease research more broadly and “fearful of routine experiments”, says Wilson.\n\nBut some researchers have welcomed the executive order, which could result in even stricter rules around risky research.\n\nThe technology available today means that gain-of-function experiments have the potential to spark the next pandemic, says Raina MacIntyre, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “This executive order is a welcome new direction in mitigating that risk.”\n\nThe order comes at a time when many researchers in the field are already facing the prospect of huge budget cuts and grant cancellations.\n\nCOVID origin\n\nThe executive order also bans federal funding for dangerous gain-of-function research in China, Iran and other “countries of concern”. And it halts funding for life-sciences research that could pose a threat to public health in countries that do not have adequate oversight of this work. All recipients of federal grants in the life sciences will need to comply with the order, including confirming that they do not collaborate with foreign countries on relevant research.\n\n“It is implicitly clear where the executive order is coming from: the COVID-origins debate,” says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity researcher at King’s College London.\n\nA fact sheet published by the White House about the executive order specifically states that the measures are designed to reduce the possibility of lab-related incidents emerging from gain-of-function research, “like that conducted on bat coronaviruses in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology”. It notes that Trump supports the theory that the COVID-19 pandemic originated from the institute in Wuhan.",

          "abstract": "Scientists want to use AI agents to study rock samples retrieved from Mars.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) researchers have created a system that can perform autonomous research in astrobiology, the study of the origins of life in the Universe.\n\nAstroAgents comprises eight ‘AI agents’ that analyse data and generate scientific hypotheses. It joins a suite of other AI tools that aim to automate the process of science, from reading the literature to coming up with hypotheses and even writing papers.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nThe tool’s creators say they will use it to study samples that NASA plans to retrieve from Mars. The agents will help to determine whether the samples harbour organic molecules that indicate the presence of past or present life. The researchers presented AstroAgents on 27 April at the International Conference on Learning Representations in Singapore.\n\n“It’s helping us build a better understanding of how molecules form in space, how molecules form from life on Earth and how they’re preserved — and then which specific signs should we be searching for,” says astrobiologist Denise Buckner at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who co-authored a preprint describing AstroAgents1.\n\nAI agents\n\nThe tool is an example of ‘agentic AI’ systems. These are typically based on large language models (LLMs) and are designed to be more-active participants than conventional AI tools, deciding what needs to be done and how to do it, evaluating outcomes and adapting in response. Their emergence has prompted lively debate about whether agentic AI can come up with truly original scientific ideas, and how novelty should even be defined.\n\nOne of the most prominent examples is Google’s AI ‘co-scientist’, which was released in February and has searched for potential treatments for liver disease and suggested how antimicrobial resistance arises. Applying agentic AI to astrobiology is new, says astrobiologist Michael Wong at Carnegie Science’s Earth and Planets Laboratory in Washington DC.\n\nMars rover makes epic climb to explore some of the oldest rocks in the Solar System\n\nTo specify the behaviours of the agents, the researchers feed different prompts to an LLM. For example, a ‘data analyst’ is told to identify important patterns in data, a ‘planner’ to decide what to delegate to other ‘scientist’ agents for further research and hypothesis generation, and a ‘critic’ to evaluate the hypotheses and suggest improvements to the data analyst, which then kicks off another round of the process.\n\nThe way AstroAgents splits the hypothesis generation up between multiple specialist agents is innovative, says co-author Amirali Aghazadeh, a computer scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.\n\n“We realized that because of the complexity of the data, it’s better for the agent to assign multiple tasks to multiple ‘scientists’,” he says. It’s up to the planner to decide what each scientist agent will study, and it does this on its own. “It’s kind of the magic of the system,” he says.\n\nHeaps of hypotheses\n\nThe research team experimented with using two LLMs to power AstroAgents — Claude Sonnet 3.5 and Gemini 2.0 Flash. They fed each system mass-spectrometry data for eight meteorites and ten soil samples taken from locations around Earth, including Antarctica and the Atacama Desert in Chile, and carried out ten rounds of refinement.\n\nAstrobiology: Hunting aliens",

          "abstract": "The sugar in a lollipop activates a receptor in the tongue. Its 3D structure has now been revealed.Credit: Iparraguirre Recio/Getty\n\nSugar has long seduced the human palate — and wreaked havoc on public health. Now, researchers have taken a decisive step towards understanding how.\n\nA team at Columbia University in New York City has, for the first time, mapped the molecular structure of the human sweet taste receptor and shown how two of the most widely consumed artificial sweeteners bind to the receptor and activate it. The discovery, reported today in Cell1, offers a detailed look at how our tongues perceive sweetness, and could pave the way for more health-conscious fizzy drinks, chewing gums and other confections.\n\n“This single receptor is responsible for our insatiable, never-ending attraction to sugar,” says Columbia neuroscientist Charles Zuker, who led the study. “And now that we have this structure, perhaps we can find ways to modulate its function.” For example, compounds that target the receptor could alter how natural sugars are sensed by taste buds on the tongue.\n\nA spoonful of structure\n\nFrom ripe fruit to saccharine-laden yogurt, foods containing either sugars or their substitutes turn on the sweet taste receptor, triggering a signalling cascade that the brain regards as a sign of energy-rich rewards.\n\nZuker and his colleagues first identified2 the receptor in 2001, showing that it is a molecular complex made of two proteins, TAS1R2 and TAS1R3. One latches on to the sweet molecule, and the other provides structural support.\n\nA spoonful of sugar could be the medicine\n\nYet, despite more than 20 years of study, the sweet receptor’s precise architecture remained elusive, even as scientists deciphered the structures of other taste receptors, such as the one for bitterness.\n\nNow Zuker’s team has finally cracked the structure. The researchers stabilized the fragile protein complex in its active conformation, a crucial prerequisite step for high-resolution imaging. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they then captured atomic-level snapshots of the receptor bound to two synthetic sweeteners: sucralose (sold commercially as Splenda) and aspartame (found in NutraSweet). Both bind more tightly to the receptor than natural sugar does, helping to fix the receptor in place for the authors’ structural analysis.\n\nSweet spot\n\nThe images revealed that the TAS1R2 subunit has a pocket that either sucralose or aspartame can occupy. Each binds to it slightly differently, however, hinting at a flexible mechanism that allows the receptor to recognize a wide range of sweet-tasting compounds. The TAS1R3 subunit, meanwhile — although not involved in binding of the sweet molecules — has a crucial supporting role by helping to assemble and stabilize the receptor complex.\n\nCommon sweetener suppresses mouse immune system — in high doses\n\n“This really begins to clarify just how this receptor works,” says Kyle Palmer, a pharmacologist who co-founded and leads scientific operations at Opertech Bio, a taste-assessment company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",

No one knows.” I reached forward to acknowledge the incoming call from the Hai Hu.\n\nThe screen lit up, and Commander Ndiaye appeared. “Mr Chairman,” she said, her weathered face filling the display. “The Hai Hu’s HD telescope picked up this.” The image flickered, revealing an endless, off-white surface marked with regular patterns. “We don’t know what it is,” she continued, “but it’s definitely artificial.” You could see unnatural lines and angles etched on it and symbols that had to be some language.\n\nThe camera panned. “The scale is… beyond anything we imagined. The ship’s a half-sphere, 120,000 kilometres wide.”\n\nCamilla gasped. “Did she say —?”\n\n“Bigger than Earth,” I murmured. Jupiter itself was only 140,000 kilometres. What did beings capable of building that want with us? It could probably destroy Earth easier than I could kick over an anthill.\n\nThe report droned on, but I wasn’t listening. The future preoccupied me. Would history remember me as the leader who handled first contact — or the fool who got us all killed?\n\n*****\n\nDays passed with no change. Leviathan, as the press called it, loomed closer to Jupiter, silent and indifferent. The thing ignored our communications from Earth and the Moon’s distributed antenna array. My orders to the Hai Hu were to avoid beaming anything at it lest it be misinterpreted.\n\nIn the situation room, we watched Leviathan’s rendezvous with the gas giant. Ndiaye’s video streamed live, albeit with a 40-minute delay. “Mr Chairman,” she said, her voice tense, “this thing is massive. We can’t see its edges.”\n\nSomeone shouted behind her, and the screen switched views. Jupiter’s clouds were moving — no, being sucked towards Leviathan. The alabaster flat surface rippled as it consumed the gas like a pond drinking rain.\n\n“We think it’s refuelling,” Ndiaye said. “But the volume is … staggering. Helm, back us away. Maximum acceleration.”\n\nNo one in the situation room spoke, but for the first time in my life, I understood why they say you can smell fear. We were all staring at the screen like figures in a wax museum. Glancing back at the science adviser, I said, “Are we in danger?”",

          "authors": "Yuxin Zhao",
          "abstract": "China’s efforts to redefine how scientific merit is measured are the subject of fierce debate. At the heart is a contradiction: Chinese institutions encourage researchers to follow global scientific norms, but they measure performance against locally defined priorities. Many scientists, especially those at early career stages, find it hard to navigate this system with its conflicting incentives.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nIn March, for example, the National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) updated its journal-ranking system — which complements other standards such as impact factors and Clarivate’s Journal Citation Reports. Using article citations, its database is re-evaluated each year with a complex algorithm. Journals might move up or down the tiers. However, in 2025, some elevations of domestic titles over prominent international ones caught scholars’ attention. For example, CAS’s Chinese Physics Letters moved to tier 1, whereas the American Chemical Society’s Nano Letters (a global leading title in nanoscience) dropped to tier 2 (see go.nature.com/4atq2xx). Critics attribute such changes to opaque metrics and disciplinary reclassifications — for example, materials science can be classed as engineering or as physics.\n\nSuch assessments are well intentioned, but can have unintended consequences. For example, the CAS library states that its system, which is designed to assess journals’ scholarly impact and to inform institutional research-management strategies, should not be applied to evaluations of individual researchers. Yet evidence suggests that scholars in China choose where to publish to align with this ranking. For example, between 2015 and 2019, journals that were downgraded in the CAS list saw a 14.8% decline in articles by authors in China1. Scholars at less-prestigious institutions were more likely to do so to ensure that their career progressed than were those at more-prestigious ones.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nAnecdotally, colleagues have told me that work they published in prominent overseas journals received less attention in promotion reviews than did studies published in local ones. Some researchers refer to submissions to certain domestic journals as ‘academic tribute’ — not out of disrespect but because of frustration with the current evaluation frameworks.\n\nIf these trends continue, concerns might arise over researchers’ ability to connect globally. That might further dissuade top researchers from coming to China to pursue self-directed innovative work. For example, one 2023 study found that 89% of expatriate top-tier scholars who received offers through China’s Thousand Talents programme decided to continue their careers abroad2. Three measures could help stakeholders to realign incentives with scientific universality while respecting national contexts.",

Credit: Hariandi Hafid/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock\n\nResearchers have developed a process for refining nickel that they say could dramatically cut its carbon footprint, which is currently equivalent to the total emissions of a small country.\n\nImplementing the process on an industrial scale would present some engineering challenges, but the experiment, described in Nature on 30 April1, is a proof of principle. “What we did here is to prove that the science works,” says co-author Ubaid Manzoor, a metallurgical engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Sustainable Materials in Düsseldorf, Germany.\n\nNickel is a key ingredient in stainless steel, and its use in lithium-ion batteries is predicted to double global nickel demand by 2040. But it has one of the dirtiest production processes of any metal. “Primary production of nickel is highly carbon-intensive,” says Manzoor. On average, refining one tonne of nickel ore produces around 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide (see ‘Emissions from extraction’).\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThat carbon intensity could further increase as more nickel is extracted from laterites, a type of ore that is currently underutilized. That process can release more than 40 tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of nickel, in part because it relies on carbon-rich coke — a material usually derived from coal — to remove oxygen from the rock through chemical reduction.\n\nToxic red mud could be turned into green steel",

          "abstract": "Climate change is driving more frequent bouts of extreme weather that lead to floods and other damage.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty\n\nEvery four years, the US government is supposed to release a report on how climate change is affecting the nation, to guide communities and companies on how to address and adapt to a warming planet. But the sixth edition of the National Climate Assessment — already in the works for months — was gutted earlier this week, when US President Donald Trump’s administration dismissed hundreds of scientists helping with it.\n\n‘Totally broken’: how Trump 2.0 has paralysed work at US science agencies\n\nSome researchers aren’t giving up, however. They are wondering whether they could publish it anyway, through independent channels. One of their inspirations is the National Nature Assessment, a report that Trump cancelled on his first day back in office. Last month, researchers involved with that report announced a campaign to publish it outside the governmental framework, using private funding. The report is meant to detail the importance of nature — ecosystems, biodiversity and more — on the US economy and on US health.\n\nBoth reports address “the condition of the planet writ large”, says Gillian Bowser, an ecologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and a lead author of the nature assessment. Efforts to revive them reflect the ways in which US researchers are trying to cope with Trump’s assault on federal science.\n\n“I volunteered for this effort, and I’m ready to continue it,” says Costa Samaras, a systems engineer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and lead author of a chapter of the climate assessment. “This is important work for the country,” adds Samaras, who worked on US energy policy under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nUp-to-date knowledge\n\nBoth projects were coordinated by the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a network of 15 federal agencies that deal with environmental issues across the US government. The reports were meant to be comprehensive syntheses of the most up-to-date scientific knowledge in the fields of climate science and ecology.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nThe first National Climate Assessment was published in 2000; since then, this report, mandated by the US Congress, has come out fairly regularly. It is “the de facto understanding of what climate change means for the country”, says Nícola Ulibarrí, an environmental policy specialist at the University of California, Irvine, who contributed to the fifth edition and was slated to contribute to the sixth.\n\nTrump has called climate change a “hoax”, but during his first term as president, he approved the 2018 release of the fourth climate assessment. His team also began the process of setting up the fifth assessment, although the president’s controversial pick to lead the USGCRP — a climate-change denier — was later replaced. By contrast, Trump’s current administration moved swiftly to gut the sixth report, dubbed the NCA6.\n\nIn early April, the president’s team terminated contracts with the company that provided internal staff members to coordinate the report’s production. This week, administration officials dismissed nearly 400 university and other external scientists who were working on it. Nature asked the White House the reason for the terminations, and received the same line that appeared in the scientists’ dismissal e-mail: “At this time, the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated in accordance with the Global Change Research Act of 1990.”",

          "abstract": "US President Donald Trump has proposed stiff cuts to the budgets of US science agencies for 2026.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 calls for unprecedented cuts to scientific agencies that, if enacted, would deal a devastating blow to US science, policy specialists say.\n\nOn 2 May, the White House released a budget document for the upcoming fiscal year, which starts on 1 October. The proposal is a ‘skinny budget’ that is light on details, but calls for disproportionately large cuts to federal science funding. According to the White House document, the proposal would cut all non-defence spending by 23%, but it targets the US National Science Foundation (NSF) for a 56% funding reduction, and would slash the budget of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) by roughly 40%. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be hit by a 55% cut as the administration seeks to eliminate what it calls “radical” and “woke” climate programmes. On the day the budget was released, the EPA announced plans to dismantle its primary research division.\n\nExclusive: NSF stops awarding new grants and funding existing ones\n\nLater this month, the presidential administration is expected to release a more detailed budget. Observers warn that Trump might still seek cuts to money already allocated by Congress for fiscal year 2025.\n\nUltimately, it is the US Congress that decides how the federal budget will be spent — not the president. But Trump’s proposal is a starting point for congressional negotiations, and there are signs that many members of Congress will go along with Trump’s recommendations.\n\nIn a statement, US representative Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said that the budget “lays the foundation for restoring a government that serves the people — not itself”.\n\nScience-policy researchers say the budget could be disastrous for the next generation of scientists. “The message that this sends to young scientists is that this country is not a place for you,” says Michael Lubell, a physicist who tracks science policy at the City University of New York in New York City. “If I were starting my career, I would be out of here in a heartbeat.”\n\nIf Congress were to enact this budget, “the consequences for the future of our nation will be catastrophic”, said Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the non-profit American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC, in a statement.\n\nIn another statement, Victoria LaCivita, the spokesperson for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, responded: “The administration is re-focusing investments in the priority areas that America must continue to lead in, securing our standing as a global tech leader and ending woke science spending.” Among the priority areas, she said, are artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear energy.\n\nNature’s news team breaks down the budget proposal and implications for science.\n\nNational Science Foundation\n\nUnder Trump’s proposal, the 2026 budget of the NSF, one of the world’s leading funders of basic research, would drop by roughly US$5 billion, a cut of about half compared to its 2024 budget. The cuts target climate science, clean energy, and “woke” social, behavioural and economic sciences. The budget would also cut $1.1 billion from “broadening participation” programmes, which aim to attract members of under-represented groups to science; that’s roughly an 80% reduction from the past few years.\n\nAlthough the funding for AI research and quantum sciences would be kept at current levels, it is unclear how well the agency itself will function: the budget calls for a $93-million cut to operations. That would mean a decrease of roughly 20% below the amount requested for fiscal year 2025. Media reports say that half of the NSF staff could lose their jobs. If the cuts go through, “I don't know how the agency functions as Congress intended it”, says Kenneth Evans, a science-policy researcher at Rice University in Houston, Texas.\n\nNational Institutes of Health\n\nThe administration has proposed slashing the budget of the NIH from about $48 billion in 2025 to roughly $27 billion in 2026 — a cut of some 40%. If enacted, this would be the most drastic cut ever for the NIH, which is the world’s largest funder of biomedical research.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is slashing NIH-backed research — in charts\n\nThe request also proposes to collapse many of the agency’s 27 institutes and centres into 5 new ‘focus areas’. Funding for institutes that focus on health in minority groups and on international research would be eliminated entirely.\n\nThese cuts would “absolutely devastate the biomedical research enterprise” and the US economy, which is dependent on that enterprise, says Carole LaBonne, a stem-cell biologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “It’s incredibly short-sighted.”\n\nThe Trump team justifies these massive cuts by repeating its previous criticisms of the agency: “NIH has broken the trust of the American people with wasteful spending, misleading information, risky research, and the promotion of dangerous ideologies that undermine public health,” the budget document says.\n\nFormer NIH director Monica Bertagnolli, who was appointed by then-president Joe Biden, a Democrat, was appalled to see the administration’s rhetoric. “Each one of these statements has been litigated in the past and found to be grossly inaccurate or false,” she says. “This is a very unfortunate and distorted view of an organization I know to be dedicated to improving the health of all people.”\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nThe administration seeks to cut the budget for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was roughly $9 billion in 2024, by roughly one-third and to eliminate programmes such as one aimed at preventing chronic diseases. That’s despite the stated commitment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr — who, as secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, oversees the CDC — to support such activities.\n\nNASA\n\nNASA’s budget would drop by 24.3% from its 2025 level, to $18.8 billion in 2026. That’s the largest single-year cut relative to the previous year’s funding ever proposed. The agency’s science division, including astrophysics, planetary and Earth-science research, would be slashed by nearly half. Among the projects targeted for cancellation are climate-monitoring satellites and plans to bring back rock samples from Mars using robotic spacecraft. A coalition of space-science advocates has spoken out in recent weeksagainst the proposed cuts, saying they would usher in a “dark age of space science at NASA”.\n\nHuman space-flight programmes would see dramatic changes. The proposed budget cuts funding for the International Space Station, but pours more money into lunar and Mars exploration — including $1 billion for unspecified “Mars-focused” programmes. That’s in keeping with the administration’s priority of landing astronauts on the Moon and Mars before China does. The budget proposes retiring the government’s heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket after two more flights, including one scheduled to take astronauts to the Moon in 2026.",

In a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1, scientists identified a genetic mutation that probably contributes to some people’s limited sleep needs.\n\nWhy don’t new memories overwrite old ones? Sleep science holds clues\n\nUnderstanding genetic changes in naturally short sleepers — people who sleep for three to six hours every night without negative effects — could help to develop treatments for sleep disorders, says co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n“Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed”, detoxifying themselves and repairing damage, she says. “These people, all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can.”\n\nIn the 2000s, Fu and her colleagues were approached by people who slept six hours or less each night. After analysing the genomes of a mother and daughter, the team identified a rare mutation in a gene that helps to regulate humans’ circadian rhythm, the internal clock responsible for our sleep–wake cycle. The researchers suggested that this variation contributed to the duo’s short sleep needs. That discovery prompted others with similar sleeping habits to contact the laboratory for DNA testing.\n\nThe team now knows several hundred naturally short sleepers. Fu and her colleagues have so far identified five mutations in four genes that can contribute to the trait — although different families tend to have different mutations.\n\nShort sleeper",

Only one medication for the condition has approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, and it has limited effectiveness.\n\nBefore this study, the role of the fungus, called Fusarium foetens, in the human microbiome and its interactions with metabolism were poorly understood. “We had little understanding of how this fungus evolved to colonize the intestines of healthy individuals,” says co-author Jiang Changtao, a microbiologist at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing. Previous studies have shown that gut yeast — a type of fungus — can aggravate alcoholic fatty liver disease2, but whether filamentous fungi such as F. foetens could affect liver conditions was unclear.\n\nChangtao and his colleagues cultured F. foetens from human faeces using an isolation and culturing system that they designed. They gave the fungus to mice with a type of fatty liver disease called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and found that it markedly improved MASH symptoms, such as reducing already existent liver swelling and liver scarring from the disease.\n\nUltimate cause\n\nThe researchers then investigated how the metabolisms of treated mice changed. They found that the effect was caused by slowed synthesis of fatty molecules called ceramides. Ceramides are important for interactions between the intestine and the liver but are found at elevated levels in humans and mice with MASH.\n\nThe researchers harvested molecules secreted by F. foetens from the fungal culture’s growth medium and found that the secretions alone inhibited ceramide synthesis. The team analysed the growth medium closely and found one molecule that inhibits an intestinal ceramide-synthesizing protein called CerS6.\n\nThe molecule had already been found in multiple fungal species, but its effect on MASH was unknown. Now, Changtao and his team plan to further analyse molecules produced by F. foetens to “provide a new and effective approach for the clinical treatment of MASH”.",

          "abstract": "Chief business officers wear many hats, says Filippo Mulinacci.Credit: Getty\n\nFilippo Mulinacci joined Araris Biotech in 2022 as its chief business officer. In March, the oncology company, based in Zurich, Switzerland, was acquired by Taiho Pharma, based in Tokyo, as part of a deal worth up to US$1.14 billion.\n\nMulinacci’s corporate career started after he completed a master’s degree in chemistry at the University of Turin, Italy, in 2002. He then pursued a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, followed by a master’s in business administration (MBA) at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.\n\nHe recounts his role in helping to broker the Araris Biotech–Taiho Pharma deal, his corporate career path so far and the skills he has picked up along the way.\n\nTell us about your corporate career path, and why you chose it.\n\nMy first job after graduating with my MSc was as a research associate at the biotechnology company Serono, based first in Ivrea, close to Turin, Italy, and later in Geneva. Going straight into a biotech company, rather than continuing my studies, was a great career move and learning opportunity. The role expanded my scientific knowledge, enabling me to diversify from my original academic discipline of chemistry.\n\nAfter three years, I quit to pursue a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Geneva, turning my focus to proteins and protein formulation.\n\nImmediately after that, I earned an MBA at the University of St. Gallen. I felt I lacked experience in the strategic and corporate side of the pharma industry. My class was a mixture of people with engineering and economics backgrounds; there were very few science graduates.\n\nFor me, the key takeaways were gaining an understanding of business strategy, marketing, frameworks and finance, including accounting, corporate finance and valuation.\n\nAfter many years in the laboratory, Filippo Mulinacci pivoted to a role in the biopharmaceutical industry.Credit: Filippo Mulinacci\n\nI joined Roche, based in Basel, Switzerland, as a global business-development and licensing associate right after finishing my MBA in 2011. Licensing, in the context of the biopharma industry, is when one party acquires the rights to a product or technology, often from the inventor, to develop, manufacture or market that product or technology.\n\nIt was a great entry-level position: I scouted for new partnering opportunities to expand the pipeline, or the drug candidates that a company has under development. I enjoyed working across several fields of therapies, and I developed experience in two that I am truly passionate about: biologics and oncology (cancer has affected members of my family).\n\nAfter two years, I started gaining experience on the transactions side, facilitating deals between big pharma and smaller companies. In this role, you need legal knowledge as well as soft skills, such as negotiation and networking, alongside your scientific knowledge. I learnt these skills on the job, thanks to extensive experience working with senior colleagues with mixed backgrounds, ranging from law to intellectual property (IP) to finance.\n\nAfter five years, I wanted a role at a smaller company — on the other side of the table, in other words.\n\nI joined Philogen in 2016 as its head of business development and licensing, based in Zurich.\n\nThat role enabled me to develop my deal-making skills in both the chemistry and the biologics fields, from the side of the licensor, or the ‘seller side’. Philogen is an ETH Zurich biotech spin-off firm with a proprietary chemistry platform — a technology that enables the discovery of new chemically synthesized drugs — and biologic products in the field of immuno-inflammation.\n\nGood deal-makers possess both technical skills and industry knowledge and can put themselves in the shoes of the other negotiating parties. I learnt these skills on the job, and I also attended external courses, including one at the Program on Negotiation at the Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWhat does a head of business development and licensing do?\n\nA key part of the role involves scouting, search and evaluation, and networking: seeking out new products or assets, and evaluating their commercial and clinical potential.\n\nBecause Philogen was not focused on a single therapy area, platform or asset, this introduced complexities into the deal structure with regard to licensed rights, but also made the job more interesting.\n\nStructuring a deal requires an evaluation of the current and future value of the asset or platform for licensing to a potential partner.\n\nIn 2018, I joined Basilea Pharma, a Roche spin-off company based in Basel, as its oncology business development and licensing manager. I spent four years there before joining Araris Biotech as its chief business officer (CBO).\n\nWhat does a biotech CBO do?\n\nYou wear many hats. The first is to represent the company to the pharma industry. Most biotech firms developing new products need to attract external investors, and they also usually need big pharma support for phase III studies and to commercialize a new drug. In my role, I talk to potential partners and lead transactions with pharma companies. I address mainly the financial and legal aspects of the deals.\n\nAlso, most biotech companies have a data room. This is typically a virtual space for storing confidential data, and a CBO’s day-to-day activities include keeping all key financial and legal documentation held there updated, alongside presentations for investors and clinical and non-clinical data.\n\nIt is essential to maintain this type of documentation, especially when preparing to reach out to new investors. The role also entails general housekeeping of company documentation, so the firm can be ready to make a deal whenever an opportunity arises.\n\nThe CBO role also focuses on partnerships. The chief financial officer, by contrast, deals with investors, supporting the work of the chief executive.\n\nBut when needed, I do help out with, for example, due-diligence queries. In this context, that includes analysing IP and legal contracts or human-resources, tax or finance information related to a merger or acquisition.\n\nDo you miss anything about a more laboratory-based role in science?\n\nI don’t miss the bench work. I have learnt much more about applied science in the commercial field. Lab work is very focused on one project, whereas in licensing roles, you get a helicopter view of new technologies and therapies, and you can learn about the new frontiers of science.\n\nWhat is your advice to early-career researchers seeking a licensing role?\n\nA very common skill among the network of people I work with, whatever their background, is being able to put themselves in the shoes of the party they are negotiating with.",

They found that the enzyme can break down a plastic that is commonly used in health care because of its biodegradable properties, called polycaprolactone (PCL).\n\nUntil now, the only enzymes shown to break down plastics were found in environmental bacteria, says study co-author Ronan McCarthy, who researches bacteria and bacterial infections at Brunel University in London. He says that finding the same ability in pathogens often present in hospitals could explain why these microbes persist in these environments. “If a pathogen can degrade plastic, then it could compromise plastic-containing medical devices such as sutures, implants, stents or wound dressings, which would obviously negatively impact patient prognosis,” he adds.\n\nEnzyme expression\n\nAs part of their study, McCarthy and his colleagues inserted the gene that codes for the enzyme into Escherichia coli bacteria. When they made the bacteria express the enzyme, they found that it broke down the PCL in agar or beads. The strain of P. aeruginosa taken from the wound was also able to digest PCL agar and beads. And when the researchers created a mutant where the gene that coded for the Pap1 enzyme was deleted from the P. aeruginosa, the bacterium was unable to degrade the plastic.\n\nThe team also found that the enzyme increased the amount of biofilm formed when P. aeruginosa was exposed to the plastic as compared with glass beads. When bacteria produce high levels of biofilm, antibiotic resistance can increase, leading to difficult-to-treat infections. The team also conducted experiments in greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larvae and found that the bacterium was more harmful when a PCL implant was present, compared to when the implant was absent. Additionally, moths infected with bacteria lacking the enzyme had similar survival rates regardless of whether a PCL implant was present or not.",

          "abstract": "Although it might seem counter-intuitive, writing the middle and end of your thesis first can make the process easier, says Tuuli Toivonen.Credit: Oscar Wong/Getty\n\nPhD theses usually come in two forms. Standard monographs, a comprehensive dissertation written by a single author, continue to be used, but theses based on collections of published articles are becoming the norm in the natural sciences.\n\nFor monograph-style theses, the research process is relatively straightforward: you might first read extensively, then narrow down your ideas to what is relevant and interesting, formulate a focused research question or hypothesis based on the literature and then proceed with data collection, analysis and, finally, writing the dissertation.\n\nArticle-based theses consist of works published in scientific journals, written by a student during the course of their PhD training, alongside an introductory chapter that ties the articles together. The path to these theses might be winding, because each article has its own narrative, influenced by the journal and the co-authors. The introductory chapter, or synopsis, synthesizes the individual articles and presents a broader narrative tying the literature into the findings of the thesis. In simple terms, the synopsis aims to describe how the author’s contributions advance science. In some ways, it might be best thought of as a literature review fused with new results obtained over the course of a PhD.\n\nIn my own field, quantitative geography, article-based theses are most common. At the University of Helsinki, where I teach, a PhD student typically finalizes three or four first-author articles, at least half of which are accepted or published.\n\nCareers collection: Funding science\n\nMaking your claim\n\nHow, then, can a high-quality synopsis be written efficiently? This is where my approach might be useful.\n\nIn Finnish, a PhD defence is called väitös, which directly translates to ‘claim’ or ‘argument’. My early supervisor, the late geomorphologist Matti Seppälä, was known for his intelligence as well as his laser-sharp stare. He often asked students approaching their defence an intimidating question: “So, what’s your claim?”, referring to the single, clarified, fundamental message that a reader should take from those years of gruelling PhD work.\n\nWhen I was struggling to write my own synopsis in 2006, this question lingered in my mind. Ultimately, thinking about how to answer it helped me to shape my synopsis and guided me through the overall process. Since then, I have supervised a dozen students writing article-based PhD theses, and have often encouraged them answer Seppälä’s question to guide their thinking and writing when it’s time to wrap up their theses.\n\nI’ve found that the approach helps the student to identify the most important content and gain the broader perspective needed for the synopsis. On the basis of comments by the pre-examiners and reviewers, the students create a clear, logical and easy-to-read structure.\n\nThe approach might even help natural scientists who are writing a research paper. Focusing on key takeaways in the discussion, then writing the remainder of the paper from that point, is an effective way to write any paper.\n\nA recipe for a clear synopsis",

          "abstract": "Whether it’s developing artificial-intelligence tools, clean technologies or medical treatments, governments around the world are seeking to leverage their research institutions and workforces to compete strategically with other nations.\n\nThe strategy behind one of the most successful labs in the world\n\nThrough our decades of leadership in research and development (R&D) in corporate settings, national laboratories and research universities, we’ve seen at first hand how one crucial acknowledgement — recognizing non-conventional career paths or roles — strengthens workforces1. Yet, too often, one group remains overlooked: skilled technical staff. The technicians who devise the instruments, techniques and materials that go hand in hand with scientific discoveries are often the unsung heroes of research. Numerous studies2–4 and historical cases5–7 in leading labs show how close collaborations between researchers with PhDs and technicians often lie behind major breakthroughs.\n\nToday’s trailblazing research increasingly relies on technological advances, such as gene editing, high-performance computing or nanofabrication, creating a growing demand for technicians with specialized training, practical experience and the ingenuity to solve problems with complex instruments, equipment and software. In many areas, however, this demand exceeds supply. In the semiconductor industry, for example, only about 1,000 technicians enter the field in the United States each year8 — too few to supply the predicted 75,000 extra technicians needed for all manufacturing and research operations between 2024 and 2029 (see ‘Don’t take technicians for granted’).\n\nSource: Ref.8\n\nThe boundaries between science and technology are increasingly blurring, and so, too, should those between doctoral-level researchers and technicians in research institutions. We urge leaders of institutions to remove conventional occupational boundaries between these groups. To achieve excellence, leaders should take three steps.\n\nLearn from successful labs\n\nInnovative research labs around the world have long orchestrated team-management synergies between doctoral-level researchers and technicians. We urge leaders to foster cultures — the shared values, assumptions, beliefs, norms and expectations that impact how their members think, behave and perform9 — that cultivate a sense of belonging in which all individuals, including technicians, are valued.\n\nExamples of such institutes include: Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Virginia2,3; the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK5; the original incarnation of Bell Labs2,3,6,7 in Murray Hill, New Jersey; and US National Science Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers4,10,11 — a network of research hubs across US universities that work in partnership with industries.\n\nTechnicians at Janelia Research Campus are integral to the research process.Credit: HHMI Janelia Research Campus\n\nJanelia, founded in 2006 by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, fosters close collaborations between life scientists, physicists, engineers and technicians. When it comes to recruitment, practical research experience can substitute for academic degrees, according to chemist Luke Lavis, who leads the molecular tools and imaging group at Janelia. For example, engineer Dan Flickinger “doesn’t have a PhD but is the brains behind many of the microscopes developed at Janelia. He is an expert optical engineer who simply makes things work”, Lavis told us.\n\nLeaders can learn from Janelia’s approach, which includes a strategic focus on projects that require patience and sustainable financial resources, encouraging commitment by personnel to be physically present at Janelia at least 75% of the time, and prioritizing collaborations between researchers and technicians for tool building. One example of its success involved major developments in protein biosensors, which required technicians who could carry out painstaking work over long periods, and support through deep financial resources2.\n\nWant to speed up scientific progress? First understand how science policy works\n\nCambridge’s Laboratory of Molecular Biology has an exemplary history of facilitating a feedback loop between scientists and technicians. Principal investigators act as interpreters to translate scientific terms into technical engineering requirements to develop research instruments5. Cryo-electron microscopy, for example, a technique to create 3D images of biological molecules, was developed by integrating software and advanced cooling techniques. Rather than being supervised by one individual, this work was carried out by a self-organized multidisciplinary team of scientists and technicians who collaborated in iterative steps and adjustments.",

They are also more likely to be dissatisfied with aspects of the experience, such as their number of online friends, a survey of 3,340 adolescents in the United Kingdom has revealed.\n\nThe study, published today in Nature Human Behaviour1, explores how teenagers with specific mental-health conditions use social media, finding that participants with disorders such as anxiety and depression are more vulnerable to negative online experiences than are those with conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). “That is a question that very few studies have addressed, especially on such a large sample,” says study co-author Luisa Fassi, a specialist in young people’s mental health and social-media use at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe results are “a good warning to families that if your youth is vulnerable because of anxiety, a tendency to have depression or be low in mood, then social media is something that really needs to be carefully monitored”, says Anne Marie Albano, a clinical child and adolescent psychologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.\n\nOnline behaviour\n\nThe researchers analysed data from a 2017 survey of 11- to 19-year-olds conducted by the UK National Health Service (NHS). Participants underwent an in-depth clinical assessment and were asked about their use of social-media sites and how they feel about them. Sixteen per cent of respondents had at least one mental-health condition. Of those, 8% had ‘internalizing’ conditions, such as depression and anxiety — characterized by negative emotions towards the self — and 3% had externalizing conditions, such as ADHD, characterized by negative emotions towards others.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nThe analysis found that young people with mental-health conditions spent more time on social media overall, and those with internalizing conditions were more likely to compare themselves with others online than were those with externalizing conditions or no mental-health condition. Those with internalizing conditions were also more affected by comments or reactions to their posts and had less control over how much time they spent on platforms.",

          "abstract": "Thomas Crowther made a name for himself after publishing a paper that suggested Earth had eight times more trees than expected.Credit: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Bloomberg Philanthropies\n\nA university investigation into Thomas Crowther, a prominent tree researcher who ran a large laboratory at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), reveals that he blurred personal and professional relationships in his lab and breached internal rules on financial and hiring compliance. But it clears him of misusing grant funds.\n\nHowever, some members of Crowther’s laboratory have accused ETH Zurich of a flawed and biased investigation, in a letter sent to the university on 28 April and seen by Nature, and they call for an independent review into the university’s handling of the case. The investigation led ETH Zurich to decide that it would not renew Crowther’s contract — a tenure-track professorship — and his lab, which previously employed 40–60 people, is being dismantled.\n\nETH Zurich published a redacted version of the report on 25 April. It finds that Crowther “repeatedly failed to follow internal rules and adequately address conflicts of interest”, but it does not provide evidence of any misuse of funds, according to Stefan Spiegel, the university’s vice-president of finance and controlling at the institution.\n\nCrowther, who is on administrative leave until his contract expires in September, denies many of the allegations investigated in the report, but admits he made mistakes. “I am deeply sorry if this caused any discomfort for anyone,” Crowther said in a statement to Nature. He never engaged “any form of inappropriate advances”, he adds.\n\nThe university confirmed to Nature that it had received the lab members’ letter. “From ETH Zurich’s perspective, the case is considered closed” with the publication of the report, it said in a statement. “The President of ETH Zurich had already concluded in December 2024 that the basis of trust required for a permanent position was not given in this case.”\n\nRising star\n\nCrowther rose to prominence after publishing a Nature paper1 in 2015 that suggested that Earth had eight times more trees than expected. His work garnered interest from influential people, including US President Donald Trump, and inspired a high-profile tree-conservation initiative by the World Economic Forum.\n\nCrowther has been at ETH Zurich since 2017, but in late 2024, Swiss media reported that several people had made allegations against him to the university.\n\nThe report into these allegations, investigated in 2024 and 2025 by a law firm appointed by ETH Zurich, reveals that among the documents examined were five individuals’ written statements and a whistle-blowing report on possible compliance issues.\n\nThe investigation says that Crowther treated “his employees in the same way as friends”. Although most employees appreciated his behaviour, the report says, others thought it was inappropriate and said he crossed personal boundaries. Examples of this reported behaviour included late-night WhatsApp messages inviting employees to parties. Some described a “toxic management culture”.\n\nIn a statement to Nature, Crowther admits that he blurred the lines between friendships and professional relationships, and treated employees as close friends. “I am devastated that it did not work for some. I will always strive to improve,” he says.\n\nFinancial matters\n\nFor some of the more serious allegations, such as that Crowther kissed a former lab intern and invited a student to his apartment after dinner, the institution said it received information during the investigation that contradicts the accusers’ versions of events.\n\nCrowther added: “I would never ever initiate any form of intimate interaction with a student. I am grateful that the ETH investigation uncovered clear evidence to contradict these accusations.”\n\nOn financial and legal matters, the probe investigated several allegations, including that lab members worked for other organizations during their contracted hours and that the lab misused consultancy contracts.\n\nThe report finds that in certain cases, such as spending on crisis communications, legal advice and marketing, and the use of consultancy contacts, the rules were not always followed. In the report, Crowther acknowledged a “few minor oversights” relating to spending on crisis communication and legal advice, but denies that consultancy contracts were misused.\n\nCrowther says that his lab was huge, with “countless contracts and collaborations”. “I know that I will have made some accidental errors. But I can guarantee that no lab members worked for other organizations during their employment at ETH,” he adds.\n\nOverall, the report concludes that Crowther conducted his research to a high level, but “failed to live up to the responsibility expected of him”.",

          "abstract": "Protein molecules (artist’s illustration) fold into their final shapes. Newly developed editors can swap bits of a protein for other molecules and amino acids.Credit: Ruslanas Baranauskas/Science Photo Library\n\nA powerful technique that directly edits proteins in living cells promises to help researchers to study proteins in improved ways.\n\nThe technique relies on strings of amino acids called inteins, which can autonomously cut themselves out of proteins. Scientists have now harnessed inteins to splice chemical groups, unusual amino acids and even polymers into target proteins, and can observe how such additions affect a protein’s function and cellular location.\n\nThe method was described in a pair of papers in Science, one published today1 and one in April2.\n\nThe technique is “a very nice addition to the toolbox”, says Mikko Taipale, a molecular geneticist at the University of Toronto in Canada, who was not involved in either study. Just as DNA-editing CRISPR systems have transformed the ability to manipulate genes, intein editors will provide a better way to investigate the form, function and localization of proteins, says Taipale.\n\nBut whereas CRISPR is ready for use in living cells, laboratory animals and humans, current protein editors require finicky customization and can be used only in cells. The tools are “good for very specific questions”, says Taipale.\n\nIntein intel\n\nInteins were discovered in 1990 in baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and thousands of these elements have since been identified in other single-celled organisms. “We call them Houdini proteins, because they escape from the bondage of the proteins they’re embedded in,” says Tom Muir, a chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey and a co-author of the Science paper published in April. Although inteins’ biological role remains unclear, for the most part, researchers have long been trying to repurpose inteins as protein editors.\n\nAI tools are designing entirely new proteins that could transform medicine\n\nProgress has been slow: inteins can be hard to work with and are inefficient editors. But Muir’s group designed new inteins that perform better than previously available ones. The paper published today, by George Burslem at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his colleagues, describes intein systems that are easier to produce and use in live cells.\n\nThe editors, called protein transposons by Muir’s team, require some groundwork. Researchers first have to reprogram the DNA code for the protein of interest. This step adds instructions to encode an ‘acceptor site’ where the edit will be made. The site includes two intein elements at either end.\n\nThe researchers then prepare a ‘donor’ protein carrying the desired cargo to be spliced into the target protein. The cargo is bracketed by two more intein elements. When the target protein and the donor align, the split inteins pair up and self-eject from the target protein, taking the rest of the acceptor site with them. The cargo slots itself into the gap.\n\nThe process is “cut and paste”, says Burslem.\n\nQuick work\n\nBurslem’s team used the editors to make changes in five different proteins in live cells. The protein editors needed less than ten minutes to do their work, Burslem says. Muir’s team used a different set of editors to tweak three proteins.\n\n“Between the two papers, there’s quite a breadth of different types of proteins that this has been applied to,” says Muir.\n\nThese editors provide a powerful new tool for cell-biology experiments, he adds. The tools can be used to add markers to proteins, giving scientists a fresh way to track proteins’ actions and movements. And the editors can paste in stretches of amino acids that will redefine where a protein goes in the cell, give it a new function or force it to interact with another protein of interest.",

In this Registered Report, we analyse nationally representative UK data ( N = 3,340, aged 11–19 years) including diagnostic assessments by clinical raters alongside quantitative and qualitative social media measures. As hypothesized, adolescents with mental health conditions reported spending more time on social media and were less happy about the number of online friends than adolescents without conditions. We also found hypothesized differences in social media use by condition type: adolescents with internalizing conditions reported spending more time on social media, engaging in more social comparison and experiencing greater impact of feedback on mood, alongside lower happiness about the number of online friends and lower honest self-disclosure. In contrast, those with externalizing conditions only reported higher time spent. These findings emphasize the need to consider diverse adolescent mental health profiles in policy and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Contemporary approaches examining the determinants of happiness have posited that happiness is determined bidirectionally by both top-down, global life satisfaction and bottom-up, domain satisfaction processes. We propose a personalized happiness perspective, suggesting that the determinants and consequences of happiness are idiographic (that is, specific) to each individual rather than assumed to be the same for all. We showed the utility of a personalized happiness approach by testing associations between life and domain satisfaction at both the population and personalized levels using nationally representative data of 40,074 German, British, Swiss, Dutch and Australian participants tracked for up to 33 years. The majority of participants (41.4–50.8%) showed primarily unidirectional associations between domain satisfactions and life satisfaction, and only 19.3–25.9% of participants showed primarily bidirectional associations. Moreover, the population models differed from personalized models, suggesting that aggregated, population-level research fails to capture individual differences in personalized happiness, showing the importance of a personalized happiness approach. Patterns of individual differences are robust, yet distinguishing between individual-level patterns and random error is challenging, highlighting the need for future work and innovative approaches to study personalized happiness.",

Our results show that LLMs perform particularly well at self-interested games such as the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma family. However, they behave suboptimally in games that require coordination, such as the Battle of the Sexes. We verify that these behavioural signatures are stable across robustness checks. We also show how GPT-4’s behaviour can be modulated by providing additional information about its opponent and by using a ‘social chain-of-thought’ strategy. This also leads to better scores and more successful coordination when interacting with human players. These results enrich our understanding of LLMs’ social behaviour and pave the way for a behavioural game theory for machines.",

          "abstract": "Research from high-income countries has found negative outcomes associated with physical punishment. Yet, the extent to which such research evidence generalizes to children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is largely unknown. The objective of the current pre-registered study (PROSPERO: CRD42022347346) was to conduct a meta-analysis of the associations between childhood physical punishment and individual outcomes in LMICs. We identified eligible articles by searching for keywords related to physical punishment in six languages across 11 databases, with search periods from April to August 2021 and June to July 2024. This process yielded 5,072 unique records, of which 189 studies, comprising 1,490 unique effect sizes and representing 92 LMICs, met our inclusion criteria. Findings from random-effects multilevel meta-analyses indicated that physical punishment was associated with detrimental outcomes, including mental health problems, worse parent–child relationships, substance use, impaired social–emotional development, negative academic outcomes and heightened externalizing behaviour problems, among others. Despite some variation by contextual and study-level characteristics, all subgroup estimates were consistent in direction. Sensitivity checks indicated that these findings were not typical of other non-violent methods of discipline but were specific to physical punishment and psychological aggression. The analysis confirmed that physical punishment is associated with detrimental outcomes for individuals in LMICs. Additional research is needed to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies and interventions to prevent the physical punishment of children and adolescents worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Global efforts to mitigate climate change are increasing pressure on heavy manufacturing industries to decarbonize production. The iron and steel industry is responsible for 7% of CO 2 emissions globally (2% in the United States) and is often a major employer in the regions where iron and steel is produced. Understanding the future prospects for workers in regions with high CO 2 emitting industries—including impacts of phasing out or evolving such industries—will be critical for informing regional economic and clean energy strategies. We simulate the impact of an “in-place” transition that replaces today’s integrated production with direct reduced iron (DRI) used in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), using Southwest Pennsylvania as an application of our generalizable approach. Our results suggest that the integrated steelmaking workforce today has the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) to fill over 95% of all jobs required by DRI/EAF facilities, but the number of jobs is only 25% of those at integrated plants. We also find that some occupational groups have greater general transferability into the broader job market, while other groups, such as production workers, are ill-equipped today based on current SKAs to transition out of the iron and steel industry. Our methodology further suggests factors that limit transitions: Around 85% of occupations are more limited by missing skills, while 15% are more limited by insufficient wages. These results may help to improve the design of social policy and the targeting of retraining programs, while the simulation approach can be readily adapted for other regions and industries.",

To address the detrimental effects of social isolation, we build on cutting-edge research on social touch and movement sonification to investigate whether social tactile gestures could be recognized through sounds, a sensory channel giving access to remote information. Four online experiments investigated participants’ perception of auditory stimuli that were recorded with our “audio-touch” sonification technique, which captures the sounds of touch. In the first experiment, participants correctly categorized sonified skin-on-skin tactile gestures (i.e., stroking, rubbing, tapping, hitting). In the second experiment, the audio-touch sample consisted of the sonification of six socio-emotional intentions conveyed through touch (i.e., anger, attention, fear, joy, love, sympathy). Participants categorized above chance the socio-emotional intentions of skin-on-skin touches converted into sounds and coherently rated their valence. In two additional experiments, the surface involved in the touches (either skin or plastic) was shown to influence participants’ recognition of sonified gestures and socio-emotional intentions. Thus, our research unveils that specific information about social touch (i.e., gesture, emotions, and surface) can be recognized through sounds, when they are obtained with our specific sonifying methodology. This shows significant promise for providing remote access, through the auditory channel, to meaningful social touch interactions.",

Given that both the state rulers and civil society groups can use AI/ICT, the key that determines which side would benefit more from the advancement of these technologies hinges upon “technology complementarity.” In general, AI/ICT would be more complementary to the government rulers because they are more likely than civil society groups to access various administrative big data. Empirically, we propose three hypotheses and use statistical tests to verify our argument. Theoretically, we prove a proposition, showing that when the above-mentioned complementarity assumption is true, the AI/ICT advancements would enable rulers in authoritarian and fragile democratic countries to achieve better control over civil society forces, which leads to the erosion of democracy. Our analysis explains the recent ominous development in some fragile-democracy countries.",

          "abstract": "Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver’s personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people’s attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization.",

          "abstract": "Autocatalysis is seen as a potential key player in the origin of life, and perhaps more generally in the emergence of Darwinian dynamics. Building on recent formalizations of this phenomenon, we tackle the computational challenge of exhaustively detecting minimal autocatalytic cycles (autocatalytic cores) in reaction networks and further evaluate the impact of thermodynamic constraints on their realization under mass action kinetics. We first characterize the complexity of the detection problem by proving its NP-completeness. This justifies the use of constraint solvers to list all cores in a given reaction network, and also to group them into compatible sets, composed of cores whose stoichiometric requirements are not contradictory. Crucially, we show that the introduction of thermodynamic realism does constrain the composition of these sets. Compatibility relationships among autocatalytic cores can indeed be disrupted when the reaction kinetics obey thermodynamic consistency throughout the network. On the contrary, these constraints have no impact on the realizability of isolated cores, unless upper or lower bounds are imposed on the concentrations of the reactants. Overall, by better characterizing the conditions of autocatalysis in complex reaction systems, this work brings us a step closer to assessing the contribution of this collective chemical behavior to the emergence of natural selection in the primordial soup.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the effects of missense mutations or single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function is crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of diseases/disorders and designing rational therapies. We introduce here Rhapsody-2 , a machine learning tool for discriminating pathogenic and neutral SAVs, significantly expanding on a precursor limited by the availability of structural data. With the advent of AlphaFold2 as a powerful tool for structure prediction, Rhapsody-2 is trained on a significantly expanded dataset of 117,525 SAVs corresponding to 12,094 human proteins reported in the ClinVar database. Adopting a broad set of descriptors composed of sequence evolutionary, structural, dynamic, and energetics features in the training algorithm, Rhapsody-2 achieved an AUROC of 0.94 in 10-fold cross-validation when all SAVs of a particular test protein (mutant) were excluded from the training set. Benchmarking against a variety of testing datasets demonstrated the high performance of Rhapsody-2 . While sequence evolutionary descriptors play a dominant role in pathogenicity prediction, those based on structural dynamics provide a mechanistic interpretation. Notably, residues involved in allosteric communication and those distinguished by pronounced fluctuations in the high-frequency modes of motion or subject to spatial constraints in soft modes usually give rise to pathogenicity when mutated. Overall, Rhapsody-2 provides an efficient and transparent tool for accurately predicting the pathogenicity of SAVs and unraveling the mechanistic basis of the observed behavior, thus advancing our understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relations.",

          "abstract": "Hawaiian lobeliads exhibit extensive adaptive radiations and are considered the largest plant clade (143 species) endemic to any oceanic archipelago. Rapid insular radiations are prone to reticulate evolution, yet detecting hybridization is often limited by inadequate sampling of taxa or independent loci. We analyzed 633 nuclear loci (including tetraploid duplications) and whole plastomes for 89% of extant species to derive phylogenies for the Hawaiian lobeliads. Nuclear data provide strong support for nine major clades in both likelihood and ASTRAL analyses. All genera/sections are monophyletic except Clermontia and Cyanea . Nuclear and plastome phylogenies conflict on short, deep branches; the nuclear tree resolves a fleshy-fruited clade of Hawaiian Clermontia/Cyanea-Brighamia/Delissea , sister to Polynesian Sclerotheca , with both sister to a capsular-fruited Hawaiian clade. Incomplete lineage sorting in a rapid radiation starting 8.5–11.3 Ma is sufficient to explain uncertainty and cytonuclear discordance along the backbone. Sequence data support reticulation within Clermontia and especially Cyanea . Nuclear data identify 42 interisland dispersal events: 89% accord with the strict progression rule, involving movement to the next younger island in the hotspot chain, consistent with theory. Plastid data overestimate such events by 17%. Cyanea and Clermontia have undergone parallel adaptive radiations in elevational distribution and flower length on all major islands, with multiple founders and some interisland differences. Hawaiian lobeliad diversification was driven by an early intergeneric divergence in habitat, followed by parallel adaptive radiation and ecological speciation within Clermontia/Cyanea , combined with widespread single-island endemism, frequent interisland dispersal, and occasional hybridization.",

          "abstract": "Membrane blebs have important roles in cell migration, apoptosis, and intercellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). While plasma membranes (PM) typically maintain phosphatidylserine (PS) on their cytoplasmic leaflet, most blebs have PS exposed on their outer leaflet, revealing that loss of steady-state lipid asymmetry often accompanies PM blebbing. How these changes in PM lipid organization regulate membrane properties and affect bleb formation remains unknown. We confirmed that lipid scrambling through the scramblase TMEM16F is essential for chemically induced membrane blebbing across cell types, with the kinetics of PS exposure being tightly coupled to the kinetics of bleb formation. Measurement of lipid packing with environment-sensitive probes revealed that lipid scrambling changes the physical properties of the PM, reducing lipid packing and facilitating the bilayer bending required for bleb formation. Accordingly, reducing lipid packing of the PM through cholesterol extraction, elevated temperature, or treatment with biological amphiphiles promoted blebbing in the absence of TMEM16F. Consistent with these cellular observations, blebbing in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos measured via EV production was significantly reduced by depleting the TMEM16-homolog ANOH-2. Our findings suggest that changing membrane biophysical properties by lipid scrambling is an important contributor to the formation of blebs and EVs and potentially other cellular processes involving PM deformation.",

          "abstract": "How central and peripheral circadian clocks regulate protein metabolism and affect tissue mass homeostasis has been unclear. Circadian shifts in the balance between anabolism and catabolism control muscle growth rate in young zebrafish independent of behavioral cycles. Here, we show that the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, which mediate muscle protein degradation, are each upregulated at night under the control of the muscle peripheral clock. Perturbation of the muscle transcriptional molecular clock disrupts nocturnal proteolysis, increases muscle growth measured over 12 h, and compromises muscle function. Mechanistically, the shifting circadian balance of Ror and Rev-erb regulates nocturnal UPS, autophagy, and muscle growth through altered TORC1 activity. Although environmental zeitgebers initially mitigate defects, lifelong muscle clock inhibition reduces muscle size and growth rate, accelerating aging-related loss of muscle mass and function. Circadian misalignment such as shift work, sleep deprivation, or dementia may thus unsettle muscle proteostasis, contributing to muscle wasting and sarcopenia.",

          "abstract": "Within Earth’s climate system, the ocean, cryosphere, and vegetation exhibit hysteresis behavior such that their state depends on their past and not merely on their current boundary conditions. The atmosphere’s fast mixing time scales were thought to inhibit the necessary memory effect for such multistability. Here, we show that moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column generates hysteresis in monsoon circulation independent of oceanic heat storage and yields two stable atmospheric states for the same solar insolation. The dynamics of monsoon rainfall is thus that of a seasonal transition between two stable states. The resulting hysteresis is shown in observational data and reproduced in a general circulation model where it increases with decreasing oceanic memory and exhibits the two distinct states that persist for more than 60 y. They are stabilized by moisture accumulation within the atmospheric column that carries information across time scales much longer than those typical for mixing. The possibility of abrupt shifts between these two states has implications for the future evolution of global monsoon rainfall that is crucial for the agricultural productivity currently feeding more than two billion people.",

However, lifetime-readout sensors are poorly understood at a molecular level, complicating their development. Although there are many sensors that have fluorescence-intensity changes, there are currently only a few with fluorescence-lifetime changes. Here, we optimized two biosensors for thiol–disulfide redox (RoTq-Off and RoTq-On) with opposite changes in fluorescence lifetime in response to oxidation. Using biophysical approaches, we showed that the high-lifetime states of these sensors lock the chromophore more firmly in place than their low-lifetime states do. Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of RoTq-On fused to a glutaredoxin (Grx1) enabled robust, straightforward monitoring of cytosolic glutathione redox state in acute mouse brain slices. The motional mechanism described here is probably common and may inform the design of other lifetime-readout sensors; the Grx1-RoTq-On fusion sensor will be useful for studying glutathione redox in physiology.",

          "abstract": "PARK7/DJ-1, a redox-sensitive protein implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, and inflammation, exhibits increased secretion under stress. We previously demonstrated that, as a leaderless protein, PARK7 relies on an unconventional autophagy pathway for stress-induced secretion. The current study delves deeper into the mechanisms governing PARK7 secretion under oxidative stress triggered by the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Here, we revealed that 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux is critical for PARK7 secretion. Downregulation of syntaxin 17 (STX17), a SNARE protein crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and cargo degradation, hindered PARK7 secretion. Likewise, impairing lysosomal function with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) or chloroquine (CQ) diminished PARK7 release, highlighting the importance of functional lysosomes, potentially in the form of secretory autolysosomes, in PARK7 release. We also found that 6-OHDA appeared to promote the unfolding of PARK7, allowing its selective recognition by the chaperone HSPA8 via KFERQ-like motifs, leading to PARK7 translocation to the lysosomal membrane through LAMP2 via chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Additionally, a dedicated SNARE complex comprising Qabc-SNAREs (STX3/4, VTI1B, and STX8) and R-SNARE SEC22B mediates the fusion of PARK7-containing autolysosomes with the plasma membrane, facilitating the extracellular release of PARK7. Hence, this study uncovers a mechanism where 6-OHDA-induced autophagic flux drives the unconventional secretion of PARK7, involving CMA for PARK7 translocation to lysosomes and specialized SNARE complexes for membrane fusion events.",

          "abstract": "Evidence across a broad range of disciplines has demonstrated how individuals’ social environments can impact their health, lifespan, reproduction, and ultimately their evolutionary fitness. Past research has primarily focused on either traits specific to individuals or wider traits of social groups, linking these with a component of fitness. In this study, we examined how both individual- and group-level social traits in 164 wild mountain gorillas combine to influence multiple pathways impacting fitness over 21 y. First, we highlight key sex differences in the costs and benefits of social bonds, with strong and stable social bonds linked with lower risk of illness in females, but higher risk of illness in males. Second, we demonstrate important trade-offs in the fitness consequences of sociality, with strong and stable bonds in males linked with decreases in injury but increases in illness. Finally, we show the extensive moderating effects of group-level traits on the fitness consequences of individual-level social traits. For example, in small groups, females with strong bonds benefitted from lower rates of illness, but also showed lower birth rates, while in large groups, females with strong bonds experienced higher rates of illness but also higher birth rates. These findings highlight the complexity of selection acting on social traits, where the fitness consequences of individual’s social phenotypes are highly context dependent. We argue that this variability in the fitness benefits of sociality has likely played a fundamental role in maintaining the wide diversity of social phenotypes observed within species.",

          "abstract": "Geological observations informed by climate dynamics imply that the oceans were 99.9% covered by light-blocking ice shelves during two discrete, self-reversing Snowball Earth epochs spanning a combined 60 to 70 Myr of the Cryogenian Period (720 to 635 Ma). The timescale for initial ice advances across the tropical oceans is ~300 y in an ice−atmosphere−ocean general circulation model in Cryogenian paleogeography. Areas of optically thin oceanic ice are usually invoked to account for fossil marine phototrophs, including macroscopic multicellular eukaryotes, before and after each Snowball, but different taxa. Ecosystem relocation is a scenario that does not require thin marine ice. Assume that long before Cryogenian Snowballs, diverse supra- and periglacial biomes were established in polar−alpine regions. When the Snowball onsets occurred, those biomes migrated in step with their ice margins to the equatorial zone of net sublimation. There, they prospered and evolved, their habitat areas expanded, and the cruelty of winter reduced. Nutrients were supplied by dust (loess) derived from cozonal ablative lands where surface winds were strong. When each Snowball finally ended, those biomes were mostly inundated by the meltwater-dominated and rapidly warming lid of a nutrient-rich but depauperate ocean. Some taxa returned to the mountaintops while others restocked the oceans. This ecosystem relocation scenario makes testable predictions. The lineages required for post-Cryogenian biotic radiations should be present in modern polar−alpine biomes. Legacies of polar−alpine ancestry should be found in the genomes of living organisms. Examples of such tests are highlighted herein.",

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease and adenine base editor (ABE) technologies in generating allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, utilizing extensive in vitro and in vivo analyses. Both methods achieved high editing efficiencies across four target genes, critical for mitigating graft-versus-host disease and allograft rejection: TRAC or CD3E , B2M , CIITA , and PVR . Notably, ABE demonstrated higher manufacturing yields and distinct off-target profiles compared to Cas9, with translocations observed exclusively in Cas9-edited products. Functionally, ABE-edited CAR T cells exhibited superior in vitro effector functions under continuous antigen stimulation, including enhanced proliferative capacity and increased surface CAR expression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ABE editing resulted in reduced activation of p53 and DNA damage response pathways at baseline, along with sustained activation of metabolic pathways during antigen stress. Consistently, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing data indicated that Cas9-edited, but not ABE-edited, CAR T cells showed enrichment of chromatin accessibility peaks associated with double-strand break repair and DNA damage response pathways. In a preclinical leukemia model, ABE-edited CAR T cells demonstrated improved tumor control and extended overall survival compared to their Cas9-edited counterparts.

Using chronic viral infection, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) was specifically required for the formation of antigen-specific T EX -int cells at the effector phase of responses. Single-cell transcriptomics validated that Hdac1 deficiency depleted T EX -int cells and revealed that Hdac1 was critical for positive regulation of T EX -int-characteristic genes, including Cx3cr1 , Cxcr6 , and Klf2 . Furthermore, profiling chromatin accessibility landscape in T EX subsets demonstrated that loss of Hdac1 resulted in a prevalent increase in chromatin open state, as evidently observed at the exhaustion program genes, which were linked to induced expression of exhaustion-inducing Tox transcription factor, PD1 and Lag3 coinhibitory receptors in T EX cells. Hdac1 thus has dual regulatory functions: promoting T EX -int cell fate and preventing excessive activation of the exhaustion program to curtail uncontrolled virus replication.",

          "abstract": "Genes and the environment jointly shape individual traits, but the influence of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), arising from the genetic composition of interacting conspecific individuals, is often ignored or underemphasized. Moreover, because of practical challenges in characterizing IGEs, empirical research has fallen behind theoretical advancement. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta offers a uniquely suitable study system due to its distinct colony-level phenotypic variation (monogyne and polygyne social forms) attributed to IGEs of a social-supergene variant ( b allele). A minority of b -carrying workers ( Bb genotype) can trigger colony-level conversion from monogyne (single queen per colony) to polygyne (multiple queens per colony) behavior. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this process via 400-ant microcolonies. We first showed that assimilated Bb workers reduce aggression by host BB workers toward Bb queens, thus inducing polygyny, at rates observed earlier in experiments that used full-size (&gt;20,000 ants) colonies. We then demonstrated that social conversion is facilitated by cuticular contact between the worker types, and verified the presence of nonvolatile cuticular pheromones that are necessary but not sufficient components underpinning this process. Follow-up experiments suggested that a second, polygyne worker-produced pheromone that is only released once such workers detect a Bb queen is also necessary but again insufficient, for full expression of the conversion phenomenon. Thus, multiple pheromonal components linked to presence of the b supergene allele in colony workers appear to be involved in shaping social environments and thereby inducing, via IGEs, the transformation from monogyne to polygyne fire ant societies.",

In walled bacteria, different modes of cell division have been reported that are notably associated with distinctive cell shapes. In all cases, division involves a step of septation, corresponding to the growth of a new dividing cell wall, followed by splitting of the two daughter cells. The radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans is a spherical bacterium protected by a thick and unusual cell envelope. It has been reported to divide using a distinctive mode of septation in which two septa originating from opposite sides of the cell progress with a flat leading edge until meeting and fusing at mid-cell. In the present study, we have combined conventional and superresolution fluorescence microscopy of live bacteria with in situ cryogenic electron tomography of bacterial lamellae to investigate the septation process in D. radiodurans . This work provides important insight into i) the complex architecture and multilayered composition of the cell envelope of this bacterium, ii) the unusual “sliding doors” septation process and iii) the sequence of events and molecular mechanisms underlying septal closure, including the synthesis of a FtsZ-dependent peptidoglycan layer that rigidifies and straightens the growing septa.",

          "abstract": "Diverse single-stranded RNA viruses employ different host cellular organelles or membrane systems to compartmentalize their replication intermediates and proviral factors, ensuring robust replication. Replication of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), an Alphaflexiviridae family, is tightly associated with chloroplasts and dynamic cytosolic viral replication complex (VRC) clusters. BaMV VRC clusters comprise double-stranded viral RNA, BaMV replicase (Rep BaMV ), and mitochondrial outer membrane protein, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). In this study, we demonstrate that host glycolytic enolase (ENO) binds to untranslated regions of BaMV RNA independently of ENO hydrolytic activity. However, the structural integrity of ENO is essential for its direct interaction with Rep BaMV , and its positive regulating role in BaMV replication and the size of BaMV VRC clusters. Additionally, ENO, pyruvate kinase (PYK), and VDAC colocalize within cytosolic BaMV VRC clusters embedded in the convoluted endomembrane reticulum (ER) along with ER-targeted viral movement proteins under BaMV infection. This association suggests that the ENO-PYK-VDAC metabolon, with ENO serving as a scaffold to link chloroplasts and mitochondria, may play a pivotal role in BaMV robust replication. Collectively, our findings offer significant insights into how glycolytic ENO acts in BaMV replication.",

          "abstract": "Heterotrimeric Gα:Gβγ G proteins function as molecular switches downstream of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). They alternate between a heterotrimeric GDP-bound OFF-state and a GTP-bound ON-state in which Gα GTP is separated from the Gβγ dimer. Consequently, pharmacological tools to securely prevent the OFF-ON transition are of utmost importance to investigate their molecular switch function, specific contribution to GPCR signal transduction, and potential as drug targets. FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), two natural cyclic peptides and highly specific inhibitors of Gq/11 heterotrimers, are exactly such tools. To date, their efficient and long-lasting inhibition of Gq/11 signaling has been attributed solely to a wedge-like binding to Gα, thereby preventing separation of the GTPase and α-helical domains and thus GDP release. Here, we use X-ray crystallography, biochemical and signaling assays, and BRET-based biosensors to show that FR and YM also function as stabilizers of the Gα:Gβγ subunit interface. Our high-resolution structures reveal a network of residues in Gα and two highly conserved amino acids in Gβ that are targeted by FR and YM to glue the Gβγ complex to the inactive Gα GDP subunit. Unlike all previously developed nucleotide-state specific inhibitors that sequester Gα in its OFF-state but compete with Gβγ, FR and YM actively promote the inhibitory occlusion of Gα GDP by Gβγ. In doing so, they securely lock the entire heterotrimer, not just Gα, in its inactive state. Our results identify FR and YM as molecular glues for Gα and Gβγ that combine simultaneous binding to both subunits with inhibition of G protein signaling.",

          "abstract": "Representing the locations of places so that we can use them as landmarks is critical to our ability to navigate through large-scale spaces—a process referred to as “map-based navigation.” While many neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that this ability involves the retrosplenial complex (RSC)—a scene-selective region in the medial parietal cortex—nothing is known about how this cortical system develops. So, does it develop only late in childhood, as generally assumed from some behavioral studies? Or is it, perhaps counterintuitively, present in the first few years of life? To test this question, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) multivoxel pattern analysis and a virtual town paradigm, we investigated the representation of location information in the RSC of 5-y-olds. We found that i) the RSC in 5-y-olds already represents the locations of particular buildings in the town (e.g., the ice cream store by the mountain versus by the lake), but not their category membership (e.g., ice cream store, regardless of location), and ii) this neural representation is correlated with their performance on a location task. Using multidimensional scaling, we also found that the neural representation of the buildings in RSC reflects the actual layout of the virtual town. Finally, the parahippocampal place area—a scene-selective region implicated in scene categorization, not map-based navigation—did not represent location information, but instead category information, the exact opposite of RSC. Taken together, these findings reveal the early development of navigationally relevant location information in RSC and thus the early origins of map-based navigation.",

This warrants the investigation of the role played by interspecies interactions in shaping gel architecture and rheology. Here, using computer simulations, we investigate the effect of changing the strength of the interactions between two species forming a fibrous double network. Simply changing the strength of interspecies lateral association, we generate two types of gels: one in which the two components demix and another one in which the two species wrap around each other. We show that demixed gels have structure and rheology that are largely unaffected by the strength of attraction between the components. In contrast, architecture and material properties of intertwined gels strongly depend on interspecies “stickiness” and volume exclusion. These results can be used as the basis of a design principle for double networks which are made to emphasize either stability to perturbations or responsiveness to stimuli. Similar ideas could be used to interpret naturally occurring multicomponent gels.",

          "abstract": "In an era of unprecedented biodiversity loss, the need for standardized practices to describe biological variation is becoming increasingly important. As with all scientific endeavors, species delimitation needs to be explicit, testable, and refutable. A fundamental task in species delimitation is distinguishing within-species variation from among-species variation. Many species that are distributed across large geographic areas exhibit levels of genetic variation that are as great or greater than those that exist between well-defined sympatric species. Here, we provide a workflow to distinguish between intra- and interspecific genetic variation and apply the workflow to a taxonomically problematic group of frogs (the Rana pipiens complex, or leopard frogs) that are widely distributed across Mexico and Central America. Our workflow makes use of recent advancements that pair genome-scale datasets with model-based species delimitation methods, while emphasizing the need for positive evidence of reproductive isolation to confirm the validity of geographically contiguous species boundaries. We find that intraspecific geographic variation in widespread leopard frog species has resulted in considerable taxonomic inflation of species. Ten currently recognized species are not supported in our analyses, and we here synonymize them with previously named taxa. Furthermore, we find positive evidence for the presence of three undescribed species. In addition to proposing these taxonomic changes, we provide descriptions of the data or analyses that would be needed to refute and overturn our recommendations. We recommend that all species delimitation studies (especially of geographically variable groups) clarify what new evidence would be sufficient to change the taxonomic recommendations.",

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal diseases characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors. Neuroinflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of RP and its progression. Previous studies have suggested that the transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) plays a pivotal role in regulating acute and chronic neuroinflammation. However, the functional role of TAK1 in neuroinflammation remains unclear in RP. Here, we observed TAK1 upregulation in activated microglia of the rd10 mouse model of RP. To create the conditional deletion of TAK1 in microglia, we backcrossed Cx3cr1 CreER/CreER mice and Tak1 fl/fl mice onto rd10 background. We found that both heterozygous (rd10;Cx3cr1 CreER/+ ;Tak1 fl/+ ) and homozygous (rd10;Cx3cr1 CreER/+ ;Tak1 fl/fl ) deletion of microglial TAK1 slowed down photoreceptor degeneration but with distinct mechanisms. The heterozygous TAK1 deficiency resulted in a reduction in the activation and proliferation of microglia and the release of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting STAT3 signaling. In contrast, the homozygous TAK1 deficiency induced apoptosis in microglia via the TNF/RIPK1/CASP3 signaling pathway, contributing to the reduction of microglia-mediated neurotoxicity and subsequent preservation of photoreceptors in RP. Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of TAK1 in the survival and activation of microglia. We propose that targeting microglial TAK1, considering its expression levels and subsequent signal transduction, could offer a promising personalized therapeutic strategy for individuals with RP regardless of underlying genetic causes.",

We detected temporary upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) in all DC and monocyte subsets on days 3 and 7 after vaccination as well as cell type–specific responses and response kinetics. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed rapid appearance of activated DC and monocyte clusters dominated by ISGs, inflammatory chemokines, and genes involved in antigen processing and presentation. This was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis in a large cohort of vaccinees.

This is especially manifest for lineages with extended geological histories, which, therefore, evokes questions as to the associated processes producing such patterns. Insects, as the earliest flying animals, have exceptional abilities for expanding their range and habitats and to avoid detrimental conditions. They are ideal for exploring historical biogeography augmented via adaptation. Here, we employ beaded lacewings as a model to explore such patterns and likely processes, particularly given that they differ notably from the commonly observed pattern of a latitudinal diversity gradient. Furthermore, owing to their good fossil record it can be observed that their distributions varied remarkably through time. Ecological niche modeling and evaluation demonstrate their niche variation and niche breadth expansion intermittently accompanying global climate change. However, different niche relevant variables changed under patterns of either phylogenetic conservatism or evolutionary lability. By assessing wing morphological disparity and modeling flight aerodynamics, we uncovered a continuous improvement of flight efficiency through beaded-lacewing history as well as a Paleogene divergence in strategy, which reveals a long-term associated path with the niche variation. Our results unveil the adaptive evolution and dispersal history of beaded lacewings through 170 My, achieved by dynamic strategies in niche shift and flight adaptation as responses to a changing planet.",

We find a class of combinatorial objects which we call tight gradings.

Here, we extend this framework to sulfur (S)—one of six “life-essential” volatile elements [T C ~ 664 K]—via the mass-independent S-isotope compositions of differentiated meteorites. We observe that on average, NC and CC iron meteorites are characterized by distinct Δ 33 S (Δ 33 S NC = 0.013 ± 0.003‰; Δ 33 S CC = −0.021 ± 0.009‰; 2 SE).

A lack of CC achondrite S-isotope analyses prevents direct comparison of the Δ 33 S and Δ 36 S of NC and CC achondrites, but the average Δ 33 S and Δ 36 S of NC achondrites (Δ 33 S = 0.02 ± 0.008; Δ 36 S = −0.019 ± 0.064‰; 2 SE) overlap with those of the NC irons. The average Δ 33 S values of NC achondrite groups also correlate with nucleosynthetic anomalies of other elements (e.g., Cr) previously used to define isotopic heterogeneity within the NC reservoir. The position of the Earth in Δ 33 S-Δ 36 S composition space implies that ~24% of terrestrial S derives from CC materials, while the majority (~76%) was delivered by NC materials.",

However, many patients do not respond, and the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. In this study, we profile a cohort of patients with locally advanced or metastatic basal cell carcinoma undergoing aPD-1 therapy using single-cell RNA sequencing, high-definition spatial transcriptomics in tumors and draining lymph nodes, and spatial immunoreceptor profiling, with long-term clinical follow-up. We find that successful responses to PD-1 inhibition are characterized by an induction of B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity after treatment initiation. These induced BCR clones spatially colocalize with T cell clones, facilitate their activation, and traffic alongside them between tumor and draining lymph nodes to enhance tumor clearance. Furthermore, we validated aPD-1-induced BCR diversity as a predictor of clinical response in a larger cohort of glioblastoma, melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, suggesting that this is a generalizable predictor of treatment response across many types of cancers. We find that pretreatment tumors harbor a characteristic gene expression signature that portends a higher probability of inducing BCR clonal diversity after aPD-1 therapy, and we develop a machine learning model that predicts PD-1-induced BCR clonal diversity from baseline tumor RNA sequencing. These findings underscore a dynamic role of B cell diversity during immunotherapy, highlighting its importance as a prognostic marker and a potential target for intervention in non-responders.",

          "abstract": "A key unresolved question in microbial ecology is how the extraordinary diversity of microbiomes emerges from the interactions among their many functionally distinct populations. This process is driven in part by the cross-feeding networks that help to structure these systems, in which consumers use resources to fuel their metabolism, creating by-products which can be used by others in the community. Understanding the effects of cross-feeding presents a major challenge, as it creates complex interdependencies between populations which can be hard to untangle. We address this problem using the tools of network science to develop a structural microbial community model. Using methods from percolation theory, we identify feasible community states for cross-feeding network structures in which the needs of consumers are met by metabolite production across the community. We identify tipping points at which small changes in structure can cause the catastrophic collapse of cross-feeding networks and abrupt declines in microbial community diversity. Our results are an example of a well-defined tipping point in a complex ecological system and provide insight into the fundamental processes shaping microbiomes and their robustness. We further demonstrate this by considering how network attacks affect community diversity and apply our results to show how the apparent difficulty in culturing the microbial diversity emerges as an inherent property of their cross-feeding networks.",

          "abstract": "Globally, cities face increasing extreme heat, impacting comfort, health, and energy consumption. Infrastructure-based heat adaptation strategies can improve these outcomes, but each strategy has a unique mix of benefits and drawbacks. Here, we apply an urbanized meteorological model (WRF) with the newly integrated multilayer BEP-Tree street tree model to dynamically downscale Earth System Model projections and a 3-D microclimate model (TUF-Pedestrian) to simulate the street-scale radiation environment impacting pedestrians. We evaluate the performance of five heat adaptation strategies (street trees, cool roofs, green roofs, rooftop photovoltaics (PV), and reflective pavements) during extreme heat events in three cities with contrasting background climates (Toronto, Phoenix, and Miami), under contemporary and end-of-century projected climates, based on three metrics: outdoor heat stress, air conditioning (AC) energy use, and ventilation of vehicular air pollution. No single adaptation strategy improves all three outcomes. While street trees inhibit ventilation, they reduce outdoor heat stress four times more effectively than the next best strategy via shade provision, fully offsetting heat stress increases under a high-emissions end-of-century climate scenario in all cities studied. Cool roofs and green roofs moderately reduce heat stress and energy use. Alternatively, rooftop PV with energy storage can generate sufficient power for space cooling but have marginal effects on heat stress. Reflective pavements are the least effective across metrics. Where the ventilation of street-level emissions is of less concern, our results clearly support the combination of street trees and rooftop PV as a highly complementary and effective means of adaptive mitigation across different climates and neighborhood densities.",

          "abstract": "Many organisms employ reversible dormancy, or seedbank, in response to environmental fluctuations. This life-history strategy alters fundamental ecoevolutionary forces, leading to distinct patterns of genetic diversity. Two models of dormancy have been proposed based on the average duration of dormancy relative to coalescent timescales: weak seedbank, induced by scheduled seasonality (e.g., plants, invertebrates), and strong seedbank, where individuals stochastically switch between active and dormant states (e.g., bacteria, fungi). The weak seedbank coalescent is statistically equivalent to the Kingman coalescent with a scaled mutation rate, allowing the use of existing inference methods. In contrast, the strong seedbank coalescent differs fundamentally, as only active lineages can coalesce, while dormant lineages cannot. Additionally, dormant individuals typically mutate at a slower rate than active ones. Consequently, despite the significant role of dormancy in the ecoevolutionary dynamics of many organisms, no methods currently exist for inferring population dynamics involving dormancy and associated parameters. We present a Bayesian framework for jointly inferring a latent genealogy, seedbank parameters, and evolutionary parameters from molecular sequence data under the strong seedbank coalescent. We derive the exact probability density of genealogies sampled under the strong seedbank coalescent, characterize the corresponding likelihood function, and present efficient computational algorithms for its evaluation based on our theoretical framework. We develop a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and implement our inference framework as a package SeedbankTree within BEAST2. Our work provides both a theoretical foundation and practical inference framework for studying the population genetic and genealogical impacts of dormancy.",

Despite the cardioprotective effects of endogenous ligand, apelin, achieving G-protein-biased agonism for therapeutic benefit poses a significant challenge. In this study, we unravel the biased signal transduction pathway mediated by a reported partial G i -protein-biased APLNR agonist CMF-019 and developed a biased chemical space remodeling approach to identify exclusive G-protein-biased agonists targeting APLNR. These agonists exhibited enhanced Gi-protein-biased function and protective effects in both in vitro and in vivo.

          "abstract": "Supported by chiral stationary phase high-performance liquid chromatography HPLC (CSP-HPLC), examples of chiral mechanically interlocked organic molecules, including knots, rotaxanes, and catenanes, have been reported. However, the exploration of stereoselective construction of chiral cationic complexes, particularly those induced by point chirality, has been notably limited due to the constraints posed by the type of chiral chromatographic columns and separation efficiency. To address this, we have developed a construction strategy for generating coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes through the induction of point chirality. In this study, by adjusting the symmetry of the ligand, we have easily realized the efficient construction of high-yield crystalline coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes. Moreover, within the enantiomerically pure chiral environment of molecular self-assembly driven by L -alanine and L -valine residues in bidentate ligands, the coconformational mechanically helical and topologically chiral [2]catenanes exist exclusively as a single enantiomer, thus eliminating the need for laborious CSP-HPLC separation from racemic mixtures. The generation of the opposite enantiomer can be realized by employing unsymmetrical ligands containing corresponding D -alanine and D -valine residues, as confirmed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, electrospray-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, solution-state NMR spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy.",

          "abstract": "Stop-loss mutations cause over twenty different diseases. The effects of stop-loss mutations can have multiple consequences that are, however, hard to predict. Stop-loss in ITM2B/BRI2 results in C-terminal extension of the encoded protein and, upon furin cleavage, in the production of two 34 amino acid long peptides, ADan and ABri, that accumulate as amyloids in the brains of patients affected by familial Danish and British Dementia. To systematically explore the consequences of Bri2 C-terminal extension, here, we use a yeast-based massively parallel assay to measure amyloid formation for 676 ADan substitutions and identify the region that forms the putative amyloid core of ADan fibrils, located between positions 20 and 26, where stop-loss occurs. Moreover, we measure amyloid formation for ~18,000 random C-terminal extensions of Bri2 and find that ~32% of these sequences can nucleate amyloids. We find that the amino acid composition of these nucleating sequences varies with peptide length and that short extensions of two specific amino acids (Aliphatics, Aromatics, and Cysteines) are sufficient to generate de novo amyloid cores. Overall, our results show that the C-terminus of Bri2 contains an incomplete amyloid motif that can turn amyloidogenic upon extension. C-terminal extension with de novo formation of amyloid motifs may thus be a widespread pathogenic mechanism resulting from stop-loss, highlighting the importance of determining the impact of these mutations for other sequences across the genome.",

Yet, several lineages have evolved the ability to move their jaws laterally, enabling major innovations, like chewing. While lateral jaw motions are primarily known in tetrapods, here, we show that an ecologically dominant lineage of reef fishes (Zanclidae and Acanthuridae) has evolved the ability to laterally rotate their jaws during feeding. This unique function substantially expands both the kinematic versatility and known diversity of vertebrate jaw mechanisms, adding to the growing list of innovations that followed the origin of jaws. Within Acanthuridae, this increased kinematic versatility may allow for algal detachment with minimal movement of the rest of the body, facilitating rapid biting within the same microtopographic location, and thus, this lineage having the highest bite rates among biting reef fishes. This innovation may have thus helped create one of the most ecologically diverse and speciose herbivorous reef fish lineages. Our results highlight the ecological and evolutionary impact of lateral jaw rotation within vertebrates, and potentially how this novelty led to a significant change in coral reef trophodynamics.",

          "abstract": "Sensory enteroendocrine cells in the intestinal epithelium detect and relay information about the luminal environment to other cells within and outside the gut. Serotonergic enterochromaffin (EC) cells are a subset of enteroendocrine cells that detect noxious stimuli within the gut lumen, such as chemical irritants and microbial byproducts, and transduce this information to sensory nerve fibers to elicit defensive responses such as nausea and visceral pain. While much has recently been learned about the pharmacological and biophysical characteristics of EC cells, a more broadscale investigation of their properties has been hindered by their relatively low prevalence and sparse anatomical distribution within the gut epithelium. Here, we introduce a method for large-scale parallel analysis of individual EC cell activity within a physiologically relevant epithelial context. Using this approach, we identify somatostatin-28 as a potent inhibitor of both basal and stimulus-evoked serotonin release from EC cells and delineate the signaling pathway that underlies this modulatory response. Our analysis suggests that targeting this inhibitory signaling pathway may offer therapeutic avenues for treating gastrointestinal disorders associated with EC cell function and dysregulated serotonin signaling. Together with the ongoing development of specific biosensors, this platform provides a template for the efficient characterization of other rare sensory cell types and their pharmacological modulators.",

The complexity of neutrophil functions in local environments underscores our limited understanding of how their adaptation in tissues influences disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that neutrophils recruited in murine colitis and infection models, idiopathic IBD, and chronic granulomatous disease-associated IBD undergo extensive transcriptional reprogramming, resulting in the emergence of neutrophil populations that feature unique DUOX2 NADPH oxidase expression. Functional studies utilizing mice with myeloid and neutrophil specific DUOX2 inactivation reveal a vital and dichotomous role for this NADPH oxidase in both colitis and intestinal infection. Niche-directed reprogramming promoted a DUOX2-dependent chemokine and cytokine-rich intestinal environment that amplified and prolonged inflammatory responses, suggesting that selectively suppressing DUOX2 may constitute an anti-inflammatory strategy for IBD treatment. Altering spatiotemporal redox signaling by de novo expression of a ROS-generating enzyme represents an important feature for functional neutrophil diversification in disease, with implications for other neutrophil-driven diseases in specialized niches.",

          "abstract": "Around 34 Mya, the Eocene−Oligocene transition (EOT) marked the most dramatic global climatic cooling of the Cenozoic. On a planetary scale, paleontological evidence suggests that this transition was associated with major faunal turnovers, sometimes even regarded as a mass extinction crisis. In South America, there is no consensus on the response of the endemic mammals to this transition. Here, using a vetted fossil dataset and cutting-edge Bayesian methods, we analyzed the dynamics of South American mammal (SAM) diversification and their possible drivers across latitude (tropical vs. extratropical), taxonomic groups, and trophic guilds throughout the Eocene−Oligocene ( ca. 56 to 23 Ma). Our results did not evidence any mass extinction among SAM at the EOT. Instead, they experienced a gradual and long-term diversity decline from the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene, followed by a sudden waxing-and-waning diversity associated with a large taxonomic—but not ecological—turnover. Tropical and extratropical lineages have had very distinct macroevolutionary histories. No effective change in the pace at which tropical lineages diversify was found, thus favoring the tropical stability hypothesis proposed by Wallace. Diversity-dependent effects, temperature, and Andean uplift were recovered as probable drivers of SAM diversification across the period. Contrasting evidence casts doubt on the common hypothesis primarily linking Oligocene faunal changes to grassland expansion. Our findings illustrate the uniqueness of the deep-time interplay between endemic SAM and their physical environment in a context of climatic shift, highlighting the need to consider regional idiosyncrasies for understanding the coevolution of life and climate.",

          "abstract": "Aneuploidy is observed as gains or losses of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms and is a common hallmark of cancer. Whereas models for the generation of aneuploidy in cancer invoke mitotic chromosome segregation errors, whole-arm losses might occur simply as a result of centromere breakage. We recently showed that elevated RNA Polymerase II level over the S-phase-dependent histone genes predicts rapid recurrence of human meningioma and is correlated with total whole-arm losses relative to gains. To explain this imbalance in arm losses over gains, we have proposed that histone overexpression at S-phase competes with the histone H3 variant CENP-A, resulting in centromere breaks and whole-arm losses. To test whether centromere breaks alone can drive aneuploidy, we ask whether total whole-arm aneuploids can predict outcomes across different cancer types in large RNA and whole-genome sequencing databanks. We find that total whole-arm losses generally predict outcome, suggesting that centromere breakage is a major initiating factor leading to aneuploidy and the resulting changes in the selective landscape that drive most cancers. We also present evidence that centromere breakage alone is sufficient to account for whole-arm losses and gains, contrary to mitotic spindle error models for the generation of aneuploidy. Our results suggest that therapeutic intervention targeting histone overexpression has the potential to reduce aneuploidy and slow cancer progression.",

Methyltransferase 3 (METTL3) is a major m 6 A methyltransferase for RNA N6-mehtyladenosine (m 6 A) modifications to regulate epitranscriptome and cellular functions. With the atheroprone flow upregulating METTL3 and m 6 A RNA hypermethylation, we investigate the role of METTL3 in atheroprone flow–induced glycolysis in ECs in vitro and in vivo. Compared to pulsatile shear stress (PS, atheroprotective flow), oscillatory shear stress (OS, atheroprone flow) increases METTL3 expression to enhance the m 6 A modifications of mRNAs encoding HK1, PFKFB3, and GCKR, which are rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis. These augmented m 6 A modifications increase the expressions of HK1 and PFKFB3 while decreasing GCKR, resulting in elevated EC glycolysis, as revealed by seahorse analysis. Moreover, a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging study demonstrates the elevation of glucose incorporation into de novo synthesized lipids in ECs under atheroprone flow in vitro and in vivo. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) drug, represses METTL3 expression, thereby mitigating OS-induced glycolysis in ECs.

Species trees play a central role in many of these applications; however, despite the widespread availability of genome assemblies, accurate inference of species trees remains challenging due to the limited automation, substantial domain expertise, and computational resources required by conventional methods. To address this limitation, we present ROADIES, a fully automated pipeline to infer species trees starting from raw genome assemblies. In contrast to the prominent approach, ROADIES incorporates a unique strategy of randomly sampling segments of the input genomes to generate gene trees. This eliminates the need for predefining a set of loci, limiting the analyses to a fixed number of genes, and performing the cumbersome gene annotation and/or whole genome alignment steps. ROADIES also eliminates the need to infer orthology by leveraging existing discordance-aware methods that allow multicopy genes. Using the genomic datasets from large-scale sequencing efforts across four diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, birds, and budding yeasts), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality to the state-of-the-art studies but in a fraction of the time and effort, including on challenging datasets with rampant gene tree discordance and complex polyploidy. With its speed, accuracy, and automation, ROADIES has the potential to vastly simplify species tree inference, making it accessible to a broader range of scientists and applications.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to anticipate and adapt to future climate can benefit from historical experiences. We examine agroclimatic conditions over the past 50 y for five major crops around the world. Most regions experienced rapid warming relative to interannual variability, with 45% of summer and 32% of winter crop area warming by more than two SD (σ). Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a key driver of plant water stress, also increased in most temperate regions but not in the tropics. Precipitation trends, while important in some locations, were generally below 1σ. Historical climate model simulations show that observed changes in crops’ climate would have been well predicted by models run with historical forcings, with two main surprises: i) models substantially overestimate the amount of warming and drying experienced by summer crops in North America, and ii) models underestimate the increase in VPD in most temperate cropping regions. Linking agroclimatic data to crop productivity, we estimate that climate trends have caused current global yields of wheat, maize, and barley to be 10, 4, and 13% lower than they would have otherwise been. These losses likely exceeded the benefits of CO 2 increases over the same period, whereas CO 2 benefits likely exceeded climate-related losses for soybean and rice. Aggregate global yield losses are very similar to what models would have predicted, with the two biases above largely offsetting each other. Climate model biases in reproducing VPD trends may partially explain the ineffectiveness of some adaptations predicted by modeling studies, such as farmer shifts to longer maturing varieties.",

          "abstract": "During meiosis, the correct pairing, synapsis, and recombination of homologous chromosome pairs is critical for fertility of sexual eukaryotes. These processes are challenged in polyploids, which possess additional copies of each chromosome. Polyploidy thus provides a unique context to study how evolution can modify meiotic programs in response to challenges. We previously observed that in newly formed (neo-)polyploids of Arabidopsis arenosa , synapsis defects precede chromosomes associating in aberrant multivalent and univalent configurations. Here, we study synapsis dynamics in genotypes with varying levels of meiotic stability to ask whether efficient synaptic progression is a key component of evolving stable tetraploid meiosis. We develop a method to quantify synapsis dynamics using the progression of foci of the pro-crossover factor HEI10 as a reference. HEI10 initially appears at many small foci before accumulating only at crossover sites. In diploids, this transition begins while significant asynapsis is still present, though it quickly declines as HEI10 accumulates at fewer foci. In neo-tetraploids, suboptimal elongation of synaptic initiation sites and stalled synapsis, perhaps due to defective pairing, occurs before the onset of HEI10 accumulation. In established tetraploids, HEI10 accumulation begins only when synapsis is near complete, suggesting enhanced HEI10/synapsis codynamics (even compared to diploids). Hybrids generated by crossing neo- and established tetraploids exhibit intermediate phenotypes. We find the extent of asynapsis correlates positively with crossover numbers, and the frequency of multivalents and univalents, which can disturb chromosome segregation. Our work supports the hypothesis that improving the efficiency of synapsis is important for evolving polyploid meiotic stability.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Mtb cell envelope glycans are potent virulence factors that play key roles in mediating infection of host tissues and modulating the host immune response. However, there are few ways to site-selectively modify and label these or any glycans to study their functions in disease. This gap arises because glycans generally lack functional groups amenable to bioconjugation strategies. Methylthioxylofuranose (MTX), a rare monosaccharide in select pathogenic mycobacteria, is an exception. MTX is appended to mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM), an antigenic glycolipid in the Mtb cell envelope implicated in downregulating the host immune system during infection. MTX is unique not only in its prevalence but also in its functionality—it contains a thioether not present in other glycans. We envisioned exploiting the MTX thioether to selectively label ManLAM with an oxaziridine probe. Here, we show that MTX-containing glycans can be labeled selectively in the test tube and live cells, highlighting the reactivity and accessibility of this motif. Our approach labels ManLAM efficiently despite the presence of protein methionine residues and can distinguish between different mycobacterial species. Using an oxaziridine equipped with a reporter, we could visualize ManLAM localization in live cells and a macrophage infection model, highlighting the stability of the label and the cell envelope in this environment. These studies will enable investigations of dynamic changes in a critical Mtb cell envelope component during infection. Moreover, the selective reactivity of thioethers can be leveraged to expand the repertoire of glycan bioconjugation strategies.",

          "abstract": "Vetiver ( Vetiveria zizanioides ) is highly attractive to the rice stem borer ( Chilo suppressalis , RSB) and is widely utilized as a trap plant for RSB control in East Asia. However, the underlying mechanism driving this high level of attractiveness remains unclear. In this study, we identified volatiles emitted by vetiver using SPME/GC–MS and found that cedrol constitutes 12.15% of the total volatile profile. Both Y-tube olfactometer and electroantennography assays revealed that cedrol is highly attractive to female RSB moths at a concentration of 200 μg/μL. To investigate the mechanism responsible for the high level of cedrol in vetiver, we sequenced and assembled a chromosome-level genome of vetiver, identifying a vetiver-specific terpene synthase, VzTPS9, which is responsible for the synthesis of cedrol from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Subsequently, we constructed a transgenic rice line by integrating VzTPS9 into the rice genome. Enzyme assays and gene expression analyses demonstrated that the transgenic rice produced higher levels of cedrol, which were positively correlated with VzTPS9 expression levels, and consequently, with increased attractiveness to female RSB moths. These findings suggest that increased expression of VzTPS9 in vetiver leads to elevated cedrol synthesis, contributing to its enhanced attractiveness to RSB. This work uncovers the molecular mechanism behind vetiver’s high attractiveness to RSB and provides valuable insights for developing more effective strategies for utilizing vetiver as a trap plant in RSB control.",

Condensate formation and function remain incompletely understood due to difficulties in visualizing the condensate interior at high resolution. Here, we analyzed the structure of biochemically reconstituted chromatin condensates through cryoelectron tomography. We found that traditional blotting methods of sample preparation were inadequate, and high-pressure freezing plus focused ion beam milling was essential to maintain condensate integrity. To identify densely packed molecules within the condensate, we integrated deep learning–based segmentation with context-aware template matching. Our approaches were developed on chromatin condensates and were also effective on condensed regions of in situ native chromatin. Using these methods, we determined the average structure of nucleosomes to 6.1 and 12 Å resolution in reconstituted and native systems, respectively, found that nucleosomes form heterogeneous interaction networks in both cases, and gained insight into the molecular origins of surface tension in chromatin condensates. Our methods should be applicable to biomolecular condensates containing large and distinctive components in both biochemical reconstitutions and certain cellular systems.",

Here, we show that human CDADC1 is a (d)CTP-specific deaminase, with a roughly 2-fold in vitro preference for dCTP over CTP. We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of CDADC1 in the absence of substrate and in complex with dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP. The structures show that CDADC1 forms trimers and dimers of trimers in solution. The (d)CTP substrate is selected by a narrow pocket for the cytosine base and multiple lysine and arginine contacts to the triphosphate. Substrate binding promotes the association of trimers into hexamers and the transition of the hexamers from a loose to a tighter arrangement. Genetic experiments in mice show that loss of Cdadc1 is surprisingly well tolerated, even in the absence of the dCMP deaminase Dctd that is considered as the main source of dUMP, the precursor of dTTP.",

Despite their eco-friendly and biodegradable reputation, the in vivo behaviors of PLA-MPs concerning fermentation, carbon cycle, and adverse effects remain unknown. Here, we showed that gut microbiota from the colon can effectively degrade the PLA-MPs by secreting esterase FrsA, whereas esterase FrsA-producing bacteria were identified to dominate this behavior in male C57BL/6 mice. Using isotope tracing and multiomics techniques, we uncovered that 13 C-labeled PLA-MPs were incorporated into the carbon cycle of gut microbiota as a carbon source. Meanwhile, these degraded PLA-MPs fragments entered the succinate pathway of the tricarboxylic acid cycle within gut epithelial cells. These processes altered the metabolic phenotype of the gut, resulting in the decreased linear short-chain fatty acids that are primary energy sources of the gut epithelium. Furthermore, we found that exposure of PLA-MPs significantly reduced the appetite and body weight of mice. Our findings present an overall process of biodegradable plastics within hosts, with the focus on the entire double carbon cycle of PLA-MPs in the gut, which offers indispensable insights into the potential impact of exposure to PLA-MPs.",

          "abstract": "Infection with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes the most severe form of viral hepatitis, affecting more than 15 million people worldwide. HDV is a small RNA satellite virus of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that relies on the HBV envelope for viral particle assembly. The only specific HDV component is the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which consists of viral RNA (vRNA) associated with the small (S) and large (L) delta antigens (HDAg). While the structure of the HDAg N-terminal assembly domain is known, here we address the structure of the remaining S Δ60 protein using NMR. We show that S Δ60 contains two intrinsically disordered regions separated by a helix–loop–helix motif and that this structure is conserved in the full-length protein. Solution NMR analysis revealed that S Δ60 binds to both full-length and truncated vRNA, highlighting the role of the helical regions in submicromolar affinity interactions. The resulting complex contains approximately 120 S Δ60 proteins per RNA. Our results provide a model for the arginine-rich domains in RNP assembly and RNA interactions. In addition, we show that a cluster of acidic residues within the structured region of S Δ60 is critical for HDV replication, possibly mimicking the nucleosome acidic patch involved in the recruitment of chromatin remodelers. Our work thus provides the molecular basis for understanding the role of the C-terminal RNA-binding domain of S-HDAg in HDV infection.",

The framework uniquely integrates DEM with pore-scale hydrodynamic models to capture unsaturated flow dynamics, while leveraging a two-way coupling mechanism to ensure bidirectional fluid–grain feedback through stabilized domain partitioning. Further innovations include a dynamic pore-merging and retriangulation algorithm that enhances computational efficiency for large-scale systems. Validated against experimental data for glass beads and Ottawa sand, PUA-DEM accurately reproduces critical hydromechanical phenomena-including capillary/viscous fingering, wetting-induced granular swelling/collapse, and quasi-static deformation-under diverse saturation and loading regimes. Numerical case studies reveal how capillary forces and wetting fluid saturation collectively govern granular response, from pore-scale meniscus evolution to macroscale flow instabilities. By bridging pore- and particle-scale physics, PUA-DEM advances predictive modeling of partially saturated granular systems, offering transformative insights for geohazard mitigation, sustainable agriculture, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and energy-related engineering applications.",

          "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapeutics is one major challenge to clinical effectiveness of cancer treatment and is primarily interpreted by various biochemical mechanisms. This study establishes an inverse correlation between tumor cell contractility and chemosensitivity. In both clinical biopsies and cancer cell lines, high/low actomyosin-mediated contractile force attenuates/enhances the vulnerability to chemotherapy, which depends on intercellular force propagation. Cell–cell interaction force activates the mechanosensitive Notch signaling that upregulates the downstream effector major vault protein, which facilitates the export of chemotherapy drugs from nuclei, leading to the reduction of chemosensitivity. Cellular contractility promotes the tolerance of tumor xenografts to chemotherapy and sustains tumor growth in vivo, which can be reversed by the inhibition of contractile force, Notch signaling, or major vault protein. Further, the actomyosin-Notch signaling is associated with drug resistance and cancer recurrence of patients. These findings unveil a regulatory role of intercellular force in chemosensitivity, which could be harnessed as a promising target for cancer mechanotherapeutics.",

Designated as the word of the year in 2016 by the Oxford English Dictionary , “post-truth” refers to “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping political debate or public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.” Authors advocate that more needs to be done to address the adverse effects of post-truth, such as misinformation , and to help people cope with it. But what exactly needs to be done? Take the science education ecosystem, for example: What are the implications for science curricula in schools and universities? How should school science teachers and university lecturers teach? One way of dealing with post-truth is to focus on the nature and importance of scientific evidence to counter proliferation of misinformation. My own research group has been investigating strategies to support evidence-based reasoning in secondary school science lessons for more than 25 years. Our work has highlighted how students’ skills in evidence-based reasoning can be supported through resources and pedagogical strategies .",

We used scRNA-seq to examine cell-type allometry in asexual planarians of different sizes, revealing that they consist of the same basic cell types but in varying proportions.

Tree-ring proxies, spanning three centuries, reveal that the recent intensity of this pattern is unprecedented in the historical records. In contrast, the circumglobal teleconnection, which historically dominated the continental-scale Eurasian heatwave occurrences, has shown no discernible trend amid global warming. Consequently, this emerging pattern signifies a radical shift in Eurasian heatwave-drought climatologies. The mechanism involves Rossby wave propagation linked to warming sea surface temperatures in the Northwestern Atlantic and enhanced Sahel precipitation, both amplified recently by overlapping effects of anthropogenic warming and natural variability. Land-atmosphere interactions driven by soil moisture deficits further intensified the pattern regionally. Climate models predict that anthropogenic forcings will continue to strengthen the pattern throughout this century.",

Here, we estimate the global footprint of these devices and track 30 years of progress to mitigate impacts. We estimate that 1.41 million dFAD buoys were released between 2007 and 2021, drifting across at least 134 million square kilometers, or 37% of Earth’s ocean surface. Lost dFADs have stranded in 104 maritime jurisdictions, contributing to coastal pollution and damaging sensitive habitats. Regulatory progress has been made to address data quality, entanglement, and pollution but concerns over unregulated dFAD deployments, unsustainable bycatch, and weak industry accountability persist. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative environmental footprint of dFADs reaches far beyond tuna fishing grounds and remains inadequately mitigated at the global scale.",

DUX4 also activates hundreds of previously unannotated intergenic loci dominated by repetitive elements. The transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of these loci in myogenic and embryonic contexts indicate that the usage of DUX4-binding sites at these intergenic loci is influenced by the cellular environment. These findings demonstrate that DUX4 induces context-specific transcriptomic programs, enriching our understanding of DUX4-induced muscle pathology.",

However, complex iPSC-NK (iNK) manufacturing challenges clinical use. Here, we identified LiPSC-GR1.1 as a superior iPSC line for iNK production. By engineering LiPSC-GR1.1 with a mesothelin (MSLN)–targeting CAR and interleukin-15 (IL-15), we achieved robust differentiation of iPSCs into mature activated iNK cells with enhanced tumor killing efficacy, superior tumor homing, and vigorous proliferation. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β)–producing tumor cells up-regulated major histocompatibility complex molecules and down-regulated MSLN post–CAR-IL-15 iNK treatment. Tumor-infiltrating CAR-IL-15 iNK cells exhibited high levels of CAR, IL-15, and NK-activating receptors, negligible checkpoint exhaustion markers, and extremely low levels of NK suppressive factors CISH , TGFBR2 , and BATF , enabling them to sustain activation, metabolic fitness, and effective tumor killing within TGF-β–rich hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Overall, we developed MSLN.CAR-IL-15–engineered GR1.1-iNK therapy with enhanced antitumor efficacy for solid tumor treatment.",

          "abstract": "The Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), Italy, exhibits distinct unrest patterns, including shallow seismicity following substantial strain accumulation, all within a densely populated area. Previous geophysical studies typically analyzed individual episodes, but by comparing two distinct unrest periods we identified recurring manifestations and V P / V S anomalies linked to a confined reservoir at 2- to 4-kilometer depth. Integrating rock physics experiments under hydrothermal conditions, 24 years of rainfall data, and subsurface hydrodynamics, we found increasing rainfall rates, which indicate reservoir recharge and pressurization. We show that hydrothermal water promotes caprock sealing through the formation of a fibrous microstructure. Our experiments further demonstrate that fluid accumulation rates directly influence deformation rates. Together, these processes drive gradual deformation, natural seismicity, and deepening earthquake foci. Recognizing these recurring patterns is crucial for understanding the caldera’s unrest-driving mechanism, enabling us to offer actionable insights for hazard assessment and engineering solutions, such as intercepting water upstream to prevent drainage toward Pozzuoli.",

This micro–underwater robot, equipped with flexible flapping wings that mimic the propulsive mechanisms of the pteropod, reaches a float velocity of 1.88 body height per second and a forward velocity of 1.2 body length per second, while maintaining a power consumption of merely 580 milliwatts. The ability to dynamically adjust the attack angle of the wings enables smooth transition among various modes (float, move straight, yaw, and pitch) of underwater locomotion, allowing for agile, three-dimensional maneuvering in complex aquatic environments.

          "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is a devastating manifestation in most lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Loss-of-function mutations in CLN1 , encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1), cause CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD that has no curative treatment. Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for trafficking to their destination. Although PPT1 depalmitoylates S-palmitoylated proteins and its deficiency causes CLN1 disease, the underlying pathogenic mechanism has remained elusive. We report that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a polytopic membrane protein mediating lysosomal cholesterol egress, requires dynamic S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosome. In Cln1 −/− mice, Ppt1 deficiency misroutes NPC1-dysregulating lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis. Along with this defect, increased oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) promotes cholesterol-mediated activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1), which inhibits autophagy contributing to neurodegeneration. Pharmacological inhibition of OSBP suppresses mTORC1 activation, rescues autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology in Cln1 −/− mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of CLN1 /PPT1 in lysosomal cholesterol homeostasis and suggest that suppression of mTORC1 activation may be beneficial for CLN1 disease.",

LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both essential for successful retrotransposition. ORF2p has endonuclease and reverse transcription activity, while ORF1p binds RNA. Many copies of ORF1p assemble onto the LINE-1 RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensate. However, the function of these condensates in the LINE-1 life cycle remains unclear. Using reconstitution assays on DNA curtains, we show that L1 RNP condensates gain DNA binding activity only when RNA is super-saturated with ORF1p. In cells, L1 RNP condensates bind to chromosomes during mitosis. Mutational analysis reveals that DNA binding is crucial for nuclear entry and LINE-1 retrotransposition activity. Thus, a key function of ORF1p is to form an RNP condensate that gains access to the genome through DNA binding upon nuclear envelope breakdown.",

Most human anti-CA antibodies cross-reacted with all HEV genotype variants, and a subset also recognized the zoonotic rat hepatitis E virus.

Structural analyses of CA protein complexed with three potent and broad HEV antibodies uncovered a neutralizing site located on monomeric P domain loops at the apex of the viral spike.

A promising solution is data compaction through contour extraction, visualizing only the outlines of objects while eliminating superfluous backgrounds. Here, we introduce an in-sensor multilevel image adjustment method using adjustable synaptic phototransistors, enabling the capture of well-defined images with optimal brightness and contrast suitable for achieving high-clarity contour extraction. This is enabled by emulating dopamine-mediated neuronal excitability regulation mechanisms. Electrostatic gating effect either facilitates or inhibits time-dependent photocurrent accumulation, adjusting photo-responses to varying lighting conditions. Through excitatory and inhibitory modes, the adjustable synaptic phototransistor enhances visibility of dim and bright regions, respectively, facilitating distinct contour extraction and high-accuracy semantic segmentation.

We find that scarcely investigated cellular determinants—namely, storage duration, membrane stiffness, and membrane-bound sialic acid quantity—substantially affect PACE nanoparticle adsorption efficiency. Following development of an optimized adsorption protocol, RBC hitchhiking was shown to enhance PACE nanoparticle cargo delivery to pulmonary tissue while also increasing exposure to other assayed organs.

The chemical interactions of dust particles with ozone production processes played crucial roles in explaining approximately 13 to 35% of the observed ozone reduction, alongside the impact of intense meteorological disturbances on transport and formation of ozone.

In the presence of an arrested peptidyl–transfer RNA, the RQC factor NEMF and the UFM1 E3 ligase (E3 UFM1 ) form a direct interaction via the UFL1 subunit of E3 UFM1 , and UFL1 adopts a conformation distinct from that previously observed for posttermination 60 S .

Constraining the maximum extent of these aseismic ruptures is, thus, important for better delineating the influence zone of injections concerning their seismic hazard. Here, we derive a scaling relation based on rupture physics for the maximum size of aseismic ruptures, accounting for fluid injections with arbitrary flow rate histories. Moreover, on the basis of mounting evidence that the moment release during these operations is often predominantly aseismic, we derive a scaling relation for the maximum magnitude of aseismic slip events. Our theoretical predictions are consistent with observations over a broad spectrum of event sizes, from laboratory to real-world cases, indicating that fault zone storativity, background stress change, and injected fluid volume are key determinants of the maximum size and magnitude of injection-induced slow slip events.",

          "abstract": "Antiviral restriction factors such as MxA (myxovirus resistance protein A) inhibit many viruses. Viral escape drives restriction factors to evolve rapidly at virus-binding interfaces to regain defense. Here, we explore how antiviral proteins balance restricting many viruses with evolving specificity against individual viruses. Human MxA uses its rapidly evolving loop L4 as the specificity determinant for orthomyxoviruses such as thogotovirus (THOV) and influenza (IAV). Previous combinatorial mutagenesis of rapidly evolving residues in human MxA loop L4 identified THOV “super-restrictors” and suggested an antiviral breadth-specificity trade-off. Using a modified combinatorial mutagenesis strategy, we find super-restrictor MxA variants specific to H5N1 IAV. A single L4 residue underlies the MxA breadth-specificity trade-off. However, rare “generalist” super-restrictors or a heterozygous combination of more common “specialist” super-restrictors can overcome the breadth-specificity trade-off. Our findings suggest that at least two strategies enable restriction factors such as MxA to increase their restriction of diverse viruses to overcome breadth-specificity trade-offs, which might be pervasive in host-virus conflicts.",

Its dissociation dynamics, driven by three conformers—cis-cis (CC), cis-trans (CT), and trans-trans (TT)—pose substantial experimental and theoretical challenges. Using deep potential molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy, we explored the dissociation dynamics of H 2 CO 3 in solution on the nanosecond timescale. While the CC conformer is the most abundant, the CT conformer is the dominant proton donor. This enhanced deprotonation ability arises from the CT conformer’s involvement in more hydrogen-bonding ring structures, enabling diverse proton transfer pathways, and its greater electronic asymmetry, which increases hydrophilicity and destabilizes the hydroxyl group. Furthermore, protons dissociated from the CT conformer demonstrate a stronger preference for the homing pathway. Our findings underscore the critical role of the topology and electronic properties of the CT conformer in aqueous H 2 CO 3 dissociation and proton transfer.",

The shortest path is obtained parallelly in nature using simultaneous spike traveling instead of arithmetic calculation, achieving extremely low time and space complexity. A nonlinear weight mapping approach is proposed to counterbalance the neuron intrinsic nonlinearity to guarantee accuracy to support large-scale graphs. The memristor hardware capability is experimentally demonstrated in unsupervised and supervised classification tasks. The estimated energy efficiency of 517.82 giga-traversal edges per second per watt outperforms field programmable gate arrays by three to four orders of magnitude, providing a pathway toward highly energy-efficient graph computing hardware.",

However, research has predominantly focused on their quasi-static characteristics, leaving their behavior under extreme dynamic conditions, especially at length scales relevant to practical applications largely unexplored. Here, we present a strategy to achieve extreme impact mitigation at the macroscale by combining shell-based microarchitecture with an additively manufactured medium-entropy alloy (MEA) featuring low stacking fault energy (SFE). Notably, the shell-based architecture amplifies the effective dynamic stress within the metamaterial compared to truss-based morphologies, leading to the earlier activation of multiscale toughening mechanisms in the alloy. The low SFE of the MEA enables the evolution of a diverse array of defect types, thereby prolonging strain hardening behavior across seven orders of magnitude in strain rate.

It has long been recognized that sex chromosome–linked drivers present a paradox: Their success in transmission can severely distort populations’ sex ratio and lead to extinction. This paradox is typically solved by the presence of suppressors or fitness costs associated with the driver, limiting the propagation of the driver. Here, we show that Stellate (Ste) in Drosophila melanogaster represents a novel class of X chromosome–linked driver that operates with an inherent mechanism that weakens its drive strength. Ste protein asymmetrically segregates into Y-bearing cells during meiosis I, subsequently causing their death. Unexpectedly, Ste segregates asymmetrically again during meiosis II, sparing half of the Y-bearing spermatids from Ste-induced defects, thereby weakening the drive strength. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which sex chromosome drivers avoid suicidal success.",

NMR spectra of heat-induced 13 C-ILV-methyl–labeled polymers, and 1 H-methyl spectra of liver-derived polymers, show equivalence to that of AAT in a post–protease-encounter conformation. This is corroborated by x-ray crystallography, which reveals a cryptic epitope recognized by the conformationally selective 2C1 antibody, common to both forms.

Consequently, the PBAC-modified PSCs achieve an efficiency of 25.53% (0.1 square centimeters) (certified efficiency of 25.24%) and 24.03% (1.0 square centimeters). Moreover, after 1500 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5 illumination and 2000 hours of exposure to damp heat conditions (85°C and 85% relative humidity), the device retains approximately 96 and 81% of its initial power conversion efficiency, respectively.

In contrast, the proteolytic activation of Syncytin-2 is not affected by GBP5, and its fusogenic activity is only modestly reduced. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Syncytin-1 is mainly cleaved by the GBP5 target furin, whereas Syncytin-2 is also efficiently processed by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) and thus resistant to GBP5-mediated restriction. Mutational analyses mapped PCSK7 processing of Syncytin-2 to a leucine residue upstream of the polybasic cleavage site.

We identify elevated levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor–1 (PAI-1) and, notably, its strong correlation with inflammation in arterial thrombosis. To address this, small molecular inhibitors of PAI-1 and inflammation are used as bioregulators to restore vascular homeostasis. We design a carrier-free supramolecular system based on the bioregulators-tuned self-assembly of a near-infrared thrombus probe, which preferentially forms protein corona in situ to enhance plasma stability. Under acidic conditions and increased shear stress, the supramolecular assemblies disintegrate, enabling site-specific cargo release. In vivo, the probe accumulates 22.8-fold more in the thrombotic than contralateral artery. Functionally, this nanomedicine improves outcomes in mice with carotid artery thrombosis and chronic cerebral ischemia. Mechanistically, it down-regulates NF-κB signaling, inhibits NETosis and glycolysis, and up-regulates cGMP-mediated signaling, thereby alleviating inflammation and promoting fibrinolysis.

Exoprotease activity was also substantially higher in ssRNA virus–infected cellular exudates compared to ssDNA virus–infected and uninfected cultures. This suggests that DOM produced through virus-mediated host lysis does not a priori support secondary production and implicate ssRNA virus infection as a source of proteolytic activity in the water column, highlighting a multifaceted role for viruses in altering microbial utilization and remineralization length scales of organic matter in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Body size greatly affects how organisms interact with their environments. However, the macroevolutionary patterns of body size across many major metazoan clades and their constraining mechanisms remain elusive. A new high-resolution body size dataset covering 2435 species from 1091 genera of Cambrian and Ordovician trilobites reveals that body size evolution changes episodically, with three marked reductions in size. Such a pattern rules out a persistent Cope’s rule dynamic. Rather, we find a strong temporal link between body size changes and major fluctuations in marine redox, supporting the hypothesis that marine oxygen levels exerted a primary control on the tempo and mode of trilobite body size evolution. These further imply a dominant role for marine oxygen in early animal evolution.",

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired megakaryogenesis plays a critical role in the development of DPR. In this study, we report remarkable hypermethylation within CG islands of HSCs and megakaryocyte progenitor cells (MKPs) in patients with DPR. Treatment with the hypomethylating agent decitabine reduced methylated CG levels in MKPs and enhanced megakaryocyte production in mice. In addition, we found that DNMT3A negatively regulated megakaryogenesis in megakaryocyte lineages derived from primary HSCs. Transplantation with HSC-overexpressed DNMT3A impeded platelet engraftment following HSCT in mice. We further demonstrated that DNMT3A was directly bound to and methylated ETS1 and RUNX1 during megakaryogenesis. These findings highlight abnormal DNA methylation in DPR and indicate that hypomethylating agents may improve megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation by targeting DNMT3A-mediated methylation.",

We report an intelligent hearing system inspired by the human auditory system: asymmetric well-aligned piezoelectric nanofibers combined with neural networks to mimic natural auditory processes. Piezoelectric nanofibers with spirally varying lengths and directions transmit and convert acoustic sound into mechanoelectrical signals, mimicking the complex cochlear dynamics. These signals are then encoded by digital neural networks, enabling accurate sound direction recognition. This intelligent hearing system surpasses human directional hearing, accurately recognizing sound directions horizontally and vertically. The advancement represents a substantial stride toward next-generation artificial hearing, harmonizing transduction and perception with a nature-inspired design. It promises for applications in hearing aids, wearable devices, and implants, offering enhanced auditory experiences for those with hearing impairments.",

A mathematical analysis of all compositions that have survived from antiquity now allows us to reconstruct the exact tuning and intonation. According to this analysis, ancient musicians preferred pure intonation. However, they had a keen sense of its combinatorial limitations on instruments with strings of fixed length, such as lyres, and they recognized the necessity of slight deviations from pure intonation during vocal performance to allow for more tonal complexity. This spirit is paralleled in ancient atomic philosophy, which posited that atoms sometimes swerved to allow for more combinatorial complexity and unexpected effects.",

We identified several significantly differentially expressed genes, with CCL2 displaying the strongest association with 3-repeat tau pathology and increased burden in PiD compared to those in 4-repeat tau progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) cases. Investigation of co-expressed genes and pathways suggested the involvement of mRNA processing, mitochondrial function, and immune processes in disease pathobiology.

The resulting QD-SNA structures are monodisperse, colloidally stable, and photoluminescent in aqueous solution. The nanoreactors were prepared using two different proteins (~10 and 12 nanometers in diameter), and CdS, CdSe, and PbSe nanocrystals were synthesized. Moreover, the extent of surface defects and crystallinity depends on the relative concentrations of ionic precursors, which control the growth rate and the number of ionic vacancies. By optimizing conditions, CdS-SNAs that exhibit near-zero reabsorption loss were synthesized.

This regulation requires all core components of the ABA signaling pathway. Furthermore, we reveal that ABA-INSENSITIVE 5, a well-conserved transcription factor in the ABA signaling pathway of land plants, plays a pivotal role in PD density regulation, whereas ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 does not. Our findings show that the ABA-induced reduction in primary PD density is mediated by these ABA-responsive factors in P. patens . Considering previous reports on ABA-dependent PD regulation in both moss and angiosperms, we propose that the ABA-mediated control of PD biogenesis and permeability represents a conserved mechanism in land plants, with critical implications for cell-to-cell communication and stress adaptation.",

We identify hedgehog-interacting protein ( HHIP ), associated with both BPD and emphysema, as a critical regulator of alveologenesis. During this process, Hhip -expressing cells expanded, accompanied by hedgehog (Hh) signaling inhibition and myofibroblast transition. Stromal-specific Hhip deletion led to hyperactivation of Hh-IGF1 signaling axis, causing persistent SMA + myofibroblasts and epithelial stem/progenitor cell senescence. Hyperactivation of this pathway was also observed in human BPD and hyperoxia-induced BPD models. Early Hhip deficiency resulted in adult emphysema with myofibroblast accumulation. We developed a therapeutic Fc-fused HHIP protein that mitigated BPD in neonatal mice and prevented adult emphysema. These findings establish HHIP as a critical regulator of alveologenesis and a therapeutic target for BPD and emphysema.",

The RITH phenotypes highly correlated with prognosis and pathological ITH. In addition, through an integrated multi-omics analysis, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying RITH, notably enhancing its biological interpretability. Specifically, high-RITH tumors demonstrated an enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and activation of extracellular matrix remodeling. Our approach facilitates the noninvasive refined classification of ITH using radiomics and multi-omics, paving the way for tailored treatment strategies in HCC.

The Eyes absent (EYA) family of proteins, which are crucial for embryonic development, become dysregulated in cancer, where they have been shown to mediate proliferation, migration, and invasion. Our study reveals an unusual mechanism by which EYA3 reduces the presence of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells in the premetastatic niche (PMN) to enhance metastasis, independent of its effects on the primary tumor. We find that EYA3 up-regulates nuclear factor κB signaling to enhance CCL2 expression, which, in contrast to previous findings, suppresses cytotoxic NK cell activation in vitro and their infiltration into the PMN in vivo. These findings uncover an unexpected role for CCL2 in inhibiting NK cell responses at the PMN and suggest that targeting EYA3 could be an effective strategy to reactivate antitumor immune responses to inhibit metastasis.",

Their strong spin-orbit interaction and broken inversion symmetry lead to the spin-valley locking effect, in which carriers occupying the K and K ′ valleys of the reciprocal space must have opposite spins. This effect is particularly strong for holes due to a larger spin-orbit gap in the valence band. By reducing the dimensionality of a monolayer of WSe 2 to 1D via electrostatic confinement, we demonstrate that spin-valley locking and strong hole-hole interactions lead to a ferromagnetic state where hole transport is spin-valley polarized, even without an applied magnetic field. A massive Dirac fermion model in the Hartree-Fock approximation reveals that many-body hole-exchange interactions lead to this polarized ground-state. This observation opens the possibility of implementing a robust and stable valley-polarized system, essential in valleytronic applications.",

Screening of the synergistic effect of vitamins and peptides on protein synthesis by the spheroids and evaluation of skin toxicity with chemical agents showed a correlation with clinical results or existing standards.

Our study investigates neurotransmitter modulation of ACOD1 expression, a regulator of immunometabolism activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Screening neurotransmitters identifies dopamine as a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced ACOD1 expression in innate immune cells. Mechanistically, DRD2 forms a complex with TLR4, initiating MAPK3-dependent CREB1 phosphorylation and subsequent ACOD1 transcription. Conversely, dopamine disrupts TLR4-MYD88 interaction via DRD2 without affecting the formation of the LPS-induced TLR4-MD2-CD14 complex. Enhanced ACOD1 expression induces CD274/PD-L1 production independently of itaconate, precipitating inflammation-associated immunosuppression in sepsis. Delayed administration of pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, mitigates lethality in bacterial sepsis mouse models. Conversely, the dopamine antagonist aripiprazole exacerbates sepsis mortality. Dysregulation of the dopamine-ACOD1 axis correlates with sepsis severity in patients, indicating a potential therapeutic target for modulating this neuroimmune pathway.",

Despite extensive research, Early Cretaceous cryosphere responses to temperature and atmospheric P CO 2 fluctuations over short, human, timescales remain uncertain. Here, we show rapid late Valanginian (~133 million years ago) seasonal fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST) and δ 18 O mainly driven by atmospheric P CO 2 . Two distinctive features emerge: large seasonal variability of up to 15.9° ± 4.9°C in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, comparable to that found today, a positive sea surface δ 18 O value related to evaporation (expressed as salinity increases), and the existence of polar ice. Model-predicted patterns of SST change match with high statistical confidence those derived from clumped isotopes in well-preserved oyster fossils from Madagascar and display consistent warm/cold seasonality. Given its relative coolness in a Cretaceous context, the late Valanginian is a valuable analog for Earth’s future climate.",

Here, we show that these two options represent two ends of a spectrum. In species with a more “closed” system, rates of H + removal and Ca 2+ uptake are high and exceed the amount of ions required for calcification. This explains the relatively low Mg/Ca of the calcite of this species by dilution of the [Mg 2+ ] in the calcifying fluid. Conversely, in species with a more open system, the H + and Ca 2+ fluxes are lower, with more seawater exchanged between the environment and calcifying fluid, explaining the relatively high Mg/Ca in these foraminifera. In either of these species, mitochondria were found to be located at the site where the Ca 2+ /H + exchange takes place and the mitochondrial density aligned with the rate of pumping. These findings highlight the crucial role of transmembrane transporters and mitochondria in foraminifera calcification and explain the species-specific elemental signatures.",

For some experimental conditions, Hamming codes are efficient in encoding the highest possible number of genes for spatial analysis. However, for most experimental parameters, the optimal generation of error-robust codebooks is an unsolved mathematical problem. Here, we present a method to generate highly optimized extended Hamming codebooks compatible with established error-correctable methodologies such as MERFISH. Our method uses an iterative set-exchange approach and generally reaches over 90% of the theoretical maximum limit of gene set complexity.

The capacity of ASE-based circuits to accept messenger RNAs as inputs enables integration of endogenous cellular information for efficient multi-input information processing, demonstrated by a multi-input molecular classifier monitoring key cell reprogramming events.

Clock interferometry, where particles with an internal clock are coherently split and recombined along two spatial paths, has sparked interest due to its fundamental implications, especially at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here, we demonstrate that a clock interferometer provides metrological improvement compared to its technical noise–limited counterpart using a single internal quantum state. This enhancement around a critical working point can be interpreted as a geometric phase–induced signal-to-noise ratio gain. In our experimental setup, we infer a sensitivity enhancement of 8.8 decibels when measuring a small difference between external fields. We estimate that tens of decibels of sensitivity enhancement could be attained for measurements with a higher atom flux.

Mapping and visualizing the most detrimental TLS in the bath pinpoints the dominant sources of ubiquitous 1/ f dielectric noise and energy relaxation.

Eleven previously reported coelacanth “muscles” are nonexistent, while three previously unknown muscle subdivisions and connections are found. These findings markedly affect our understanding of the deep-time cranial evolution of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). Only 13% of the previously identified myological evolutionary novelties for the major gnathostome lineages proved to be accurate, but several new ones are proposed. We show that low, moderate, and high levels of cranial muscle innovation characterized the emergence of lobe-finned (sarcopterygian), cartilaginous (chondrichthyan), and ray-finned (actinopterygian) fishes, respectively. The novelties in the latter group resulted in the evolution of a second active mechanism for the expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity, which was probably crucial for the predominance of suction feeding versus bite feeding in extant actinopterygians.",

Here, we present a platform to morph closed surfaces with bistability that harnesses a balanced integration of origami and kirigami principles. By harmonizing panel rotation around creases nearly tangent to the closed surface and panel rotation around hinges nearly perpendicular to the closed surface, we show that origami-kirigami assemblages can shape-morph between a cube and a sphere, scale between spheres of dissimilar size, and change topology between a sphere and a torus, with programmed bistability.

We developed a methodological pipeline that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to rigorously quantify astrocyte morphological features and spatial organization across the brain, leveraging expression of cytoskeletal markers. Application of this pipeline reveals that morphological characteristics of individual astrocytes predict their location within the NAc. Our analysis also indicates that after heroin use, astrocyte structural plasticity is impaired in portions of the NAc associated with the extinction of conditioned responses and is uniquely engaged in the dorsomedial portion of the NAc shell, an undercharacterized subdivision of the structure.",

High-throughput sequencing and biochemical analysis showed that most of the selected 1331 RNA sequences required at least one DNA for activity. Representatives for four of six RNA clusters that depended on DNA cofactors were active even when the 256 DNAs were replaced by completely random DNA 20-nucleotide oligomers.

The collapse of this species in the rocky intertidal revealed an unexpected relationship between two keystone predators.

Before the sea star wasting event, the local sea otter population fluctuated around a near equilibrium. However, in the absence of Pisaster , sea otters increased their dietary intake on mussels, which contributed in part to a local population-level rise.

Readily available aryl iodides, alkyl/aryl bromides, and propargyl esters are used as the distinct electrophilic coupling partners, leading to the synthesis of a diverse array of tetrasubstituted allenes. In particular, the challenging asymmetric formal triple XEC has also been realized through palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, which uses the sterically hindered 2,6-disubstituted aryl bromides as the arylating reagents to prepare tetrasubstituted allenes bearing an axially chiral biaryl unit.

Defects in peroxisome metabolic function restrict expansion of the Legionella vacuole membrane and cause rupture of this compartment, inhibiting bacterial replication and leading to bacterial degradation. Similarly, peroxisome dysfunction causes Salmonella replication vacuole destabilization and reduced bacterial burden within host cells. Thus, these two intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit host cell peroxisomes to maintain their replication compartments, establishing a critical role for this organelle in disease.",

          "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and few treatment options. In early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, impaired metabolism and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex strongly predict future cognitive impairments. Therefore, understanding Alzheimer’s disease–related deficits in the retrosplenial cortex is critical for understanding the origins of cognitive impairment and identifying early treatment targets. Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we discovered early, sex-dependent alterations in parvalbumin-interneuron transcriptomic profiles. This corresponded with impaired parvalbumin-interneuron activity, which was sufficient to induce cognitive impairments and dysregulate retrosplenial functional connectivity. In fMRI scans from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, we observed a similar sex-dependent dysregulation of retrosplenial cortex functional connectivity and, in postmortem tissue from subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, a loss of parvalbumin interneurons. Reversal of cognitive deficits by stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the retrosplenial cortex suggests that this may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

          "abstract": "Robots with adaptive morphology can improve interactions with their environment, allowing adaptive functions without complicated control strategies. Inspired by a pufferfish, this paper introduces PufferFace Robot (PFR), a vibration-propelled soft robot with an adaptive design for exploring cavities using simple locomotion strategies. PFR is particularly useful for inspecting centimeter-scale pipeline systems with varying diameters and shapes, which pose substantial challenges. Although recent soft robots using smart materials offer advantages, difficulties remain in handling different pipe sizes, navigating transitions, and managing fluid flow. PFR’s inflatable soft skin is equipped with flexible spikes that create asymmetrical friction under vibrations, propelling the robot forward without feedback control. Its hollow structure allows fluid flow, while a front-mounted camera enhances inspection capabilities. PFR adapts to various pipeline conditions, navigating cavities 1 to 1.5 times its diameter and critical areas such as 90° elbows, T-connectors, and high-curvature sections. In specific scenarios, PFR can generate a propulsive force 20 to 35 times its weight.",

          "abstract": "The redox composition of volcanic gases relays substantial information about magmatic conditions and volcanic activity. Volcanic plume gas measurements are often interpreted assuming that magmatic gases are chemically inert on emission and near-source dilution in air. Conversely, many volcanic plumes contain high levels of bromine monoxide (BrO), which is produced by atmospheric oxidation of magmatic hydrogen bromide (HBr) emissions. We investigate the chemical kinetics of hot magmatic gases mixing with air. Our model reproduces and explains observations of volcanic plume BrO at Mt. Etna, evidencing that reduced gases [HBr, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2 )] can oxidize at the hot magma–air interface. The extent of oxidation is controlled by the magmatic gas temperature. Observations of BrO and H 2 in Mt. Etna plume indicate that magmatic gases enter air at several hundred kelvin below magmatic temperature, consistent with hypothesized decoupling of gas temperatures from magma prior to emission.",

Notably, FL-NI achieved a 117.8% increase in pulmonary drug delivery by noninvasive inhalation and a 71.5% increase in delivery specifically to fibroblast activation protein–positive myofibroblasts while reducing nonspecific immune cell and epithelial uptake by 29.8 and 55.8%, respectively. The accurate inhalation codelivery of nintedanib and siIL11 into myofibroblasts achieved synergistic effects, effectively enhanced myofibroblast deactivation, reduced pathological collagen deposition by 50.8%, and promoted epithelial tissue repair.

Using this plastic-based PET, we determined the distribution of the relative angle between polarization planes of photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and parapositronium annihilations are maximally entangled. Our result indicates that the degree of entanglement depends on the annihilation mechanism in matter, opening avenues for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a diagnostic indicator.",

Here, we present a groundbreaking approach leveraging digital optical frequency comb–enabled stimulated Brillouin scattering to achieve instantaneous microwave frequency and amplitude detection, attaining a record-breaking 50.8-gigahertz bandwidth, a 1.1-megahertz accuracy, and a 500-nanosecond temporal resolution, which is three orders of magnitude improvement over that obtained with frequency sweeping schemes. In addition to conventional frequency detection, the proposed technique enables simultaneous multifrequency microwave amplitude measurement and achieves a substantial performance enhancement in the figure of merit of more than 10-fold, which paves the way for dynamic microwave signal detection and analysis.",

Herein, we develop a scalable polymer-involved biomimetic assembly that responds to intracerebral reactive oxygen species (ROS) for elastic spreading and concentration-dependent drug therapy. Structurally, a polymer of thermally sensitive deformation is selected for hydrophobic loading of curcumin (Cur) and coordinative grafting onto ultrasmall ceria (CeO 2 ) by elastic compression at transition temperature, which is further sealed by self-polymerized dopamine with apolipoprotein decoration to improve intracerebral shuttling. When triggered by ROS in the lesions, burst exposure of Cur and polymer-linked CeO 2 (PCeO 2 ) is achieved. The concentrated Cur switches amyloid-β (Aβ)–activated microglia into normal for mobilizing phagocytosis, and CeO 2 has sustainable antioxidant capacity to prevent microglial mitochondrial damage after phagocytosis of PCeO 2 -captured Aβ. After administration, our findings reveal microglia-mediated Aβ clearance, neuroprotection, and ROS elimination in AD mice.
