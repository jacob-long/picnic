Here we demonstrate an experimental architecture for high-rate reloading and continuous operation of a large-scale atom array system while realizing coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information. Our approach utilizes a series of two optical lattice conveyor belts to transport atom reservoirs into the science region, where atoms are repeatedly extracted into optical tweezers without affecting the coherence of qubits stored nearby. Using a reloading rate of 300,000 atoms in tweezers per second, we create over 30,000 initialized qubits per second, which we leverage to assemble and maintain an array of over 3,000 atoms for more than two hours. Furthermore, we demonstrate persistent refilling of the array with atomic qubits in either a spin-polarized or a coherent superposition state while preserving the quantum state of stored qubits. Our results pave the way for realization of large-scale continuously operated atomic clocks, sensors, and fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

          "abstract": "Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2.",

          "title": "Equity in science is a beautiful lie — and I’m done pretending",
          "authors": "Dolors Armenteras",
          "abstract": "For years, I thought equity in science was possible. I believed it in meeting rooms to which I had been invited to speak, until I realized that I had not been invited to shape the discussion. I believed it in working groups that applauded diversity, until I noticed that my ideas only landed when echoed by someone else. And international organizations regularly sought me out, but it was hardly ever for a leadership role.\n\nAcademia needs a more honest, scientific approach to DEI\n\nIn 2021, I proposed ways to build healthier collaborations between countries with unequal resources: currently they benefit mainly the wealthier partner (D. Armenteras Nature Ecol. Evol. 5, 1193–1194; 2021). The article resonated with scientists across Latin America, Africa and Asia, who thanked me for exposing these skewed partnerships. But what also stood out to me was that none of the committees and organizations that had so often solicited my input got in touch.\n\nMany scholars from historically overexploited countries (often referred to as the global south) expected that exposing the problem would trigger change. Four years on, I see it clearly: the scientific system was never designed for equity. For people whose privilege stems from geography, institutional reputation and inherited networks, the system works perfectly the way it is. That’s why institutions focus only on improved access and optics. They look like they are changing, but the same people retain control.\n\nI still believe in science and in justice. But I no longer think that power can be shared equitably in the current system. In 2023, I was invited to contribute to a global map charting the use of controlled fire in ecosystem management. This meant condensing 25 years of research into a 40-minute questionnaire for a chance to win an artwork made by an Indigenous artisan and, perhaps, be invited to a workshop. It was written in Spanish and framed as inclusive. But it exposed how the system works: extract specialist knowledge at low cost and mostly without giving credit, repackage it into global claims and call it collaboration. I declined.\n\nDecolonize scientific institutions, don’t just diversify them\n\nIn 2025, I was invited to contribute to a project developing a global standard for gathering fire data. It used all the right words: co-production, inclusion and diversity. It cited my work. But I wasn’t being invited to co-design or co-lead the project, or even as a peer — only to “contribute regional input”. Time commitment: less than 20 hours. Visibility: none. Influence: symbolic. When I declined, explaining my reasons, I received two replies. One was defensive: “You know I’d never reach out with a symbolic request,” sidestepping my actual concerns. The other was polite, affirming the project’s importance but failing to address its asymmetry. Neither academic offered co-authorship or fresh terms. Nothing changed. These weren’t bad people. That’s the hardest part. They were playing by the rules of a system that rewards extractive collaboration — especially when it’s wrapped in the language of equity.\n\nThe system doesn’t thrive just because of the people at the top. It holds strong because many scientists in less-privileged positions want to be included. Sometimes we are chosen — not for our ideas or our leadership, but because we tick the right box. A woman from Latin America, visible and qualified. But we don’t become a peer. Our work is not cited as often. Our students become local guides instead of co-authors. Grants continue to be written without us.",

          "abstract": "Numerous dinosaur eggs have been found in Shiyan, China, but their age has been unknown until now.Credit: Dr. Bi Zhao\n\nScientists in China have calculated the direct age of a fossilized dinosaur egg1 for the first time. The newly dated egg, from a cluster of 28 found in a nesting area in Shiyan, China, is around 85.9 million years old, according to a study published in Frontiers in Earth Science today.\n\nWorking out how old fossilized eggs are typically involves indirectly dating the volcanic ash or rock layers in which the specimens are embedded. But indirect methods can be inaccurate, because the material might not have formed at the same time as when the eggs were laid.\n\nTo determine the age of an egg directly, the researchers fired lasers at eggshell fragments to vaporize the minerals deposited on the surface during fossilization. The resulting vapour contained lead and uranium atoms. Uranium naturally decays into lead. Because the decay happens at a consistent rate, studying the composition of decaying uranium atoms (or isotopes) and stable lead atoms trapped in geological material, such as the dinosaur eggs, reveals the fossil’s age.\n\n“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that in situ isotopic ages have been reported for dinosaur eggshells both in China and, very likely, worldwide,” says study co-author Xing Cheng, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Science in Xi’an. The method has previously been used to estimate the ages of fossilized bones and teeth2, as well as those of rocks and minerals3.\n\nGuntupalli Prasad, a palaeontologist at the University of Delhi in New Delhi, says that the direct dating method will have wide ramifications for palaeontology. “This will remove the uncertainties associated with the ages of many fossils,” he says.\n\nBut Susannah Maidment, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, says that the study did not account for the processes that occur between the egg’s burial and fossilization. One such process, called diagenesis, could change the original composition of the studied materials. “Any attempt to direct date fossils must demonstrate that the mineralogy has not been altered by diagenetic processes, as this would result in an incorrect age estimation,” she says.\n\nThe authors say previous research has revealed little to no volcanic activity that would disturb eggs in the area, and the eggshells sampled were well preserved with no shell deformation, which suggests negligible alteration after they were laid. However, they said they intend to conduct further studies to verify their results.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Material deep inside Earth — thousands of kilometres down, near the planet’s core — has undergone a mysterious shift.\n\nIs Earth’s core leaking? Volcanic rocks provide strongest evidence yet\n\nAlthough the change occurred nearly two decades ago, between 2006 and 2008, scientists discovered it only recently, while analysing data from a pair of satellites that once measured variations in Earth’s gravity. The team thinks it might have happened when the structure of some of the rocks near the boundary between Earth’s core and mantle transformed, becoming denser.\n\nThe discovery — which was possible because the geological shift altered the planet’s gravitational field — is an astonishing testament to Earth-orbiting satellites. “It’s a really new observation,” says Isabelle Panet, a geophysicist at Paris City University. Panet, lead author Charlotte Gaugne Gouranton — also at that university — and their colleagues reported the findings last month in Geophysical Research Letters1.\n\nThe work will help scientists to better understand the connections between Earth’s various layers, from its brittle crust to its solid mantle to its partially liquid core, Panet says. Connections between these layers affect where large earthquakes originate, how the planet maintains a magnetic field that protects it from solar storms and more.\n\nFollow the leader\n\nPanet’s team made the discovery using data from a pair of US–German satellites known as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which orbited Earth between 2002 and 2017. The satellites flew one in front of the other, separated by a set distance.\n\nStrange blobs in Earth’s mantle are relics of a massive collision\n\nWhen they encountered a gravitational tug from, for example, the hulking mass of a mountain range, the lead satellite would pull temporarily away from the trailing satellite — a change that could be measured and correlated with the gravitational shift. Researchers have most often used changes in the distance between the GRACE satellites to measure the displacement of masses of water on Earth, such as when groundwater disappears beneath croplands or when glaciers melt.\n\nBut, as it turns out, GRACE was also able to spot much deeper changes in Earth’s mass. Panet had already used it to look for mass changes happening hundreds of kilometres below the surface ahead of large earthquakes2,3. Then she realized she could probe even farther down, to a depth of nearly 2,900 kilometres, to the complex boundary between the core and mantle.\n\nPanet and her colleagues spotted a strange signal in the GRACE data that peaked around 2007 and was centred off Africa’s Atlantic coast. They were unable to attribute it to water shifting around on Earth’s surface, however. “So at least partially, there has to be an origin within the solid Earth,” Panet says. “It has to come from very deep.”\n\nIn the deep",

          "abstract": "A child receives a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine earlier this year in Lubbock, Texas.Credit: Jan Sonnenmair/Getty\n\nUpdate: After this story was published, an updated draft agenda for the ACIP meeting was posted. According to the schedule, the committee will no longer consider the RSV vaccine, but it will vote on the three other shots described in this story: COVID-19, hepatitis B and MMRV.\n\nNext week, the panel of top advisers who recommend how vaccines are used in the United States will meet to review jabs that protect against COVID-19, hepatitis B and other diseases. The meeting — the committee’s second since US health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr abruptly fired all of its previous 17 members and welcomed 7 new ones — has raised eyebrows among public-health specialists, given that the safety and efficacy of some of the vaccines on the agenda have been well established for years.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\n“I’m very concerned, given the signalling from the members of this newly reconstituted, hand-picked [committee] that they are going to select targets for further restriction,” says Andrew Pavia, a physician with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association based in Arlington, Virginia. At their last meeting, the advisers — several of whom have publicly expressed anti-vaccine views — voted to end the use of the preservative thimerosal in influenza vaccines, despite evidence that it is safe at the doses found in jabs.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will vote on at next week’s meeting, to be held on 18 and 19 September, because the agenda lacks detail, increasing researchers’ concern. “It’s very unusual for ACIP to put things on the agenda with only a month’s notice and not discuss who’s going to be presenting data, what data is going to be looked at, and what, if any, questions might come up for a vote,” Pavia says.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services, which is run by Kennedy and has authority over the ACIP, did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nNature spoke to public-health specialists about the vaccines up for discussion, what the committee might vote on and the data it should be considering.\n\nScrutiny for COVID-19 jabs\n\nLast month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved updated COVID-19 vaccines, but it imposed limitations on who can get the shots. Whereas the vaccines were previously authorized for all people aged 6 months and older in the United States, now they are approved only for those older than 65 years, as well as people with health conditions that put them at high risk of severe disease.\n\nRFK Jr demanded a vaccine study be retracted — the journal said no\n\nThe FDA is responsible for authorizing new vaccines, whereas the ACIP, overseen by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), advises on who should receive them. These recommendations, which are typically adopted by the CDC as official policy, help to inform which vaccines are covered by health insurance.\n\n“I assume ACIP could end up mirroring what the FDA has recommended” for COVID-19 shots, says Adam Ratner, a paediatrician at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), an organization based in Itasca, Illinois.\n\nIn a statement following the FDA’s decision on 27 August, AAP president Susan Kressly called the move “deeply troubling”, especially for children, whose safety Kennedy has focused on when questioning vaccines. The previous week, the AAP issued its own recommendation that all children 6 months and older should be vaccinated and, in particular, kids aged 6–23 months old who are at high risk of severe COVID-19.\n\nAccording to data from the 2022–23 cold and flu season, mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines were between 46% and 70% effective at preventing COVID-19-related emergencies for children aged 6 months up to 5 years during a 2-month window after the second or third dose. (Flu vaccines, which are also updated seasonally, are typically 40–60% effective.) And such shots elicited no safety concerns in that same age group.\n\nHowever, The Washington Post is reporting that Trump health officials might link COVID-19 vaccines with 25 paediatric deaths reported to a vaccine safety database at next week’s meeting. Anyone can submit reports to the database, but claims must be investigated to confirm a link.\n\nHepatitis B shots no longer for newborns?\n\nAnti-vaccine advocates have been questioning whether a hepatitis B vaccine should be given to newborns — the current practice in the United States. Instead, they are suggesting that jabs be administered only to people with certain high-risk behaviours, including unprotected sex and drug use, Pavia says. That’s a problem, he adds, because “the majority of hepatitis B worldwide is transmitted from mother to infant”.\n\nHepatitis B is a liver disease caused by a virus that spreads through contact with infected blood and other body fluids. According to the AAP, babies infected with hepatitis B in their first year of life have a 90% chance of developing chronic disease, and one-quarter of those with chronic hepatitis B die from it.\n\nSource: CDC/National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System\n\nSince the United States began recommending hepatitis B vaccines for infants in the 1990s, cases have dropped significantly (see ‘Generational decline in hepatitis B’). Administering “earlier is always better with an incurable virus”, says Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco.",

          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "Some researchers are developing biological systems that create mirror-image versions of DNA and other molecules crucial to life.Credit: Ting Zhu Lab\n\nThis week in Manchester, UK, scientists will be deliberating whether to restrict research that could eventually enable ‘mirror life’ — synthetic cells built from molecules that are mirror images of those found in the natural world.\n\nMirror-image molecules separated using workhorse of chemistry\n\nOver the past year, many scientists have voiced concerns over experiments that might lead to the creation of such cells, suggesting that they would pose an enormous risk to human health and the environment. “Pretty much everybody agrees” that mirror-image cells would be “a bad thing”, says John Glass, a synthetic biologist at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California.\n\nBut there are disagreements about where to draw lines to limit research on mirror-image biology, given the potential benefits of such studies.\n\nMany of the molecules in our bodies are ‘chiral’ — that is, they take one of two mirror-image forms, like right-handed and left-handed gloves. Proteins are built from left-handed amino acids, and DNA twists like a right-handed screw, for example.\n\nStudying mirror-image versions of such molecules could help to unpick how this handedness emerged, some researchers say. And because the body’s enzymes and immune system might not as readily recognize right-handed amino acids or left-handed DNA, such molecules could resist degradation — making them useful as therapeutic drugs. This approach has already shown clinical success: in 2017, for example, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a small peptide containing mirror-image amino acids, called etelcalcetide, to treat people with chronic kidney disease.\n\nRare ‘ambidextrous’ protein breaks rules of handedness\n\nBut this ability to evade degradation could be a double-edged sword. If an entire mirror-image cell were ever made, it might proliferate uncontrollably in the body or spread unchecked through the environment, some researchers say.\n\nThis is why scientists are meeting in Manchester this week.\n\nBiochemist Sven Klussmann, founder and chief executive of Aptarion Biotech in Berlin, which is developing short strands of therapeutic mirror-image RNA, agrees that it’s reasonable to consider the potential risks of mirror life. “But we should not panic yet, and we should not restrict research too early,” he says.\n\nYet Kate Adamala, a synthetic biologist at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, cautions that the risks of research that could enable mirror life would outweigh any potential benefits. “There is no benefit of mirror biology that couldn’t be achieved other ways with normal biology,” she says. “That’s not a risk I think we should be taking.”\n\nRed lines\n\nGlass says that several teams, including his own, are close to, for the first time, creating a synthetic cell from molecules with the chirality seen in nature. But nobody is currently building a mirror-image cell, and it could take decades to do so, if it’s even possible at all. Still, researchers are making progress on technologies that could underpin that work; and in 2019, before the potential risks were realized, the US National Science Foundation awarded research grants to ‘boot up’ a mirror cell. Adamala, one of the grant recipients, says her growing concerns convinced her and her colleagues to drop the work.\n\nMirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA\n\nGlass and Adamala were among 38 scientists who laid out their worries in Science in December 20241. Since then, the non-profit Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund has sponsored a series of meetings to develop recommendations to avert the threat mirror life could pose. In June, researchers who gathered in Paris called on funders not to support work on a mirror-image cell, and suggested restricting areas of research that could facilitate mirror life. In Manchester this week — and at a US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine meeting at the end of this month — researchers will pick up the conversation and deliberate over where to draw those red lines.",

          "abstract": "A time crystal as seen under a microscope.Credit: Zhao & Smalyukh, 2025, Nature Materials\n\nA time crystal is a form of matter that shows continuous, repeating patterns over time, much like how atoms in a normal crystal repeat in space. Examples once existed in only complex, quantum matter, but now physicists have found a way to make a time crystal that can be seen, under certain conditions, with the naked eye.\n\nThe feat, accomplished by physicists at the University of Colorado Boulder, and published in Nature Materials on 4 September1, involved liquid crystals — bar-shaped molecules with properties between those of a liquid and those of a solid. Simply by shining a light on the liquid crystals, the team created ripples of twisting molecules through them. The ripples kept moving for hours, undulating with a distinct beat, even when the researchers changed the conditions. The rhythm was also out of sync with any incoming force — fulfilling the two defining criteria for a time crystal.\n\nAlthough some of this behaviour of liquid crystals was already known, no one had previously considered whether it could be harnessed to make a time crystal, says Young-Ki Kim, a materials scientist at the Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea.\n\nThe macroscopic scale of the time crystal — at millimetres to centimetres across — creates opportunities “to provide deeper understanding” of the phenomena, he says. The distinctive patterns in the crystals could also allow them to be used in anti-counterfeit devices, say the authors.\n\nImpossible machines\n\nNobel-prizewinning physicist Frank Wilczek first proposed the idea of a time crystal in 2012. Wilczek’s version was almost like a perpetual-motion machine; something that cycled endlessly while in its natural resting state. A team later published a paper that mathematically proved this concept was impossible2, but researchers soon found that other kinds of time crystal were possible. Ordered time crystals could exist, for example, in bizarre systems that were perpetually in flux, rather than at rest.\n\nTime crystals have since been made in a variety of ways, using interacting nanoscale defects in diamonds, trapped ions and simulated on Google’s Sycamore quantum computer. But most examples have been at the microscopic scale.\n\nThe latest system involves shining a light, even that from a normal light bulb, on a liquid-crystal film trapped between two glass plates. When the light hits photosensitive dye molecules on the glass plates, they switch their orientation, which triggers molecules in the liquid crystal to begin twisting.\n\nIntermolecular forces between rod-like liquid crystal molecules mean that they usually all point in the same direction. If some begin twisting, this sets off a domino effect: the molecules reorient themselves in a complex interaction that moves across the sample like a Mexican wave.\n\nFrom this soup of molecules arise stable twisted formations that behave like particles. These particles interact with each other to create observable ripples. “We were surprised and excited to see that such time-crystalline order can be readily observed in soft matter systems,” says Ivan Smalyukh, a physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder, who led the work.\n\nTo observe the molecular dance in detail, the authors looked at the time-crystal system using a kind of microscope that transmits only polarized light. The amount of light that passes through depends on a molecule’s alignment, revealing the time crystal’s ripples as a series of dark and bright stripes.",

          "abstract": "A Noble Madness: The Dark Side of Collecting from Antiquity to Now James Delbourgo Riverrun (2025)\n\nThe Galileo Museum, a science museum in Florence, Italy, has astronomer Galileo Galilei’s preserved middle finger on display. Encased in a gilded glass egg, the digit is exhibited “as if it were the relic of a Christian saint”, remarks historian of science James Delbourgo in his illuminating and entertaining history of the ‘dark side’ of humanity’s obsession with collecting things. The finger was severed from Galileo’s corpse in 1737 — long after his death in 1642 — along with an index finger also displayed at the museum and a vertebra held at the University of Padua, Italy. According to a witness to the dismemberment, the Italian nobleman who took the fingers desired them “because Galileo wrote so many beautiful things with them”.\n\nHow a self-taught biologist transformed nature writing — and inspired Darwin\n\nIt is an unusual story, but perhaps not entirely atypical. As Delbourgo shows in A Noble Madness, a large driver of the desire to collect artefacts is curiosity — whether scientific, historical, religious or otherwise. But perhaps even more often, it is obsession. Delbourgo focuses on this compulsive aspect, and the varying ways in which society has regarded people who are driven to amass stuff. He offers “a grand portrait gallery that charts the changing image of the collector from the ancient looter and medieval idolater to the decadent of the fin de siècle and the modern-day hoarder”.\n\nDark desires\n\nA compelling example of such obsession is Henry Wellcome. He is known today through the biomedical research-funding organization Wellcome, and the Wellcome Collection museum and library in London. Born in 1853 to an itinerant missionary father in a log cabin in Wisconsin, by his death in 1936, Wellcome had become a highly successful pharmaceutical entrepreneur in the United Kingdom. He also owned a grotesquely overwhelming collection of objects, the variety and sheer number of which the world had never seen — mainly because few were on display.\n\n‘Natural history museums can save the world’: anti-colonialism, conservation and climate change\n\nWellcome obtained many of these objects through highly dubious means, notes Frances Larson in her disturbing 2009 history of his collection, An Infinity of Things. In 1912, for example, Wellcome’s right-hand man wrote to an agent in India, a doctor, that the country must be “completely ransacked as far as we possibly can for literature and other objects of interest connected with ancient medicine”. The agent duly did his best — but there is little evidence that Wellcome ever studied or ‘enjoyed’ what had been collected. He was always too busy acquiring new things, right up to his death. His obsession was rooted in possession.\n\nThe Wellcome Museum deliberately avoids displaying information about its founder, notes Delbourgo. He regards this stance as “myopic: the Wellcome’s abdication of its duty to educate visitors about its origins denies the public the chance to make up its own mind about its past”.\n\nThe British Museum, just down the road in London, is less coy about the man who provided its founding collection in 1753. Physician and naturalist Hans Sloane — the subject of Delbourgo’s 2017 book Collecting the World — was an avid collector of curiosities and animal and plant specimens. His motivations were multifarious. He collected manuscripts from astrologers and alchemists to document their ascientific convictions as “disorders of the mind”, delusions that he felt might be cured by bloodletting, his specialism. But when it came to collecting from the natural world, he was explicit about a financial incentive: to “figure out what species were good for, what they cost, and how to make money off them”, in Delbourgo’s words. To his critics, Sloane was an “ignorant arriviste”. Today, his financial links to the slave plantations in Jamaica that part-funded his collecting are openly acknowledged in an exhibit showing a bust of Sloane.\n\nGalileo’s elegantly preserved middle finger.Credit: Eric Vandeville/Gamma-Rapho/Getty",

          "abstract": "‘God’s influencer’ Carlo Acutis was canonized on 7 September by Pope Leo XIV. Acutis was known for his use of digital media to promote Catholic devotion.Credit: Vatican Pool/Getty\n\nThe canonization of Carlo Acutis by Pope Leo XIV on 7 September was a sign of how the Catholic Church is increasingly embracing the digital world.\n\nAcutis, who died of leukaemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was known for using the Internet to further his faith, maintaining a website documenting Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church. It earned him the moniker God’s influencer.\n\nBut the work of a saintly teenage tech-wizard is just one way that new technologies are finding their way into religious practice: artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and ritual-performing robots are already taking on spiritual roles that are conventionally filled by humans. Worshippers have mixed feelings about them.\n\nAI Jesus\n\nThe rise of generative AI chatbots has led to the creation of tools that purport to offer people the opportunity to speak directly with religious figures, such as Jesus Christ. Anné Verhoef, a philosopher at North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa, analysed five popular Jesus chatbots by asking them questions about themselves and basic theology, and found some worrying trends.\n\nNone of the chatbots he studied were developed or endorsed by any church, and it is not clear what religious texts they were trained on. Four of the five were created and managed by private companies — with names such as Catloaf Software, a mobile-development company in Los Angeles, California — whereas the fifth is run by a Christian group in South Korea with no official connection to any church. All are free but supported by advertisements, with one offering an ad-free premium subscription.\n\n“It’s difficult to know if they are really about religion, or just milking money from the faithful,” says Verhoef.\n\nAnother concern is that most religious AI bots claim to be Jesus rather than an AI impersonation developed by humans. “If this is really about Christianity and being sincere about faith, they should not be pretending to be God,” he says. “The possibility for abuse is huge” — if people believe a chatbot is actually divine, they might be convinced to follow its instructions for nefarious purposes, Verhoef says.\n\nJesus chatbots are growing in popularity and have hundreds of thousands of users, Verhoef estimates. The AI technology is also being used in more official capacities. Last year, as part of an experiment with a local university, a Catholic church in Lucerne, Switzerland, installed a Jesus chatbot in its confessional booth that could answer theological questions and offer spiritual guidance. In 2023, hundreds of Lutherans in Nuremberg, Germany, attended a church service generated and delivered by chatbot ChatGPT. Both were reasonably well-received, says Verhoef. Many of the functions of a priest could be replaced by AI chatbots in the future, but he sees a problem with it.\n\n“If a sermon is prepared by an AI not a person, how seriously can we take that as a spiritually inspired sermon or thought?” asks Verhoef.\n\nReligious acceptance\n\nChristianity isn’t the only religion using generative AI tools. There are also Buddhist, Hindu, Jewish and Islamic chatbots, but some religions are more open to adopting new technologies than are others, and for different uses. Hinduism and Buddhism, for example, already incorporate some simple forms of automation in their rituals. Some temples in India have begun using robotic arms to perform the Hindu aarti ritual, in which a devotee offers an oil lamp to the deity to symbolize the removal of darkness, and one temple in Kerala has an AI-driven animatronic elephant.",

          "abstract": "Thousands of paper documents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s meteorological archives are now being digitized.Credit: Derrick Muheki/INERA DRC\n\nHow can countries find out how climate change will affect them at a regional scale? Can artificial intelligence (AI) help to forecast hurricanes and other extreme weather events? And has the world already blown past the most ambitious target of the Paris climate agreement — to limit global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels?\n\nThe need to address these and other questions is spurring researchers to tap into vast, unused repositories of handwritten weather records that span more than two centuries. These troves of valuable — but in some cases unreadable — data are now becoming easier to access with new, more sophisticated machine-learning tools.\n\n“All meteorological services around the world have some basement where they store data from the 1800s that has not been digitized,” says Marlies van der Schee, a climate scientist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt. “For many institutes, they don’t even know what is in their archives.”\n\nSearching for data\n\nIn the quest to gather missing climate data, climate scientist Derrick Muheki has travelled farther than most. To access the meteorological archives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) — which contain records from when the DRC became independent in 1960 collected from 37 weather stations across the country — Muheki had to fly from Kinshasa to Kisangani in the country’s north, travel along the Congo River by boat and then take an unpaved road on a motorcycle to reach the Yangambi branch of the DRC’s National Institute for Agronomic Research (INERA). There, he spent two months earlier this year scanning thousands of pages of weather logs.\n\nMuheki had to bring enough batteries to power his digital camera for the duration of the trip, as the remote branch of INERA is not hooked up to the DRC’s national grid. He learnt some of the Bantu language Lingala so that he could communicate with other INERA staff members. He says it helped that many of the words were similar to the language he grew up speaking in his native Uganda.\n\nWeather reports from old ships’ logs — such as this eighteenth century document from British vessel HMS Dolphin — contain data that can be fed into climate models. Credit: The History Collection via Alamy\n\nAfter returning to his research group at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, Muheki began to extract data from the more than 9,000 scanned images using a machine-learning tool he designed for reading the weather logs, called MeteoSaver1.\n\nIn initial tests, MeteoSaver could only transcribe the data with 75% accuracy, but further refinements and training of its neural network — on the basis of an open-source package for handwritten-text recognition called Tesseract — have pushed that to 90%, he says.\n\nThe resulting data will provide crucial information about how conditions have changed over time in the world’s second largest rainforest. Climate scientist Wim Thiery, Muheki’s adviser at the Vrije Universiteit, says that because of a lack of information about past temperatures, the forested heart of the African continent had a major data gap in the 2021 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assessed the severity and speed of global warming in various parts of the world. He hopes that efforts such as Muheki’s will help to rectify this.\n\nForgotten figures\n\nMuheki’s logistical hurdles were unusual, but the DRC is not the only country that is yet to fully digitize its weather records.\n\n“There are paper records still languishing in archives all over the world,” says Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK. These include millions of unused rainfall observations in the UK’s National Meteorological Archive.\n\nIs it too late to keep global warming below 1.5 °C? The challenge in 7 charts\n\nHawkins has managed several projects that relied on citizen scientists to manually transcribe climate records. Ten years ago or so, machine-learning tools just weren’t up to the task, he says. The hardest part for AI tools is not reading handwritten text, but recognizing the tabular structure in the documents. “When I and colleagues started trying [AI] tools out, they just would not work on tabulated numbers,” says Hawkins. “It wasn’t in their training.” Much of Muheki’s work consisted of developing custom algorithms for doing just that. Now, the tools are finally becoming good enough to match human performance, says Hawkins, who is a co-author on the research paper that describes MeteoSaver.\n\nSimilar efforts by other teams are showing that machine learning could drastically speed up the rate of recovery of historic records. “It’s really a revolution in our ability to rescue data,” says Thiery.",

Such plants tend to emit large amounts of greenhouse gases.Credit: Getty\n\nFaced with a lawsuit, the administration of US President Donald Trump has disbanded a panel of five well-known critics of climate science who issued a controversial draft report questioning the evidence underlying global warming. US energy secretary Chris Wright asserted that the group had accomplished its goal in publishing the first draft, which the Department of Energy (DoE) has declined to withdraw. Two of the panel’s members told Nature they plan to continue the work independently.\n\nThe dissolution of the panel could undermine the draft report as well as its potential use in regulatory decisions. In particular, the document serves as the scientific basis of the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal a landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. A repeal of the finding would prevent the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating greenhouse gases, now and potentially into the future.\n\n“The optics are bad,” says Adam Orford, a legal scholar at Fordham University in New York City. “If you are going to base climate policy on something, shouldn’t it be a little bit more credible than a draft report from a committee that was disbanded?”\n\nContentious findings\n\nThe draft report, which was released in July, concluded that global warming is “less damaging economically than commonly believed”. Climate scientists say that it amplifies minor uncertainties about climate change and downplays the harms. It was written by a working group comprising five academic researchers who have a history of disagreeing with consensus opinions on climate science. Before the group was disbanded, the DoE had tasked it with responding to public comments on the draft and then producing a final version of the report.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nWright’s decision to disband the group, first reported by Politico, arrives in the middle of a lawsuit by advocacy groups over how the climate panel was appointed and managed. The lawsuit hinges on whether the DoE followed mandates laid out under the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires agencies to ensure that advisory panels represent a diversity of viewpoints. The suit argues that the DoE handpicked its panel to represent a specific viewpoint, which centres on opposition to mainstream climate science. The lawsuit also argues that the DoE violated other FACA requirements, including one requiring that such panels announce their meetings publicly.\n\nThe DoE has requested that the case be dismissed now that the working group has been disbanded, but advocacy groups are pushing for a formal ruling on the legality of the panel. A federal judge declined today to rule on the case; arguments are expected to resume later this month.\n\nThe DoE did not immediately respond to allegations that it acted illegally in appointing and managing the climate panel. It also declined to specify whether it intends to issue a final report that includes responses to public comments.\n\nThe draft report achieved its purpose, “namely to catalyze broader discussion about the certainties and uncertainties of current climate science”, a DoE spokesperson said in a statement to Nature. “We will continue to engage in the debate in favor of a more science-based and less ideological conversation around climate science.”\n\nOutside the mainstream\n\n“The DoE report has turned into a true mess,” says Andrew Dessler, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University in College Station, who helped to coordinate a 450-plus-page response from dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad.",

But on 5 September, a European supercomputer called JUPITER officially reached the exascale threshold, a milestone in computing power. The device could boost European research.\n\nJUPITER is the fourth-fastest computer in the world. Having surpassed one quintillion (1018) operations a second, it joins an exclusive league of exascale supercomputers. According to the European Union, it is also 100% powered by renewable energy, and ranks first in energy efficiency among supercomputers.\n\nJUPITER’s computational speed serves its main purpose — to push the capabilities of research in areas such as AI, weather modelling, astrophysics and biomedical research. It gives researchers in Europe access to their own top-level supercomputer, rather than having to rely on machines in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nThe milestone is “absolutely” a big deal for Europe, says Kirk Cameron, a computer scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, particularly with regard to AI and large language models (LLMs). “There’s this race going on in the world of who will be the innovators in AI,” he says. “It’s taken a little bit to get [Europe] into the race. So it’s really nice to see them making that progress.”\n\nNature examines what JUPITER can actually do, and what it will be used for.\n\nWhat is JUPITER?\n\nJUPITER, which stands for Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research, has been in development since 2018, with the explicit aim of giving Europe a foothold in the supercomputer race taking place around the world. Funded by the European Commission and EU member Germany, it is located at the Jülich science research centre in Germany.\n\nJUPITER booted up and performed its first computations in July, says Thomas Lippert, the project lead on JUPITER at Jülich. Running on some 24,000 NVIDIA chips, JUPITER is capable of exceeding 1,000 petaflops — one exaflop, or one million trillion operations per second — at its peak performance. For comparison, a typical laptop operates at one teraflop, or one trillion calculations per second.\n\nA day in the life of the world’s fastest supercomputer\n\nOfficially, JUPITER is the fourth-fastest supercomputer in the world, with a benchmark performance of about 800 petaflops, after the United States’ El Capitan (1.7 exaflops), Frontier (1.35 exaflops) and Aurora (1 exaflop).\n\nLippert says that having a supercomputer such as JUPITER will enable Europe to develop the talent necessary to build and operate such machines in the future. “Our economy and welfare depend on these technologies,” he says.\n\nThe EU says that JUPITER “runs entirely on renewable energy” to limit its impact on the environment. Lippert says that this is achieved by paying to use only renewable energy from Germany’s national grid.\n\nWhen it is running at full load, JUPITER will use 17 megawatts of power, which is equivalent to powering about 11,000 homes. Cameron says such supercomputers can be extremely power-hungry and cause problems. “You’re competing with cities for power,” he says. “These things start to impact the infrastructure of communities around these areas.”\n\nHow will JUPITER help European research?\n\nResearchers will be able to apply to use the supercomputer up to twice a year, and 30 projects have already been selected. These include research on AI applications, such as foundation models and video generation, climate models, particle physics, energy applications and biomedical research for drug development and disease control.",

Typically founded by scholars at the beginning of their independent research careers, Young Academies give a voice to and represent the interests of young scientists in academia, helping them to be heard by national governments and wider society. There are now more than 60 Young Academies (and similar networks) worldwide.\n\nBut in 2023, a different kind of Young Academy launched in Denmark. YATSI, the Young Academy of Technology, Science and Innovation, aims to give a voice to early-career researchers and professionals in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), with representatives from both academia and industry, and also to strengthen collaboration between the two sectors.\n\nYATSI’s three founders (Sandra Wingaard Thrane, Janus Juul Eriksen Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel and Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen) felt there was a need for a Young Academy that focused exclusively on STEM. Thrane co-founded Bactolife, a biotechnology start-up in Copenhagen, in 2017 and is now its chief scientific officer. Eriksen is a chemistry researcher at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Kongens Lyngby. Laustsen-Kiel leads the Center for Antibody Technologies at DTU, and is also the co-founder of eight companies. Jensen is a researcher in nanomaterials at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nCareers advice from scientists in industry\n\nYATSI now has four physical meetings a year and several ad hoc meetings across its three committees. Meetings are hosted by universities and companies, and cover topics that range from career development to STEM education and policy. Fellows are selected on the basis of written applications and in-person interviews. To be eligible, applicants must have completed a PhD (or equivalent) within the past seven years. Membership lasts for five years, and the academy is governed by a five-member council.\n\nWe hope to reach a full capacity of around 40 members by 2027 (the number is capped to optimize communication, networking and teamwork, but also to be representative of early-career STEM professionals in Denmark).\n\nOur current fellows come from six universities and nine companies or start-ups across Denmark, and have a variety of STEM backgrounds. Their specialisms encompass physics, chemistry, engineering, food, biology, information technology, cybersecurity and many more fields. There is a balanced and diverse mix of industry and academic profiles, with both Danish people and researchers from other countries who are working in Denmark. For this reason, the lingua franca of YATSI is English. Speaking as a French researcher based in Denmark, joining YATSI is a great opportunity to network with other scientists at a similar career stage. And as a member of YATSI’s Interact committee, I have helped to collate advice around effective industry–academia interactions.\n\nPolicy, Inspire, Interact\n\nYATSI has three committees. Its Policy committee aims to ensure that the voices of early-career professionals are heard in conversations around university education, research funding and personal development. The committee also highlights career opportunities in Denmark and Europe.\n\nThere is a recognized need for closer collaboration between academic science and industrial commercialization. The Policy committee is gathering support for an academia–industry sabbatical-exchange programme aimed at giving participants a better understanding of the real-world relevance of academic research and helping to ensure that industry practices are informed by state-of-the-art scientific knowledge.\n\nDenmark’s Best Science Meme is one example of how YATSI’s Inspire committee strives to engage the public, to illustrate the breadth and diversity of STEM in Denmark and to disseminate knowledge about STEM research and innovation.",

          "abstract": "Science under Siege: How to Fight the Five Most Powerful Forces that Threaten Our World Michael E. Mann & Peter J. Hotez PublicAffairs (2025)\n\nMonths into President Trump’s second term, science and scientists are under attack as never before in the United States. The administration is forcing devastating cuts to previously stable US research investments, dismantling federal science agencies and programmes, ousting independent scientific officials and blatantly disregarding evidence on issues that affect us all, including vaccines, air pollution and fossil fuels.\n\n‘Now is not the time for despair’ — how scientists can take a stand against political interference\n\nThe scientific community needs to recognize these trends and fight back in every way possible. The timely release of Science under Siege by paediatrician and vaccine specialist Peter Hotez and climate scientist Michael Mann is a welcome addition to the scientific community’s arsenal. Both authors work to dispel misinformation in the public and political arenas, and both have experienced personal attacks because of it.\n\nMann, known for his ‘hockey stick’ visual representation of soaring global average temperatures owing to climate change, has faced years of public disparagement and threats to his physical safety. Hotez found himself in the crosshairs of the politicization of public-health guidance, on vaccines in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic — and had to hire private security. Together, they explore the forces that undermine science in the United States and beyond.\n\nFive forces to contend with\n\nThe duo skilfully establishes parallels in the attacks on climate scientists and on public-health professionals. The two fields might seem disparate, but specialists in both share a responsibility to inform the public about the “one-two punch of climate change and pandemics” — the effects of which are mutually reinforcing to “threaten massive loss in human life” — and find solutions.\n\nWho is on RFK Jr’s new vaccine panel — and what will they do?\n\nIn some cases, Mann and Hotez note, the same tactics are used in attempts to discredit their work in both fields — sometimes even by the same people. For example, climate-disinformation messaging morphed over several years from ‘it’s not real’ to ‘it’s actually good for us’. These same tactics were adopted by peddlers of COVID-19 misinformation, who claimed that widespread infection could lead to herd immunity, and caught on much faster, mere months after the virus began spreading.\n\nBut who’s behind the lies, propaganda and attacks? Mann and Hotez identify five forces — the ‘five Ps’ — that drive threats to science and scientists: plutocrats, petrostates, pros (that is, academics and specialists who use their credentials to promote disingenuous, and lucrative, contrarian views), propagandists and the press. Mann and Hotez detail how bad actors continue to propagate misinformation, persecute scientists, undermine science-based decisions from policymakers and the public and threaten global health and safety.\n\nFighting back\n\nAs the president of the Union of Concerned Scientists — a science-advocacy non-profit organization that spends its time fighting these known enemies — I found this thorough naming and shaming resonant and indeed cathartic. I imagine that this exploration of just how pervasive and well-funded these forces are might also bring relief to scientists wondering why their commitment to truth-telling isn’t enough.",

          "title": "How billions of hacked mosquitoes and a vaccine could beat the deadly dengue virus",
          "authors": "Lucila Pinto",
          "abstract": "Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center.\n\nLast month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air. The insects all carry a secret weapon — a bacterium called Wolbachia that lowers the odds that the mosquitoes can transmit the dreaded dengue virus to humans.\n\nThis is the world’s largest ‘mosquito factory’: its goal is to stop dengue\n\nThese infected mosquitoes are the latest weapon in Brazil’s fight against dengue, which infects millions of people in the country each year and can be fatal. A biofactory that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.\n\nThat will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly growing threat of dengue. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year’s outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks’). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached more than 12,000 — the highest ever recorded for this disease.\n\nSOURCE: Brazilian Ministry of Health\n\nAs outbreaks grow larger and the crisis becomes more urgent, the Wolbachia method isn’t Brazil’s only bet. A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country’s drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.\n\nThese twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.\n\nThe local approach\n\nCurrently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.\n\nHowever, Qdenga’s roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.\n\nThe main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What’s more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.\n\nWhen will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain\n\nBrazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan’s director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil’s.”\n\nButantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.\n\nThe vaccine’s development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.\n\nEggs of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria. After hatching, the mosquitoes will be released to prevent the spread of dengue.Credit: Xinhua/Shutterstock\n\nAfter testing 30 formulations, Butantan arrived at one that proved highly effective in preventing infections, according to the preliminary results of a phase III trial involving more than 16,000 volunteers in Brazil. The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure1.\n\n“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.\n\nIn fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial2 in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine’s long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.\n\nThe vaccine is already moving through the country’s regulatory process. And although there’s still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil’s regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.\n\nTo meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.\n\nRegarding the vaccine’s approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”\n\nAlthough Butantan’s production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil’s need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.\n\nIn the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.\n\nInfecting mosquitoes\n\nWhile Butantan awaits news about the vaccine’s approval, the Wolbachia method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.\n\nThe method’s arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. Wolbachia is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.",

          "abstract": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) facility, in Hanford, Washington.Credit: IMAGO/Xinhua via Alamy\n\nTen years after the historic discovery of gravitational waves, and having spotted hundreds more of these space-time swells since then, physicists say they are only just getting started.\n\nOn 14 September 2015, the twin facilities of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), in Hanford, Washington, and Livingston, Louisiana, sensed the passing of ripples in space-time that had originated more than one billion years ago in the cataclysmic merger of two black holes many galaxies away.\n\nClearest gravitational wave detection yet confirms Hawking’s black hole theory\n\nThat milestone took more than four decades of breakthroughs and heroic improvements in experimental techniques. But seeing such black-hole ‘binaries’ has now become routine. The LIGO detectors — alongside their sister observatories Virgo, near Pisa, Italy, and KAGRA, under Mount Ikenoyama, Japan — have roughly doubled their sensitivities over the past ten years, enabling them to monitor a region of the Universe that is twice as wide and contains about eight times as many galaxies. “We see binary black holes every three days on average now, which is pretty amazing to me,” says David Reitze, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and long-time director of the LIGO observatories. “It’s only going to get better.”\n\nOver the next decade, teams in both the United States and Europe are hoping to build bigger observatories that can spot gravitational waves from anywhere across the observable Universe. Nature takes a look at scientists’ plans for the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors.\n\nCosmic Explorer\n\nUS-based gravitational-wave researchers want to build the Cosmic Explorer (CE), an interferometer similar to LIGO, but with L-shaped arms that are ten times longer, stretching 40 kilometres. If it is built and works as planned, the CE should collect 100,000 black-hole mergers each year, essentially spotting them wherever they happen in the observable Universe. These will include events that happened more than ten billion years ago, when galaxies were at their busiest creating and destroying stars and making and merging black holes, says Reitze. “You really do want to be able to probe farther back.”\n\nEach year, the CE would also pick up more than one million mergers of lighter objects called neutron stars — a rate of or one every several seconds, says Stefan Ballmer, a physicist at Syracuse University in New York.\n\nBut building it will not be cheap. With its arms stretching far beyond the horizon, the CE will run into the curvature of the Earth. If the endpoints are built at the ground level, the middle points will have to reach some 30 metres below the surface. Physicists have been scouting the United States for remote locations that are naturally bowl-shaped, which could reduce the need for digging. “We are winnowing the candidate sites down to a shortlist,” says Ballmer.\n\nLIGO upgrades\n\nMeanwhile, a planned set of upgrades called LIGO A# (A-sharp) could more than double the sensitivity of the existing observatory in the early 2030s, and help to test the cutting-edge technology that will eventually go into the CE. Improvements will include raising the power of the lasers that run down the interferometer arms. The LIGO team also plans to install heavier, more stable and more perfectly reflective suspended mirrors at the ends of those arms. (Interferometers detect gravitational waves by measuring tiny changes in the amount of time it takes for laser light to bounce between the mirrors.)\n\nHowever, both the continued funding for maintaining LIGO and that for any upgrades — let alone new US-based facilities — could be at risk if President Donald Trump achieves his target of severely downsizing the US National Science Foundation, the agency that has funded most of LIGO’s construction and operation. Congress has hinted that it might prefer less-drastic cuts, however, and researchers remain hopeful. “I think we just have to wait and see,” Reitze says.\n\nAn artist’s impression of the Einstein Telescope — an underground gravitational-wave observatory with three 10-kilometre-long arms arranged in a triangle.

          "authors": "Leon Lobo, Douglas Paul, Chander Velu",
          "abstract": "It might not be apparent, but almost everything people do in this digitally connected world, from sending a text or e-mail to doing an Internet search or paying for something online, depends on accurate, resilient timing. Most electronic communications rely on digital infrastructure that is synchronized to a common time reference, enabling information to flow at a known rate. Accurate timing is also crucial for synchronizing and stabilizing infrastructure such as electricity grids, for helping to ensure the integrity of financial transactions, for steering machinery for precision agriculture, and for managing transport, logistics and postal delivery systems, among a host of other essential functions.\n\nToday, the necessary timing signals come overwhelmingly from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). These deliver signals from space, with only a radio receiver needed to receive and interpret them. Chief among them is the US-developed Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS is free to use, and the technology is mature: miniature GPS receivers are now embedded in every smartphone, at a cost of a few dollars per unit. This is an easy, low-cost way to reliably synchronize time, certainly compared with the old method of physically calibrating your clock to a reference clock at a national standards agency.\n\nBest ever clocks: breakthrough paves way for ultra-precise ‘nuclear’ timekeepers\n\nBut this success has bred complacency — and led to underappreciated risk. GNSS are far from fail-safe. In many parts of the world, organized-crime syndicates and military authorities are among those increasingly jamming GNSS signals (blocking them entirely) or spoofing them (transmitting false signals to provide misleading time and position coordinates). Disruptions to the signal due to extreme weather events are also on the rise. In some sectors, such as aviation, a multitude of systems would potentially be affected in the event of more-widespread outages. But there is low awareness of the risks — and protections are hugely variable between sectors.\n\nThe increasing vulnerability of time signals from space necessitates the development of alternative ways of accessing accurate, resilient and secure time. We (the authors) have been involved in varying capacities in technology and economic measures to deliver a nationwide, resilient terrestrial timing solution that is independent of GNSS in the United Kingdom. Here we set out three key steps that we think would help to facilitate the development of alternative time sources worldwide: increasing buy-in from business; linking up existing, heterogeneous local timing systems; and creating entirely new uses for time.\n\nGetting buy-in from business\n\nConstellations of GNSS satellites disseminate time from the national-standards laboratories that contribute to the formulation of the global time scale, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The GPS system was developed by the US Department of Defense during the cold war, initially for the exclusive use of the US military. Each GPS satellite carries multiple atomic clocks, which are ultimately synchronized with a representation of the UTC, known as UTC(USNO), generated by an ensemble of atomic clocks at the US Naval Observatory in Washington DC. The signals these satellites beam down to Earth enable users to determine the time to within an accuracy of 10–7 seconds, or 100 billionths of a second.\n\nRecognition in the 1980s of the wider potential societal benefits of GNSS led the United States to make an intentionally degraded, ‘selectively available’ version of the GPS signal accessible to everyone globally, free of charge. The full version was made public in 2000, since when its use has ballooned in a plethora of civilian applications. Other GNSS systems exist, such as GLONASS (operated by Russia), Galileo (the European Union) and BeiDou (China). But GPS remains dominant owing to widespread public confidence in a US-provided infrastructure and to the system’s earlier availability for general use, which means a large number of older receivers are only GPS-compliant. Some 5.6 billion end-user GNSS receiver units were in use in 2023, a number predicted to increase to almost 9 billion units in 2033 (see ‘Sky-high demand’). The economic benefits of using GNSS have been estimated to be around US$300 billion annually for the United States, $81 billion across Europe and from $9 billion to about $18 billion for the United Kingdom (see ‘Productivity plus’).\n\nSource: EU Agency for the Space Programme (https://go.nature.com/42AQKJL)\n\nThe potential costs of disruption to GNSS are similarly considerable: across all sectors, a report for the UK government in 2023 estimated these costs, per day, to be almost $1.9 billion for the United Kingdom alone. But whereas the economic benefits of using GNSS often accrue to individual firms, the economic cost of disturbances to the GPS signal — for example, the failure of the electricity grid due to a GPS outage that might affect transport, financial and communication systems — tends to be borne by all of society.\n\nMore onus needs to be put on firms and utilities that provide services through GNSS to invest in timing resilience. Regulation to increase the liability of individual firms, and personal accountability of senior managers for ensuring resilience of time, is one way to make this happen. There is also a need to support the development of alternative assured ‘holdover time’ capabilities: accurate, locally based clocks that can continue to provide time for a while if the main GNSS signals are lost.\n\nSource: London Economics (https://go.nature.com/4G5NDYM)\n\nThe cumulative investment costs across every organization in every sector to provide such a holdover system are likely to be significant. Developing national public infrastructures for delivering resilient timekeeping directly from national representations of UTC — in effect, recreating timekeeping as a national public utility — is a way to reduce direct costs for businesses. Such a public utility could instil trust and confidence in users, and cover its costs by offering tiered, paid-for levels of assurance of time. In the United Kingdom, a supporting terrestrial clock system is being designed and developed as a nationwide time infrastructure through the National Timing Centre research and development programme (of which one of us, L.L., is head) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington. This system is linked to UTC(NPL), the United Kingdom’s real-time realization of UTC.\n\nBut limited understanding of the need for alternative assured-time capabilities is a barrier to achieving business and political buy-in. A programme of public awareness about the use and importance of GNSS should be rolled out globally, emphasizing both the risks inherent in the current systems and the benefits of alternative timing systems for increased resilience and enhanced performance.\n\nLinking up time systems\n\nCrucial infrastructures, from financial services to transport and energy systems, are often interdependent. Yet they tend to operate as independent ecosystems, subject to their own legislation and with their own regulatory standards, policies, supply chains and digital ecosystems.\n\nLittle thought tends to be given to the security of timekeeping in the design and maintenance of the digital systems underpinning this infrastructure. Time’s intangible nature means that it often falls in the gap between cybersecurity and physical-security measures designed to protect digital and physical assets, respectively. When mitigating GNSS loss or disruption is considered at all, it tends to be by individual firms on an ad hoc basis. For example, telecommunications network providers often have atomic clocks distributed across their fibre exchanges to enable synchronization to be maintained for the Internet backbone even if GNSS signals are disrupted. Such mitigation measures are rarely tested robustly for the possibility of GNSS outages across all interconnected sectors.\n\nAtomic clock keeps ultra-precise time aboard a rocking naval ship\n\nThe increasingly interlinked nature of timing infrastructure implies that terrestrial clocks need to be integrated and able to coordinate time in the case of disruption to GNSS. This underlines the desirability of government intervention to provide a base capability that is accessible to all users wherever and whenever they need it. This might take the form of new legislation or regulation and standards to allow interoperability between essential infrastructures. It is part of the rationale behind the UK National Timing Centre’s research programme.\n\nA further consideration is that the global supply chain for timing systems — from atomic clocks, time distribution and monitoring systems to user equipment — is currently sparse and lacks diversity. The ubiquity and utility of GNSS for time has resulted in industry investing in and developing receivers that are low in size, weight, power and cost, proliferating dependency on this single solution. (One of us, D.P., is head of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position, Navigation and Timing, led by the University of Glasgow, UK, which runs a programme developing cheaper timing technologies.) A more diverse supply chain needs to be built to provide the enabling technologies to support a national timing infrastructure that can enhance the resilience of time. This needs to be complemented by an upgrade of the skills pipeline.\n\nPrivate-sector investments in building such a resilient supply chain to provide reliable timing will depend on effective, long-term commitment from governments1. Policy initiatives such as direct public investment, or incentives such as tax credits, interest deferrals and loans, must be immune to political winds of change to truly de-risk such investments. This could be achieved by regulating the minimum holdover time — the length of time any backup system can provide accurate timekeeping — across industries to ensure commitment to build and develop such time-based resilience. Such regulation needs to define the requirements for specific clocks with the accuracy needed to enable each national infrastructure to operate effectively.\n\nCreating new uses for time\n\nThe extra revenue-generating opportunity of new timing systems is, on the face of it, limited when compared with the extra costs. A focus solely on managing risk and enhancing the resilience of time systems might not, therefore, be enough to convince firms of the need to invest in supporting the development of terrestrial holdover timing systems.\n\nFinancial markets require precise, trustable time for transactions to be recorded accurately.Caption: Michael M.

          "abstract": "A publisher has found that less than 25% of authors disclosed their use of AI to prepare manuscripts, despite the publisher mandating disclosure for submission.Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAn analysis of tens of thousands of research-paper submissions has shown a dramatic increase in the presence of text generated using artificial intelligence (AI) in the past few years, an academic publisher has found.\n\nThe American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) found that 23% of abstracts in manuscripts and 5% of peer-review reports submitted to its journals in 2024 contained text that was probably generated by large language models (LLMs). The publishers also found that less than 25% of authors disclosed their use of AI to prepare manuscripts, despite the publisher mandating disclosure for submission.\n\nTo screen manuscripts for signs of AI use, the AACR used an AI tool that was developed by Pangram Labs, based in New York City. When applied to 46,500 abstracts, 46,021 methods sections and 29,544 peer-review comments submitted to 10 AACR journals between 2021 and 2024, the tool flagged a rise in suspected AI-generated text in submissions and review reports since the public release of OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022.\n\n“We were shocked when we saw the Pangram results,” says Daniel Evanko, the AACR’s director of journal operations and systems, who presented the findings at the 10th International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publications in Chicago, Illinois, on 3 September.\n\nThe analysis found that AI-generated text in peer-review reports dropped by 50% in late 2023, after the AACR banned peer reviewers from using LLMs. But detections of AI-generated text in peer-review comments more than doubled by early 2024 and continued to climb.\n\nIt “was disconcerting to see people increasing the usage of LLMs for peer review in spite of us prohibiting that usage”, says Evanko. He adds that “our intention is definitely to start screening all incoming manuscripts and all incoming peer review comments”.\n\nThe tool “seems to work exceptionally well”, says Adam Day, founder of Clear Skies, a London-based research-integrity firm. However, “there may be bias that we’re not seeing regarding false positive rate, and we should be mindful of that”, he adds.\n\n99.85% accurate\n\nPangram was trained on 28 million human-written documents from before 2021, including 3 million scientific papers, as well as ‘AI mirrors’ — LLM-generated texts that mimic human-written passages in length, style and tone.\n\nMax Spero, chief executive officer of Pangram Labs, says that adding an active-learning mode to Pangram was “one of the breakthroughs” that enabled it to reduce the false-positive rate — the share of texts incorrectly flagged as being AI-written. He and his team repeatedly retrained the tool, which “reduced our false-positive rate from about one in 100 to about one in 10,000”, he says.\n\n‘AI models are capable of novel research’: OpenAI’s chief scientist on what to expect\n\nIn a preprint posted last year1, Spero and his colleagues showed that Pangram’s accuracy was 99.85%, with error rates 38 times lower than those of other currently available AI-detection tools.\n\nTesting the AI-detection tool on manuscripts before ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it flagged only seven abstracts and no methods or peer-review reports as containing potentially AI-generated text. “From there on, the detections just increased linearly and at what we would think is a very high rate,” says Evanko.\n\nThe tool can also distinguish between different LLMs, including ChatGPT models, DeepSeek, LLaMa and Claude. “We’re only able to do this because we’ve generated our entire training set ourselves, so we know the exact provenance, we know what model the training data came from,” explains Spero.\n\nThe current model of Pangram cannot distinguish between passages that are fully generated by AI and those that are written by humans but edited using AI.\n\nLanguage aid\n\nThe AACR used Pangram to analyse submissions in 2024 that included 11,959 abstracts, 11,875 methods sections and 7,211 peer-review reports.\n\nTheir analysis found that authors at institutions in countries where English is not a native language were more than twice as likely to use LLMs.\n\n“I was personally shocked at just how high the usage was in the methods,” says Evanko. “Asking an LLM to improve the language of the methods section could introduce errors … because those details need to be exact in terms of how you did something and if you rephrase something, it might not be correct any more,” he adds.",

          "title": "‘Lipstick on a pig’: how to fight back against a peer-review bully",
          "authors": "Katarina Zimmer",
          "abstract": "Nyssa Silbiger still recalls the rude remark that reviewer three made in 2014 about her first paper describing her PhD research. “The phrases I have so far avoided using in this review are, ‘lipstick on a pig’, and ‘bullshit baffles brains’,” they wrote.\n\nTo Silbiger, a marine biologist at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, the words cut deep. The critique not only made it difficult to work out how she should revise her manuscript on the bioerosion of coral reefs, but also led her to question her abilities and whether she belonged in science at all. “As a twenty-something student, that can have a really big impact on your ability not only to conduct science, but your whole future career,” says Silbiger, who now leads her own marine-ecology group at the university.\n\nCan Germany rein in its academic bullying problem?\n\nPeer review is supposed to be critical. But too often, Silbiger says, reviewer feedback crosses the line into an unprofessional realm. Such unacceptable behaviours range from outright bullying of other scientists and personal comments about the authors to mean-spirited or unhelpful remarks without constructive, evidence-based criticism. In 2019, Silbiger and Amber Stubler, a marine ecologist at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California, conducted a survey of roughly 1,100 scientists. Some 58% of respondents reported that they had encountered unprofessional peer-review comments1. In particular, women, non-binary scientists and people of colour said that the experience had harmed their confidence and productivity and delayed their career advancement.\n\nAttention to the issue has grown ever since and, fortunately, so have ways to address it. Journals, editors and scientific organizations have begun to explore a range of solutions to prevent bullying during the peer-review process and to hold mean-spirited reviewers accountable. Many scientists are also taking matters into their own hands by pushing back on unprofessional reviews.\n\n“There is progress being made, just in small increments and in different flavours,” says Emma Dunne, a palaeobiologist at the Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen–Nuremberg in Germany, and the ethics editor of the journal Historical Biology. “I would like to think that things can only get better.”\n\nWhy do nasty peer reviews happen?\n\nHowever negatively a referee views a study, there’s always a polite, evidence-based way to express criticism, says Sally Thomas, the Palaeontological Association’s publications officer. During the organization’s peer-review workshop for early-career researchers, she stresses the importance of being careful with language (see ‘Don’t do it’). “Always put yourself in the shoes of the author,” says Thomas, who is based in Cambridge, UK. Start by writing something positive, she says, “and then lay out what is not so good about the work in a totally unemotional and logical way”.\n\nDon’t do it\n\nAs a peer reviewer, avoid harmful and unhelpful comments such as these real examples.\n\n• “The writing of this paper was atrocious.”4\n\n• “The result of attending university in a developing country.”4\n\n• “You should look closely at a career outside of science.”1\n\n• “This young lady is lucky to have been mentored by the leading men in the field.”4\n\n• “Utterly disappointed in this submission, it achieves nothing, and was a waste of funding.”4\n\n• “The author’s last name sounds Spanish. I didn’t read the manuscript because I’m sure it’s full of bad English.”1\n\n• “This manuscript was not worth my time so I did not read it and recommend rejection.”4\n\n• “I have rewritten so much of this troubled paper that I should be included as an author.”4\n\n• “The first author is a woman. She should be in the kitchen, not writing papers.”1\n\n• “This paper is, simply, manure.”1\n\n• “What the authors have done is an insult to science.”1\n\n• “The author’s status as a trans person has distorted his view of sex beyond the biological reality.”1\n\n• “The English is not good enough; please have it reviewed by a native speaker.”\n\n• “The authors provide us with a nice example [of] what they can, and cannot do, and how they (wrongly) understand nature and ecology.”4\n\n• “This person works for an NGO [non-governmental organization], you shouldn’t believe anything they say.”1\n\nYet research indicates that some scientists worry that being too nice will allow poor-quality studies to be published or think that authors deserve harsh comments for submitting substandard work2. Other times, overly harsh reviews might be intended to hinder or delay the publication of papers by competing laboratory groups. Personal snipes at study authors are also widespread, including ones targeting early-career scientists, women and people of colour, notes palaeontologist Farid Saleh at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. He recalls how a reviewer once singled him and a female co-author out on a paper with 12 other authors, “calling us disingenuous, not real scientists, and making other personal attacks”. Remarks that disparage the authors’ English-language skills without constructive feedback are unprofessional and can exacerbate the existing challenges that individuals whose primary language is not English face in scientific publishing, adds Valeria Ramírez Castañeda, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied such challenges3.\n\nNot all rude-seeming reviews are intentional, because cultural attitudes to directness vary. A blunt comment from one scientist might be perceived as rude by researchers who are used to more diplomatic language, Ramírez Castañeda says. Reviews by scientists who lack the skills or experience to give nuanced feedback, senior researchers accustomed to the more-adversarial academic cultures of the past and scientists who don’t have the time to thoughtfully consider a paper might seem harsher than intended.\n\nWhat authors can do\n\nAvoiding problematic peer reviews starts by considering which journal to submit to and what its peer-review practices are. Specialists agree that the most common form of peer review — single-anonymous, in which referee identities are concealed from the authors but not vice versa — can promote unprofessional comments by giving reviewers anonymity.\n\nValeria Ramírez Castañeda says peer reviewers shouldn’t penalize a lack of English fluency.Credit: Valeria Ramírez Castañeda\n\nFortunately, many journals have begun to offer other kinds of peer review — such as double-anonymous review, in which both author and reviewer identities are concealed. This can help to prevent problematic comments and review-related rejections when reviewers are biased against authors from some demographics or nations. IOP Publishing (IOPP), a publisher of physical-science journals in Bristol, UK, has found few differences in overall rejection rates for papers with double-anonymous reviews compared with single-anonymous ones. However, an internal analysis of 2024 data covering around 28,000 papers suggests that some groups might benefit from double-anonymous reviews. Scientists in Africa were 4% more likely to have their paper accepted when the authors chose to be anonymous during the peer-review stage. But there is no clear trend for women and non-binary authors, says Laura Feetham-Walker, IOPP’s reviewer-engagement manager. And, in some scientific fields, “it’s not that challenging [for a reviewer] to identify who the senior authors are on any paper”, even if they are anonymized, notes Simon Harold, chief editor of Nature Ecology & Evolution in London. (Nature’s Careers team is independent of the journal’s publisher, Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature Ecology & Evolution and other Nature Portfolio journals.)\n\nMany journals, including the BMJ, Nature and some of the other Nature Portfolio journals (see go.nature.com/4nvd9zs), also offer open, or transparent, peer review. In this case, the reviews — and sometimes the referees’ identities — are published with the paper. Although this practice can encourage more-considerate behaviour, early-career scientists often worry about retaliation when critically reviewing papers from more-senior or influential authors. The sense of being able to speak freely with anonymity “is why I think the anonymous peer-review system is the default”, Harold adds.\n\nShould I tell anyone that I suspect misconduct in a paper I’m reviewing?\n\nWhen biologist Mayank Chugh was pursuing a master’s degree, members of his lab group in India received harsh feedback and demoralizing comments about their written English in some of their papers. So, they decided to submit his first paper to the journal eLife. The journal has both a consultative review process — in which editors and reviewers discuss the manuscript together and share consolidated feedback with the authors — and a policy to publish reviews and encourage reviewers to disclose their names. “We trusted that process over what we had experienced before,” says Chugh, who is now at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a member of eLife’s early-career advisory group. Morteza Mahmoudi, a nanoscientist and anti-bullying researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing, takes further steps when he anticipates an unproductive peer-review process — something he has often experienced with papers that challenge commercially important assumptions in his field. He now asks editors to exclude certain researchers from reviewing — an option that many journals provide. In these cases, “I don’t get those unnecessary delays in the process or harsh comments”, says Mahmoudi.\n\nAfter receiving a reviewer’s report, if authors aren’t sure whether the language is problematic, Feetham-Walker recommends that the authors ask themselves: “Has this comment helped me to improve my paper, or has it just undermined my confidence?” Importantly, peer review should critique only the science, she adds. “The main defining factor of unprofessional comments is that they are personal.” If still in doubt, Mahmoudi advises authors to consult their colleagues.\n\nIt’s important to remember that harsh reviews can help authors to improve their paper, notes Mirvat Alasnag, an interventional cardiologist at King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. “If it’s not what you wanted to hear, leave the noise behind, but try as hard as you can to look at the comments and see if they’re valuable,” she says.\n\nHowever, in the case of especially egregious comments, she and others recommend flagging the problematic behaviour to the manuscript-handling editor (see ‘How to avoid — and push back on — peer review bullying’). Silbiger suggests that authors write an e-mail thanking the editor and reviewer for the critical appraisal and noting that they will take the suggestions into consideration. Then, they should detail the comments they felt were unethical and unprofessional and ask that those comments be removed from the review process — and possibly flagged to the reviewer as being unhelpful.\n\nHow to avoid — and push back on — peer-review bullying\n\nResearchers advise on how to avoid and address problematic comments from reviewers.\n\nChoose the right journal. Consider journals that have transparent, open review processes in which reviews are made public, for instance, or that give authors the option to veto certain reviewers.\n\nFocus on the science. Try to isolate the scientific critiques in problematic reviews, and if they’re valuable, focus on addressing them. If in doubt, get a second opinion from colleagues on whether a comment is worth addressing.\n\nWrite to the editor. Thank the editor for their time and politely point out the specific comments you found discriminatory or rude.\n\nConsider appealing. If you think that a problematic review has unduly influenced the review process and led to a rejection, consider appealing the editor’s decision.\n\nAfter Silbiger revised her manuscript in 2014 — and reviewer three responded with further unprofessional comments — her PhD supervisor wrote to the journal’s chief editor. After explaining how the team had addressed the valid criticisms and pointing out the unprofessional remarks that couldn’t be addressed, she asked the chief editor to decide whether to accept or reject the paper. The paper was ultimately published and has been cited 88 times. “If you’re junior, sometimes it helps to have your senior author be the one to write the letter,” Silbiger says.",

          "authors": "Ting Zhu",
          "abstract": "In theory, all biological structures, functions and even organisms could be recreated in their mirror image, leading to endless possibilities.Credit: Getty\n\nThis week, experts in synthetic biology and microbiology, among other fields, are gathering in Manchester, UK, to explore the benefits and risks of building synthetic life. One of the topics that will be discussed is how research might be restricted to prevent the creation of organisms made of components that are the mirror image of those that make up life on Earth. Days after the Manchester meeting, the issue will be examined at a workshop organized by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. And other meetings are planned.\n\nHow should ‘mirror life’ research be restricted? Debate heats up\n\nMost of the biological molecules known to make up life on Earth have a specific handedness, or chirality. Amino acids have left-handed chirality, for example, whereas DNA is right-handed. Because mirror-image bacteria or other synthetic life forms would be made of molecules of opposite handedness (so with right-handed amino acids and left-handed DNA), the concern is that such organisms might represent a hazard to known life1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw). For example, some of them might be capable of evading immune systems, confounding medicines, resisting predation and causing harms to humans, non-human animals, plants and ecosystems2,3.\n\nProhibiting the creation of molecules or biological entities of either chirality that could endanger human health or environmental stability should be uncontroversial. And discussions early in the development of a field — as well as efforts to engage the public — can be constructive when it comes to ensuring that research is conducted responsibly and ethically.\n\nBut in the face of vast unknowns, the noble path of pre-emptively protecting humanity from potential risks in the distant future can be slippery. And we should tread cautiously.\n\nThe concept of a mirror-image biological world is not new. It was first proposed in 1860 by French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur4. And the potential benefits and risks of mirror-image organisms have been discussed by the research community for more than 30 years1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw). However, in the past few months, the conversation has abruptly shifted to calls for hard limits on basic research and funding2.\n\nAt this point, there are divergent views (see go.nature.com/46tgjvf and eLetters by R. Derda et al. and D. Perrin in ref. 2) on how soon it might be possible to create mirror-image organisms; the potential benefits and risks of generating mirror-image life and of developing precursor technologies; whether moratoria on research should be imposed; and, if so, what areas of study should be restricted.\n\nGiven the countless unanswered questions, careful consideration of the scientific facts learnt so far — regarding what it would take to create a mirror-image life form, and the pros and cons of research on mirror-image molecular biology more broadly — is crucial for bridging divergent views and fostering rational and informed debate.\n\nOn the distant horizon\n\nIn December 2024, nearly 40 experts, including in synthetic biology, ecology and immunology, co-authored a Policy Forum article in Science2 and released a separate 299-page technical report3. In both, the authors argued that were mirror-image life created, it would be very likely to present unprecedented risks to humans, animals, plants and ecosystems.\n\nMultiple meetings have followed the Science publication, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, France and the Netherlands.\n\nBut how close are scientists to being able to create a mirror-image life form?\n\nScientists have been pondering the idea of a mirror-image world of biology for more than a century.Credit: Jorg Greuel/Getty\n\nDozens of research groups, including those at pharmaceutical companies, have been synthesizing and investigating mirror-image proteins, DNA and RNA for the past three decades to understand fundamental biology and develop therapeutics5–14. My colleagues and I have been exploring various mirror-image molecular processes, too. These include the replication of mirror-image DNA, the transcription of mirror-image DNA into mirror-image RNA and the translation of mirror-image RNA into mirror-image proteins — in other words, a mirror-image version of the central dogma of molecular biology7–11.\n\nResearch in mirror-image molecular biology is still in its infancy. But scientists working in this field have been humbled by the tremendous challenges of exploring this unknown world5–14. The creation of mirror-image organisms, if it ever became feasible, would face monumental conceptual and technical barriers.\n\nHundreds to thousands of cellular components — including proteins, nucleic acids, membranes, metabolites and complex carbohydrates called glycans — would need to be synthesized chemically or enzymatically in their chirally inverted forms. Some of these are encoded directly by DNA. But many are synthesized or modified by other complex biological machinery, meaning their compositions and structures cannot simply be derived from DNA sequences. And many have not yet been characterized.\n\nIt took our group nearly four years to chemically synthesize a mirror-image protein fragment of up to around 470 amino acids9 — the longest single-chain mirror-image polypeptide reported so far. Synthesizing longer polypeptides and membrane proteins that are rich in water-repelling (hydrophobic) domains would be even harder.\n\nAsilomar conference took courage and foresight — today, inclusivity would also be crucial\n\nLikewise, we have been trying to chemically synthesize a highly simplified version of a mirror-image ribosome since 2016, and are still years away from achieving it. Should we succeed, this ribosome will lack protein and RNA modifications and will not have aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (the enzymes responsible for attaching specific amino acids to their corresponding transfer RNAs during protein biosynthesis)8,11. This means it will be able to produce only short peptides and small proteins (say, of about 300 amino acids)8.\n\nEven if all the constituent molecules of the simplest bacterium could be synthesized in their mirror-image forms, these would need to be folded correctly and assembled with spatio-temporal precision to create a mirror-image bacterium that functions as a complex, autonomously replicating cell.\n\nMany laboratories have built non-living membrane-bound compartments, in which copies of DNA and RNA molecules can be made or in which RNA molecules can be translated into proteins. Although researchers have been able to isolate biologically derived ribosomes and other cellular machinery with natural chirality for decades, no lab has been able to use this machinery to produce all the essential cellular components in vitro.\n\nResearchers don’t yet know how to assemble a natural-chirality self-replicating cell from biologically derived building blocks — let alone how to chemically synthesize a mirror-image one from the ground up. And although other strategies for the creation of mirror-image life have been proposed (such as the stepwise conversion of a natural-chirality cell into a mirror-image cell2,3), there is insufficient evidence to support their feasibility.\n\nIn short, it is crucial to distinguish mirror-image molecular biology from the creation of mirror-image organisms. A self-replicating cell has molecular diversity, metabolic complexity and structural intricacy that are orders of magnitude greater than what’s found in any currently synthesizable biomolecular system. And the creation of a mirror-image organism lies well beyond the reach of present-day science.\n\nEndless possibilities\n\nBecause all biological structures, functions and even organisms could be recreated in their mirror image, the possibilities — good and bad — in a looking-glass world are endless. As well as considering the risks of hypothetical scenarios, such as the creation of mirror-image life, it is important to keep in mind the realized and potential benefits of the mirror-image molecular biology research that is already under way5–14.\n\nWhen given to animals or humans, mirror-image peptides and nucleic-acid drugs can trigger a much milder immune response compared with their natural-chirality counterparts13. They are also more resistant to biodegradation, which means a dose can stay in the body for much longer. The implications for drug discovery are profound.\n\nMirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA\n\nDozens of mirror-image peptides, DNA and RNA molecules are already being developed as drug candidates for cancer, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders10,13. Indeed, a synthesized mirror-image ribosome would probably drastically accelerate pharmaceutical discovery by enabling the high-throughput production of mirror-image peptides8,11.\n\nAll sorts of other possible applications of mirror-image molecules or biological entities can be imagined, particularly in medicine and sustainability.\n\nMirror-image glucose tastes as sweet as its natural-chirality counterpart, but does not provide calories because it is not metabolized by the enzymes found in natural-chirality organisms15. This means that mirror-image glucose and other mirror-image sugars could serve as non-caloric sweeteners or other food additives.\n\nMirror-image DNA molecules have the same capacity to hold information as their natural-chirality counterparts do, but they are more resistant to biodegradation and easier to distinguish from contaminant (natural-chirality) DNA. As such, mirror-image DNA molecules can serve as robust information repositories9.\n\nNanoparticles or nanocapsules, built using mirror-image proteins, could enable the safe delivery of drugs by shielding them from the immune system. Mirror-image DNA or RNA molecules designed to detect the presence of certain human proteins and metabolites, such as thrombin10 and guanine11, could be used as diagnostic biosensors in clinical settings.\n\nMeanwhile, mirror-image versions of enzymes that are capable of degrading plastics that have no chirality could offer a solution to plastic pollution12. Like their natural-chirality counterparts, such enzymes can break down plastics but are more resistant to biodegradation themselves. In principle, mirror-image versions of enzymes that can capture carbon might similarly be used to help address climate change.\n\nPlastic-consuming bacteria, shown in this artist’s impression, contain enzymes that degrade plastics. Biostable mirror-image versions of these proteins could offer a solution to plastic pollution.Credit: Thomas Parsons/Science Photo Library\n\nAs well as providing solutions for all sorts of practical problems, basic research on biology through the looking glass could offer insights into the structures and functions of biomolecules. It could shed light on the origin of homochirality (the dominance of one set of chiral molecules in known forms of life), and even on the origin of life11. It could guide searches for new life forms, for instance, on Earth as well as on other planets.\n\nOf course, the very properties that promise to make mirror-image proteins and nucleic acids so useful in so many contexts — their biostability and tendency to induce only a mild immune response in humans and other organisms — could also make certain mirror-image organisms harmful1–3 (see also go.nature.com/3hshyst and go.nature.com/3vwuytw).",

          "title": "These nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties",
          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "The United States has long been one of the most popular destinations for international students pursuing graduate studies. But pauses to some of the country’s university PhD programmes and the imposition of visa restrictions for students from certain countries have prompted other nations to try to attract those students who have been affected by the changes or who no longer want to study in the United States.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed slashing budgets at some of the country’s top scientific agencies and has frozen funds for grants and contracts for universities.\n\nChris Tisdell, a researcher in education and mathematics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, says he has heard reports of international students already shifting away from the United States because of uncertainties surrounding funding. International student arrivals dropped by 30% in June this year compared with June 2024, according to data reported by the US International Trade Administration.\n\nGwilym Croucher, a researcher in higher education at the University of Melbourne, Australia, says he expects talented PhD candidates to look elsewhere. “The beneficiaries of that may be established places like Canada, Australia, the UK, a lot of Europe, but they may also be China and India,” he says.\n\nSo, which countries have stepped up efforts to woo PhD students? And what are they offering?\n\nCanada\n\nSeveral universities in Canada have set up programmes to attract students from the United States.\n\nIn July, Western University in London launched a Doctoral Excellence Award, targeting current and prospective students of US universities, including those who have had an offer rescinded in the past six months, at US universities ranked in the top 100 globally. Initially, 25 students will be supported, receiving a PhD stipend for up to four years of study, as well as “fast-tracked admissions and help finding a supervisor”, says Florentine Strzelczyk, Western University’s provost. PhD stipends increased across Canada, after the government set a blanket rate of Can$40,000 annually last year.\n\nEarlier this year, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver also extended the deadline to allow for late applications from US citizens to be considered for certain graduate programmes starting in January 2026.\n\nAlicia Piazza is in her third year of a PhD at Brock University in St. Catharine’s and recommends Canada for graduate studies, particularly because of the quality of training on offer. “I’m three years in and I’m still learning,” she says. The classes she has attended, including one on grant writing and another on presenting and analysing research papers, have prepared her to work in academia or industry. Students at the university are also encouraged to apply for external funding, and she successfully applied for a scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\nPiazza receives a stipend from the university that covers her tuition fees, and was also guaranteed a position as a teaching assistant, which helps to cover living expenses, she says. “The rent is not too bad, so it’s pretty affordable,” she adds.\n\nEurope\n\nFrance, Germany and Spain are among other countries that have introduced new programmes to attract students, particularly those from the United States, alongside initiatives to attract scientists further on in their careers.\n\nThe University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay, France, is offering eight spots for students to pursue a PhD in subjects spanning climate and environmental science, global health, humanities, social sciences and energy transition. Students who have already started a PhD in the United States are also eligible. International students can apply for several scholarships that cover accommodation and living costs, and in some cases health insurance. Students supported by funding from their university, institution or the national research agency receive between €16,800 (US$19,400) and €18,000 per year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Max Planck Society in Germany has launched a Transatlantic Program and encouraged prospective students to apply to programmes at its international research schools and graduate centres. Doctoral students are under contract with the society, with set working hours of 39 hours per week and a minimum pay of €32,400 per year.",

          "abstract": "Low-socioeconomic-status (SES) and immigrant households benefit the most from attending high-quality early childcare, but they often access it the least. This study tests whether cognitive and behavioural barriers contribute to these access gaps in the French context, where disparities in early childcare enrolment are large. Through a multi-arm experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of informational interventions and personalized support to enhance early childcare application and access in a sample of 1,849 households. Results revealed that the information-only treatment had minimal impact, while adding personalized support to alleviate administrative burdens significantly bridged the SES and migration gaps in early childcare applications. However, despite substantial increases in application rates, we found limited impacts on access rates for low-SES and immigrant households. Our research underscores the need for integrated strategies to promote equal opportunities in early childhood education by identifying key obstacles to early childcare access for these households.",

          "authors": "Lara Weed, Jamie M. Zeitzer",
          "abstract": "Seasonal changes in time policy, such as switching between Standard Time (SDT) and Daylight Saving Time (DST), have been adopted by many countries, including the United States. While transitioning between SDT and DST has notable acute negative population health impacts, the chronic impact of these time policies on health has not been well evaluated. To estimate the impact of permanent SDT or DST on health, we modeled the circadian impact of SDT, DST, and Biannual Shifting (BAS) across a year in the contiguous, continental United States. We find that BAS produces a greater burden on the circadian system as compared to either permanent SDT or DST. Chronotype as well as location (latitude and location within time zones) impact this burden. Analyzing these data relative to county-level health data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Places dataset), we find that, under idealized light exposure conditions and after controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, there would be a decrease in the prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.78% ( − 0.06% to − 1.49%)] and stroke [ − 0.09% ( − 0.04% to − 0.14%)] under SDT compared with the current policy. The prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.51% ( − 0.09% to − 0.93%)] and stroke [ − 0.07% ( − 0.04% to − 0.09%)] would also decrease under permanent DST, though to a lesser degree. Our data, reflecting the impact of time policy on circadian burden and subsequent health benefits, support the cessation of BAS.",

However, detailed characterizations of how population-level behaviors change over time during multiple disease outbreaks and spatial resolutions are still not widely available. We used data from 431,211 survey responses collected in the United States, between April 2020 and June 2022, to provide a description of how human behaviors fluctuated during the first 2 y of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that at the national and state levels, people’s adherence to recommendations to avoid contact with others (a preventive behavior) was highest early in the pandemic but gradually—and linearly—decreased over time. Importantly, during periods of intense COVID-19 mortality, adaption to preventive behaviors increased—despite the overall temporal decrease. These spatial-temporal characterizations help improve our understanding of the bidirectional feedback loop between outbreak severity and human behavior. Our findings should benefit both computational modeling teams developing methodologies to predict the dynamics of future epidemics and policymakers designing strategies to mitigate the effects of future disease outbreaks.",

          "abstract": "Diversified economies are critical for cities to sustain their growth and development, but they are also costly because diversification often requires expanding a city’s capability base. We analyze how cities manage this trade-off by measuring the coherence of the economic activities they support, defined as the technological distance between randomly sampled productive units in a city. We use this framework to study how the US urban system developed over almost two centuries, from 1850 to today. To do so, we rely on historical census data, covering over 600M individual records to describe the economic activities of cities between 1850 and 1940, as well as 8 million patent records and detailed occupational and industrial profiles of cities for more recent decades. Despite massive shifts in the economic geography of the United States over this 170-y period, average coherence in its urban system remains unchanged. Moreover, across different time periods, datasets, and relatedness measures, coherence falls with city size at the exact same rate, pointing to constraints to diversification that are governed by a city’s size in universal ways.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms have become vital channels for businesses to reach consumers through advertising. But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses.",

We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

Here, we tracked RIPK1 and RIPK3 coassemblies and found that these fibrillar aggregates could be released into the culture medium after the membrane rupture in necroptotic cells. Interestingly, these RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils were capable of infiltrating recipient cells and acting as seeds for the nucleation and formation of the endogenous necrosome. Cryo electron microscopy structural analysis unveiled a distinctive S-shaped conformation common to RHIM fibrils of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which can facilitate the cross-seeding of RIPK3 by RIPK1 or RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils. Our findings suggest the ability of functional RIPK1/RIPK3 amyloid fibrils in intercellular spreading to induce protein conformation change in recipient cells and provide structural insights into the mechanism of RIPK1 and RIPK3 cross-templating to drive necroptosis.",

Rad54 is an ATP-dependent DNA motor protein that stimulates Rad51 activity during mitosis. In meiosis Rad51 is downregulated by the protein Hed1, which blocks Rad54 binding to Rad51, and allows Dmc1 to function as the active recombinase. We currently have a poor understanding of the regulatory interplay between Rad54, Hed1, Rad51, and Dmc1. Here, we identify a conserved Rad51 interaction motif within Rad54, and we solve a CryoEM structure of this motif bound to Rad51. We also identify a distinct Rad51 interaction motif within Hed1 and solve its structure bound to Rad51. These structures explain how Rad54 engages Rad51 to promote recombination between sister chromatids during mitosis and how Rad51 is downregulated by Hed1 upon entry into meiosis such that its meiosis-specific homolog Dmc1 can promote recombination between homologous chromosomes.",

          "abstract": "To survive in highly competitive environments, bacteria use specialized secretion systems to deliver antibacterial toxins into neighboring cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. In many Gram-positive bacteria, the export of such toxins requires a membrane-bound molecular apparatus known as the type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb). Recently, it was shown that toxin recruitment to the T7SSb requires a physical interaction between a toxin and two or more so-called targeting factors, which harbor key residues required for T7SS-dependent protein export. However, in addition to these targeting factors, some toxins additionally require a protein belonging to the DUF4176 protein family. Here, by examining two toxin–DUF4176 protein pairs, we demonstrate that DUF4176 constitutes a family of toxin-specific molecular chaperones. In addition to being required for toxin stability in producing cells, we find that DUF4176 proteins facilitate toxin export by specifically interacting with a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered region found in many T7SS toxins. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine structures of several DUF4176 chaperones in their unbound state, and of a DUF4176 chaperone in complex with the binding site of its cognate toxin. These structures reveal that this binding site consists of a disordered amphipathic α-helix that requires interaction with its cognate chaperone for proper folding. Overall, we have identified a family of secretion system associated molecular chaperones found throughout T7SSb-containing Gram-positive bacteria.",

Protein-coding circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging class of RNA cargo that offers increased stability compared to mRNA with potentially reduced immunogenicity, but delivery technologies for intracellular delivery of circRNA remain underexplored. Here, we develop an optimized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for circRNA delivery to immune cells, observing strong and durable transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. We employ a design-of-experiments (DoE) methodology to identify key formulation parameters for enhanced circRNA delivery and, upon intramuscular administration of our optimized circRNA LNPs to mice, observe substantial accumulation within draining lymph nodes and strong dendritic cell (DC) maturation at short time points. Applying this optimized circRNA LNP platform to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate robust antibody production and enhanced immune responses in mice compared to vaccination with mRNA LNPs, including strong T h 1-biased cellular responses and a 3.8-fold increase in antigen-specific reciprocal endpoint IgG titers. These results provide insights into design criteria for circRNA LNP formulations and support the use of circRNA LNPs for vaccination against infectious diseases.",

          "abstract": "Across all domains of life, cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases have diversified to perform a range of crucial functions, such as methionine synthesis and the demethylation of various reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds. These large modular enzymes typically possess three substrate-binding domains, two binding either the methyl donor or methyl acceptor, as well as a cobalamin-binding domain. Here, by challenging the current paradigm of glycine betaine (GBT) catabolism, we have identified a unique methyltransferase in aerobic environmental bacteria that has a dual function both as a methionine synthase and a GBT methyltransferase. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as a model, we demonstrate that a core cobalamin-binding domain (MtgC) and a bidirectional methyltransferase (MtgD) are essential for both methionine synthesis and GBT demethylation. MtgC is phylogenetically distinct from the cobalamin-binding domains of either the classical methionine synthase (MetH) or the GBT methyltransferases found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Across the global ocean, mtgC expression is frequently greater than previously known GBT catabolic pathways due to its occurrence in abundant cosmopolitan marine bacteria. Thus, we uncover a unique relationship between GBT catabolism and methionine synthesis in nature and identify a major route for N-osmolyte demethylation in the global ocean.",

Here, we show that PhsABC and AsrABC-mediated hydrogen sulfide production by Salmonella enterica serovar ( S. ) Typhimurium was linked to an increased abundance of Deltaproteobacteria and inhibition of cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration of Escherichia coli in the murine large intestine. Functional phsABC and asrABC operons provided a growth benefit to S. Typhimurium in the cecum of Enterobacterales- free conventional mice only upon inoculation with commensal E. coli. In gnotobiotic mice engrafted with a defined community of 17 human Clostridia isolates, S. Typhimurium infection inhibited cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration in E. coli only in the presence of Desulfovibrio piger , a sulfide-producing representative of the Deltaproteobacteria. A S. Typhimurium strain deficient for hydrogen sulfide production ( phsA asrA mutant) did not inhibit cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration in E. coli , even when D. piger was present. Collectively, these data suggest that the phsABC and asrABC operons of Salmonella serovars provide a benefit during competition with closely related bacteria, such as E. coli , by inhibiting cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration of the commensal.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies with limited therapeutic options. Among the alternative targets explored for pancreatic cancer, the glycolipid stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) has been extensively studied. We have previously demonstrated that the chimeric anti-SSEA4 antibody with alpha-2,6-sialylated complex type biantennary glycan (SCT) or its 3-fluorosialyl derivative (FSCT) attached to the Fc-Asn297 residue exhibited enhanced binding to the Fc-receptors FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIA which are responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as vaccinal effect. Here, we found that high-SSEA4 expression correlates with increasing tumor proliferation and sensitivity to the glyco-optimized antibodies (anti-SSEA4-SCT and anti-SSEA4-FSCT) which preferentially recruit NKG2D-expressing natural killer cells and FcγRIIA-bearing macrophages with enhanced target killing activity. We also uncovered an immune evasion mechanism involving the interaction of sialoglycans on the cancer cell with Siglec-9 on NK cells or Siglec-10 on macrophages to block the antibody-mediated effector functions, and this immune checkpoint inhibition can be suppressed with the removal of sialic acid on cancer cells or blockade of Siglec recognition. In xenograft models, the glyco-optimized antibodies exhibited superior inhibition of tumor growth with high-SSEA4 expression compared to the wild-type antibody and persistent antitumor activity without additional antibody administration. These findings support anti-SSEA4 antibodies with enhanced effector functions and blockade of Siglec-mediated immune checkpoint as a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.",

B-1 cells are originated from fetal tissues, but, as opposed to B-2 cells, the molecular mechanisms behind their development and homeostatic maintenance remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that posttranscriptional regulation by the RNA binding protein HuR is essential for the homeostatic self-replenishment of innate B-1a cells, the expansion of B-1 cell clones targeting self-antigens, and the production of natural autoantibodies. HuR KO B-1 cells fail to express the high levels of surface B-cell receptor (BCR), TACI, and BAFFR required for tonic signaling and cell survival. At the molecular level, HuR promotes the translation of messenger RNAs encoding the IgM heavy chain and modules, in a direct or indirect manner, the expression of TACI and BAFFR. In summary, we reveal the need for posttranscriptional regulation in BCR expression, tonic signaling, and homeostatic maintenance of functional innate B-1 cells.",

          "abstract": "Low-cost yet high-performance structural materials have been invariantly sought for modern engineering applications. However, due to the localized stress concentration induced by a high Peierls-Nabarro stress and limited dislocation mobility, increasing material strength usually comes at the expense of ductility and toughness, resulting in a trade-off between strength–ductility/strength–toughness. Here, we report an anomalous phenomenon of dislocation absorption at the crack front, which is unlike typically observed dislocation emission at the crack tip, in a heterogeneous “plain” steel consisting of tempered lath martensite embedded with stable carbon-enriched retained austenite. The continuous absorption of dislocations emitted from the tempered martensite into the tough austenite significantly alleviates the localized stress concentration, and as such retards crack propagation in the tempered martensite matrix. This allows the plain high-carbon low-alloyed steel subjected to simple quenching–partitioning–tempering processes to achieve remarkable properties comprising a multiplication of strength and elongation over 50 GPa·% with an exceptionally high fracture toughness over 130 MPa·m 1/2 . The toughening strategy based on this mechanism provides a promising route for developing cost-effective plain steels with ultrahigh strength, ductility, and toughness that is a persistent pursuit in the steel industry.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are gaining attention for their inherent safety and the use of abundant sodium resources. Bismuth (Bi) anode, with its high theoretical capacity and low cost, enhances the performance and competitiveness of ASIBs in energy storage applications. However, as a conversion-type material, Bi inevitably undergoes dramatic volume changes during cycling, limiting the structural stability and calendar life of the electrode. Herein, we present a Bi-carbon composite electrode with ultrafine Bi nanocrystals (&lt; 10 nm) uniformly integrated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (UF Bi@NCF). Despite Bi’s low melting point (271 °C), Ostwald ripening of metallic Bi during carbonization (750 °C) is effectively suppressed by incorporating polyacrylic acid as a chelating polymer in the electrospun Bi(III)/polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions. The high dispersity of Bi nanocrystals at elevated temperature is attributed to the strong coordination and electrostatic interactions between carboxyl groups and Bi 3+ . This structural refinement significantly reduces localized stress concentrations during sodiation/desodiation. The UF Bi@NCF anode demonstrates a reversible capacity of 237.5 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C, and negligible capacity decay even after 5,700 cycles at an extremely high current rate of 20 C for ASIBs. These findings highlight the potential of the anti-Ostwald ripening effect in enhancing the stability and performance of metal-carbon composite electrodes, providing valuable insights into the design of advanced materials for next-generation aqueous batteries.",

At the core of the proposal is a hierarchy of layered prosodic messages that co-occur within the same intonation unit (0.5 to 2 s long). Motivated by this hierarchy, a procedure for the differential detection of three such co-occurring nonverbal messages is then described. In way of implementation, we produce a variant model of the WHISPER automatic speech recognition system that flags intonation unit boundaries, intonation unit prototypes, and emphases therein. The procedure required us to alter WHISPER’s token combinations and significantly adjust its prediction process. The variant model was tested on four datasets that contain spontaneous and read speech, and performs on a par with similar human annotation, and often better, using relatively modest training data. Several insights regarding this implementation, such as model size and encoding methods, are described as well. We believe that the proposed framework, coupled with the results of its application herein, can greatly improve the analysis of speech and language, integrating contextual information and speaker intentions into linguistic descriptions for a large array of purposes with modest means.",

          "abstract": "The Turkana Basin is a renowned paleoanthropological region in Kenya and Ethiopia and is famous for discoveries of numerous hominin fossils and their associated cultural technologies. The Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary sequences hosting these important remains are interbedded with volcanic ash (tuff) beds that provide crucial bracketing age constraints. The Nariokotome Tuff Complex, comprising the Upper, Middle, and Lower Nariokotome Tuffs, preserves deposits that cover an important time interval during the late Early Pleistocene that saw milestone events for Homo erectus and associated technological development. Unfortunately, characterization of these tuffs has been hampered by a) overlapping published eruption ages and b) indistinguishable major element compositions. In addition, fluvial reworking of feldspar-bearing pumice clasts (the target rock for age determinations) from older volcanic deposits into younger tuff layers complicates correct age assignments. Here, we use multiple tephrochronological correlation tools, including high-resolution 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and grain-specific major- and trace-element geochemistry, to establish a well-characterized geochemical and geochronological framework for the Nariokotome tuffs. Utilizing a modern-generation mass-spectrometer, we report distinct ages for the Upper Nariokotome Tuff at 1,233.1 ± 1.3 ka (± 1.9 ka, 2σ; including external uncertainties), the Middle Nariokotome Tuff at 1,263.4 ± 1.2 ka (± 1.9 ka) and the Lower Nariokotome Tuff at 1,285.8 ± 1.0 ka (± 2.1 ka). In addition, high-spatial resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry trace element compositions provide distinct characterization of each tuff, aiding intrabasin correlation of these units. This combined methodology demonstrates the potential to resolve the stratigraphic complexities associated with assigning ages to key paleoanthropological sites.",

          "abstract": "Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is driven by the activation of a set of genes controlled by serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous transcription factor with limited intrinsic transcriptional activity. Myocardin (MYOCD) is a strong transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates smooth muscle differentiation through its association with SRF. MYOCD forms nuclear condensates via its intrinsically disordered transcription activation domain (TAD), whereas SRF is diffusely distributed in the nucleus. MYOCD recruits SRF into these condensates, thereby activating the smooth muscle gene program. We engineered a “superactivator” of smooth muscle genes by replacing SRF’s weak TAD with that of MYOCD, thereby enabling SRF to form nuclear condensates and reprogram fibroblasts into SMCs. Using protein proximity labeling, quantitative proteomics and superresolution confocal microscopy, we show that condensates formed by the MYOCD TAD aggregate chromatin remodelers, RNA polymerases, and mRNA processing factors to drive smooth muscle gene expression. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms whereby nuclear condensates facilitate tissue-specific gene expression and highlight a strategy for engineering cell fate determinants by coupling condensate-forming domains to heterologous DNA-binding proteins.",

          "abstract": "Number 1A, 1948 by Jackson Pollock is a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style. While past work has identified the red and yellow pigments that form part of his core palette, the vibrant blue in the painting has remained unassigned. In this study resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to assign the blue in the painting as manganese blue. This assignment offers critical context for the conservation of his works. Importantly, assignment of this pigment enables spectroscopic investigation of the electronic structure origin of the pure hue of manganese blue and the chemical phenomena that produce its color. To probe these phenomena, resonance Raman data are coupled to magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to assign and analyze the two electronic transitions that create the blue color. This study reveals these bands are split by excited-state exchange interactions; the gap between them contains the reflected light that gives manganese blue its appearance. This sheds light on distinct advantages of molecular inorganic pigments: their ability to leverage ligand field effects in charge transfer states to create multiple intense visible absorption features and the ability to fine-tune pigment color through host lattice electrostatics.",

Mathematical modeling and experiments have elucidated the underlying processes involved. There has been recent interest in the influence of geometric cues on array orientation, be it direct (cell shape) or indirect (tension in the membrane). However, the mechanical influence of membrane curvature on these elastic filaments has largely been ignored. A previous model was proposed to describe how the anchoring process may control the deflection of individual MTs seeking to minimize bending on a cylindrical cell. We incorporate this process into a model of interacting MTs and find the cell curvature influence to be significant: the array favors orientations parallel to the direction of elongation rather than the expected transverse direction. Even without elasticity, the geometry of large cells hinders robust MT organization. These results suggest the necessity of additional processes to overcome these factors. We propose an orientation-dependent catastrophe rate, hypothetically caused by cellulose microfibrils impeding MT polymerization. We find a combination of anchoring and impedance to be sufficient to generate transverse arrays despite the geometric influences.",

To address this gap, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate fracture propagation in LCEs. We stretch edge-cracked monodomain LCE samples, recording their stress-stretch responses and crack paths under varying initial directors and stretching rates. Our findings reveal that cracks can change direction during propagation, which are highly dependent on both the initial director and the stretching rate. To further understand LCE fracture behavior, we develop a rate-dependent phase-field fracture model, which is validated through experiments, and demonstrates the ability to predict complex fracture paths.

Humanized mice, generated by transplanting human hematopoietic stem, progenitor cells into genetically modified mice, are invaluable to study human immune development and function in vivo. However, a major limitation of current models is suboptimal myelopoiesis, particularly lack of functional human neutrophils, hampering the modeling of human immune responses and chronic diseases. Here, we describe a humanized mouse model, named MaGIC for genes replaced, in the C57Bl/6 N strain, which improves human myelopoiesis and enables development of functional human neutrophils. In MaGIC mice, human cytokines M-CSF/CSF1(M), GM-CSF/CSF2(G) and IL-6(I) are knocked-in replacing mouse genes and murine IL2rg and Rag1 (a) are deleted. Human THPO in these mice supports human hematopoiesis. More importantly, insertion of human CD47 (C) under the control of endogenous mouse CD47 promoter enables xenotransplantation and human neutrophil development. MaGIC mice support all human neutrophil subsets found in human bone marrow and blood, a major improvement. This is achieved by creating a niche postirradiation for human granulocyte–macrophage progenitors via reduced murine CD47 and physiological levels of human CD47. These mice also have mature human monocytes, tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells, enabled by humanized M-CSF and GM-CSF. Human neutrophils in MaGIC mice are fully functional in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammation. MaGIC mice address critical gaps in current models and enable incisive translational research on human neutrophils, advancing studies in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.",

Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF , a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron . Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains.

          "abstract": "The P2X2 receptor (P2X2R) is a slowly desensitizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated ion channel that is highly expressed in the cochlea. When mutated, the P2X2R exacerbates age- and noise-related hearing loss, but selective modulators of the receptor are lacking, and the molecular basis of activation and desensitization remains poorly understood. Here, we determine high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X2R in an apo closed state and two distinct ATP-bound desensitized states. In the apo closed state structure, we observe features unique to the P2X2R and locate disease mutations within or near the transmembrane domain. In addition, our ATP-bound structures show how free anionic ATP forms subtype-specific interactions with the orthosteric binding site. We identify and characterize two different ATP-bound desensitized state structures, one similar to published models for other P2XR subtypes, and a second alternate conformation not previously observed. A loop adjacent to the orthosteric binding site between these two ATP-bound desensitized state structures undergoes significant conformational changes. These movements are supported by multireplicate, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulation studies and suggest a path by which ATP could enter or leave the orthosteric pocket. Together, our results provide structural insights into the P2X2R, facilitating structure-based drug development for this therapeutically important target.",

Tumor-associated macrophages promote mammary tumorigenesis, whereas the role of mammary tissue macrophages (MTMs) remains incompletely understood. High-dimensional immunostaining of murine mammary tumor progression revealed that MTMs were localized in the peritumoral stroma and associated with eosinophils, which were previously shown to facilitate antitumor T cell responses. The depletion of MTMs accelerated tumorigenesis in both spontaneous and orthotopically transplanted mammary tumor models. Upon induction of a productive antitumor response via the depletion of regulatory T cells, MTMs assumed an alternatively activated state and expressed eotaxins, thereby attracting eosinophils to peritumoral regions. MTMs expressed the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, which induced both MTM activation and eosinophil recruitment. These results suggest that MTMs can sense IL-33 and recruit eosinophils to facilitate antitumor immunity, a mechanism that may operate during tumor progression and be further enhanced during productive antitumor responses.",

          "abstract": "Despite the many studies on the ubiquitin–proteasome system, our understanding of the proteasome itself is limited. The balance and regulation of 26S and 30S proteasomes are not yet known. Here, we show that among the proteasome base assembly chaperones, only S5b/PSMD5 determines the levels of proteasome holoenzymes, especially the 30S proteasome, in mammals. In a variety of cell lines and mouse tissues, we found that apart from its role in yeast 19S proteasome assembly, loss of S5b/PSMD5 increased assembly toward the 26S and 30S proteasomes. During the process, we identified proteasome complexes that may represent alternative assembly intermediates, including the 19S base complex and 20S complexes harboring 19S subunits, eventually leading to a shift in the overall steady-state level of the 26S and 30S proteasomes. Intriguingly, the addition of the S5b/PSMD5 protein in vitro and its increase in cells efficiently disassembled the 30S proteasome into the 20S and 19S complexes. Increase in the 26S and 30S proteasomes over the 20S proteasome enhances the degradation of the aggregation-prone proteins and ubiquitinated proteins in cells and ameliorates cognitive impairment through the reduction of tau pathology in PS19 mice. These results suggest that 26S and 30S proteasomes are manipulated by S5b/PSMD5 and are beneficial for mitigating proteinopathy in mammals.",

On Venus, the coexistence of large volcanic highlands—interpreted as the surface expression of long-lived mantle plumes—alongside coronae, smaller features thought to be caused by transient thermal diapirs, remains enigmatic. Using two-dimensional numerical models of mantle convection with sharp and broad mineral phase transitions for pyrolite, we show that both scales of upwellings can be generated in a stagnant lid planet with an interior temperature 250 to 400 K warmer than Earth’s. The smaller plumes originate from a ~600 km deep internal layer that exists as a consequence of the different sequence of mineral phase transitions that occur in warmer mantles less processed and differentiated by partial melting and volcanism. Future models that include melting will provide further tests of our hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "The RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF) are essential components of the RAS-ERK signaling pathway, which controls vital cellular processes and is frequently dysregulated in human disease. Notably, mutations that alter BRAF function are prominent drivers of human cancer and certain RASopathy disorders, making BRAF an important target for therapeutic intervention. Despite extensive research, several aspects of BRAF regulation remain unclear. In this study, we developed an in vitro BRAF activation assay using purified autoinhibited BRAF:14-3-3 2 :MEK complexes. Our results show that fully processed, active-state KRAS alone can promote dimer-dependent BRAF activation. Moreover, we found that phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes synergized with KRAS to promote BRAF activation, achieving activity levels comparable to those observed with BRAF proteins that constitutively dimerize. In contrast, the SMP phosphatase complex had only a minimal effect on BRAF catalytic activity in this system but mediated the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory pS365 14-3-3 binding site in a manner that was accelerated by the presence of KRAS alone or KRAS and 30% PS liposomes. Finally, we show that inhibitors blocking the BRAF RBD:KRAS interaction were able to suppress the in vitro activation of BRAF, underscoring the critical role of RAS binding in initiating the disassembly of the BRAF autoinhibited state. Thus, this assay provides valuable insights into the steps required for BRAF activation and can serve as an effective screening tool for identifying compounds that may inhibit this process and have therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "The noncoding small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associate with a large set of proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). While the function of snRNAs is well characterized, the regulation of their transcription remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugation regulates snRNA3′ end processing. To further study the connection between SUMOylation and snRNA biogenesis, we generated a CRISPR/dCas9 tool comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the catalytic domain of the SUMO protease SENP1 (dCas9-SENP1). Here, we show that snRNA transcription decreases when dCas9-SENP1 is delivered to their promoter-proximal sequence elements (PSE), indicating that SUMO conjugation to proteins associated with snRNA promoters is necessary for proper transcriptional activity. Focusing on SNAPC1, a subunit of the snRNA-specific transcription complex SNAPc, we identified lysine residues 245 and 333 as SUMO acceptor sites and generated a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of this protein (SNAPC1 2KR). To explore the relevance of SNAPC1 SUMOylation on snRNA transcription, we generated a cell line carrying an inducible degron system for depletion of the endogenous SNAPC1 protein. This system led us to demonstrate that SNAPC1 2KR is unable to sustain basal levels of snRNA transcription. By tagging endogenous SNAPC3 and SNAPC4, two other subunits of SNAPc, we show that while SNAPC1 SUMOylation-deficient mutant is able to interact with SNAPC3, its interaction with SNAPC4 is affected, despite the fact it is still recruited to the PSE. Altogether, these results indicate that SNAPC1 SUMOylation is required for proper snRNA transcription and SNAPc complex assembly.",

          "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases present one of the most significant global health challenges. These disorders are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates that impair synaptic function and cause progressive neuronal degeneration. Therefore, stimulating protein clearance mechanisms may be neuro-protective. Variants in FBXO7/PARK15 cause Parkinsonian Pyramidal Syndrome, an early-onset parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder in humans, and inactivation of this gene in mice recapitulates many phenotypes seen in patients. The proteasome regulator PI31 is a direct binding partner of Fbxo7 and promotes local protein degradation at synapses by mediating fast proteasome transport in neurites. PI31 protein levels are reduced when the function of Fbxo7 is impaired. Here we show that restoring PI31 levels in Fbxo7 mutant fly and mouse strains prevents neuronal degeneration and significantly improves neuronal function, health, and lifespan. Notably, Fbxo7 inactivation in mouse neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and this was suppressed by transgenic expression of PI31. Our results demonstrate that PI31 is a crucial biological target through which Fbxo7 deficiency drives pathology. Therefore, targeting the PI31-pathway may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",

          "abstract": "Insulin potently decreases blood glucose; thus, tight control is required to prevent excessive insulin release and hypoglycemia. Central to this inhibition is somatostatin released from delta cells that are clustered with beta cells in pancreatic islets. This communication is of interest because the loss of functional beta cells in diabetes leads to uncontrolled delta cell activity that disrupts islet paracrine crosstalk. While it is established that insulin and somatostatin secretion are coordinated, the specific mechanism is unsettled. We have previously demonstrated that beta cells release the hormone Urocortin 3 to stimulate delta cells at high glucose, demonstrating a paracrine negative feedback loop. Others have proposed direct coordination via gap junctions. To resolve this conundrum, we used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of beta and delta cells in low (2.8 mM) (LG) and high (16.8 mM) glucose (HG). Surprisingly, while many delta cells exhibit Ca 2+ oscillations in HG that are coordinated with beta cells, the activation of these delta cells precedes beta cells and is more variable than beta cell responses. The selective delta cell knockout of connexin 36 confirmed the involvement of gap junctions. However, blockade of vesicle release with the Rho-GTPase inhibitor ML-141 completely removed coupling between beta and most delta cells in HG. Our data reveal considerable functional heterogeneity among delta cells, where most delta cells are entrained by oscillatory Ca 2+ behaviors of beta cells that are mediated by a combination of paracrine signaling and low-density gap junction coupling.",

          "abstract": "Palytoxin (PTX), a potent marine toxin, has long been known to transform Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA), an indispensable ion pump, into a nonselective cation channel. It has been postulated that PTX takes control of the two gates on either side of a channel-like pore. These gates normally open and close alternately, synchronized with chemical events, never opening simultaneously. A critical question is whether palytoxin takes over the control of the two gates or creates a new pathway. Here, we present structures of NKA with bound palytoxin in three different states. PTX binds to NKA in E2P, occupying the physiological Na + exit pathway, similar to istaroxime, a new-generation cardiotonic steroid. Adding Na + and ATP/ADP to the NKA·PTX complex induces an open channel traversing the entire membrane alongside the physiological ion pathway. As AlF x , a stable transition state analog of phosphate replaces phosphate in the NKA·PTX complex preformed in E2P, the complex appears to undergo the normal reaction cycle from E2P to E1· n Na + . PTX occupies the space between the transmembrane helices M4 and M6, thereby preventing the closure of the extracellular half of the ion pathway. These structures demonstrate that the architecture of NKA is fundamentally different from “a pore with two gates.” Each half of the ion pathway comprises three segments, including a movable component that plays a pivotal role in translocating the bound cations by connecting the constant part to an appropriate inlet. The ion pathway of NKA transforms dynamically, ensuring that the two halves never exist simultaneously.",

We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ordinary differential equation (ODE) inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "abstract": "During wound healing, tumor growth, and organ formation, epithelial cells migrate and cluster in layered tissue environments. Although cellular mechanosensing of adhered extracellular matrices is now well recognized, it is unclear how deeply cells sense through distant matrix layers. Since single cells can mechanosense stiff basal surfaces through soft hydrogels of &lt;10 μm thickness, here we ask whether cellular collectives can perform such “depth-mechanosensing” through thicker matrix layers. Using a collagen-polyacrylamide double-layer hydrogel, we found that epithelial cell collectives can mechanosense basal substrates at a depth of &gt;100 μm, assessed by cell clustering and collagen deformation. On collagen layers with stiffer basal substrates, cells initially migrate slower while performing higher collagen deformation and stiffening, resulting in reduced dispersal of epithelial clusters. These processes occur in two broad phases: cellular clustering and dynamic collagen deformation, followed by cell migration and dispersal. Using a cell-populated collagen-polyacrylamide computational model, we show that stiffer basal substrates enable higher collagen deformation, which in turn extends the clustering phase of epithelial cells and reduces their dispersal. Disruption of collective collagen deformation, by either α-catenin depletion or myosin-II inhibition, disables the depth-mechanosensitive differences in epithelial responses between soft and stiff basal substrates. These findings suggest that depth-mechanosensing is an emergent property that arises from collective collagen deformation caused by epithelial cell clusters. This work broadens the conventional understanding of epithelial mechanosensing from immediate surfaces to underlying basal matrices, providing insights relevant to tissue contexts with layers of varying stiffness, such as wound healing and tumor invasion.",

Combining these methods with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can extend their reach. However, the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the choice of the active space complicates the consistent evaluation of energies and gradients across structurally diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the weighted active space protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrated the approach on the TiC + -catalyzed C–H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn–Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.",

Based on sequence differences among repeat units, we clustered individual sequences into 7 VNTR structural alleles called Types. Three Types were related through large duplications, but the other Types diverged much earlier such that only 12 repeat units at the 5′ end of the VNTR were shared across most Types. The most diverged Types were rare and present only in individuals with African ancestry, but a multiallelic structural polymorphism was present across populations at different frequencies, consistent with expansion of the VNTR preceding the emergence of early hominins. We demonstrated that this polymorphism was in complete linkage disequilibrium with fine-mapped schizophrenia variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and that this risk haplotype was associated with decreased CACNA1C gene expression in the brain.

          "abstract": "The TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain is an ancient protein module that functions in immune and cell death responses across the Tree of Life. TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins—many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the “AtTIRome”) to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRome’s cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure–function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the “BB-loop”, a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein. These findings shed light on the diversity of TIR outputs and reveal methods to design and engineer TIR-based immune receptors.",

          "abstract": "Tropical cyclones are expected to intensify more rapidly with warming, but relatively little work has examined whether they could expand more rapidly with warming, too. Recent theory predicts that peak expansion rate should increase with sea surface temperature (SST), and physical arguments suggest this dependence should be specifically on the relative SST, i.e. the SST difference from the tropical mean. We test this hypothesis with historical observational data, in which SST variations are primarily variations in relative SST. Both average and peak expansion rates are found to systematically increase with relative SST globally across the Northern Hemisphere (27.2 and 37.5 km/d/K) and within each individual basin. Results are robust across both reanalysis and Best Track observational datasets. Uniform-SST aquaplanet simulations show a much weaker dependence of maximum expansion rate on absolute SST, suggesting that the dominant dependence is on relative SST. Hence, mean global warming is not expected to strongly change storm size dynamics, but patterns of sea surface warming may play an important role in determining how storm size, and hence coastal risk, may change in the future. This work can also help improve forecasting of the wind field and its hazards and impacts at landfall.",

          "abstract": "γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in inhibition in the adult brain. Structural and electrophysiological studies have provided numerous insights into the receptor’s functioning but the complete molecular mechanism of GABA A R action remains elusive. Herein, we used high-resolution single-channel recording to analyze point-mutated α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors and applied so called Φ value (REFER, rate-equilibrium free energy relationship) analysis which allows to infer the order of domains engagement during activation, offering a complementary “dynamic” insight into the receptor’s function. As anticipated, point mutations at the orthosteric binding sites reduced GABA binding affinity, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing progressively with increasing distance from the binding site. On the contrary, mutations located all over the macromolecule’s structure, e.g., in “peripheral top position,” extracellular/transmembrane interface, and channel pore, affected the receptor with a clear tendency to influence entire gating including opening/closing, preactivation, and desensitization with no clear correlation with the distance to the channel gate. Interestingly, the calculated Φ values for the GABA A R showed a relatively narrow range (0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that the conformational transitions are highly synchronized and coordinated by a global network of interactions. This prediction is also in agreement with observation that, typically, single GABA A R residue mutation alters the kinetics of not just one but many (often all) conformational transitions. We thus propose a dictum reflecting modus operandi of the GABA A R: Binding is local and gating is global. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that GABA A R shows particularly strong functional compactness manifested as global gating mechanisms and high allostery.",

          "abstract": "Bubble-mediated gas exchange associated with wave breaking is a critical pathway for ocean–atmosphere exchange of low solubility gases such as oxygen. Yet, ocean and climate models, as well as observation-based products, usually rely on wind-only air–sea flux formulations derived from carbon constraints that ignore the asymmetric nature of the bubble flux, contributing to discrepancies between estimates of oxygen inventories and their response to climate change. Without bubbles, gas exchange is controlled by a symmetric wind-driven exchange, with the ocean–atmosphere gas partial pressure difference controlling whether outgassing or uptake occurs. Bubbles entrained by wave breaking can enhance this symmetric turbulent exchange, and contribute an additional asymmetric flux, always leading to an uptake, as they get squeezed by hydrostatic pressure (large bubbles) or collapse and fully dissolve (small bubbles). We present an observation-constrained theoretical framework of the air–sea flux accounting for air entrainment due to wave breaking and symmetric and asymmetric bubble exchange. The combined evidence from theory, laboratory, and field measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes, oxygen concentration, and noble gas supersaturation yields a universal formulation of gas exchange which we implement into a global ocean biogeochemical model. We discuss the resulting oxygen fluxes and demonstrate that our wind–wave–bubble formulation better reproduces observed in situ oxygen concentrations in water mass formation regions, where air–sea exchange is high, than a commonly used wind-only formulation. We show that the asymmetric bubble flux is essential for evaluating air–sea oxygen fluxes and estimating the magnitude of the ocean oxygen loss associated with global warming.",

To avoid untenable lipid contacts with polar backbone atoms, they use the continuous hydrogen bonding achieved by α-helices or β-barrels to traverse membranes. Here, we show that integrin αX, and by homology αM, undermine this paradigm by partially unfolding the N-terminal third of their transmembrane (TM) helix. Unfolding results in a dynamic, frayed helix that weakens the association with its partnering β2 subunit to lower the activation threshold of integrin αXβ2-mediated cell adhesion. The extent of unfolding depends on membrane geometry, thereby establishing a mechanism for sensing membrane properties. The combination of adhesive control with sensory capacity in integrin αXβ2 and αMβ2 may achieve membrane localization-dependent receptor activation in leukocyte phagocytosis. The unfolding of the αX TM helix arises from a high number of α-helix-destabilizing residues that TM helices in general approach but do not exceed. Accordingly, backbone dynamics of TM helices may disrupt hydrogen bonds, modulate protein function, and optimize TM helix rigidity.",

          "abstract": "Francis Crick’s global parameterization of coiled coil geometry has been widely useful for guiding design of new protein structures and functions. However, design guided by similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal barrel geometry required to maintain interstrand hydrogen bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta barrels have been designed using two-dimensional structural blueprints; while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control over the global shape. Here, we show that the simplicity and control over shape and structure provided by parametric representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by taking advantage of the rich sequence–structure relationships implicit in RoseTTAFold-based design methods. Starting from parametrically generated barrel backbones, both RFjoint inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate backbone irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that for beta barrels across a broad range of beta sheet parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of a rare barrel topology, and de novo designed transmembrane nanopores with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high success rates of deep learning–based protein design methods, our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more precisely specifiable and accessible.",

However, the selectivity of the chaperones mediating Rubisco assembly in vascular plants toward their cognate Rubisco presents a substantive roadblock to both Rubisco protein engineering and transgenic expression of heterologous Rubisco orthologs, both of which necessitate changes to the Rubisco sequence. Here, we ask whether a plant Rubisco chaperone can be reprogrammed by directed evolution to accommodate a nonnative client. We developed a selection strategy to assess Rubisco assembly factor activity in high-throughput and used this selection to identify mutants of the chaperone Raf1 from Arabidopsis thaliana ( At Raf1) that assemble Nicotiana tabacum Rubisco, for which wild-type At Raf1 has minimal activity. We show that directed evolution can generate At Raf1 variants that enable significantly increased N. tabacum Rubisco assembly compared to wild-type At Raf1. Evaluation of evolved At Raf1s indicates that they retain the ability to assemble their native client and can assemble other dicot Rubisco orthologs that they were not evolved to recognize.

          "abstract": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a voltage-gated cation channel that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular excitability, especially in cardiac pacemaker cells and neurons. Its dysregulation is linked to heart diseases such as bradycardia and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain. Structural and functional studies have revealed that the S4 voltage sensor of the HCN channel moves downward during hyperpolarization. Recent structural studies of HCN channels have shown that the extracellular portion of the S4 segment is approximately three helical turns longer than that of voltage-gated K + (Kv) channels. However, whether this extended extracellular part of S4 plays a functional role in gating is still unknown. In this study, utilizing the available HCN4 channel structures, we examined the formation of salt bridges in the extracellular part of S4 with the S5 segment and the S1-S2 linker. Results from charge-swapped mutants and double cysteine mutants suggested that sequential, stepwise salt bridge formation involving the extracellular positively charged amino acids of S4 plays a role in the voltage-dependent gating of HCN channels. Furthermore, we applied voltage clamp fluorometry to confirm that the extracellular salt bridge network affects the S4 movement. This extracellular S4 portion includes disease-related arginine residues, R375 and R378. Our results suggest that disruption of salt bridge formation may perturb the smooth transition of S4 movement and cause HCN channel dysfunction.",

By developing a theoretical “spectral” approach to this problem based on quantum-accurate grain boundary site distributions, we show how grain boundaries can be cooperatively alloyed, whether by depletion or enrichment. We provide machine-learned cosegregation information for over 700 ternary aluminum-based alloys and experimentally validate the concept in one ternary alloy where cosegregation is not expected by prior models but is expected based on the cooperative model.",

In this study, we use intergenerational single-nucleus omics to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of seasonal temperature changes in fruits containing developing seeds of the next generation. We show that the sensing of temperature takes place specifically in maternal fruit tissues and that mothers preadapt their progeny to maternal temperature through the intergenerational flux of the hormone ABA to the zygote itself where it is sensed to affect dormancy. We conclude that mothers can control filial traits via direct transfer of hormones to progeny and propose that this is an important mechanism by which populations can rapidly adapt to environmental change.",

We analyzed mitochondrial genetic data from individuals interred at sites that date to earlier (A.D. 700–1200) and later (A.D. 1200–1450) time periods, which allowed us to examine changes in gene pools over time and to test these migration hypotheses. Comparing the full mitogenomes from 114 individuals, we show that low levels of migration occurred diachronically, although they still may have contributed to hybridized cultural practices.

Systemic and tubular-specific knockout of ACSM3 both exacerbated renal fibrosis, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ACSM3 overexpression alleviated fibrotic kidneys in mice. Mechanistically, ACSM3 deficiency disrupted MCFA metabolism and resulted in abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably, we identified that dodecanoic acid (C12:0) could improve kidney fibrosis, which was primarily utilized via ACSM3 in kidneys.

These phase separations, which in the laboratory manifest as hydrogels and in cells as membrane free structures (liquid condensates) such as P bodies and stress granules, form hubs for molecular processes such as transcription and messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and also underlie the selectivity of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which act a barriers to large molecules unless they are escorted by specific LCD containing nuclear transporters that interact with LCD containing nucleoporins within NPC channels.

Functional characterization using Slc39a8 A391T knock-in mice and kidney-specific Slc39a8 knockout mice reveals that loss of SLC39A8 function reduces renal zinc accumulation, thereby mitigating susceptibility to kidney injury and disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that perturbed zinc homeostasis drives renal damage, and limiting zinc levels—whether via impaired SLC39A8 activity or direct chelation—activates the zinc–AKT–FOXO1–G6PC axis to confer protection. Critically, zinc chelation with EDTA recapitulates this benefit, significantly preventing and ameliorating experimental acute and chronic kidney disease.

It is unclear how the membrane’s continuity and dimensionality impact pattern formation. Here, we address this gap using the MinDE system, a prototypical example of pattern-forming membrane proteins. We show that when the lipid substrate is fragmented into submicrometer-sized diffusive liposomes, adenosine triphosphate-driven protein–protein interactions generate three-dimensional (3D) spatially extended patterns, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. Remarkably, these 3D patterns emerge at scales four orders of magnitude larger than the individual liposomes. By systematically varying protein concentration, liposome size, and density, we observed and characterized a variety of 3D dynamical patterns not seen on continuous 2D membranes, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals, and a coexistence phase. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model revealed that the physical properties of the dispersed membrane effectively rescale both the protein–membrane binding rates and diffusion, two key parameters governing pattern formation and wavelength selection. These findings highlight the robustness of Min’s pattern-forming ability, suggesting that protein–membrane suspensions could serve as an adaptable template for studying out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo contexts.",

          "abstract": "Recent discovery of “extreme clustering” of inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flow suggests a hidden mechanism of particle–particle interaction at sub-Kolmogorov separations unexplained by hydrodynamic interaction. The near-contact radial distribution function (RDF) reaches O ( 10 4 ) , resulting in a collision kernel four orders larger than direct numerical simulation predictions. Statistical stationarity is lost in the particle-laden turbulence, suggesting the particles experience a nonequilibrium process. We hypothesize dielectric particles in isotropic turbulence experience contact electrification through interparticle collisions, creating inhomogeneous mosaic surface charge. These mosaic charges lead to attractive forces and thereby extreme clustering and collision amplification, forming a positive feedback loop. To explore this potential mechanism, we investigated hollow glass spheres dispersed in a high-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic air turbulence chamber using high-resolution 3D particle tracking velocimetry and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). We measured RDF, particle-pair mean-inward radial relative velocity, and mean radial relative acceleration (RA) with time up to 10 min. We sampled particles from the flow chamber through time and evaluated their nanoscopic charge distribution using KPFM. We found that both RDF and mosaic surface charge increase with time; RA at close separations is attractive, intensifies as particles approach, and grows in time; and the turbulence-exposed RA curves collapse when nondimensionalized by the dipole–dipole acceleration calculated from mosaic charge distributions. These results support the proposed mechanism—Inhomogeneous Mosaic Potential Amplified Collisions in Turbulence (IMPACT). Better understanding and modeling of these effects could improve predictions for air pollution, weather patterns, and drug manufacturing—where particle interactions have big impacts.",

          "abstract": "Winds generate waves over the oceans with a wide range of properties. The largest wave heights and periods are important parameters in the design of marine structures. Extreme waves also play an outsize role in air–sea fluxes and coastal dynamics, and leave imprints on seismic and sediment records. Rare events have so far escaped measurements, with few wave heights from satellite altimeters exceeding 16 m, and no associated measurement of wave periods. Here, we use swells radiated from storms to reveal long wave periods within the storms, and their generation mechanism. Swells are resolved in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite sea level measurements. Patterns of increasing swell wavelength and decreasing swell height away from storms are consistent with a nonlinear transfer of energy from short to long period waves. We propose an updated parametric shape for wave spectra in storms that aligns with SWOT swell measurements. It reduces energy levels by a factor of 20 at 1.2 to 1.4 times the peak period compared to commonly used spectral shapes and allows estimation of storm wave periods from swell heights. Consistent with less extreme conditions, the peak period generally increases with wave height. This was particularly verified for the largest storm peak period of 20.2 ± 0.6 s, obtained for the event with the largest significant wave height 19.7 ± 0.3 m measured by altimeters. These observations of long period swells should have a wide range of applications from coastal dynamics to seismology.",

          "abstract": "The optimal control of finite-time processes on the microscale is of significant theoretical and practical interest, particularly for the energy-efficient operation of nanomachines. While previous studies have primarily focused on transitions between equilibrium states, many biologically and technologically relevant processes occur far from equilibrium. In such nonequilibrium settings, memory, a ubiquitous feature in realistic systems, plays an intricate role, as any driving necessarily excites internal memory modes. This motivates a deeper exploration of optimal control strategies in nonequilibrium regimes. Here, we combine experiments, theory, and computational methods to investigate the transition of a colloidal particle confined in an optical trap between two nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). We identify optimal control protocols that minimize the thermodynamic work during the finite-time transition between two NESS. We compare optimal protocols in viscous and viscoelastic fluid environments, which are common in realistic technical and biological processes and introduce memory due to a delayed response. Regardless of the presence of memory effects, optimal protocols consistently balance energy extraction with dissipation minimization. In the presence of memory, optimal control is achieved if the protocol matches the time response of the environment. These findings offer key insights for designing optimal control strategies for finite-time, nonequilibrium processes in complex environments.",

In this study, we found that increased severity in IAV infection and reduced innate immune response correlated with extensive mitophagy in senescent human cells and in the lung of aged mice. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) was identified as strongly elevated in the lungs and sera of aged human (&gt;65 y old) and mouse (&gt;21 mo old). ApoD was able to localize to mitochondria and interact, through its WXXI motif in the LC3B-Interacting Region domain, with LC3B to trigger mitophagy during IAV infection, in a PINK1 pathway independent manner, which attenuated type I interferon response and promoted virus replication. ApoD deficiency, on the other hand, protected older mice from severe influenza and improved survival. Likewise, depletion of senescent cells by ABT-263, a senolytic compound, in aged mice lowered ApoD level and restored innate immune antiviral response, limiting virus propagation and associated pulmonary damage. Thus, age-induced ApoD drives IAV-mediated mitophagy, and promotes virus replication and infection severity, and is therefore a promising target for inhibition to improve disease outcome in older patients.",

This study uses multiple techniques, including X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate 54 pre-Neolithic burials from 11 archaeological sites located across Southeastern Asia. The findings confirm that many of these pre-Neolithic flexed and squatting burials were treated by an extended period of smoke-drying over fire, a process of mummification similar to that recorded ethnographically in some Australian and Highland New Guinea societies.

          "abstract": "Wnt signaling plays a crucial role for many developmental processes. It is also pivotal in the generation and limited treatment outcomes of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we identified Wnt7b, which is markedly upregulated in GBM patients, as a determinant of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (αPD1; anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) in a clinically relevant, αPD1-resistant GBM murine model with abundant stem cells. We observed that increased levels of Wnt7b and β-catenin correlated with the resistance to αPD1. Treatment combining a porcupine inhibitor WNT974 with αPD1 reprogrammed the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to bolster antitumor immune responses and extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM, with 25% long-term survivors. Our causal studies revealed that WNT974 potentiated αPD1 therapy by the expansion of antigen presenting DC3-like dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, WNT974 combination with αPD1 was associated with a reduction in immune suppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an increase in the Ki67+CD8/Ki67+regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio, tilting the CD8:Treg balance in the TME toward antitumor immune response, and more pronounced GrzB+CD8+ effector T cells. Conversely, an increase in monocytic MDSCs and phosphorylation of pro-oncogenic proteins was associated with resistance to the combination therapy. Collectively, our preclinical findings provide a strong rationale to test Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibition with αPD1 therapy in GBM patients with elevated Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling.",

However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.",

We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.",

Initially this fibroblast response reorganized fibrillar collagen and stiffened the myocardium albeit without depositing fibrotic tissue. These adaptations coincided with heightened matrix-integrin receptor interactions and diastolic tension sensation at focal adhesions within fibroblasts. Targeted p38 deletion arrested these cardiac fibroblast responses in DCM mice, which prevented cardiomyocyte remodeling and improved contractility.

This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM 2.5 pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.",

          "abstract": "Oxytocin is essential in shaping social behavior across the lifespan. Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.",

Among photosynthetic organisms, PSI-LHC (light-harvesting complex) structures exhibit substantial differences in their sizes, reflecting adaptation to different light environments. Here we report the structure of a PSI-fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein (FCPI) supercomplex from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Eh) at 2.79-angstrom resolution by cryo–electron microscopy, which showed a huge Eh-PSI-FCPI supercomplex containing 38 peripheral Eh-FCPI antennae and a linker protein (EhLP) in addition to the PSI core. A network of 819 pigments was found in Eh-PSI-FCPI, which functions to capture and transfer light energy with 95% quantum efficiency. This elucidates how its modular Eh-FCPI arrangement contributes to the expansion of PSI cross section and efficient light harvesting.",

          "abstract": "Isolated cluster systems can help to elucidate the molecular level description of water-mediated proton transfer. Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.",

This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked.

We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change. Yet protected tropical areas saw up to an 82% reduction in fragmentation, underscoring the potential of targeted conservation.",

We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation and reduced transmission, and structural analyses revealed their epitopes.

The blowout persisted for 112 days, releasing ~109,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. Elevated air toxics and fine particle pollutant levels were also measured in nearby communities. We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility. Furthermore, we observed a dose-response effect, where the odds of low birthweight were highest among women living closest to the well and attenuated out.",

We combine provider knowledge assessments and over 2000 anonymous standardized patient visits to providers in India to examine why they overprescribe antibiotics for pediatric diarrhea and figure out how to reduce overprescribing. Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge. Using randomized experiments, we revealed that the know-do gap stems from providers’ beliefs that patients want antibiotics, not from profit motives or lack of alternative treatments. Yet, a discrete choice experiment suggests patients do not prefer providers who give antibiotics. Our findings indicate that addressing provider misperceptions about patient preferences may be more effective than standard information-based interventions in reducing antibiotic overuse.",

          "abstract": "Oxidase-based electrochemical biosensors are widely deployed for point-of-use applications, yet oxygen interference remains a major challenge, substantially reducing sensing accuracy. Here, we developed a universal enzymatic O 2 scavenger composed of alcohol oxidase, catalase, and paraformaldehyde to eliminate O 2 within the sensor by converting it to water. Unlike other oxidases, alcohol oxidase exclusively uses O 2 as an electron acceptor, preventing interference with the electron transfer chain involving the sensing oxidase. We demonstrated the compatibility of this O 2 scavenger for calibration-free sensing of glucose, lactate, and creatinine in the concentration range relevant to human health. Without the O 2 scavenger, sensor readings were less than 50% of those under inert gas conditions. With the O 2 scavenger, the accuracy improved to 99%, even at low substrate concentrations. The general compatibility and performances of this alcohol oxidase-based O 2 scavenger unlock the full potential of oxidase-based biosensors for reliable point-of-use sensing.",

We show that Pacific mastodons fall within a deeply divergent mitochondrial clade, extending the range of this species into western Canada and potentially Mexico.

          "abstract": "Current treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fall short of meeting clinical needs, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of PDAC progression, which involves not only biochemical signals but also essential biomechanical cues. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression. This research reveals a promising approach for treating PDAC by focusing on biomechanical cues.",

Thanks to the cyclic shift symmetry in the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) of bosonic modes, the DFT measurement outcomes can be used to deterministically project multiqubit states onto W states. Experimentally, we show that three-qubit W state discrimination can be achieved by detecting the cyclic shift symmetry with a three-mode DFT optical circuit, yielding a measurement discrimination fidelity of 0.871 ± 0.039.

Single-cell sequencing places Padi4 in both progenitor and differentiated hair lineage cells and indicates that PADI4 acts to repress transcription during hair follicle development. We establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting on LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and ribosomal RNA transcription in vivo. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 citrullinates the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and reveal a cross-talk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.

          "abstract": "A critical yet challenging step in protein complex assembly is the formation of a dimeric intermediate that serves as a seed for incorporating additional subunits. We hypothesized that this step could be facilitated by “bi-handed” chaperones that recognize two different subunits through distinct domains (hands). However, whether such chaperones exist remained unknown. Here, we identify AAGAB as a bona fide bi-handed chaperone. AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD. This hemicomplex is subsequently transferred to the GD via a GD:σ2 binding interface, accompanied by conformational maturation. These findings establish AAGAB as the founding member of a bi-handed chaperone family and reveal an intramolecular handover mechanism that underlies their mode of action.",

          "abstract": "Vomiting is a common yet poorly understood symptom, largely due to the lack of conventional animal models. This study establishes a Drosophila model for vomiting triggered by berberine ingestion. Our findings reveal that this response is mediated by the chemoreceptor TrpA1, which is indirectly activated by berberine via the mAChRs-PLC pathway. Berberine induces acetylcholine release from foregut epithelial cells, which triggers tachykinin secretion from intestinal tracheal cells. Tachykinins contract the visceral muscles, particularly the P4 pump of the foregut, and suppress myosuppressin release from pars intercerebralis neurons, thereby promoting crop motility. We further demonstrate the conservation of key genes involved in mammalian vomiting regulation. Overall, this study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding vomiting and introduces Drosophila as a genetic model for mechanistic studies.",

This study demonstrates a transient electric field reversal at the MoTe 2 /Pt Schottky junction, enabling photoconductivity inversion from negative to positive within 100 ps. By applying ultrafast photocurrent detection, a minimal voltage variation (10 mV) precisely controls this transition, and a device with a remarkable photocurrent response time of 3.8 ps is proposed.

While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration. This study establishes three advances: (i) TREM2 exhibits stage-dependent neuroprotective/neurotoxic roles, (ii) photoreceptor metabolites dictate microglia/myeloid cell fate via STAT2, and (iii) microglial apoptosis spreads through membrane signaling complexes.

          "abstract": "Lubricated friction is a multiscale problem where molecular processes dictate the macroscopic response of the system. Traditional lubrication models rely on semiempirical constitutive relations, which become unreliable under extreme conditions. Here, we present a simulation framework that seamlessly couples molecular and continuum models for boundary lubrication without fixed-form constitutive laws. We train Gaussian process regression models as surrogates for predicting interfacial shear and normal stress in molecular dynamics simulations. An active learning algorithm ensures that our model adapts in scenarios where common constitutive laws fail, such as at layering transitions. We demonstrate our approach for nanoscale fluid flow over rough and heterogeneous surfaces, paving the way for accurate boundary lubrication simulations at experimental length and timescales.",

          "abstract": "Phase transitions of metamaterials are critical in advancing energy conversion efficiency and controlling mechanical performance. However, the design method and localized perception of phase transitions remain challenging. Inspired by the passive coupling mechanisms in ostrich locomotion, this work proposes nonreciprocal metamaterials that can perceive real-time phase transition. These architectures enable the topological solitons to propagate unidirectionally and overcome dispersive and dissipative effects through bistable-to-monostable state switching between adjacent units. The integration of electromagnetic resonators within the metamaterial units enables real-time detection of dynamic phase transitions, as soliton propagation or external loads induce resonance frequency shifts between distinct stable states. By arraying these mechanoreceptive units and the combination of the machine learning, it can encode information and compute programmatically. Furthermore, the mechanoreceptors hold promising applications in robotics. This work provides an approach for integrating phase transition perception and nonlinear wave manipulation and offers insights into dynamic material intelligence and energy management systems.",

By combining first-principles simulations with machine learning, we unveil the complex quantum dynamics of SrTiO 3 emerging after terahertz laser pumping. We disclose the microscopic origin of the phonon upconversion, observed experimentally but not fully understood, and quantify the lifetime of the out-of-equilibrium motion, which is beyond the reach of the state-of-the-art simplified models.

Here, we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration, suggesting that they limit the window of time available for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 escapes the inhibitory activity of INSTIs and underscore the importance of genotypic analysis outside IN in PWH experiencing VF on INSTI-containing drug regimens.",

Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.",

In contrast, agents that decelerate relaxation were hitherto unknown. Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as 15 N-pyridine, 1,4- 13 C 2 -succinate, and 1- 15 N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner. Here, we report on a previously unrecognized effect in which the tracers’ longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in aqueous solution are substantially reduced by adding nicotinamide, urea, glycerol, or dendrons. The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s p K a where T 1 can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the 15 N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1- 15 N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond.",

MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD.

Loss of CB5LP in Arabidopsis causes embryonic defects, seedling lethality, and accumulation of 14α-methyl-sterols, with reduced levels of sitosterol and stigmasterol—indicating a defect in sterol 14α-demethylation. TurboID-based proximity labeling and in vitro assays show that CB5LP physically and functionally interacts with CYP51, a cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing this demethylation step. Unlike canonical cytochrome b 5 proteins, CB5LP has a reversed topology and is exclusive to plants, acting as an evolutionarily distinct electron donor.

However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP 3 levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP 3 is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP 3 as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts.

Our analysis, combined with additional synthesis, supports a hypothesis that the net land sink is substantially weaker than commonly reported. At a global scale, our estimate of the net land carbon sink is 0.8 ± 0.7 petagrams of carbon per year from 2000 through 2019, nearly a factor of two lower than the Global Carbon Project estimate. With concurrent adjustments to ocean (+8%) and fossil fuel (−6%) fluxes, we develop a budget that partially reconciles key constraints provided by vegetation carbon, the north-south CO 2 gradient, and O 2 trends.

The heteroplasmic nature of mtDNA—where mutant and wild-type mtDNA coexist—complicates efforts to define its contribution to disease progression. In this study, bulk whole-genome sequencing of 637 matched tumor-normal samples from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project revealed an enrichment of functionally impactful mtDNA variants in specific pediatric leukemia subtypes. Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance. We reveal somatic mtDNA mutations as a potential source of functional heterogeneity and cellular diversity among leukemic cells, influencing their fitness and shaping disease progression.",

Rapid eye movement SD (REM SD) modulates the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, influencing the synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons. However, the precise mechanism remains undefined. To investigate this, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce 12 hours of REM SD, specifically targeting VIP neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our results show that REM SD mitigated depression by suppressing VIP neurons activity, which directly increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and, consequently, promoted synaptic plasticity recovery. In addition, the knockdown of VPAC2 on mPFC pyramidal neurons revealed that VPAC2-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in these neurons is essential for REM SD to mitigate depression-like behavior. These findings suggest that VIP neurons directly regulate pyramidal neurons and are crucial in alleviating depression by REM SD.",

Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role. These findings suggest that March MJO activity alone may not be a reliable predictor for ENSO evolution, but underscore the importance of North Pacific atmospheric variability.",

Knockout of either OsbZIP35 or OsTCP19 results in increased grain length, confirming their regulatory roles in grain development. The OsbZIP35-COR1-OsTCP19 module controls the expression of the cell cycle gene OsCycB1;4 , thereby modulating cell proliferation and ultimately determining grain size. Five haplotypes of COR1 were identified, with COR1 -Hap1 and COR1 -Hap3 being elite alleles associated with longer grains.

Multiomics analyses reveal activation of TCF7 and costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules in CD8 T rp cells. CD8 T rp cells suppress T cell expansion in vitro and in vivo. In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 T rp cells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 T reg cells and themselves.

To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms.

Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones.",

To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end inverse design methodology for acoustic tweezers based on coding metasurfaces, establishing a dual-objective, dual-scale optimization paradigm. At the microscale, the phase modulation and transmission efficiency are co-optimized through coupled physical models. While at the mesoscale, the particle suspension and rotation dynamics are considered.

Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life.

On the basis of a multimodel ensemble of historical aerosol forcing simulation for a period of global aerosol increase during 1965 to 1989, here, we show that the precipitation response shares a common southward displacement of tropical rain bands but the magnitude differs markedly among models, accounting for 76% of the intermodel uncertainty in zonal-mean precipitation change. Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change.",

          "abstract": "Influenza A viruses remain a global health threat, yet no universal antibody therapy exists. Clinical programs have centered on neutralizing mAbs, only to be thwarted by strain specificity and rapid viral escape. We instead engineered three non-neutralizing IgG2a mAbs that target distinct, overlapping epitopes within the conserved N terminus of the M2 ectodomain (M2e). Combined at low dose, this “triple M2e-mAb” confers robust prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice challenged with diverse human and zoonotic IAV strains, including highly pathogenic variants. Therapeutic efficacy depends on Fc-mediated effector activity via FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, rather than in vitro neutralization. Serial passaging in triple M2e-mAb–treated immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts failed to generate viral escape mutants. Our findings redefine the influenza-specific antibody therapeutic design and support Fc-optimized, non-neutralizing M2e-mAbs as a broadly effective, mutation-resistant, off-the-shelve therapy with direct relevance to human pandemic preparedness.",

          "abstract": "PTDSS1 (phosphatidylserine synthase 1) encodes an enzyme that facilitates production of phosphatidylserine (PS), which mediates a global immunosuppressive signal. Here, based on in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified PTDSS1 as a target to improve anti–PD-1 therapy. Depletion of Ptdss1 in tumor cells increased expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–regulated genes, including B2m , Cxcl9 , Cxcl10 , and Stat1 , even in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation in vitro. Loss of Ptdss1 in tumor cells also led to increased expression of MHC-I, enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, and increased frequency of an iNOS + myeloid subset. A gene signature derived from the iNOS + myeloid cell subset correlated with clinical benefit in patients treated with anti–PD-1 therapy. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Ptdss1 in different tumor models improved anti–PD-1 therapy. Together, our results provide insights on a therapeutic strategy for overcoming immunosuppression by inhibiting PTDSS1 and provide rationale for development of a combination immunotherapy strategy composed of PTDSS1 inhibition plus PD-1 blockade.",

          "abstract": "Mobile robots that simultaneously have fast speeds, sufficient load-carrying capabilities, and multiple locomotive functions have always been challenging to develop. Here, we introduce a liquid-amplified electrostatic rolling (LAER) mechanism, which elegantly integrates actuation and adhesion into a streamline single-degree-of-freedom structure. Based on this, we developed a rigid tethered LAER roller (0.015 grams) that exhibited a rapid moving speed of ~210 body length per second on ceilings and a flexible tethered roller (10.600 grams) that had a load-to-weight ratio of ~121 moving on the ground. Liquid regulating modules were embedded into LAER structures to exhibit controlled moving. We also developed a single-wheeled and two-wheeled untethered LAER robots with onboard power supply. Furthermore, we demonstrate a LAER linear actuator and a camera equipped untethered LAER robot for preliminary environmental monitoring. The lightweight, scalable LAER structure is promising to bring fast electrostatic actuators, motors, and robots with superior load-to-weight ratios and multimodal locomotion capabilities such as turning, circular moving, and plane-to-plane transitioning.",

          "abstract": "DNA with high storage density can serve as an alternative storage medium to respond to the global explosion of data growth and become a powerful personal storage memory if an integrated compact device can store and handle large-scale data.

We develop a compact DNA cassette tape drive and verify its functionality by randomly depositing incomplete images into the data partition, demonstrating a completely automated closed-loop operation involving addressing, recovery, removal, subsequent file deposition, and file recovery again, all accomplished within 50 min. Last, the complete image is restored by next-generation sequencing and decoding. DNA cassette tape provides a strategy for fast, compact, large-scale DNA-based cold or warm data storage.",

          "abstract": "Cell type–specific regulatory programs that drive type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the pancreas are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-nucleus multiomics and spatial transcriptomics in up to 32 nondiabetic (ND), autoantibody-positive (AAB + ), and T1D pancreas donors. Genomic profiles from 853,005 cells mapped to 12 pancreatic cell types, including multiple exocrine subtypes. β, Acinar, and other cell types, and related cellular niches, had altered abundance and gene activity in T1D progression, including distinct pathways altered in AAB + compared to T1D. We identified epigenomic drivers of gene activity in T1D and AAB + which, combined with genetic association, revealed causal pathways of T1D risk including antigen presentation in β cells. Last, single-cell and spatial profiles together revealed widespread changes in cell-cell signaling in T1D including signals affecting β cell regulation. Overall, these results revealed drivers of T1D in the pancreas, which form the basis for therapeutic targets for disease prevention.",

          "abstract": "Breastfeeding is essential for reducing infant morbidity and mortality, yet exclusive breastfeeding rates remain low, often because of insufficient milk production. The molecular causes of low milk production are not well understood. Fresh milk samples from 30 lactating individuals, classified by milk production levels across postpartum stages, were analyzed using genomic and microbiome techniques. Bulk RNA sequencing of milk fat globules (MFGs), milk cells, and breast tissue revealed that MFG-derived RNA closely mirrors luminal milk cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA analyses identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition, highlighting key genes ( GLP1R , PLIN4 , and KLF10 ) and cell-type differences between low and high producers. Infant microbiome diversity was influenced by feeding type but not maternal milk production. This study provides a comprehensive human milk transcriptomic catalog and highlights that MFG could serve as a useful biomarker for milk transcriptome analysis, offering insights into the genetic factors influencing milk production.",

          "abstract": "Integrins bind ligands between their alpha (α) and beta (β) subunits and transmit signals through conformational changes. Early in chordate evolution, some α subunits acquired an “inserted” (I) domain that expanded integrin’s ligand-binding repertoire but obstructed the ancestral ligand pocket, seemingly blocking conventional integrin activation. Here, we compare cryo–electron microscopy structures of apo and ligand-bound states of the I domain–containing αEβ 7 integrin and the I domain–lacking α 4 β 7 integrin to illuminate how the I domain intrinsically mimics an extrinsic ligand to preserve integrin function. We trace the I domain’s evolutionary origin to an ancestral collagen-collagen interaction domain, identifying an ancient molecular exaptation that facilitated integrin activation immediately upon I domain insertion. Our analyses reveal the evolutionary and biochemical basis of expanded cellular communication in vertebrates.",
