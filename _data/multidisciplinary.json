          "abstract": "In 2020, a global surge of activism linked to the Black Lives Matter movement prompted scientists to stage an academic ‘strike’, drawing attention to the ethical responsibility of addressing systemic racism. This catalysed debate in conservation, adding urgency to decades of scholarship on marginalization. In this Perspective, we review this literature and examine how exclusion in conservation persists across intersections of race, class, urban–rural divides, nationality and power dynamics from local to global levels. We highlight how marginalization and ‘othering’ disproportionately affect Black, Indigenous and people of colour (BIPOC) communities, especially in the Global South. Expansion of protected areas and the prioritization of individual animal lives over human well-being can intensify such inequities. We propose a framework for more inclusive conservation: recognizing and supporting human rights, ensuring local community agency, challenging entrenched norms in BIPOC engagement, and fostering educational opportunities led by and for BIPOC communities. Amid shifting global politics, including reduced US federal support for social and conservation issues, this framework provides guidance to counter racism and exclusion. By rethinking conservation practice, it seeks to build long-lasting, equitable and inclusive approaches that respect both people and nature.",

          "abstract": "Cancer metastasis is a major contributor to patient morbidity and mortality1, yet the factors that determine the organs where cancers can metastasize are incompletely understood. Here we quantify the absolute levels of 124 metabolites in multiple tissues in mice and investigate how this relates to the ability of breast cancer cells to grow in different organs. We engineered breast cancer cells with broad metastatic potential to be auxotrophic for specific nutrients and assessed their ability to colonize different tissue sites. We then asked how tumour growth in different tissues relates to nutrient availability and tumour biosynthetic activity. We find that single nutrients alone do not define the sites where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases. In addition, we identify purine synthesis as a requirement for tumour growth and metastasis across many tissues and find that this phenotype is independent of tissue nucleotide availability or tumour de novo nucleotide synthesis activity. These data suggest that a complex interplay between multiple nutrients within the microenvironment dictates potential sites of metastatic cancer growth, and highlights the interdependence between extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic cellular properties in influencing where breast cancer cells can grow as metastases.",

The Homo antecessor fossils from the TD6 layer of Gran Dolina at Atapuerca, Spain, dated between 950 ka and 770 ka (ref.  2 ), have been proposed as potential candidates for this ancestral population 3 . However, all securely dated Homo sapiens fossils before 90 ka were found either in Africa or at the gateway to Asia, strongly suggesting an African rather than a Eurasian origin of our species. Here we describe new hominin fossils from the Grotte à Hominidés at Thomas Quarry I (ThI-GH) in Casablanca, Morocco, dated to around 773 ka. These fossils are similar in age to H. antecessor , yet are morphologically distinct, displaying a combination of primitive traits and of derived features reminiscent of later H. sapiens and Eurasian archaic hominins. The ThI-GH hominins provide insights into African populations predating the earliest H. sapiens individuals discovered at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco 4 and provide strong evidence for an African lineage ancestral to our species. These fossils offer clues about the last common ancestor shared with Neanderthals and Denisovans.",

          "abstract": "Vision can inform animals as they navigate their environment. Landmarks can be used to maintain heading, while optic flow can be integrated to estimate turning. Although it has been shown that head direction (HD) neurons in various species use these visual cues1,2, the circuit mechanisms underlying this process in vertebrates remain unknown. Here we asked whether and how the recently identified HD cells in the larval zebrafish3, one of the smallest vertebrate models, incorporate visual information. By combining two-photon microscopy with a panoramic virtual reality setup, we demonstrate that the zebrafish HD cells can reliably track the orientation of multiple visual scenes, exploiting both visual landmarks and optic flow cues. The mapping between landmark cues and heading estimates is idiosyncratic across fish and experience dependent. Furthermore, we show that landmark tracking requires the lateralized projection from the habenula to the interpeduncular nucleus4, a structure innervated by HD neuron processes3. The physiological and morphological parallels suggest that a Hebbian mechanism similar to the fly ring neurons5,6 is at work in the habenula axons. Overall, our observation that hindbrain HD cells of larval zebrafish can utilize the visual cues despite the lack of an elaborate visual telencephalon sheds new light on the evolution of navigation circuitry in vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) have long axons and a high demand for mitochondria, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in peripheral neuropathy after diabetes and chemotherapy1,2. However, the mechanisms by which primary sensory neurons maintain their mitochondrial supply remain unclear. Satellite glial cells (SGCs) in DRG encircle sensory neurons and regulate neuronal activity and pain3. Here we show that SGCs are capable of transferring mitochondria to DRG sensory neurons in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by the formation of tunnelling nanotubes with SGC-derived myosin 10 (MYO10). Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed tunnelling nanotube-like ultrastructures between SGCs and sensory neurons in mouse and human DRG. Blockade of mitochondrial transfer in naive mice leads to nerve degeneration and neuropathic pain. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ hybridization revealed that MYO10 is highly expressed in human SGCs. Furthermore, SGCs from DRG of people with diabetes exhibit reduced MYO10 expression and mitochondrial transfer to neurons. Adoptive transfer of human SGCs into the mouse DRG provides MYO10-dependent protection against peripheral neuropathy. This study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of peripheral glia and provides insights into small fibre neuropathy in diabetes, offering new therapeutic strategies for the management of neuropathic pain.",

However, their practical applications have been severely hindered by the low discharge voltages and the need for largely excessive Na metal anode6,7,8. Here we report a 3.6 V class Na–S battery featuring a high-valence sulfur/sulfur tetrachloride (S/SCl4) cathode chemistry and anode-free configuration. We show that sodium dicyanamide (NaDCA) can simultaneously unlock reversible S/SCl4 conversion and Na plating/stripping in a non-flammable chloroaluminate electrolyte. This design enables the maximum energy and power densities of 1,198 Wh kg−1 and 23,773 W kg−1, respectively, calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass including both the cathode and the anode. Also, we demonstrate facilitated S/SCl4 conversion by incorporating a bismuth-coordinated covalent organic framework (Bi-COF) catalyst (8 wt% loading) into the S cathode, which realizes an impressive discharge capacity of 1,206 mAh g(sulfur+catalyst)−1, contributing to a maximum energy density of 2,021 Wh kg−1 calculated on the basis of the total electrode mass. With an estimated cost of US$5.03 per kWh and excellent scalability, our anode-free Na–S battery shows promise in grid energy storage and wearable electronics.",

          "abstract": "The brain’s connectome1,2,3 and the vascular system4 are examples of physical networks whose tangible nature influences their structure, layout and, ultimately, their function. The material resources required to build and maintain these networks have inspired decades of research into wiring economy, offering testable predictions about their expected architecture and organization. Here we empirically explore the local branching geometry of a wide range of physical networks, uncovering systematic violations of the long-standing predictions of wiring minimization. This leads to the hypothesis that predicting the true material cost of physical networks requires us to account for their full three-dimensional geometry, resulting in a largely intractable optimization problem. We discover, however, an exact mapping of surface minimization onto high-dimensional Feynman diagrams in string theory5,6,7, predicting that, with increasing link thickness, a locally tree-like network undergoes a transition into configurations that can no longer be explained by length minimization. Specifically, surface minimization predicts the emergence of trifurcations and branching angles in excellent agreement with the local tree organization of physical networks across a wide range of application domains. Finally, we predict the existence of stable orthogonal sprouts, which are not only prevalent in real networks but also play a key functional role, improving synapse formation in the brain and nutrient access in plants and fungi.",

          "abstract": "Animals continuously evaluate their surroundings to decide whether to approach rewarding opportunities or avoid potential threats. Assigning the appropriate importance to environmental stimuli is not only crucial for survival but also underlies complex forms of goal-directed behaviour that are shared across species, including humans1,2,3,4. Understanding how the brain translates such sensory cues into motivated behaviours is, therefore, central to neuroscience and psychology. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a critical structure that bridges relevant environmental stimuli to goal-directed behaviour. Salience, valence and value are key dimensions defining stimulus relevance, but how the dmPFC processes and organizes such dimensions to drive motivated behaviour remains unclear. Here we monitored single-neuron populations in the dmPFC using calcium imaging in freely moving male mice while discriminating between stimuli predicting different reward or punishment outcomes, which enabled an unprecedented dissociation of salience, valence and value information. We found that dmPFC populations primarily encode appetitive and aversive values of learned stimuli and that subpopulations encode valence and salience along orthogonal information axes. Our results highlight a concurrent multifaceted population coding of value, salience and valence of stimuli during associative learning within dmPFC networks, such that the geometry of dmPFC neuronal representations dynamically shapes appetitive and aversive motivated behaviours.",

Here we generated extensive ancient DNA data to elucidate contemporary changes in Yakut genomic diversity and oral microbiomes. We found Yakut origins tracing back to local populations that admixed with Trans-Baikal groups migrating as the Great Mongol Empire spread. Despite the Russian conquest, the Yakut gene pool and oral microbiomes appeared largely stable, although smallpox strains distinct from those documented in Europe by approximately 1650 circulated. Marital practices generally maintained low consanguinity, with the exception of one female bearing the latest markers of traditional shamanism, who was the daughter of second-degree relatives.",

Here we developed an intratumoural vaccination chimera (iVAC) to reprogram tumour cells into an antigen-presenting state (APC-like tumour cells) with restored anti-tumour immunity. The iVAC chimeras consist of a covalently engineered PD-L1 degrader conjugated to immunogenic antigens, which could relieve immune checkpoint inhibition while enforcing the cross-presentation of exogenous antigens. Functionally, the iVAC-induced antigen processing and presentation elicited potent tumour killing through reactivation of resident antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which simultaneously remodelled the tumour microenvironment to promote durable tumour-specific immunity. Extending this strategy, we used iVAC with a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived antigen to activate CMV-specific T cells against breast cancer in vitro, in a humanized mouse model as well as in a patient-derived tumour model. This study establishes a foundation for chemically reprogramming cancer cells within tumour beds to endow APC-like functions, providing an avenue for stimulating anti-tumour immunity.",

          "abstract": "Type 2 inflammation at barrier surfaces is an evolutionarily conserved response that promotes immunity to helminth parasites, allergic inflammation and tissue repair1,2,3,4. Direct sensing of environmental triggers by epithelial cells initiates type 2 inflammation, and signals derived from neurons can modulate immune responses5,6,7,8. However, how diverse sensory inputs from epithelial, neuronal and immune cells are coordinated and integrated remains unclear. Here we identify that TRPV1+ pain-sensing nociceptors co-opt chemosensory epithelial tuft cells to initiate a cascade of tissue responses that drive type 2 inflammation. Chemogenetic silencing or chemical ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors results in a significant reduction in intestinal tuft cells and defective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. By contrast, chemogenetic activation of TRPV1+ nociceptors leads to remodelling of CGRP+ nerve fibres, significantly increased CGRP expression, enhanced tuft cell accumulation and protective anti-helminth type 2 immunity. Using spatial transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we reveal that nociceptor activation promotes rapid epithelial progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, intestinal epithelial cell-intrinsic and tuft cell-intrinsic expression of CGRP receptor subunits are required for tuft cell responses and type 2 immunity to helminth infection. Together, these results identify sensory convergence of a neuronal–epithelial tuft cell circuit as a critical upstream determinant of type 2 immunity and tissue adaptation.",

Metabolic disorders uniquely predispose an ever-expanding group of patients to mucormycosis through poorly understood mechanisms1,2,4,5, suggesting that uncharacterized host metabolic effectors may confer protective immunity against this infection. Here we uncover a master regulatory role of albumin in host defence against Mucorales through the modulation of fungal pathogenicity. Our initial studies identified severe hypoalb uminaemia as a prominent metabolic abnormality and an independent biomarker of poor mucormycosis outcome across three distinct cohorts of patients with mucormycosis. Notably, purified albumin selectively inhibits Mucorales growth among a range of pathogens, and albumin-deficient mice display susceptibility specifically to mucormycosis. The antifungal activity of albumin is mediated by the release of bound free fatty acids (FFAs). Albumin prevents FFA oxidation, which otherwise abolishes their antifungal properties, and sera from patients with mucormycosis display high levels of oxidized FFAs. Physiologically, albumin-bound FFAs suppress the expression of key virulence factors by inhibiting protein synthesis, the reby rendering Mucorales avirulent in vivo. Overall, we identify a host defence mechanism that directs the pathogen to suppress its pathogenicity program in response to unfavourable metabolic cues regulated by albumin. These findings have major implications for the pathogenesis and management of mucormycosis.",

These processes often demand exacting conditions, including cryogenic temperatures and handling of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents.2,3 Here, we report a Matteson-type homologation which integrates these three transformations into a one-pot electrochemical process. This proof-of-concept approach combines electroreductive defluorination with boronate rearrangement, eliminating the need for organolithium reagents, cryogenic conditions, or specialist setups. The available trifluoromethylarenes are employed as carbenoid precursors for the first time, expanding the scope of Matteson reaction. Comprehensive mechanistic studies, including identification of key reaction intermediates, DFT calculations, and electrochemical analysis, confirm the involvement of boronate formation and rearrangement in this “e-Matteson” homologation.",

Here we present the observation of coherent Aharonov–Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer-graphene-based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by using the Fabry–Pérot interferometry technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, ΔΦ = 2Φ0, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of ΔΦ = 4Φ0 may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge \\({e}^{* }=\\frac{1}{2}e\\) or that interference of \\({e}^{* }=\\frac{1}{4}e\\) quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Notably, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of \\({e}^{* }=\\frac{2}{3}e\\) quasiparticles instead of \\({e}^{* }=\\frac{1}{3}e\\). To investigate statistical phase contributions, we operated the Fabry–Pérot interferometer (FPI) with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the extra bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge \\({e}^{* }=\\frac{1}{4}e\\), as expected for non-Abelian anyons.",

The charging rate can be improved by making composite phase-change materials (CPCMs) with increased thermal conductivity9 and/or by exerting an external force to realize close-contact melting (CCM)10,11,12. However, these methods inevitably result in energy density losses and/or extra energy consumption. Here we report a strategy to boost the charging rates without sacrificing energy density, based on a rational design of a composite coating that enables slip-enhanced close-contact melting (sCCM) inside sealed thermal batteries. Using organic PCMs, we demonstrate a record-high power density of 1,100 ± 2% kW m−3 in a prototype. Our coating design integrates a pulse-heated (PH) layer that premelts the PCM to initiate CCM, together with a liquid-like slip surface that ensures unimpeded sinking of the remaining solid and sustains the sCCM mode throughout charging. We develop a model to explain how the slip surface enhances the charging rate. With high cycling life, adaptability and scalability, this strategy is generalizable to diverse PCMs, enabling high-performance thermal energy storage over a wide range of temperatures.",

As their depletion suppresses translation and, consequently, viral replication, tRNAs represent long-standing and increasingly recognized targets of innate immunity 1–5 . Here we report Cas12a3 effector nucleases from type V CRISPR–Cas adaptive immune systems in bacteria that preferentially cleave tRNAs after recognition of target RNA. Cas12a3 orthologues belong to one of two previously unreported nuclease clades that exhibit RNA-mediated cleavage of non-target RNA, and are distinct from all other known type V systems. Through cell-based and biochemical assays and direct RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that recognition of a complementary target RNA by the CRISPR RNA triggers Cas12a3 to cleave the conserved 5′-CCA-3′ tail of diverse tRNAs to drive growth arrest and anti-phage defence. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures further revealed a distinct tRNA-loading domain that positions the tRNA tail in the RuvC active site of the nuclease. By designing synthetic reporters that mimic the tRNA acceptor stem and tail, we expanded the capacity of current CRISPR-based diagnostics for multiplexed RNA detection. Overall, these findings reveal widespread tRNA inactivation as a previously unrecognized CRISPR-based immune strategy that broadens the application space of the existing CRISPR toolbox.",

However, this mechanism is not compatible with the early development of many vertebrates 4–9 . Yolk-anchored embryos typically cannot form a complete ring during early cleavage divisions, but it remains unclear how a partial circular arc with loose ends can divide the cell. Here, by combining laser ablation of the cytokinetic band with rheological measurements in vivo, we show that stiffening of the bulk cytoplasm, mediated by the interphase microtubule network, stabilizes the contractile band by anchoring it along its length during growth. Conversely, as the cell cycle progresses, the cytoplasm fluidizes, diminishing band–cytoplasmic anchoring and facilitating band ingression. This dynamic interplay between stability and growth versus instability and ingression repeats for several cell cycles until division is complete, resulting in a mechanical ratchet that drives cell division. Our study underscores the role of temporal control over cytoplasmic rheology as a key feature that drives unilateral cytokinesis in the absence of a closed actin ring.",

Here we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of 4′-fluorouridine in an African green monkey model of Lassa fever using the contemporary and apparently more pathogenic lineage VII Togo strain of Lassa virus. Daily treatment with 4′-fluorouridine beginning 6 days after Lassa virus infection, when the monkeys were viraemic and clinically ill, resulted in rapid and complete clearance of infectious virus in 4 out of 5 monkeys, and all treated monkeys survived to the pre-determined study end-point. Targeted transcriptomics showed that cellular responses and control of cytokinaemia contributed to the development of immunity. Our findings support the further development of 4′-fluorouridine both as a post-exposure prophylaxis to control outbreaks and as a therapeutic agent to treat symptomatic patients.",

Over time, disturbed forests can recover, gradually restoring carbon stocks and ecological functions8. However, how recovery rates vary with disturbance size, type and location remains poorly quantified. Here we use a bookkeeping approach with spatially explicit vegetation recovery curves to quantify AGC dynamics in disturbed tropical forests during 1990–2020. We find that disturbed tropical dry forests remained carbon neutral, whereas disturbed tropical humid forests experienced a net AGC loss of 15.6 ± 3.7 PgC, primarily driven by small but persistent deforestation clearings. Despite affecting only about 5% of the disturbed area, these small-size (less than 2 ha) deforestation events accounted for about 56% of carbon losses, owing to persistent land-use conversion without forest regrowth. By contrast, large fire-induced carbon losses were offset by the long-term post-fire recovery. Over time, deforestation expanded into humid forests with higher carbon stock density, intensifying AGC losses per unit area. These findings highlight the disproportionate impact of small clearings on tropical carbon losses, suggesting the need to curb land-use changes and protect young and recovering forests.",

Our data reveal that the inability to induce daytime shifts with light in most animals is not only attributed to the SCN, as has been proposed for decades, but also requires the limitation of ipRGC firing via depolarization block. Chemogenetic activation of ipRGCs induces large shifts during both night-time and daytime, but daytime shifts require brain circuits and neuropeptide transmitters that are dispensable for night-time shifts. Thus, propensity of ipRGCs for depolarization block not only prevents daytime shifts in mice, but also limits the magnitude of night-time shifts, suggesting that ipRGC inputs to SCN act as an integrated pacemaker across the circadian cycle.",

We identified bound lipids for approximately half of the hundred LTPs analyzed, confirming known ligands, while discovering new ones across most LTP families. Gains in LTP function affected the cellular abundance of both their known and newly identified lipid ligands, indicating comparable functional relevance of the two ligand sets. Using structural bioinformatics, we have characterized mechanisms contributing to lipid selectivity, identifying preferences based on head group or acyl chain. We demonstrate some basic principles of how LTPs mobilise their ligands. They commonly interact with several classes of lipids and exhibit broad but selective preference, not only for particular head groups, but also for lipid species with shorter acyl chains containing one or two unsaturations, suggesting that only subsets of lipid species are efficiently mobilized.

Chronic inflammation can impede the phased regulation of tissue restitution, resulting in the scarring complication of fibrosis. In inflammatory bowel disease, stromal fibroblasts have been implicated in treatment-refractory disease and fibrosis 2,3 ; however, their mechanisms of activation have remained undefined. Through integrative single-cell and spatial profiling of intestinal tissues from patients with inflammatory bowel disease, we uncovered a pathological cell nexus centred on inflammation-associated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts were induced by proinflammatory macrophages ( FCN1 + IL1B + ) and, in turn, produced profibrotic cytokine IL-11. We investigated the inflammation-associated fibroblast activation program at a mechanistic level using genome-wide CRISPR knockout and activation screens and identified the transcription factor GLIS3 as a key regulator of a gene regulatory network governing expression of inflammatory and fibrotic genes. We further demonstrated that the magnitude of the GLIS3 gene expression program in intestinal biopsies could be used to stratify patients with ulcerative colitis by disease severity, and that fibroblast-specific deletion of Glis3 in mice alleviated pathological features of chronic colitis. Taken together, our findings identify a critical immune–stromal cell circuit that functions as a central node in the inflammation–fibrosis cycle.",

          "abstract": "Heterochromatin, marked by histone H3 lysine 9 methylation, can be epigenetically inherited through cell division 1–3 , maintaining gene repression that preserves cell identity and enables adaptation to environmental challenges 2–6 . Studies on S chizosaccharomyces pombe have shown that heterochromatin propagation depends on the read–write mechanism, wherein a sufficient density of H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes, stabilized by histone deacetylases, concentrates Clr4 SUV39H on chromatin to promote further deposition of H3K9 methylation 7–9 . Whether other mechanisms control heterochromatin propagation by means of Clr4 SUV39H , a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex ClrC 10–12 , was unknown. Here we uncover a ubiquitin-dependent heterochromatin heritability regulatory hub (HRH) that broadly governs heterochromatin propagation, even without histone deacetylase activity. The HRH is tuned by the limiting factor Raf1 DDB2 , a substrate receptor for the ClrC ubiquitin ligase. In addition to linking Clr4 SUV39H to other ClrC components on chromatin, Raf1 DDB2 acts in a dosage-dependent manner to promote ubiquitination of histone H3 at lysine 14 (H3K14ub), which is critical for heterochromatin self-propagation. HRH is intricately linked to environmentally responsive pathways, including nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling, enabling cells to adapt to changing conditions. By modulating heterochromatin propagation, cells leverage the HRH to gain resistance to antifungal agents and adapt to high temperature. Thus, heterochromatin self-propagation is actively regulated by means of H3K14ub in response to external stimuli, with broad implications for understanding mechanisms governing rapid changes in the epigenetic landscape in physiology and disease.",

In the evolution from unicellularity to obligate multicellularity, facultative clonal multicellularity may constitute an intermediate state, in which unicellular proliferation and clonal multicellular growth are switchable2,3,4. However, little is known about the mechanisms of switching. Here we identify the genetic and cellular basis of nutrition-responsive facultative clonal multicellularity in two black-yeast species of Dothideomycetes. Deletion of any one of ten genes in Hortaea werneckii5,6 results in near-obligate unicellularity or multicellularity. Six of these genes encode regulators of conidiation (asexual sporulation) in filamentous fungi7, despite conidiation not being observed in H. werneckii. Second-site mutations often restore or reverse the phenotype, revealing genetic flexibility underlying facultative multicellularity. A Myb protein functions as a switch-like regulator of state transitions in H. werneckii; its expression and degradation are coupled to nutrient conditions, stabilizing unicellular or multicellular growth. However, while conidiation regulators are similarly co-opted to enable facultative multicellularity, the Myb gene is dispensable in the related species Neodothiora pruni8, further highlighting molecular diversity in plasticity regulation. Ecologically, multicellular-prone H. werneckii ecotypes are isolated from sponges, and sponge-conditioned medium induces multicellularity. This study establishes a tractable model system for dissecting facultative clonal multicellularity across genetic, cellular and ecological scales, and outlines genetic and cellular strategies to gain, lose and regain multicellularity and, more broadly, phenotypic plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Late Cretaceous Europe was an archipelago with a dinosaur fauna characterized by island effects such as low diversity, relictualism and insular dwarfism1. Its dinosaur communities include a unique mix of groups with typical Laurasian or Gondwanan affinities and distinctive endemics1. Chief among the latter are rhabdodontids, considered to be early-branching iguanodontians characterized by unusual dental and postcranial features and known from abundant but very incomplete fossil remains2,3. By contrast, unequivocal evidence of horned dinosaurs (ceratopsians) is puzzlingly absent4, despite their ubiquitous occurrence in contemporary ecosystems of Asia and North America. Ajkaceratops from the Late Cretaceous of Hungary was described as the first definite ceratopsian from Europe5, but this identification has been strongly disputed4. Here we describe new material of Ajkaceratops and conduct phylogenetic analyses that support its ceratopsian affinities. Our results unexpectedly demonstrate that some ‘rhabdodontid’ taxa are not, in fact, iguanodontians but actually ceratopsians. This suggests a substantial but previously hidden diversity and evolutionary history of European horned dinosaurs, and co-occurrence of iguanodontians and ceratopsians indicates greater similarity than previously appreciated to other Laurasian ecosystems. Our results challenge conventional understanding of ornithischian dinosaur evolution and indicate the need for a fundamental re-evaluation of the Late Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaur assemblages of Europe.",

          "abstract": "The Galaxy’s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits 1 . At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii) 2,3 . The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5–4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.",

          "abstract": "The medial temporal lobe, and particularly the hippocampus, has been proposed to encode items in context1,2. Although hippocampal memory representations are largely context-dependent in rodents3,4, concept cells in humans appear to be context-invariant5. However, it remains unknown how item and context information are combined to form or retrieve integrated item-in-context memories at the single-neuron level in humans. Here we show that coordinated activity of distinct neuronal populations supports item-in-context memory. In a context-dependent picture-comparison task, we recorded 3,109 neurons from 16 neurosurgical patients, identifying 597 stimulus-modulated (pre-screened) and 200 context-modulated neurons (2.95% in the amygdala, 7.68% in the parahippocampal cortex, 5.68% in the entorhinal cortex and 9.42% in the hippocampus). Their co-firing combined different comparison questions (contexts) with two subsequent pictures (stimuli) through neuronal reinstatement of question contexts. Both populations were largely separate, generalized across the preferred dimension of each other, and covaried with behavioural performance. Following experimental pairing of stimuli and context, firing of entorhinal stimulus neurons predicted that of hippocampal context neurons after tens of milliseconds. Overall, synaptic modifications and co-firing of stimulus and context neurons could contribute to item-in-context memory, specify which stimulus memories need to be retrieved, and even generalize memories through mutual reinstatement of largely separate, orthogonal representations. By contrast, only 50 stimulus–context neurons represented specific picture–question combinations, consistent with limited pattern separation in the human medial temporal lobe, favouring flexible generalization over rigid conjunctive coding.",

Although the creation and tuning of structural colours has been realized with nanostructures1,2, achieving dynamic control over visual texture3,4 remains challenging. Inspired by dynamic modulation of cephalopod skin5,6, we develop polymer films with programmable surface textures. We bring these textures to life through immersion in different liquids that cause reversible local swelling/contraction to a degree that is determined by electron-beam irradiation. We show how standard electron-beam patterning tools can spatially encode arbitrary textures that can be hidden and shown on demand. Similarly, by modulating the topography of optical Fabry–Pérot cavities, we create colour patterns that can be continuously tuned with microfluidic control to achieve several distinct appearance states, allowing them to camouflage with different backgrounds. Finally, by creating multilayer devices, we demonstrate independent control of texture and colour in a single device, enabling a higher level of dynamic control over visual appearance.",

          "abstract": "Expansions and contractions of tandem DNA repeats generate genetic variation in human populations and in human tissues. Some expanded repeats cause inherited disorders and some are also somatically unstable 1,2 . Here we analysed DNA sequencing data from over 900,000 participants in the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program using computational approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability. Repeats at different loci exhibited widely variable tissue-specific propensities to mutate in the germline and blood. Common alleles of repeats in TCF4 and ADGRE2 exhibited high rates of length mosaicism in the blood, demonstrating that most human genomes contain repeat elements that expand as we age. Genome-wide association analyses of the extent of somatic expansion of unstable repeat alleles identified 29 loci at which inherited variants increased expansion of one or more DNA repeats in blood ( P = 5 × 10 −8 to 2.5 × 10 −1,438 ). These genetic modifiers exhibited strong collective effects on repeat instability: at one repeat, somatic expansion rates varied fourfold between individuals with the highest and lowest 5% of polygenic scores. Modifier alleles at several DNA-repair genes exhibited opposite effects on the blood instability of the TCF4 repeat compared with other DNA repeats. Expanded repeats in the 5′ untranslated region of the glutaminase ( GLS ) gene associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (odds ratio (OR) = 14.0 (5.7–34.3, 95% confidence interval (CI))) and liver diseases (OR = 3.0 (1.5–5.9, 95% CI)).

Uncovering how opioids alter nociceptive neural dynamics to produce pain relief is essential for developing safer and more targeted treatments for chronic pain. Here we show that a population of cingulate neurons encodes spontaneous pain-related behaviours and is selectively modulated by morphine. Using deep learning behavioural analyses combined with longitudinal neural recordings in mice, we identified a persistent shift in cortical activity patterns following nerve injury that reflects the emergence of an unpleasant, affective chronic pain state. Morphine reversed these neuropathic neural dynamics and reduced affective–motivational behaviours without altering sensory detection or reflexive responses, mirroring how opioids alleviate pain unpleasantness in humans. Leveraging these findings, we built a biologically inspired chemogenetic gene therapy that targets opioid-sensitive neurons in the cingulate using a synthetic μ-opioid receptor promoter to drive inhibition2. This opioid-mimetic chemogenetic gene therapy recapitulated the analgesic effects of morphine during chronic neuropathic pain, thereby offering a new strategy for precision pain management that targets a key nociceptive cortical opioid circuit with safe, on-demand analgesia.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in reducing the loss of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) within the telecom band1,2,3,4, facilitating on-chip applications spanning low-noise optical5 and microwave synthesis6, to lidar7 and photonic artificial intelligence engines8. However, several obstacles arise from the marked increase in material absorption and scattering losses at shorter wavelengths9,10, which prominently elevate power requirements and limit performance in the visible and near-visible spectrum. Here we present an ultralow-loss PIC platform based on germano-silicate—the material underlying the extraordinary performance of optical fibre—but realized by a fully CMOS-foundry-compatible process. These PICs achieve resonator Q factors surpassing 180 million from violet to telecom wavelengths. They also attain a 10-dB higher quality factor without thermal treatment in the telecom band, expanding opportunities for heterogeneous integration with active components11. Other features of this platform include readily engineered waveguide dispersion, acoustic mode confinement and large-mode-area-induced thermal stability—each demonstrated by soliton microcomb generation, stimulated Brillouin lasing and low-frequency-noise self-injection locking, respectively. The success of these germano-silicate PICs can ultimately enable fibre-like loss onto a chip, leading to an additional 20-dB improvement in waveguide loss over the current highest performance photonic platforms. Moreover, the performance abilities demonstrated here bridge ultralow-loss PIC technology to optical clocks12, precision navigation systems13 and quantum sensors14.",

          "abstract": "Across the North Pacific Ocean, the mid-latitude storm track accounts for most of the heat and moisture transport into the Arctic and western North America, considerably influencing regional precipitation and temperature patterns1,2. By the end of this century, the winter North Pacific storm track is projected to shift polewards3,4,5,6, with substantial implications for oceanic ecosystems and land-based water availability1,7. Although atmospheric reanalyses suggest a polewards shift of the storm track7,8,9,10,11,12, the lack of an observed wind record has left it uncertain whether the storm-track shift has occurred in recent decades, and what role climate change plays in determining the storm-track position. Here we derive an observational constraint for mid-latitude storm tracks and show that the winter North Pacific storm track has shifted substantially polewards, emerging from natural variability. A polewards shift of storm track-induced heat and moisture flux is also evident over western North America, implying regional impacts on precipitation and temperature patterns. Our analysis further reveals that climate models underestimate the polewards shift of the storm track in recent decades, suggesting that the future human-induced impacts on both the North Pacific ecosystem and western North America might be larger than in current predictions.",

          "authors": "José D. Anadón, Osvaldo E. Sala",
          "abstract": "Managed grazing is the most extensive land use on Earth. The prevailing narrative is that global rangelands, from grasslands to deserts, are being degraded by overgrazing due to overstocking. This perception arises from scientific literature, which contains an order of magnitude more studies on overstocking than on reductions in stocking rates. In contrast, over the past 25 y, regions representing almost half (42%) of global livestock have experienced reductions in stocking rates rather than the expected increases. We evaluated socioeconomic, technological, and climatic direct drivers, as well as indirect drivers, of global stocking patterns. Trade and climate had no detectable effects, whereas technological shifts and meat consumption had an impact on stocking rates. Direct drivers were largely controlled by human population and gross domestic product. Wealthier regions, with slower population growth, greater feed supplementation, and reliance on nongrazing livestock, reduced stocking rates. Less affluent regions, facing rapid population growth and rising meat demand but limited technological and feed resources, increased stocking rates. The overlooked reductions in stocking rates may have major ecological consequences at regional and global scales. Destocking can impact biodiversity, fire regimes, potentially increase carbon sequestration, and modify land–atmosphere fluxes. These effects are not simply the reverse of overstocking, as some consequences are irreversible, including state transitions and local extinctions. The skewed pattern of publications toward overstocking and overgrazing led to a perception of widespread degradation and had consequences on research direction and policy.",

          "abstract": "How do shared narratives emerge in decentralized online networks? Prior research using simplified group coordination tasks (e.g., face-naming) shows network structure shapes group consensus, but the underlying cognitive mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examine how network structure influences the emergence and semantic content of shared narrative beliefs in experimental online social networks, using natural language processing measures and agent-based modeling. Media content with complex causal structure attenuates network structure effects by encouraging longer exploration of background knowledge. Yet network structure still shapes the narrative content communicated. An embedding-based narrative alignment measure shows that fully connected groups orient their interactions more toward communicating causes of an event, whereas locally connected networks emphasize the event’s effects. A group’s network structure also influences representational and language change in personal narratives: participants in fully connected networks showed the largest increase in causal language in personal narratives written after interaction, which also orient more around the narrative’s causal events.",

          "authors": "Christa Nater, David I. Miller, Alice H. Eagly, Sabine Sczesny",
          "abstract": "Gender stereotypes, defined as widely shared beliefs about the typical attributes of women and men, have far-reaching consequences for both stereotyped groups. This preregistered research examined cross-cultural variation in gender stereotypes based on public opinion poll data from 1995 (22 nations with 22,000 respondents) and 2023 (40 nations with 4,800 respondents). Results revealed that men were perceived as more agentic than women and women as more communal than men in all studied nations at both time points. Yet, substantial cross-cultural variation existed in the strength of these stereotypes whereby the communion stereotype in particular related to the distribution of women and men into social roles. The female advantage in communion was stronger the larger women’s share in the labor force and the greater the occupational sex segregation, both reflecting women’s employment primarily in communal domains. The male advantage in agency likely reflects that women’s considerable inroads into leader roles put them in versions of the role entailing lesser status and power and therefore conveying lesser agency. For competence, most respondents believed that women and men are equally competent in 17 of the 23 nations surveyed in 1995 and in all 40 nations surveyed in 2023. These beliefs in competence equality were stronger in nations with greater female educational attainment and labor force participation (in 2023 but not in 1995). By identifying cross-cultural patterns and socioeconomic indicators associated with variation in gender stereotyping, this research advances understanding of how the locations of women and men in nations’ social structures inform gender stereotypes.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive aging research has long observed that older adults’ autobiographical memories and future thoughts, as assessed in laboratory contexts, lack spatiotemporal detail compared to young adults. Does this pattern also hold in everyday contexts? Across two studies, we examined characteristics of autobiographical thinking in real-world settings using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Study 1 included an adult lifespan sample (N = 3,847). Study 2 (preregistered) included 217 young and older adults whose autobiographical memories were also assessed with a traditional lab-based interview. Contrary to lab-based findings commonly reported in the literature, older adults across both studies reported more episodic specificity in their everyday autobiographical thoughts than younger adults, as well as shifts toward positive and social focus rather than on the self. Linguistic analyses validated self-report data, revealing greater concreteness and perceptual detail with increasing age. Together, these findings highlight discrepancies between measurement approaches in autobiographical thinking in older age, emphasizing the significance of motivational and contextual factors in its study.",

          "abstract": "The Ciona heart cell lineage can be accurately traced back to a pair of blastomeres, the B7.5 cells, that form at the 64-cell stage. In addition to the adult heart, the B7.5 cells also contribute to two tail muscle cells in the larva, as well as the muscles that form the siphons for pumping water for feeding. Because of the simplicity of this system, we have a good understanding of how the B7.5 derivatives are specified during development. However, we know less about how the Ciona embryo precisely regulates cell numbers, as well as what effects altering cell numbers will have on development. We found that cell numbers in the B7.5 lineage are controlled by a pulse of transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1.b . Cdkn1.b can be repressed by the paralogs Prdm1-r.a and Prdm1-r.b that are exclusively transcribed in the B7.5 cells at the 112-cell stage. We unexpectedly found that precocious arrest of cell division in the B7.5 cell lineage resulted in a reversion to tail muscle fate, even in cells that can migrate. Our work demonstrates an unexpected connection between the control of cell numbers and cell fate in development.",

          "abstract": "While transcranial neuroimaging of individual capillary function holds transformative potential for diagnostics, it has proven difficult to achieve. Superresolution ultrasound, while capable of achieving micron-scale resolution, relies on the accumulation of multiple microbubble events, a method inherently limited by the exceedingly low probability of observing such events within capillaries. We present single capillary reporters (SCaRe), a paradigm-shifting approach that utilizes the complete flow trajectory information extracted from individual microbubbles to directly image single capillaries. This method allows for transcranial reconstruction and functional assessment of deep capillary networks in the entire brain. We employed computational simulations and pathological neuroinflammation models to quantify and validate metrics such as capillary transit-time and capillary stalling. Importantly, we demonstrated SCaRe’s ability to resolve immune responses to injury at the single capillary level, markedly broadening research avenues for exploring microvascular dysfunction across diverse neurological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms, including histone acetylation, regulate learning and memory and underlie Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2), an enzyme generating acetyl-CoA, locally regulates histone acetylation and gene expression in neuronal nuclei. This regulatory mechanism may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. Previously, we showed that systemic ACSS2 knockout mice, although largely normal in physiology, exhibit memory deficits. Here, we investigated whether increasing ACSS2 levels could protect neurons against disease and age-associated cognitive decline. Given the role of tau in ADRD, we used primary hippocampal neurons that mimic the sporadic development of tau pathology and the P301S transgenic mouse model for tau-induced memory decline. Our results show that ACSS2 upregulation mitigates tau-induced transcriptional alterations, enhances neuronal resilience against tau pathology, improves long-term potentiation, and ameliorates memory deficits. Additionally, boosting histone acetylation through ACSS2 countered age-related memory decline. These findings indicate that increasing ACSS2 is highly effective in countering age- and tau-induced transcriptome changes, preserving elevated levels of synaptic genes, and safeguarding synaptic integrity. These findings position ACSS2 as a key epigenetic regulator of cognitive aging and ADRD, highlighting its potential for targeted therapeutics to enhance brain resilience and function.",

          "abstract": "Improving the photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco is a key target for enhancing C 3 crop productivity, but progress has been hampered by the difficulty of evaluating engineered variants in planta without interference from the native enzyme. Here, we report the creation of a Rubisco-null Nicotiana tabacum platform by using CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out all 11 nuclear-encoded small subunit ( rbcS ) genes. Knockout was achieved in a line expressing cyanobacterial Rubisco from the plastid genome, allowing the recovery of viable plants. We then developed a chloroplast expression system for coexpressing both large and small subunits from the plastid genome. We expressed two resurrected ancestral Rubiscos from the Solanaceae family. The resulting transgenic plants were phenotypically normal and accumulated Rubisco to wild-type levels. Importantly, kinetic analyses of the purified ancestral enzymes revealed they possessed a 16 to 20% higher catalytic efficiency ( k cat,air /K c,air ) under ambient conditions, driven by a significantly faster turnover rate ( k cat,air ). We have demonstrated that our system allows robust in vivo assessment of novel Rubiscos and that ancestral reconstruction is a powerful strategy for identifying superior enzymes to improve photosynthesis in C 3 crops.",

          "abstract": "Humans predict the timing of imminent events to generate fast and precise actions, decisions, and other behaviors. Such temporal anticipation is critical over wide timescales, and especially salient over the range from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. Despite advances in our understanding of basic timing behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms, it remains an open question whether anticipation is stable across these short time scales. Recent work shows that the brain models the probability density function (PDF) of events across time, suggesting a canonical mechanism for temporal anticipation. Here, we investigate whether this computation holds when the event distribution covers different time spans. We show that, irrespective of the time span, anticipation, measured as reaction time, scales with the event distribution. This demonstrates that the key computation—the estimation of event probability density—is invariant across temporal scales. We further show that the precision of anticipation is also scale invariant which contradicts Weber’s law. The results are established in vision and audition, suggesting that the core computations in temporal anticipation are independent of sensory modality. Perceptual systems exploit probability estimation over time independently of temporal scale to anticipate imminent events.",

Not all DCIS becomes invasive, and no strategy currently exists in patients to stratify indolent DCIS from DCIS at risk of progression. Several studies of human DCIS and breast cancer suggest that TP53 mutations occur early in DCIS. However, TP53 mutation alone is insufficient for DCIS formation or transformation to invasive disease. Using an autochthonous somatic mouse model of Trp53 R245W induced breast cancer (equivalent to the TP53 R248W hotspot mutation in humans), we identified DCIS lesions. Through exome sequencing and low-pass whole-genome sequencing, we identified additional genomic changes shared between DCIS and invasive tumors. This comparison nominated seven murine candidate genes, with eight human orthologs. We assessed the cooperativity of these genes with mutant TP53 in human breast cells using acinar morphogenesis and migration assays. Overexpression of TMEM267 , which encodes a transmembrane protein overexpressed in 22% of TP53 missense mutant breast cancer cases, in cells with mutant TP53 caused a significant increase in the filled duct, DCIS-like phenotype. We nominate TMEM267 as a cooperating event with mutant TP53 in DCIS progression.",

          "abstract": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) reshape the tumor immune microenvironment and promote tumor progression, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Through integration of single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing datasets from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we identified a distinct protumoral macrophage population with elevated expression of phospholipase D3 (PLD3). Multiomics investigations revealed that high infiltration of these PLD3-high macrophages was associated with poor clinical outcomes in ESCC patients. Mechanistically, tumor cells secreted cholesterol to modulate the microenvironment. Upon the uptake by TAMs, cholesterol triggered the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), which directly bound to the PLD3 promoter region and activated its transcription. The overexpressed PLD3 localized to lysosomes, enzymatically degrading single-stranded nucleic acids, thereby suppressing the activation of the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) pathway. This cascade ultimately impaired effector T cell function and sustained an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Notably, therapeutic intervention using ODN2216-siPLD3 in murine models enhanced CD8 T cell infiltration and significantly inhibited tumor growth. Our findings highlight PLD3-high macrophages as a promising diagnostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for ESCC, paving the way for potential clinical translation.",

Despite the abundance of tissue resident activated T cells, their contributions to these various roles remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a dominant population of IL-10 producing, T-bet-expressing Tr1 T cells, residing in the small intestinal lamina propria at homeostasis. Remarkably, these intestinal Tr1 cells emerge at the time of weaning and accumulate independently of the microbiota displaying similar abundance, function, and TCR repertoire under germ-free conditions. Instead, the small intestinal T-bet + Tr1 program is driven and shaped by dietary antigens, and accumulates in a cDC1-IL-27-dependent manner. Upon activation, these cells robustly express IL-10 and multiple inhibitory receptors, establishing a distinct suppressive profile. Altogether, this work uncovers a previously unappreciated dominant player in homeostatic small intestinal immunity with the potential to play critical suppressive roles in this tissue, raising important implications for the understanding of immune regulation in the intestine.",

Notably, eukaryotic class B JDPs of the cytosol/nucleus prevent assembly or drive disassembly of amyloid aggregates known to cause neurodegenerative diseases, yet their evolutionary origin is not known. Members of the most ubiquitous class B subgroup, canonical B (B C ) JDPs, lack the signature zinc finger domain (ZnF) of the more prevalent class A JDPs, while having other key features in common. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that B C JDPs evolved more than once from class A duplicates, losing their ZnF. The cytonuclear B C s emerged at the base of eukaryotes. Cytonuclear class B’ (i.e., B’ (ST) ) JDPs that have a substrate binding domain of unknown origin, distinct from that of As and B C s, emerged from a B C duplication at the base of metazoans and subsequently multiplied by duplications. The origin of B’ (ST) s, which are capable of suppressing formation of amyloid aggregates, predated the emergence of disease-causing amyloidogenic proteins. Using ancestral protein resurrection, we tested when cytonuclear Bs evolved their amyloid related functions. We found that their common ancestor with As, AncAB that has a ZnF does not efficiently facilitate disassembly of amyloid fibrils, while AncB, which lacks a ZnF, does. Overall, our findings are consistent with the idea that, though the ZnF of class A JDPs is important for some roles, its loss allowed evolution of novel functions, as illustrated by the ability of B C and B’ (ST) JDPs to control amyloid aggregate levels.",

In this study, we report a role for rNSCs in actively engulfing synapses in the adult hippocampus. Mice in which rNSCs lack the phagocytic receptor MERTK exhibit reduced elimination of excitatory synapses, defective synaptic plasticity, and impaired formation of hippocampal learning and memory, but normal neurogenesis. Furthermore, we show that MERTK-dependent phagocytosis of excitatory synapses by rNSCs contributes to voluntary exercise-induced cognitive enhancements. Together, our data suggest that rNSCs eliminate unnecessary excitatory synaptic connections in the adult hippocampus through MERTK, thereby maintaining circuit connectivity and cognitive function independently of neurogenesis.",

However, conventional dip-coating approaches struggle to produce wafer-scale single-crystalline films, as the supersaturation conditions optimized for nucleation invariably conflict with those required for crystal growth, leading to fragmented domains and compromised device performance. Here, we introduce an in situ seeded dip coating (SDC) strategy that overcomes this limitation by engineering supersaturation to temporally decouple nucleation from crystal growth. This enables the scalable production of ultrathin two-dimensional molecular crystal (2DMC) films with exceptional uniformity across wafer dimensions. Organic field-effect transistor arrays fabricated from these 2DMCs exhibit high average charge carrier mobility (14.5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 ) and spatial homogeneity, evidenced by an ultralow mobility coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.5%. These arrays demonstrate robust polarization sensitivity with an average dichroic ratio (DR) of 2.2 and a low DR CV of 8.6%. Capitalizing on this uniformity, we constructed dual-device pixel units capable of full-range 180° polarization angle identification, enabling direct application in polarization-encoded optical encryption. The SDC technique provides a scalable pathway for practical high-performance organic polarization-sensitive optoelectronics.",

The specific and dynamic nature of this class of bonds enables encoded linkers to program the self-assembly of a broad range of building blocks. However, the possible collective behavior emerging from multiple SSDBs in programmable self-assembly remains elusive, due to experimental challenges. Here, we analyze the thermodynamic properties and kinetic pathways of SSDB hybridization through simulations supported by analytical theories, treating widely applicable cases of sequence-selective interactions. Our results reveal that the hybridization of SSDB linkers with certain rotational freedom can result in phase-transition-like behavior, which dictates the stability and the spontaneous transitions of typical states. In particular, there exists a metastable intermediate that plays a critical role in the thermally active hybridization facilitated by entropy, in contrast to normal dynamic bonds. We demonstrate that such a unique characteristic of thermodynamics causes stepwise kinetics of SSDB hybridization and hence anomalous diffusion of particles functionalized with SSDB linkers. Our work suggests that the presence of collective effect and phase-transition-like behavior may well be the crucial feature that guides larger scale ordering and dynamics in diverse systems of multiple SSDBs.",

          "abstract": "The use of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors provides organisms with a huge amount of available energy but necessitates methods to detoxify reactive intermediates. The mechanisms of NO and O 2 detoxification in many organisms involve flavodiiron proteins (FDPs). Although the proteinaceous ligands that coordinate the diiron active site of these enzymes are well established, its exact coordination environment remains under debate due to conflicting interpretations of crystallographic and spectroscopic/theoretical studies. Using 57 Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS), complemented by Mössbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory, we elucidated the redox-linked structural changes in the FDP from Escherichia coli . The as-isolated diferric state is best described as a dihydroxo-bridged Fe(III)–(μOH − ) 2 –Fe(III) core, which upon reduction converts to a monohydroxo Fe(II)–(μOH − )–Fe(II) center through the loss of one bridging ligand. This ligand rearrangement defines the structural basis for redox-linked reactivity in FDPs. The study further demonstrates that photoreduction of a stable metalloprotein species can occur under NRVS conditions, indicating that synchrotron-based vibrational measurements may induce subtle redox changes even under low photon flux. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for interpreting redox-linked ligand dynamics in diiron enzymes and highlight the need to collect damage-free X-ray crystal structures avoiding potential beam-induced reduction. Furthermore, diiron active sites are found in numerous other enzyme classes (e.g., methane monooxygenase), and therefore, our findings have implications way beyond the FDPs.",

          "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid that circulates in plasma bound to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and albumin. Circulating S1P levels correlate positively with systolic blood pressure (BP) in hypertension and negatively with severity in septic shock and with left ventricular function in heart disease. In mice, isolated deficiency in HDL-S1P and endothelial cell S1P receptor (R)-1 both trigger hypertension, supporting an essential role for HDL-S1P in endothelial function. Physiological roles of albumin-S1P and myocyte S1PRs in the cardiovascular system remain incompletely defined. We report that mice lacking all circulating S1P pools display hypotension and lack of BP increase with age, which contrasts with HDL-S1P deficiency and suggests an essential role for albumin-S1P in cardiovascular homeostasis. Although cardiac output was preserved in a basal state, left ventricular systolic function and contractile reserve were reduced in the absence of circulating S1P. Cardiac function and BP were partially or fully normalized by transfusion of erythrocytes capable of S1P production. Hypotension was accompanied by reduced peripheral resistance, and albumin-S1P, but not S1P complexed to an HDL-like chaperone, dose-dependently increased vascular resistance in isolated perfused kidneys via S1PR3 and S1PR2. Epistatic analysis supported a critical role for S1PR3 in S1P-dependent BP maintenance and pointed to a distinct origin of the cardiac phenotype. We thus uncover an essential role for circulating S1P in maintaining BP and left ventricular systolic function in mice. Our results also highlight distinct functions for the pools of S1P bound to HDL and to albumin, carrying both diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

          "abstract": "Seasonal dormancy in extratropical trees is a critical adaptation that synchronizes growth with favorable climatic conditions. Traditionally, the effective chilling temperatures (ECT) required for dormancy release have been assumed to be fixed, ranging between 0 and 10 °C, based largely on studies in cold climates. However, whether the ECT range varies across diverse climatic regions remains unclear, limiting our ability to predict tree responses to climate change. Here, we quantify ECT variation using controlled experiments on 14 species and long-term phenological observations of 65 species across a ~3,000 km latitudinal gradient in China. Our experimental results show that the estimated upper ECT threshold increases by 0.27 ± 0.06 °C per decreasing degree of latitude, indicating an expansion of the ECT range toward higher temperatures in warmer climates. Our modeling analysis of long-term phenological records supports this trend, showing a comparable increase of 0.18 ± 0.02 °C per decreasing degree of latitude. These findings provide empirical evidence of latitudinal variation in ECT, offering insights into the evolutionary adaptations in shaping tree seasonal growth across diverse climates, challenging the traditional view of a fixed 0 to 10 °C range. Incorporating this adaptive variation into vegetation models and management strategies is crucial for improving predictions of forest phenology, productivity, and resilience under climate warming.",

          "abstract": "Gene family expansions are critical for functional diversification, yet the contributions of paralogs to metabolic pathways are often unclear. In Caenorhabditis , the expanded O-acyltransferase (OAC) family—enzymes that transfer acyl groups to hydroxylated substrates—remains poorly characterized despite having been implicated in lipid metabolism. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, behavioral assays, gas chromatographic-mass spectral (GC-MS) analyses, and metabolomics, we systematically analyzed 59 OAC-family protein-coding genes to define their roles in regulating signaling molecules. We found that four adjacent paralogs ( oac-13, oac-16, oac-25, and oac-28 ) on chromosome I are required for synthesizing volatile sex pheromones—airborne signals critical for male mate-searching. Specifically, oac -13 and oac-16 are necessary for producing both major pheromone components, while the identical tandem paralogs oac-25 and oac-28 regulate the production of the later-eluting component in gas chromatography. Disruption of these genes reduced production of key pheromone components and impaired male attraction. Metabolomics revealed that oac-16 and other OACs also modulate the synthesis and secretion of nonvolatile ascaroside pheromones, indicating dual roles in chemical signaling. This work uncovers functional specialization within an expanded gene family, illustrating how redundancy and divergence enable adaptive evolution of communication systems.",

          "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT), leading to its misfolding and aggregation. The subcellular localization of mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates critically influences their neuronal toxicity, with nuclear aggregates contributing more significantly to neurodegeneration than those in the neuropil. Our previous findings demonstrated that site-specific ubiquitination of lysine residues at the positions of K6 and K9 in HTT significantly affect the aggregation properties of mHTT and influence cell viability. However, the in vivo functional relevance of this modification remains elusive. To address this, we generated two HD knock-in (KI) mouse models in which the mouse Htt exon 1 was replaced by human mutant HTT exon 1 containing 134 pure cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats. In addition, one of these KI lines carries lysine-to-arginine (K &gt; R) substitutions at residues 6 and 9 to block site-specific ubiquitination (Q134 RR line). Compared to Q134 KK control mice, Q134 RR mice showed a more pronounced accumulation of both soluble and aggregated forms of mHTT. Notably, the K &gt; R substitutions accelerated mHTT aggregation kinetics, resulting in the formation of large inclusion bodies and their exclusive nuclear localization. Furthermore, Q134 RR mice exhibited earlier onset and accelerated progression of motor impairments, brain atrophy, and neuropathological features. Collectively, our findings provide strong in vivo evidence for the crucial role of site-specific ubiquitination at K6 and K9 in modulating mHTT aggregation and HD pathology. These results reinforce the therapeutic potential of targeting these specific ubiquitination sites for clinical translation.",

CD8 + T cell populations are reduced, the level of which has emerged as an index of disease severity. Recent work has shown that the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 is a rich reservoir of antimicrobial peptide-like sequence motifs (xenoAMPs) which can chaperone and organize dsRNA for amplified Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that proteolytic digestion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by host trypsin-like serine proteases directly produces xenoAMPs. Synchrotron Small Angle X-ray Scattering, mass spectrometry, and a theoretical analysis based on continuum membrane elasticity show that proteolytically generated xenoAMPs from SARS-CoV-2 proteins in vitro and machine learning-predicted high-scoring xenoAMPs all induce negative Gaussian curvature (NGC) necessary for pore formation in membranes. We find that xenoAMPs alone as well as xenoAMPs synergistically with endogenous AMP LL-37 can induce NGC in membranes. A computational analysis of immune cells with morphologically complex shapes (e.g., pDC, CD8 + , and CD4 + T cells) suggests that surfaces with high local NGC can concentrate AMP-like sequences and promote selective membrane disruption. Consistent with this hypothesis, experiments with freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells confirm that viable pDCs, DCs, and T cells are significantly depleted after xenoAMP exposure, in contrast to monocytes and neutrophils, the immune cell subsets with spheroidal morphology. Structural data from Omicron variant xenoAMP homologs indicate reduced pore formation, consistent with clinical observations of reduced T cell cytopenia in Omicron variant infections.",

          "authors": "Jack S. Turicek, Zachary J. Phillips, Kalyana B. Nakshatrala, Jason F. Patrick",
          "abstract": "Nature’s structural composites, such as bone and wood, achieve mechanical performance through hierarchical multimaterial design. Though, their real vantage lies in the exceptional ability to repeatedly heal after damage. Synthetic fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites also leverage material hierarchy via fibrous reinforcement encapsulated within a polymer matrix, maximizing stiffness and strength. However, the layered architecture of laminated FRP composites makes them vulnerable to interlaminar delamination—debonding of fibers from the matrix—which significantly compromises structural integrity. Recently, we introduced a self-healing strategy via in situ heating, where soft yet tough thermoplastic inclusions achieve interlaminar fracture recovery via polymer chain re-entanglement, i.e., thermal remending. Here, in our latest embodiment, by automating in situ thermo-mechanical experiments, we achieve an order-of-magnitude enhancement in self-healing repeatability—reaching an unprecedented 1,000 cycles. Healing begins at 175% and slowly declines to 60% of the mode-I fracture resistance of a plain (nonhealing) composite, revealing unique chemo-physical mechanisms that govern this behavior. Both fiber-debris accumulation in the molten poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) healing agent, and waning interfacial chemical reactions between the EMAA and epoxy matrix, contribute. A Weibull distribution capturing this complex fracture recovery predicts an asymptotic healing limit above 40%, suggesting sustained repair is possible. Translating these newfound thermal remending results into real-world context, a modest quarterly self-healing schedule could maintain interlaminar fracture repair of FRP composites for over 125 y—well beyond the typical design life of many modern structures including aircraft and wind turbines. Thus, this latest self-healing paradigm effectively eliminates delamination as a failure mode.",

          "abstract": "Perissodactyls were a diverse order of mammals in the Northern Hemisphere during the Paleogene, but very few species remain today. They first appear during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 56 Ma) on the three continents of the Northern Hemisphere. Because they lack modern diversity, the study of their evolutionary history remains difficult, relying almost exclusively on fossils. In addition, their origin and early diversification remain elusive since all main groups appear at the same time with several genera and are already diverse, contrary to other modern mammal orders. Here, we investigate the early evolution of perissodactyls by analyzing a new dataset focusing on early species to obtain a new expansive phylogeny. This new topology, in combination with new observations and comparisons demonstrates that several genera are synonymous, simplifying the evolutionary picture of early perissodactyls. We show that the number of genera was overestimated and should be significantly reevaluated. These results also highlight fast dispersals of two genera, Pliolophus and Cardiolophus , on the three Northern continents, reflecting that of other modern mammals. The phylogeny also supports a potential Indo-Pakistani origin of perissodactyls. In addition, this large-scale phylogeny shows that many species that were named as “ Hyracotherium ” in the past (or sometimes “ Eohippus ”, the “dawn-horse”) and considered as “horses”, are not actually closely related to horses (Hippomorpha), including Hyracotherium itself, but can be considered as basal perissodactyls.",

The basis for this dysfunction is poorly understood. Here, we report neurological dysfunction for at least 120 d postinfection in mice infected with a virulent nonneurotropic mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed diminished tyrosine hydroxylase expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and in substantia nigra. Similar changes were observed in brains of COVID-19 deceased patients. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased proinflammatory cytokines, and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, similar to human neurodegenerative diseases. Treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) at the time of infection minimally prevented neurological abnormalities, consistent with patient data. In contrast, antivirals plus corticosteroids resulted in nearly complete recovery of neurological function. Remarkably, initiation of combined therapy even three days after infection improved outcomes. Together these results demonstrate that neurological dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice resembles human neurodegenerative disease and indicate that minimizing inflammation early after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be critical for decreasing neurological PASC. The requirement for decreasing inflammation soon after infection may also explain why antiviral therapy has had inconsistent effects in patients.",

          "abstract": "For valuable ammonia synthesis and green nitrogen recycling, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) presents a sustainable alternative to the conventional Haber–Bosch process. The NO 3 RR involves intricate, multi-step proton-coupled electron transfers (PCET) featuring multiple nitrogen-oxygen intermediates and reaction branches. Unveiling this complex reaction library is crucial for rational tailoring of NO 3 RR for improved practical application, yet it remains a formidable challenge. Herein we present an in situ ultramicroelectrode-hyphenated mass spectrometry technique to systematically investigate the dynamic electrocatalytic NO 3 RR, using a cobalt-based molecular catalyst as a model system, and to decipher its mechanistic library under complex reaction environments (potential- and pH-dependent). Several key short-lived CoNO x H y intermediates were directly tracked and identified, experimentally revealing that the overall catalytic pathway of NO 3 RR proceeds through the intermediary [LCo-NO 3 ]→[LCo-NO 3 H] + →[LCo-NO 2 ] + → [LCo-NO 2 H] + → [LCo-NO] + → [LCo-NHOH] + → [LCo-NH] + to produce NH 3 , which were further validated by isotopic 15 N-labeling and collision-induced dissociation experiments. Combining theoretical simulations, a complete PCET-based mechanistic pathway was elucidated and distinguished from competing hydrogenation–deoxygenation mechanisms. Notably, a systematically interconnected electrochemical mechanistic library for NO 3 RR, visualized through heat maps, was constructed to illustrate intermediate selectivity across a broad potential-pH space. This platform underscores the promising potential of navigating the pathway prediction and regulation of complex reaction environments, thereby advancing the mechanistic understanding of NO 3 RR and other complicated electrocatalytic processes.",

          "abstract": "We present an alternative approach to conventional small-molecule and antisense strategies for selectively targeting expanded CUG-RNA repeats associated with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1. Our alternatively designed nucleic acid ligands uniquely integrate advantageous features from both existing methods: They are compact (only three units in length), structurally resembling small molecules, yet recognize RNA targets through directional hydrogen-bonding similar to antisense oligonucleotides. Notably, these ligands exhibit greater specificity and selectivity than either approach alone. This enhanced specificity results from their bifacial recognition mechanism, wherein mismatches on one binding interface are reciprocally mirrored on the complementary face. Additionally, their short length significantly amplifies specificity, as even a single mismatch substantially reduces the overall binding free energy, effectively minimizing off-target interactions. Unlike conventional oligonucleotides, these ligands avoid binding single-stranded RNA and only recognize defined hairpin motifs via a “pothole-filling” mechanism. This method amplifies recognition specificity and selectivity, circumventing the thermodynamic penalties associated with RNA unfolding. This proof-of-concept study thus lays a foundation for developing versatile nucleic acid ligands capable of selectively targeting not only pathogenic CUG-RNA repeats in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 but also other disease-associated triplet-repeat expansions prevalent in various neuromuscular disorders.",

In many bacterial species, the second messenger c-di-GMP regulates these processes through PilZ domain proteins, however the downstream mechanisms have remained poorly defined. Here, we identify the PilZ domain protein PlzC as a key positive regulator of motility and biofilm formation through distinct mechanisms. A suppressor screen for mutants restoring Δ plzC migration identified downstream regulators, including CheX, a CheY-3 phosphatase. Genetic and phenotypic analyses revealed that PlzC promotes motility by modulating CheX, thereby influencing the frequency of direction changes during swimming. Notably, the role of PlzC in motility regulation is independent of CheZ, another CheY-3 phosphatase, demonstrating that among the two CheY-3 phosphatases, only CheX is under PlzC control. This distinction suggests that CheY-3-P levels are regulated by at least two separate signaling pathways, one of which operates through PlzC. Despite its function in motility, CheX is not required for PlzC-mediated biofilm regulation, indicating pathway specificity. PlzC regulates biofilm formation through a mechanism that involves c-di-GMP binding, separating it from its CheX-dependent motility regulation. Together, our findings establish PlzC as a central regulator linking CheX-mediated motility and c-di-GMP signaling, thereby impacting motility and biofilm formation in V. cholerae .",

Anticipating these shifts is a central challenge, particularly under accelerating climate change. Although early warning signals of critical transitions have been widely studied, the mechanisms that drive or prevent them remain less well understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework based on time-delayed dynamics that allows us to identify processes acting as catalysts or inhibitors of critical transitions in ecological systems. We show that a composite measure combining time-delayed species interactions with species abundances is a key modulator of critical transitions. Beyond the critical point, systems exhibit persistent abundance oscillations, substantially increasing the risk of large-scale destabilization and species extinctions. Additionally, we show that a high diversity of species interaction types can act as a buffer of critical transitions. Instead, strong species self-regulation effects can act as catalysts of such transitions, contrary to common expectations. We illustrate the framework with empirical data from microbial systems. Together, these results provide a formal platform for exploring and understanding the drivers of critical transitions in complex living systems.",

Accurate estimation of the extinction threshold is critical, as elevating viral mutation rates near, but not past this threshold increases the likelihood of mutations that could result in drug resistance, vaccine escape, or increased pathogenesis. Traditional models of lethal mutagenesis rely on the Poisson distribution, which assumes a uniform mutation rate across individuals. Yet, RNA viruses like influenza A virus (IAV) can have varied mutation rates due to mutations in the polymerase complex. This variability suggests that lethal mutagenesis models incorporating mutation rate diversity, such as ones using the gamma-Poisson distribution, may be more accurate for RNA viruses. Poisson models assume count data have equal mean and variance, while gamma-Poisson counts are overdispersed (variance greater than mean). Here, we provide experimental data showing that IAV mutations are overdispersed, indicating that the gamma-Poisson distribution is more appropriate for modeling IAV mutations. Modeling of lethal mutagenesis using the gamma-Poisson distribution reveals that the degree of overdispersion is critical in determining survival or extinction. Increased overdispersion shifts the extinction threshold higher, indicating that Poisson-based models have underestimated the mutation rate required to achieve viral extinction and avoid viral escape or accelerated evolution. Furthermore, time to extinction in simulated populations is significantly longer with gamma-Poisson-based models than Poisson-based. This investigation of how mutation rate variability affects lethal mutagenesis will directly impact antiviral drug design and strategy, thus advancing efforts to combat virus outbreaks and future pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involves aggressive invasion at the tumor–host interface, particularly at the leading edge. However, the mechanisms sustaining this invasive front remain unclear. Here, we performed spatially resolved multiomics profiling to characterize the leading-edge multicellular ecosystem (LEMCE) of HNSCC. We identified a set of twelve autocrine ligands, including TGFB1, ICAM1, and TNC, that support a stable invasive transcriptional state. Impaired fatty acid (FA) degradation in this region enhances autocrine ligands and amplifies proinvasive gene expression. Spatial single-cell analysis revealed that the specific resident cells in the LEMCE, which exhibited increased expression of autocrine ligands and impaired FA degradation, participated in a fibroblast–macrophage–T cell interaction circuit involving MMP1 + fibroblasts and C1QC + /SPP1 + macrophages, followed by interactions between C1QC + macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. These interactions may contribute to the structural organization and immunosuppressive features of the LEMCE. Therapeutically, targeting this niche via a combination of autocrine cytokine blockade, FA metabolic restoration, and PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition suppressed invasion, reduced metastasis, and prolonged survival in mouse models. Our findings define the LEMCE as a self-reinforcing invasive and immunosuppressive niche and highlight its potential as a targetable vulnerability in HNSCC.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions in mating strategy have profound consequences for genetic variation and adaptation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , mating-type switching is a central feature of the life cycle that enables haploid cells to be self-fertile and mate with their own mitotic descendants (homothallism). Yet heterothallic isolates that have lost this ability are found across diverse niches, indicating that this trait is polymorphic. Here, we experimentally characterized loss of mating-type switching in a representative panel of strains. Analysis of 117 telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies revealed multiple independent loss-of-function mutations in the Ho endonuclease gene and structural variants in the silent HML and HMR cassettes, the three loci essential for switching. We estimated that at least 13 independent transitions from homothallism to heterothallism have occurred in the species history. Analysis of the HO genotype of 2,910 strains shows that at least 27% are heterothallic. We found that heterothallism is strongly associated with polyploidy and elevated genome-wide heterozygosity, although the strength of these associations varies between populations. Heterothallic isolates are most prevalent in domesticated and clinical clades, consistent with an origin linked to human-associated environments. However, they are also found, though less frequently, in natural niches. Signatures of recombination in HO sequences suggest that outcrossing contributed to the ecological and geographical distribution of the trait. Our findings reveal that mating-type switching has undergone repeated losses in S. cerevisiae evolution, with major consequences for genome architecture and ecological diversification.",

          "abstract": "Molecules in dense environments, such as biological cells, are subjected to forces that fluctuate both in time and in space. While spatial fluctuations are captured by Lifson-Jackson-Zwanzig’s model of “diffusion in a rough potential,” and temporal fluctuations are often viewed as leading to additional friction effects, a unified view where the environment fluctuates both in time and in space is currently lacking. Here, we introduce a discrete-state model of a landscape fluctuating both in time and in space. Importantly, the model accounts for the reciprocal interaction of the diffusing particle with the landscape, which alters the landscape dynamics. As a result we find, surprisingly, that many features of the observable dynamics do not depend on the temporal fluctuation timescales and are already captured by the model of diffusion in a rough potential, even though this assumes a static energy landscape. Using this model, we reevaluate results of several experimental studies of protein dynamics and propose more accurate bounds on the inferred energetic roughness scales, which account for landscape dynamics.",

Persisting challenges with patient-specific approaches include inconsistent performance, high costs, and delayed graft availability. Toward developing a one-for-all solution, a more attractive paradigm lies in the exploitation of dedicated cell lines for the fabrication of human tissue grafts. Following decellularization, this new class of biomaterials relies on the sole extracellular matrix and embedded growth factors instructing endogenous repair. This conceptual approach was previously validated using a custom mesenchymal cell line for the manufacturing of human cartilage, exhibiting remarkable osteoinductive capacity following lyophilization. Key missing criteria to envision clinical translation include proper decellularization as well as stringent assessment of both immunogenicity and regenerative performance. Here, we report the engineering and subsequent decellularization of human cartilage tissue with minimal matrix impairment. Ectopic evaluation in immunocompetent (IC) and immunocompromised animals reveals preservation of osteoinductivity predicted by macrophage kinetic of polarization. By establishing in vitro human allogeneic coculture models, we evidenced the immunosuppressive properties of cell-free human cartilages, controlling macrophage and dendritic cell maturation as well as T cell activation. Finally, regenerative performance was stringently assessed in an IC rat orthotopic model whereby decellularized human cartilage grafts achieved morphological and mechanical restoration of all critical-sized femoral defects. Taken together, our study provides robust safety and efficacy prerequisites prompting a first-in-human trial for engineered and decellularized human tissue grafts.",

While previous studies have established the existence of these cells, the relationship between cellular and synaptic activity remains unclear. To address this, we applied the dual-enhanced green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners (dual-eGRASP) technique in mice to examine synaptic connectivity between the ventral CA1 and the basal amygdala during memory formation. We found that contextual fear conditioning increased engram-to-engram synapse (engram synapse) density and induced structural potentiation, highlighting their importance in associative memory. Additionally, we investigated the role of protein synthesis in memory formation by drug-induced amnesia using anisomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Mice injected with anisomycin once (1xANI) showed impaired natural recall but still displayed fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation. In contrast, mice that received four anisomycin injections over 6 h (4xANI) showed significantly impaired natural recall and failed to exhibit fear responses upon optogenetic reactivation. This behavioral phenotype correlated with synaptic changes as assessed using dual eGRASP, where 1xANI mice exhibited no significant reduction in engram synapse density but had significantly smaller spine sizes, whereas 4xANI mice showed both a significant reduction in engram synapse density and spine size. Our results indicate that protein synthesis inhibition significantly reduces engram synapse density and spine size, changes that correlate with reductions in fear memory during both natural and artificial recall.",

Here, we present a high-resolution imaging framework based on parallel-transmit, motion-corrected, ultra-high-field (7T) MRI paired with an automated, anatomically faithful cerebellar segmentation pipeline. This enables detailed quantification of cerebellar morphology and vascular architecture at scales previously inaccessible in living humans, as validated with postmortem data. Applying this framework, we uncover consistent interlobular heterogeneity in both cortical thickness and vascularization. These spatial gradients relate to differences in the granular layer from 3D-histology data. Our findings suggest that the cerebellar granular layer may act as a structural determinant of vascular density, linking anatomical features with metabolic load. These findings align cerebellar structure–function relationships with similar findings in the neocortex, where morphology reflects functional specialization and energy consumption. Our results also suggest that the in vivo imaging biomarkers we derive may offer broad avenues to monitor cerebellar involvement in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, where granular layer pathology is prominent.

Patients may progress from steatosis alone to complications such as fibrosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The cause of progression is unclear. We previously showed that liver stiffening can drive fibrosis. However, the mechanical contributions of hepatic lipid and especially cholesterol accumulation are not known. We used rat dietary models to investigate how lipid accumulation affects liver mechanics. Liver stiffness was measured using rheology and magnetic resonance elastography, and associations between stiffness and lipid droplets (LDs) or cholesterol-containing lipid crystals were measured by microindentation-visualization. Polarized light, confocal reflection, and cryo–electron microscopy were employed to assess crystal abundance and structure. LDs and crystals extracted from livers were embedded in fibrous tissue mimics to isolate mechanical effects away from inflammation or fibrosis. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin perfusion was performed to assess whether cholesterol depletion reduced crystal abundance and tissue stiffness. Increased hepatic cholesterol storage led to the formation of cholesterol-containing lipid crystals in the liver. Steatotic livers with crystals stiffened before fibrosis while steatotic livers without crystals did not stiffen or fibrose. Lipid crystals stiffened tissue mimics while LDs did not, suggesting that crystals directly cause stiffening. Cholesterol depletion reduced crystal abundance and reverted tissue stiffness to near controls without changing inflammation, suggesting key roles for cholesterol in tissue stiffening. Lipid crystals cause profibrogenic liver stiffening, connecting high dietary cholesterol to MASLD progression, and may be a target for new diagnostic tools and therapeutics for progressive MASLD.",

In this study, we found that USP25 exacerbated dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits in murine models of PD by sabotaging the mitophagy machinery. USP25 physically interacted with the autophagy receptor optineurin and disrupted its linkage with K63-specific polyubiquitin chains, leading to impaired mitophagy and the accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of USP25 significantly restored mitophagy and thereby impeded the neurodegenerative progression in PD model mice.

In contrast, microbial domestication has often occurred unintentionally, and the variation of life cycle as well as its impact on genome evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically examined life cycle variation across a diverse panel of 771 diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates from both wild and domesticated lineages. We identified widespread alterations in sexual reproduction, including impairments of sporulation, spore viability, and mating-type switching. These changes led to the emergence of two distinct life cycle strategies, favoring either asexual or sexual reproduction, which were notably enriched in domesticated clades. Haplotype analyses of the HO mating-type switching gene revealed multiple, independent loss-of-function mutations, indicating convergent evolution of heterothallism. While a preference for sexual life cycle often correlated with increased genomic heterozygosity in domesticated and human-associated clades, this relationship was not uniform across all lineages. We propose that the co-occurrence of altered sexual and asexual cycle preferences results in a trade-off that balances outcrossing and the subsequent maintenance of heterozygosity in domesticated populations. Finally, we provide a CRISPR-based molecular toolbox and a stable haploid strain collection spanning global genetic diversity, enabling further genetic research and industrial applications.",

In contrast, adding CsCl to water initially decreases the viscosity, but at moderate concentration further addition increases it. While this phenomenon is well known, the molecular mechanisms for the reduction and increase have not been elucidated. We used ultrafast optical heterodyne–detected optical Kerr effect (OHD-OKE) and IR pump–probe experiments, as well as density functional theory to investigate the impact of Cs + ions on water dynamics, interactions, and structure. OHD-OKE experiments demonstrated that the dynamics of the water hydrogen bond (H-bond) network underpin the viscosity of CsCl solutions. Transient IR spectra of HOD in H 2 O interacting with Cs + showed a significant blue shift, a hallmark of hydrogen bonds weaker than those of pure water. Due to its low charge density, Cs + is distinct from high charge density cations, e.g., Na + and Li + , which have been observed to strengthen water hydrogen bonds and drive a large, monotonic increase in viscosity with concentration. The results showed that water hydrogen bonds in the Cs + second solvation shell are weaker than typical water–water hydrogen bonds, and these weak hydrogen bonds give rise to faster collective structural dynamics, leading to reduced viscosity. However, at sufficiently high salt concentrations, the low number of water molecules per ion pair leads to water clusters. Water confined in small clusters slows H-bond rearrangement, leading to an increase in viscosity.",

Here, we report a recoding scheme for the 205 kb Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, and serine, all of which have two cognate transfer RNAs (tRNAs), are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native sequence without affecting expression of a reporter protein or strain fitness under standard laboratory conditions. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1 , encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA , intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction center subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and nonessential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of Rubisco, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain.

In bird populations, salmonellosis outbreaks are temporally irregular but occur simultaneously across large spatial extents, frequently leading to widespread avian mortality with occasional spillover to humans. Here, we test the hypothesis that avian salmonellosis epidemics result from a cascade of ecological processes triggered by climate variability in coniferous forests. Building on well-evidenced ecological mechanisms, we find strong evidence for multiyear causal links between temperature cues that drive substantial “boom-bust” cycles in tree cone production across North America, the subsequent irruptions of seed-eating birds, and, finally, the eventual occurrence and severity of avian salmonellosis outbreaks in the United States. By using an integrated, multilevel Bayesian statistical model as a predictive tool to forecast future bird irruptions and disease outbreaks, we demonstrate that our methods can be employed as an early warning system for future epidemics, potentially mitigating outbreak severity among birds and lowering the risk of zoonotic spillover events by encouraging measures such as the temporary cessation of bird feeding ahead of high-risk periods.",

However, in pathological conditions such as severe or recurrent muscle injury, FAPs can aberrantly differentiate into fibrogenic cells, resulting in excessive deposition of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. In this study, we explore the molecular regulation of FAP differentiation along the fibrogenic lineage to gain insights into the mechanisms of fibrosis in aged muscle in response to injury. Our findings reveal that aging is associated with an increased expression of the complement component 1q (C1q) in muscle-resident macrophages and elevated expression of the complement proteins C1r and C1s in FAPs. Exposure of proliferating FAPs to C1q results in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, elevated expression of collagen genes, and FAP fibrogenic differentiation, leading to increased tissue fibrosis. We demonstrate that either pharmacological inhibition of the complement pathway or genetic ablation of C1s in FAPs in aged mice reduces fibrogenic differentiation of FAPs by suppressing Wnt signaling. This reduction in FAP differentiation attenuates the fibrotic response to injury in aged animals as well as in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy. Our study supports the inhibition of complement signaling as a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating fibrosis in skeletal muscle injury or degeneration.",

In this study, we extracted amyloid fibrils directly from abdominal fat and cardiac tissue biopsies obtained from three AL patients. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined five distinct structures of light chain (LC) amyloid fibrils. Our results demonstrate that LC fibrils from different patients adopt unique structural conformations, highlighting patient-specific fibril variations. Conversely, LC fibrils extracted from different tissues within the same patient share highly similar overall fibril structures, yet exhibit localized conformational variations, potentially shaped by distinct environmental cofactors. This study emphasizes the combined roles of patient-specific protein sequences and tissue-specific microenvironments in defining LC fibril conformation.

          "abstract": "Ischemic white matter damage is a significant pathological feature of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, leading to cognitive impairments. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify a causal association between genetically predicted extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) expression and higher white matter hyperintensity volume through druggable target screening, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for white matter damage. Using different animal models of white matter damage, we show that Erk5 expression is significantly upregulated in microglia following both ischemic and demyelinating injury, correlating with the severity of white matter damage. Mechanistically, Erk5 exacerbates white matter damage by promoting microglial ferroptosis through the phosphorylation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 4 (Nfatc4), which subsequently activates the expression of cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1-like protein (Clptm1l), a lipid scramblase involved in ferroptosis. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Erk5 in microglia effectively mitigates oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis, leading to a reduction in white matter damage and improved cognitive function. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the Erk5–Nfatc4–Clptm1l axis as a therapeutic strategy for ischemic white matter damage. Our study offers valuable insights into the molecular pathways driving white matter damage and provides a framework for the clinical translation of Erk5 inhibitors in the treatment of ischemic white matter damage.",

We show that the yam Dioscorea melanophyma —which has lost sexual reproduction—evolved black, glossy bulbils that mimic co-occurring black berries and entice frugivorous birds to ingest and disperse them. Birds from 22 species fed on bulbils, with visits peaking in October–February when true fruits are scarce. Bulbil reflectance overlapped sympatric berries and was indistinguishable in a UV-sensitive avian vision model for many species, consistent with Batesian visual mimicry. Feeding trials with the dominant visitor ( Pycnonotus xanthorrhous ) showed short gut retention and negligible destruction, so bulbils are excreted largely intact and viable and monitoring revealed that bulbils achieved dispersal distances similar to rewarding endozoochorous plants. Thus, sensory deception that exploits fruit–frugivore signal–reward rules can restore ecologically meaningful movement after the loss of sex in asexual lineages.",

We report a layer-by-layer elastin-like polypeptide nucleic acid nanoparticle (LENN) system for mRNA delivery as an attractive alternative to viral vectors and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) systems. This study focuses on determining the physical characteristics of LENN bearing mRNA cargo and assessing their biological performance in T24 bladder tumor cells. Our data show that mRNA encoding luciferase forms stable 30 to 130 nm LENN particles via batch mixing to efficiently encapsulate the mRNA strands, are resistant to heparin challenge, and are capable of storage at −20 °C for 3 d as lyophilized powders while retaining full biological activity after rehydration. We also demonstrate that LENN targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can efficiently deliver the mRNA cargo to the cytosol of EGFR+ T24 human bladder cancer cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis where it is translationally active. Lipid profiling analyses show the significant role that upregulated phospholipid biosynthesis plays in nanoparticle internalization and endosomal escape compared to untargeted LENN, indicating the importance of the clathrin pathway in contributing to the delivery efficiency of LENN. Endocytosis inhibition experiments further support the involvement of the clathrin pathway. These findings highlight the compelling features of LENN with respect to their size, in vitro and in vivo targetability, mRNA encapsulation efficiency, complex stability, gene expression, and “green” manufacturability, offering an attractive alternative to existing methods for gene delivery.",

It is unclear if early brain activity is dominated by cell intrinsic, synaptic, or nonsynaptic mechanisms. We address this question by analyzing Caenorhabditis elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA reuptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510 to 570 min postfertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABA A receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.",

Our results reveal deep population structure, involving Nilo-Saharan, West Eurasian, Northern African, and Western African ancestral components, as well as signatures of the Arab expansion. We report over one million novel variants, including population-specific deleterious alleles, highlighting the need for broader African genomic representation. Notably, local ancestry inference reveals a strong signal of adaptive admixture on chromosome 1 in Sudanese Copts, marked by a peak of Nilo-Saharan ancestry introduced via genetic admixture 1,000 to 1,500 y ago. At this locus, we estimate a remarkably strong selection coefficient (s = 0.0996) for SNP rs2814778 within the ACKR1 gene, which is responsible for the Duffy-null blood group that provides resistance to Plasmodium vivax malaria. These findings reveal Sudan as a genomic mosaic shaped by ancient and recent migrations and provide clear evidence of admixture-driven adaptation in an understudied region of Africa.",

          "abstract": "Phylodynamic analysis has been instrumental in elucidating epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens. Bayesian phylodynamics integrates out phylogenetic uncertainty, which is typically substantial in phylodynamic datasets due to limited genetic diversity. Phylodynamic inference does not, however, scale with modern datasets, partly due to difficulties in traversing tree space. Here, we characterize tree space and landscape in phylodynamic inference and assess its impacts on analysis difficulty and key biological estimates. By running extensive Bayesian analyses of 15 classic large phylodynamic datasets and carefully analyzing the posterior samples, we find that the posterior tree landscape is diffuse yet rugged, leading to widespread tree sampling problems that usually stem from sequences in a small part of the tree. We develop clade-specific diagnostics to show that a few sequences—including putative recombinants and recurrent mutants—frequently drive the ruggedness and sampling problems, although existing data-quality tests show limited power to detect them. The sampling problems can significantly impact phylodynamic inferences or distort major biological conclusions; the impact is usually stronger on “local” estimates (e.g., introduction history) associated with particular clades than on “global” parameters (e.g., demographic trajectory) governed by general tree shape. We evaluate existing Markov chain Monte Carlo diagnostics and diagnostics developed here, and offer strategies for optimizing phylodynamic analysis settings and mitigating sampling problem impacts. Our findings highlight the need and directions to develop efficient traversal over rugged tree landscapes, ultimately advancing scalable and reliable phylodynamics.",

Optical imaging of misfolded proteins in disease models is essential for elucidating etiology and early diagnosis. However, developing specific optical imaging probes for each misfolded protein is time-consuming and challenging, leaving many pathological targets without effective detection tools, especially for in vivo imaging. Here, we present a dual-mode chemiluminescence strategy that enables both generic and specific detection of misfolded proteins using a single probe platform. In the generic mode, we demonstrate that ADLumin-1, a chemiluminescent probe, enables highly sensitive detection of diverse misfolded proteins in vitro, achieving up to 128-fold higher signal enhancement than Thioflavin T, and allows noninvasive imaging in mice models of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the specific mode, ADLumin-1 combined with protein misfolding cyclic amplification allows femtomolar-level detection of α-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid, while integration with a bio-orthogonal chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer technique enables in vivo discrimination of α-synuclein from Aβ. This dual-mode, modular approach offers a practical solution to the current probe limitations, with potential preclinical and clinical applications in neurodegenerative disorders.",

Such platform integrates multilayer architectures that include SiN x layers as the mechanically triggered substrate for 3D wrapping, with multimodal treatments via MXene and drug-loaded layers for photothermal stimulation and pharmacological release. Experimental and computational studies establish operational principle as the basis for the combination of long-term photothermal therapy and transient drug delivery at high spatiotemporal resolution. In vivo tests on living rat models demonstrate that the implantable neural interface can roll up across the localized, dynamic surface of injured nerves, providing sustained treatments over 1 mo in a fully bioresorbable design after the healing process.

The causes driving this evolutionary transition have been attributed to the changes in essential nutrients and the environmental crises of the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms driving this transition remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated culture experiments, molecular and physiological analyses, big data analysis, and phylogenomic dating analyses to uncover how environmental stresses influence algal physiology, thereby altering their evolutionary trajectories. We find that environmental and endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) collaboratively shape phytoplanktonic responses. The structural characteristics of red lineage phytoplankton enhance resistance to environmental ROS, facilitating physiological strategies that minimize endogenous ROS accumulation, thereby driving more adaptive evolutionary trajectories under environmental stresses in the early Mesozoic. The alignment of the turnover in diversification dynamics between the two lineages with paleoenvironmental shifts that triggered increased ROS production supports the role of ROS in driving this evolutionary transition. Our findings highlight ROS as a key underlying factor driving phytoplankton evolution, providing predictive insights into major biota–environment coevolutions throughout Earth’s history.",

We aligned skull position across timepoints (before and after spaceflight or bed rest) as a reference and then used rigid body registration to quantify brain position change. The brain shifted backward, upward, and rotated back in the pitch direction from before to after spaceflight and bed rest in a fashion that correlated with exposure duration. Regional analyses revealed nonlinear deformations in all three directions that were not captured in previous reports of the average position shift. Moreover, we observed symmetrical left–right shifts that were not evident in the average position shift due to sign cancellation. In those who spent one year in space, the supplementary motor cortex showed the largest upward displacement [2.52 mm, 95% CI = (2.25, 2.79)]. Widespread recovery occurred in all three dimensions (particularly in the up–down direction) over 6 mo following spaceflight. Larger posterior insula translations were correlated with greater postflight balance declines. The brain shifts and deformations in astronauts were somewhat similar to head-down tilt bed rest, but there were notable differences.

          "abstract": "The ancient city of Pompeii, destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79, shows technological improvements to its water supply after becoming a Roman colony. Its inhabitants relied on wells for their water supply prior to the installation of a Roman aqueduct. Carbonate incrustations deposited in various components of the city’s hydraulic infrastructure, including the aqueduct, its water towers, the well shafts, and pools of the public baths. The stable isotope and trace element composition of these carbonates differ markedly between structures supplied by wells and those fed by the aqueduct, reflecting the contrasting origins of their source waters. While the aqueduct was fed by karst springs, the wells tapped into highly mineralized groundwater from volcanic deposits. These geochemical distinctions allow for a detailed reconstruction of Pompeii’s water management system, particularly the transition from well- to aqueduct-based water supply. The periodicity of δ 13 C variations in carbonate crusts sampled from well, pools, and drainage channels of the Republican Baths offers insights into the operation and maintenance of the facility. δ 13 C values show a sharp drop from wells to bathing pools, suggesting contamination by human waste and implying that the bath water was not regularly replenished in the Republican Baths.",

While mobility and genomic data have revealed important aspects of pandemic spatial spread, several key questions remain: Did the two pandemics follow similar spatial transmission routes? How rapidly did they spread across the United States? What role did stochastic processes play in early spatial transmission? To address these questions, we integrated high-resolution disease data with a robust, data-efficient inference framework combining air travel, commuting flows, and pathogen superspreading potentials to reconstruct their spatial spread across US metropolitan areas. The two pandemics exhibited distinct transmission pathways across locations; however, both pandemics established local circulation in most metropolitan areas within weeks, driven by several shared transmission hubs. Early spatial spread was more strongly associated with air travel than with commuting, though stochastic dynamics introduced substantial uncertainty in transmission routes, creating challenges for timely detection and control. Simulations indicate that broad wastewater surveillance coverage beyond top transmission hubs coupled with effective infection control may slow initial spatial expansion. Our findings highlight the rapid, stochastic spread of pandemic respiratory pathogens and the difficulties of early outbreak containment.",

          "abstract": "The human brain excels at complex tasks with remarkable efficiency, adaptability, and resilience, making it a powerful source of inspiration for AI. Here, we present a neural dynamics model inspired by the primate dorsal visual pathway, a circuit crucial for motion and spatial processing. Incorporating key neuronal and synaptic dynamics, the model reproduces human-like decision-making behaviors and neural activity patterns without the need for extensive training. Compared with conventional artificial networks, it exhibits superior robustness to perturbations such as noise and damage. To further enhance its performance, we introduce a neuroimaging-guided fine-tuning strategy. Correlations between MRI features and behavioral performance are mapped onto critical model parameters, guiding the optimization toward more biologically plausible operational regimes. This approach improves performance and adaptability while preserving biological plausibility and reducing the parameter search space. This is a demonstration of directly integrating human neuroimaging evidence into AI model optimization, establishing a methodology for brain-inspired modeling. By combining insights from primate electrophysiology, human neuroimaging, and biologically grounded modeling, our work narrows the gap between neuroscience and AI. It demonstrates how brain-inspired approaches can advance the development of adaptive, resilient, and interpretable AI systems, offering a paradigm for biologically grounded intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common complication of diabetes, lacks effective treatments and is characterized by early axonal degeneration mediated by sterile alpha and Toll/interleukin receptor motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1). Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism of SARM1’s NAD + -cleaving activity via acetylation at lysine 641 (K641). In high-glucose conditions, SIRT3 deacetylates SARM1 at K641, enhancing its NAD + cleavage activity and exacerbating axonal damage. In type 2 diabetic (T2DM) mice, acetylation of SARM1 at K641 (K641Ac) or Sirt3 knockout mitigates hypoalgesia, intraepidermal nerve fiber loss in footpad skin, and axonal growth retardation in dorsal root ganglia. These interventions also attenuate ROS accumulation, ATP depletion, and NAD + decline, conferring protection against DPN pathology. Notably, wild-type SARM1 expression reverses the protective effects of Sirt3 ablation in T2DM mice, whereas SARM1 K641Q does not. Our findings establish that SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of SARM1 at K641 drives axonal degeneration in DPN, and enhancing K641 acetylation mitigates disease progression. This study uncovers a critical posttranslational regulation of SARM1 and suggests that targeting the SIRT3–SARM1 axis may offer therapeutic potential for DPN and related neurodegenerative conditions.",

Numerous studies support MIF’s role in activating inflammatory pathways and MIF inhibition reduces joint pathology in different experimental models of arthritis. We examined the impact of gene deletion of MIF or its cognate receptor CD74 in the T cell–dependent model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and observed the complete absence of arthritis development, suggesting an unforeseen role for MIF/CD74 signaling in the development of arthritogenic T cells. While MIF has been shown in model systems to contribute to T cell activation by augmenting innate responses, fewer than 1% of T lineage cells express CD74 in naive spleens and lymph nodes, and its functional consequences in pathogenic T cell subpopulations have not been studied. We found CD74+ T cells to expand during CIA and to increase in number within joint synovium, where they express an effector memory phenotype and recapitulate CIA development upon transfer into naive mice. We further found evidence for the presence of CD74+ T cells in the circulation and joint synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. MIF-dependent, CD74+ T cells may contribute to the chronicity of rheumatoid synovitis and to disease relapse in previously inflamed joints.",

          "abstract": "Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an mRNA decay pathway which degrades potential harmful transcripts that contain premature termination codons. However, NMD’s importance also extends to the control of isoform abundance under physiological conditions. During viral infection, NMD is inhibited through numerous mechanisms; however, NMD has been shown to have both antiviral as well as proviral activities, raising further questions into the role and control of NMD during viral infection. These observations have led us to investigate the potential involvement of NMD in dsRNA sensing as a mechanism that might explain these discrepancies. Using EIF4A2 exon 10B inclusion as an example of AS-NMD isoform accumulating during viral infection, we show that dsRNA sensing inhibits NMD. This effect is correlated with translational blockade and is driven primarily by RNaseL activation, and by PKR in the absence of RNaseL activation. Surprisingly, NMD inhibition limits the induction of IFN-β as well as interferon-stimulated genes, and this effect is upstream of IRF3 phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus. NMD inhibition also decreases PKR and RNaseL activation as well as PIC-mediated cell death by decreasing the dsRNA content, suggesting NMD directly controls dsRNA sensing by controlling the dsRNA load. Therefore, inhibition of NMD upon dsRNA sensing provides a negative feedback loop that contributes to shaping the innate immune sensing pathways.",

However, the ontology and repertoires of encephalitogenic γδT17 cells remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the encephalitogenicity of γδT17 cells is conferred through microfold cell (M cell)-dependent uptake of commensal bacteria in Peyer’s patches. Specifically, CXCR6 hi Vγ6 + Vδ1 + invariant γδT17 cells are activated by specific commensal bacteria such as Lactobacillus spp., which stimulate TCR of CXCR6 hi Vγ6 + Vδ1 + invariant γδT17 cells. During the early stages of EAE, γδT17 cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), initiating a type 17 inflammatory response. Our findings illustrate that Peyer’s patch M cells serve as a critical bridge, linking the pathological association between commensal bacteria and the onset of CNS inflammation.",

          "abstract": "The apoplast is an important battlefield in plant–pathogen interactions. The late blight oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, for instance, secretes cystatin-like protease inhibitors EpiC1 and EpiC2B to suppress C14, a papain-like immune protease secreted by tomato. Here, we found that P. infestans also secretes two distinct papain-like proteases termed Pain1 and Pain2, which are transcriptionally induced during infection. Both Pains promote P. infestans infection, but not when their catalytic residues are mutated. Strikingly, EpiC1 and EpiC2B preferentially inhibit tomato C14 rather than self-produced Pains, suggesting that they coevolved with Pains to avoid self-inhibition. To mimic the avoidance of inhibition by EpiCs, we engineered C14 (eC14) with seven Pain1 residues that potentially disturb the EpiCs–C14 interface. This eC14 is less sensitive to inhibition by EpiCs and enhances resistance to P. infestans infection. This strategy demonstrates that a pathogen-inspired protein engineering approach can increase crop resistance to plant pathogens.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the lunar farside experienced a magma ocean evolution similar to that of the nearside. Thus, the nearside-farside dichotomy, such as volcanism and crustal thickness, is likely related to the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin–forming impact. Although the noritic clasts found in Chang’e-6 (CE6) samples may originate from crustal remelting induced by the SPA impact, how (and whether) the lunar mantle was modified by this event remains unclear. Here, we present the first high-precision iron (Fe) and potassium (K) isotopic measurements of CE6 low-Ti basalts, revealing higher δ 56 Fe (0.13 to 0.21‰) and δ 41 K (0 to 0.09‰) in these basalts compared to their Apollo and Chang’e-5 (CE5) counterparts (δ 56 Fe: 0 to 0.11‰; δ 41 K: −0.29 to −0.04‰). The heavy Fe and K isotopic signatures are unlikely to be derived from cosmogenic effects or the addition of impactor-derived materials. Instead, the heavy Fe isotopes can be explained by partial melting and fractional crystallization processes. For K isotopes, however, the data require that the mantle source beneath the SPA basin had a heavier K isotopic composition than that of the nearside mantle, most likely resulting from evaporation caused by the SPA-forming impact. Our results thus provide robust evidence for significant impact-induced modification of the lunar mantle and demonstrate that large-scale impacts may have played a key role in creating lunar asymmetry.",

We previously showed that thermal selection primarily targets early embryos in Drosophila melanogaster .

We identified two loci on chromosomes 2R and X that were consistently targeted by 16 generations of thermal selection across six replicate introgressions. Global population comparisons revealed that two SNPs in these genomic regions exhibit clinal and seasonal patterns linked to environmental variability in average precipitation and temperature variance across space and time. The two SNPs lie in putative regulatory regions of the genes SP70 and sog , where allelic variation in gene expression correlates with heat tolerance. Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we confirmed that tropical alleles at these loci increase embryonic heat tolerance and interact epistatically, demonstrating the genotype-to-phenotype link in an independent set of diverse genetic backgrounds.

          "abstract": "A ~fivefold decrease in the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 took place during the Cenozoic. This has often been viewed within the context of silicate weathering changes, although the specific contributions of the potential drivers remain poorly understood. Indeed, it has been alternatively argued that changes in the sea floor spreading rate contributed to the Cenozoic p CO 2 decline, although the magnitude of the decrease means that this is unlikely to account for the entirety of the p CO 2 change. One previously overlooked factor is the concomitant change in the major element composition of seawater, especially the concentration of calcium ([Ca 2+ sw ]), which is typically viewed as responding to processes such as weathering, rather than representing a driver in and of itself. Here, we present the first detailed record of the Cenozoic major ion chemistry of seawater and show that [Ca 2+ sw ] has the potential to control key processes that impact the carbon cycle. Although our record cannot determine whether CO 2 is causally driven by [Ca 2+ sw ], carbon cycle box modeling identifies that this may have been the case. Whether or not [Ca 2+ sw ] indeed directly drove p CO 2 during the Cenozoic principally depends on the strength of the silicate weathering feedback and the magnitude of any possible changes in organic carbon burial, both of which could overwhelm a [Ca 2+ sw ]-driven impact on the carbon cycle. As such, determining the sensitivity of the weathering–climate relationship on million-year timescales is key to resolving whether factors such as seawater major ion composition are important carbon cycle drivers.",

They do so through area-specific temporal activity patterns, distinguishable well prior to movement onset.

          "abstract": "Thermal annealing improves the crystallinity of perovskite films and boosts their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in solar cells but also induces surface iodine loss and local lattice degradation. We demonstrate a molecular press annealing (MPA) strategy in which a 2-pyridylethylamine film is thermally and pressure-bonded to the perovskite surface. Real-time healing of iodine vacancies occurred during annealing and the lead-iodine framework was stabilized through optimized ligand engineering, resulting in enhanced structural integrity and long-term stability of perovskite films. This strategy enabled n-i-p perovskite solar cells to achieve a PCE of 26.6% (certified 26.5%). Notably, the devices retain 98.6 and 97.2% of their initial PCEs after 1617 hours of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking [ISOS-L-3 protocol, 85°C, 60% relative humidity (RH)] and 5280 hours of ambient storage (ISOS-D-1 protocol, room temperature, 10% RH).",

          "abstract": "The pain associated with bone fracture is mediated by somatosensory neurons, which also appear to be required to initiate bone regeneration. To characterize neuroanatomical circuitry mediating skeletal nociception and regeneration, we profiled dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons innervating murine bones using single-cell transcriptomics before and after fracture. CGRP + and Aβ-Field LTMR neurons were the most represented classes of bone-innervating neurons. Dynamic changes in sensory neuron response to injury reflected the phasic nature of bone repair, including expression of morphogens such as Tgfb1 , Fgf9 , and Shh . Innervation loss resulted in poor bone repair and was associated with defective mesenchymal cell proliferation and osteodifferentiation. Finally, we identified fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) as a major regulator of fracture repair that could be leveraged to promote bone repair.",

An outstanding question is how this organization emerges during development from an apparently homogeneous pool of neural progenitors. Here, we show that mouse dorsal neurons are diversified by time, with families of related cell types born as temporal cohorts, and by a spatial-molecular gradient that specifies individual cell types. Excitatory neurons settle into a chronotopic arrangement that transforms their progressive birthdates into anatomical order and is required to establish proper laminae. We identified essential ontogenetic principles that shape dorsal progenitors into the diverse cell types and structure that subserve sensorimotor function.",

In this study, we demonstrated that a small group of Gifted Word Learner dogs, which possess an extensive vocabulary of object labels, can learn new labels by overhearing their owners’ interactions. Moreover, we show that these dogs can acquire novel object-label mappings even when the labels and objects are not presented simultaneously.

Applying CB to the enzyme lipoic acid ligase (LplA), we uncovered a previously unknown mechanism controlling its promiscuous activity. Variants biased toward an “open” conformation state became more promiscuous, whereas “closed”-biased variants were more selective, enhancing LplA’s utility for site-specific protein labeling with fluorophores in living cells.

The predominant bacteria are hydrogen-cycling facultative anaerobes adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Furthermore, bark-associated methanotrophs are abundant and can coexist with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Microcosm experiments showed that bark microorganisms aerobically consume methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide at in planta concentrations and produce these gases under anoxia. Combined with in situ field measurements, we show that tree-dwelling microbiota metabolize multiple climate-active gases at marked rates within tree stems, highlighting a potentially substantial role in global atmospheric cycles.",

Within this mechanistic manifold, carbon-oxygen bonds in epoxides are stereoselectively converted into carbon-carbon bonds in a process mediated by organoboron reagents. Epoxycycloalkanes undergo highly chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective carbon migration to furnish ring-contracted products with broad generality. This strategy also enables enantioselective 1,2-hydride migrations for linear epoxide substrates. The combination of this ring contraction protocol with [4+2] cycloadditions provides a distinct “[4+2–1]” strategy for the stereoselective construction of complex cyclopentanes in a modular fashion.",

Besides dietary sources of animal origin, carnitine biosynthesis from trimethyllysine (TML) is essential, particularly for those who consume plant-based diets; however, its molecular regulation and physiological role remain elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A45 as a mitochondrial TML carrier that controls carnitine biosynthesis and fuel switching. SLC25A45 deficiency decreased the carnitine pool and impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, shifting reliance to carbohydrate metabolism. Slc25a45 -deficient mice were cold-intolerant and resistant to lipid mobilization by GLP1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), rendering them resistant to adipose tissue loss.

Floquet bands emerge through the periodic oscillation of the core, which can be initiated by either driving the core directly or pumping azimuthal magnon modes. For the latter, the azimuthal modes induce core gyration through nonlinear interactions, which in turn renormalizes the magnon band structure.

Multispecies mixtures outyielded two widely used grassland practices: a grass monoculture with higher nitrogen fertilizer and a two-species grass-legume community. High yields in multispecies mixtures were driven by strong positive grass-legume and legume-herb interactions.

Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease ( canu ) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation.

Previously, we induced tolerance to allogeneic islets in nonhuman primates by preemptive alloantigen delivery to antigen-presenting cells in situ. Here, mass cytometry phenotyping with incorporated donor-derived MHC-I peptide–loaded MHC-II tetramers revealed accumulation of allospecific CD4 + T cell clusters in the spleen of tolerant recipients. Areg + Tr1 regulatory and terminally exhausted EGFR hi T (Tex) cells represented the predominant allospecific subsets. Trajectory analysis showed that antigen-experienced effector memory T cells differentiated into suppressive Areg + Tr1 and EGFR + TOX + Nur77 + TCF-1 − Tex subsets. Cell-cell communication mapping showed that exhausted and effector memory T cells engaged with allospecific Tr1 cells via the Areg-EGFR axis. Gene silencing studies confirmed that Tr1 cells use Areg-EGFR signaling to drive the metabolic suppression and epigenetic reprogramming of CD4 + T cells through a Nur77-dependent pathway. These findings point to the splenic Areg + Tr1 cell-EGFR + Teff cell axis as a critical immunoregulatory pathway in peripheral transplant tolerance.",

Composed of a soft gel matrix and an ultrathin nanofilm embedded with gold circuits, our device achieves unprecedented tissue integration and preserves natural cardiomyocyte mechanics, resulting in a 140% increase in mechanical contraction and a 100% increase in electrical signals compared to conventional electronics. Cardiac tissue that grows our device exhibited enhanced drug sensitivity and response in cardiac dysfunction, revolutionizing disease modeling. By facilitating seamless interaction at the tissue-electronic interface, our platform offers a transformative perspective for advancing cardiac modeling and next-generation bioelectronic applications.",

In this paper, we present WISE, computing architecture for wireless edge networks with two key innovations: disaggregated model access via over-the-air wireless broadcasting for simultaneous inference on multiple edge devices, and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency driven by a single frequency mixer. Using a software-defined radio platform, WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy (97.2% audio classification accuracy) with ultralow energy consumption of 6.0 fJ/MAC (2.8 fJ/MAC), which is more than 10× improvement compared to traditional digital computing, e.g., on modern GPUs.",

Using the 60-centimeter Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO (4-3) and [CI] ( P 1 3 − P 0 3 ) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C 0 /CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM.",

Using an innovative method capable of detecting plastic particles as small as 200 nanometers, we quantified MPs and NPs in aerosols, dry and wet deposition, and resuspension in two Chinese megacities, Guangzhou and Xi’an. Airborne concentrations reached 1.8 × 10 5 MPs per cubic meter and 5.0 × 10 4 NPs per cubic meter in Guangzhou and 1.4 × 10 5 MPs per cubic meter and 3.0 × 10 4 NPs per cubic meter in Xi’an. Estimates revealed a variation of two to five orders of magnitude in MP and NP fluxes across major atmospheric compartments, dominated by road dust resuspension and rainfall-driven wet precipitation. Plastic particles were more heterogeneously mixed in deposition samples than in aerosols and resuspension, indicating enhanced aggregation and removal. These results provide an integrated assessment of MPs and NPs in urban atmospheric processes and offer critical insights into their transformation, fate, and potential implication for climate, ecosystems, and human health.",

Here, we report a leaving group–driven carbene precursor design based on an intermolecular approach, enabling the generation and divergent transformations of pyrrole-type α-amino copper carbenes. This strategy successfully reversed the established protonation pathway of electron-rich enamine-copper complexes, effectively inverting the conventional polarity at the β position of the amine in the form of a pyrrole-type α-amino copper carbene. Furthermore, by leveraging the extensive library of ligands in copper catalysis, we have achieved fine-tuned, switchable stereo- and regioselective divergent synthesis. Through multiple classical carbene insertion reactions, as well as carbene oxidation and metathesis reactions, this approach enables the functionalization of the β position of amines with diverse nucleophilic groups.",

Despite their essential role in muscle physiology, the mechanisms underlying T-tubule formation remain elusive. Here, we identify LUBEL/RNF31, a ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for linear (M1-linked) ubiquitination, as a key regulator of T-tubule biogenesis in Drosophila . Loss of LUBEL leads to Amphiphysin (Amph)–positive membrane sheets instead of tubular networks. The ubiquitin ligase activity of LUBEL and direct interaction with Amph, a BAR domain protein involved in membrane tubulation, are crucial for proper T-tubule morphology. LUBEL and M1-linked ubiquitin chains assemble into puncta on membranes through multivalent interactions, facilitating Amph-mediated tubulation. Notably, the Amph-LUBEL/RNF31 interaction is evolutionarily conserved across species, underscoring a fundamental role for linear ubiquitination in membrane remodeling. Our findings uncover an unexpected function of linear ubiquitination in membrane deformation driven by BAR proteins.",

Therefore, developing efficient lead-free metal halide LEDs is highly desirable but remains a big challenge. Here, we report solution-processed lead-free antimony halide–based LEDs with an external quantum efficiency of 22% and a current efficiency of 55.84 candelas per ampere. The exceptional device performance is achieved through a binary host-guest architecture using a zero-dimensional organic-inorganic antimony(III) halide, which exhibits bright emission with a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Optical and photophysical studies combined with theoretical calculations reveal the mechanism underlying its highly efficient self-trapped exciton emission. Efficient LEDs were achieved by doping (AylPPh 3 ) 2 SbCl 5 into a binary host system, which improved film morphology, enhanced charge carrier mobility, and achieved better carrier balance. These enhancements resulted in substantially superior device performance compared to nondoped LEDs with (AylPPh 3 ) 2 SbCl 5 as a neat emissive layer.",

          "abstract": "Despite their importance in the climate system, remote ocean regions and their ability to absorb anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) remain highly uncertain. To address this issue, citizen science initiatives, including sailboats, expand the observational network. Using observing system simulations and novel sailboat tracks, we demonstrate how integrating sailboat data improves estimates of ocean carbon uptake. While we underestimate the ocean carbon sink when mimicking real-world sampling, adding available sailboat data does not substantially improve reconstructions. Nevertheless, increased sampling reveals a stronger carbon sink, particularly between 40°S and 60°S. The improvement persists with hypothetical measurement uncertainties, but substantial differences arise depending on whether positive or negative biases are applied to the race track data. While we show that two additional circumnavigations already improve the ocean mean sink estimate, we further highlight the finding that the additional data remain insufficient to correct the overestimated CO 2 sink trend, calling for continuation of the ongoing data collection.",

While local impacts on temperature and precipitation are known, the extent and underlying mechanisms of its influence on meteorological drought remain unclear. Here, we analyzed 3696 paired forest loss and intact sites across boreal, temperate, and tropical zones. Forest loss intensified meteorological drought in more than 52% of affected regions. Drought prevalence in boreal zones rose by 5% over 20 years—three times greater than in tropical zones—because of reduced latent heat flux and increased surface albedo, which together suppressed convective rainfall. In contrast, tropical forests demonstrated greater ecological resilience, mitigating ~40% of meteorological drought intensification. Notably, forest loss–induced meteorological drought may further evolve into more severe agricultural and hydrological droughts. Therefore, we recommend implementing strategies tailored for each climate zone, including native forest conservation, proactive ecological restoration, and connectivity enhancement, to effectively reduce drought risk.",

This delay has been poorly understood and is usually attributed to sampling and long ghost lineages. We analyzed newly compiled databases of Paleozoic vertebrate occurrences, biogeography, and ecosystems, revealing that the Late Ordovician Mass Extinction (~445 to 443 million years ago) triggered parallel, endemic radiations of jawed and related jawless vertebrates (gnathostomes) in isolated refugia. Postextinction ecosystems hosted the first definitive appearances of most major vertebrate lineages of the Paleozoic “Age of Fishes” (and today), following the loss of ubiquitous stem-cyclostome conodonts, nascent faunas of other gnathostomes, and pelagic invertebrates. Turnover and recovery patterns matched those following climatically similar events like the end-Devonian mass extinction, including a postextinction “gap” with low biodiversity. The prolonged Silurian recovery, and the challenges of oceanic dispersal, likely further delayed the dominance of jawed gnathostomes for millions of years after the first fossil jaws.",

Here, using three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, we show that epidermal SPC-1/α-Spectrin and UNC-70/ß-Spectrin form a crescent-shaped scaffold with a periodicity of ~200 nm that embraces adjacent axons. This epidermal Spectrin scaffold is induced by developing axons and reformed during axonal regeneration, creating a “molecular imprint” of the nervous system. Disruption of this epidermal scaffold causes axonal damage, and we propose that it protects axons by restricting the endocytosis of cell adhesion molecules required for axonal-epidermal adhesion.

Although Nat10-mediated RNA ac4C modification has been implicated in malignant hematopoiesis, its role in normal hematopoiesis remains unexplored. Here, we developed ULAC-seq to map ac4C in rare hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and revealed dynamic, cell-type–specific ac4C patterns, peaking in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), correlating with elevated Nat10 expression. Nat10 knockout disrupts HSC self-renewal and arrests MEP differentiation, leading to fetal and postnatal hematopoietic failure. Mechanistically, Nat10 deposits ac4C on mRNAs encoding key hematopoietic transcription regulators (e.g., Nfix), thereby enhancing their translation. Nat10 loss reduces Nfix protein levels and suppresses expression of its target genes (e.g., Mpl) that govern HSPC fate, while Nfix reconstitution rescues colony-forming defects in Nat10-null HSPCs. Our findings reveal that Nat10 orchestrates hematopoiesis through ac4C-dependent translational control of transcriptional factors, establishing an epitranscriptome-transcriptome regulatory axis essential for HSC maintenance and function.",

Offline “structural synapses” encode task-agnostic features, while online “plastic synapses” are configuration-specific parameters updated by error-gated rules consistent with long-term potentiation and depression. The contraction metric serves as a homeostatic constraint, providing a stability guarantee. We validate our approach on cable-driven and shape-memory-alloy soft arms across trajectory tracking, pick-and-place, and whole-body shaping tasks. Compared with baseline methods, our approach reduces tracking error by 44 to 55% and maintains more than 92% shape accuracy under perturbations, including varying payloads, dynamic airflow, and actuator failures.

By contrast, non-DBD domains enable targeting of repressed chromatin marked by H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 . Fusions of different non-DBD segments of heterochromatin-targeting pioneer factors to the transcription factor SOX2 can expand binding of SOX2 target motifs within heterochromatin and improve cellular reprogramming.

After killing tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria by doxorubicin and cefotaxime, the hydrogel efficiently adsorbed bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns, tumor cell–derived damage-associated molecular patterns, and tumor-associated antigens. These danger signals greatly potentiated immune cell recruitment into the hydrogel and sufficiently activated dendritic cells (DCs) by the absorbed DNA-mediated cGAS-STING activation. The activated DCs converted T cells into cytotoxic T cells, and these activated immune cells migrated through the pores of hydrogels into the tumor tissues, effectively remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby inhibiting the tumor growth and metastasis.

We derived a new, dated sponge phylogeny and tested whether ancestral sponges had mineralized skeletons. We resolve the sponge phylogeny in good agreement with current knowledge and date their origin to the early Ediacaran. Our results suggest that early sponges were not biomineralized and that both biosilicification and biocalcification evolved independently multiple times across Porifera.

These transitions were accompanied by genomic shifts reflecting adaptations to habitat-specific physicochemical conditions, including variations in nutrient availability, potential energy sources, osmotic conditions, and viral predation stresses. Molecular dating suggests that Korarchaeota originated ~2.84 billion years (Ga) ago, with three subsequent diversification events occurring around 2.42, 1.52, and 1.29 Ga ago.

          "abstract": "Membrane fission is an energy-consuming process, critical for all domains of life. Prototypical fission machineries use local energy input such as nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to constrict and cut membranes. However, some membrane fission reactions paradoxically rely on protein scaffolds that by themselves stabilize rather than cut membranes. It turns out these proteins do not work alone; they use nonlocal energy input that generates a membrane tension gradient. Such a gradient mobilizes membrane flow that in turn tends to relax the membrane tension gradient. By interfering with membrane flow, the protein scaffold causes the membrane tension to increase unchecked to the point of mechanical failure, membrane fission. This friction-driven scission (FDS) mechanism is generic, conserved from bacteria to humans, and only requires two ingredients: a membrane tension generating process and a protein scaffold that hinders the associated membrane flow. Because both are often present in cells, it is likely that FDS contributes to membrane fission more frequently than previously appreciated.",

Nevertheless, their application remains limited to environment- and surface-specific scenarios. To this end, we present a contact-adaptable, peeling-resistant, and cross-medium WCR integrated with gecko- and octopus-inspired self-adaptive rigid-soft hybrid tracks. The hollow mushroom-shaped adhesive microstructures (HMSAMSs) on the robot tracks simultaneously couple the adhesive structural morphologies of gecko and octopus as well as inherit their functions. These microstructures demonstrate superior normal and tangential adhesion forces and adhesion-to-preload ratios in dry and underwater environments, endowing the WCR with stable cross-medium performance. Furthermore, we construct discrete HMSAMS patches and rigid-soft components in robot track, respectively mimicking biological adhesion’s mechanical decoupling and bone-muscle functions, which effectively prevent interface crack propagation, improve peeling threshold, and enhance contact adaptability. The WCR with aforementioned advantages substantially adapts to diverse material surfaces in complex multimedia environments, accelerating its universal application.",

This type of robust transport of polaritons (i.e., polariton canalization) holds promise for subwavelength control of energy flows. However, the lack of in situ dynamic tunability of canalized polaritons hinders such control because the canalization direction is fixed in the fabricated device. Here, we overcome this limitation by demonstrating programmable polariton canalization in a reconfigurable single-layer metasurface. By engineering the orientation of metasurface unit cells, the direction of canalized magnetic polaritons can be programmed along any in-plane direction (i.e., dynamic all-angle tunability). On-demand steering of canalized polaritons allows customized near-field patterns to be obtained at any desired location—a proof of concept for canalization-based information display applications. These findings offer opportunities to transcend conventional diffraction constraints for integrated photonic devices, thus opening the door for photonic applications where on-demand control is crucial.",

This protocol works well for both aryl and unactivated alkenes with a broad functional group compatibility and is applicable to ─SCF 3 , ─SCN, and ─SBz groups.

Using vegetation modeling, we show that where oxygen-fire effects are dampened by high moisture, photorespiration becomes more effective through increased temperatures. Together, these processes interact to drive an 86% reduction in modeled global biomass when oxygen levels reach 35%. This coregulation imposes substantially tighter control of atmospheric oxygen than wildfire alone, providing previously unknown insights into the spatial and interactive feedbacks that may explain the remarkable stability of oxygen levels since the evolution of forests.",

However, the most prevalent techniques for their synthesis are still the nonradical approaches of sulfoxide precursors with amines, where prepreparation of substrates, harsh reaction conditions, and restricted substrate ranges have intrinsically limited the synthetic scope. Herein, we leveraged a practical and streamlined electrocatalytic strategy to achieve sulfinamide synthesis, which involves the intermolecular oxidative cross-coupling of readily available arylthiols and aliphatic amines.

This flap was observed in both open and closed conformations using molecular dynamics simulations. The closed conformation is dependent on a hydrophobic patch of amino acids on the distal end of the flap. Functionally, YehD RBD is able to bind pectin, a polysaccharide ubiquitous in plant material. Mutations that interrupt the closed conformation increase the affinity of the protein to pectin, suggesting that the flap contributes mechanistically to pectin binding. Furthermore, in vivo, the pilus contributes to gastrointestinal (GI) tract colonization in the absence of the type 1 pilus. Hence, we report the ability of YehD to bind pectin representing a possible colonization mechanism of the GI tract via a structurally distinct CUP adhesin.",

We show that, as in patients, UCE expression is markedly reduced in multiple HCC mouse models, including those driven by oncogenic c-MET/β-catenin, leading to impaired ammonia clearance, altered amino acid metabolism, and increased pyrimidine synthesis. In contrast, UCE expression is largely preserved in c-MET/sgAxin1 tumors, allowing assessment of the consequences of UCE loss. Silencing individual UCEs increases ammonia burden and accelerates HCC with reprogrammed amino acid and pyrimidine metabolism, supporting a causal role for defective ammonia detoxification in oncogenesis. Notably, dietary protein restriction lowers hepatic ammonia and slows tumor growth. These findings establish a mechanistic link between nitrogen overload and hepatocarcinogenesis and highlight protein restriction as a feasible therapeutic strategy for patients with impaired nitrogenous waste handling.",

We show that, although the regulatory function of the enhancer generally follows the classical Hill equation, several additional terms are needed to describe the effects of affinity, orientation, sequence, and wing region on the maximum achievable expression and position of transcriptional activity in a tissue. We also found that Dll relies on two distinct sets of amino acid–DNA contacts for binding to higher affinity sites, but contacts are more evenly distributed at lower affinities.

Mechanistically, estrogen receptor α (ERα) in APCs is required for beige fat formation by promoting Nampt transcription. We further demonstrate that NAMPT is both necessary and sufficient to drive APC proliferation and differentiation, with interleukin-33 (IL-33) acting downstream to mediate these effects. These findings uncover a critical ERα/NAMPT/IL-33 axis that preserves progenitor function and thermogenic capacity, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to combat obesity-induced beige fat failure and associated metabolic dysfunction.",

At the same time, the preimplantation pluripotent state transforms into a more developmentally advanced, pregastrulation state. While extensive research has elucidated cell-extrinsic signals that direct the developmental progression, such as the Fgf/Mek/Erk pathway, the potential interplay of intrinsic cellular cues remains largely unexplored. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic screen using an in vitro model of epiblast development. We identified aurora kinase A as a cell-intrinsic factor contributing to Erk activation and transcriptional response. Consequently, suppressing aurora kinase A activity delayed exit from naïve pluripotency. Moreover, our results show that upon entry into mitosis, Erk relocates to the cell division machinery. We found that in dividing cells, a fraction of Erk, with yet elusive functions, localizes on the centrosomes, where its phosphorylation depends on polo-like kinase 1.",

          "abstract": "Thick fog events frequently occur in heavily polluted atmospheric boundary layers of Northern India. These events tend to persist longer, causing widespread socioeconomic disruption. Using long-term satellite observations across North India, we find that elevated aerosol concentrations are associated with thicker fog and larger droplets near the fog top. However, the underlying mechanism of this observed relationship remains unclear. High-resolution aerosol-coupled fog simulations suggest that increased aerosol loading enhances fog droplet number concentrations, leading to greater latent heat release. This, in turn, results in buoyancy-induced vertical mixing within the fog. Simultaneously, the increased water content intensifies longwave radiative cooling at the fog top, promoting cool-saturated conditions that further favor the formation of condensate and larger droplets. Together, the aerosol-induced vertical mixing—driven by thermodynamic uplift and radiative cooling—amplifies condensational processes, causing fog invigoration. We find that this phenomenon is especially pronounced during nighttime. Overall, our findings indicate a mechanistic pathway by which aerosols increase fog thickness over Northern India.",

However, the lack of understanding about their lineage, molecular character, and cytolytic potential in comparison to CD8 + (CD8)-CTLs has restricted their utility. Thus, here, by parallelly analyzing the human peripheral CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs, we demonstrate that they are indistinguishable for the cytotoxic program. Furthermore, using an integrative multiomics approach combining the transcriptome, T cell antigen-receptor repertoire, and open chromatin profile of CD4 + T cell memory subsets, we found a stem-cell memory subset that is precommitted to the cytotoxicity program. Through an in vitro differentiation model, we developed CD4 + T cells with cytolytic potential coexpressing and exhibiting progressive chromatin accessibility for cytotoxicity- and longevity-associated genes, hence generating long-lived CD4-CTL effectors of varying cytotoxic capacity. Together, our study advocates for exploring both CD4-CTLs and CD8-CTLs for vaccine development, vaccine efficacy testing, and immunotherapies and cell-based therapies for precision medicine.",

Here, we developed a class of GluN2B-selective positive allosteric modulators and characterized the pharmacological properties and binding site of the lead compound, 175. Systemic application of 175 facilitates hippocampal long-term depression in rats. 175 restores performances in open-field exploration and three-chamber test in Mecp2 overexpression mice that exhibit GluN2B hypofunction and autism-like features. Treatment with 175 also reverses behavioral abnormalities in open-field, Y-maze spontaneous alternation, three-chamber test, and prepulse inhibition in Disc1 mutant mice.

However, because of the unique structure of sialic acid with the anomeric center flanked by methylene and carboxyl groups, efficient synthetic access to sialoglycans remains a difficult task, thus hindering in-depth biological studies. Here, we report one-pot α-sialylation protocol for efficient synthesis of various α-sialoglycans, using sialyl ortho -(1-phenylvinyl)benzoates (PVB) as donors. This α-sialylation method enjoys broad substrate scope and high yields. In particular, this α-sialylation protocol has been successfully applied in one-pot synthesis of several α-sialoglycans, including bioactive ganglioside Hp-s1 and ST N antigen with reduced steps and improved efficiency. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations provide the mechanistic insights of much higher reactivity of sialyl PVB donors than the corresponding thiosialoside donors in the presence of N -iodosuccinimide (NIS) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). The enhanced reactivity arises from favorable noncovalent interactions and effective stabilization of the carbocation intermediate by the two phenyl groups within the PVB moieties.",

Its probe-integrated electrode array supports spatial-selective manipulation, while the adjustable electrode gaps enable manipulating multiscale targets. The independent programming of the electrical signals of each electrode further allows using multiple electric principles to achieve multiscale and spatiotemporal programmable control and in situ measurements, marking a transition from function-fixed single-object manipulation to function-on-demand single-object manipulation.

These quantum yields are comparable to reported HP formation rates in cloud and fog waters, suggesting that α-KA photochemistry could contribute 5 to 15% of the observed atmospheric hydrogen peroxide in aqueous phases, based on typical α-KA concentrations (0.1 to 10 μM). The model results showed that the photochemistry of excited triplet 3 PA * contributes ~40 and ~33%, respectively, to the formation of hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid at pH 2.5.

However, the mechanism that the injured lung microenvironment uses to modulate BC-mediated lung repair remains unclear. Here, we showed that the profibrotic transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) gradient from the injured lung immune microenvironment can be sensed by BCs. Targeted degradation of Smad2/3 in human BCs via proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) disrupted TGF-β signaling, causing cell hyperplasia and barrier function loss after being transplanted into the alveolar area. Genetic ablation of the TGF-β receptor or Smad4 in mouse BCs impaired multilineage differentiation and suppressed migration to the alveolar injury site. These data indicated that TGF-β signaling is essential for BC-mediated lung repair. Moreover, we genetically engineered human BCs to release antifibrotic bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) in response to microenvironmental TGF-β stimulation. Transplantation of this iBMP7-BC enhanced lung repair and reduced fibrosis. Collectively, this study delineates how TGF-β governs BC behavior and provides a microenvironment-responsive cell therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Using the imaging agent [ 68 Ga]AJ647, dynamic changes in the interaction of EV with Nectin-4 were measured across preclinical models and correlated with therapeutic responses. PET imaging identified dose-dependent variations in Nectin-4 engagement, with suboptimal EV doses resulting in incomplete Nectin-4 engagement and increased tumor growth. Crucially, PET-measured target engagement predicted therapeutic outcomes more reliably than either drug dose or baseline target expression. By defining effective target engagement levels needed for optimal therapeutic outcomes, PET imaging provides a clear benchmark for dosing decisions, maximizing efficacy while potentially reducing exposure to higher, toxic doses and thereby enhancing patient safety.",

Using idealized emission-driven climate simulations, this analysis examines changes in the extreme fire weather conditions under net-zero emission (ZeroE) and net-negative emission (NegE) scenarios. Compared to peak CO 2 levels, the NegE scenario achieves substantially greater fire danger mitigation, particularly in climatologically high-fire-danger regions, because of lower temperatures and increased relative humidity. In contrast, the ZeroE scenario leaves fire danger elevated globally, especially in Northern low-latitude regions. Regional responses are shaped by differences in atmospheric moisture supply, influenced by changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and the latitudinal position of the intertropical convergence zone. These findings highlight the crucial role of aggressive CO 2 removal strategies in mitigating fire weather dangers and underscore the limitations of ZeroEs alone in addressing global wildfire challenges.",
