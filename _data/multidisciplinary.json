Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06410-z (2023).\n\nTo effectively conserve biodiversity, policymakers must know the extent to which protected areas (PAs) benefit biodiversity. By leveraging impressive datasets on three measures of biodiversity for Southeast Asia, Brodie et al.1 claim to have detected a positive impact of protection within PAs, and spillovers of these impacts into the wider landscape. We argue that their analyses do not provide strong evidence about the benefits of PAs for biodiversity because their design cannot eliminate the most likely rival explanations for the patterns observed in the data, and their interpretations of the two tests for spillovers are flawed. Our concerns have important implications for balancing the trade-offs between investing in more PAs and managing the existing network better, as well as for the better use of causal inference methods in conservation science.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic flux, or the rate of metabolic reactions, is one of the most fundamental metrics describing the status of metabolism in living organisms. However, measuring fluxes across the entire metabolic network remains nearly impossible, especially in multicellular organisms. Computational methods based on flux balance analysis have been used with genome-scale metabolic network models to predict network-level flux wiring1,2,3,4,5,6. However, such approaches have limited power because of the lack of experimental constraints. Here, we introduce a strategy that infers whole-animal metabolic flux wiring from transcriptional phenotypes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a large-scale Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS) dataset for roughly 900 metabolic genes7, we show that the transcriptional response to metabolic gene perturbations can be integrated with the metabolic network model to infer a highly constrained, semi-quantitative flux distribution. We discover several features of adult C. elegans metabolism, including cyclic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, lack of de novo purine synthesis flux and the primary use of amino acids and bacterial RNA as a tricarboxylic acid cycle carbon source, all of which we validate by stable isotope tracing. Our strategy for inferring metabolic wiring based on transcriptional phenotypes should be applicable to a variety of systems, including human cells.",

          "abstract": "For nearly 450 million years, mycorrhizal fungi have constructed networks to collect and trade nutrient resources with plant roots 1,2 . Owing to their dependence on host-derived carbon, these fungi face conflicting trade-offs in building networks that balance construction costs against geographical coverage and long-distance resource transport to and from roots 3 . How they navigate these design challenges is unclear 4 . Here, to monitor the construction of living trade networks, we built a custom-designed robot for high-throughput time-lapse imaging that could track over 500,000 fungal nodes simultaneously. We then measured around 100,000 cytoplasmic flow trajectories inside the networks. We found that mycorrhizal fungi build networks as self-regulating travelling waves—pulses of growing tips pull an expanding wave of nutrient-absorbing mycelium, the density of which is self-regulated by fusion. This design offers a solution to conflicting trade demands because relatively small carbon investments fuel fungal range expansions beyond nutrient-depletion zones, fostering exploration for plant partners and nutrients. Over time, networks maintained highly constant transport efficiencies back to roots, while simultaneously adding loops that shorten paths to potential new trade partners. Fungi further enhance transport flux by both widening hyphal tubes and driving faster flows along ‘trunk routes’ of the network 5 . Our findings provide evidence that symbiotic fungi control network-level structure and flows to meet trade demands, and illuminate the design principles of a symbiotic supply-chain network shaped by millions of years of natural selection.",

We preview a selection of next-generation technologies—low-loss silicon nitride waveguides and components to address loss, as well as fabrication-tolerant photon sources, high-efficiency photon-number-resolving detectors, low-loss chip-to-fiber coupling, and barium titanate electro-optic phase shifters for high-performance fast switching.",

A total of 141 new associations were identified, including five for which independent disease–gene evidence was recently published. Following in silico triaging and clinical expert review, 69 associations were prioritized, of which 30 could be linked to existing experimental evidence. The five associations with strongest overall genetic and experimental evidence were monogenic diabetes with the known β cell regulator 3,4 UNC13A , schizophrenia with GPR17 , epilepsy with RBFOX3 , Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease with ARPC3 and anterior segment ocular abnormalities with POMK . Further confirmation of these and other associations could lead to numerous diagnoses, highlighting the clinical impact of large-scale statistical approaches to rare disease–gene association discovery.",

Here a textile fibre computer that monolithically combines analogue sensing, digital memory, processing and communication in a mass of less than 5 g is presented. Enabled by a foldable interposer, the two-dimensional pad architectures of microdevices were mapped to three-dimensional cylindrical layouts conforming to fibre geometry. Through connection with helical copper microwires, eight microdevices were thermally drawn into a machine-washable elastic fibre capable of more than 60% stretch. This programmable fibre, which incorporates a 32-bit floating-point microcontroller, independently performs edge computing tasks even when braided, woven, knitted or seam-sewn into garments. The universality of the assembly process allows for the integration of additional functions with simple modifications, including a rechargeable fibre power source that operates the computer for nearly 6 h. Finally, we surmount the perennial limitation of rigid interconnects by implementing two wireless communication schemes involving woven optical links and seam-inserted radio-frequency communications. To demonstrate its utility, we show that garments equipped with four fibre computers, one per limb, operating individually trained neural networks achieve, on average, 67% accuracy in classifying physical activity. However, when networked, inference accuracy increases to 95% using simple weighted voting.",

          "abstract": "In advanced applications such as aerospace and space exploration, materials must balance lightness, functionality and extreme thermal fluctuation resistance 1,2 . Shape-memory alloys show promise with strength, toughness and substantial strain recovery due to superelasticity, but maintaining low mass and effective operation at cryogenic temperatures is challenging 3–6 . We hereby introduce a new shape-memory alloy that adheres to these stringent criteria. Predominantly composed of Ti and Al with a chemical composition of Ti 75.25 Al 20 Cr 4.75 , this alloy is characterized by a low density (4.36 × 10 3 kg m − 3 ) and a high specific strength (185 × 10 3 Pa m 3 per kg) at room temperature, while showing excellent superelasticity. The superelasticity, owing to a reversible stress-induced phase transformation from an ordered body-centred cubic parent phase to an ordered orthorhombic martensite, allows for a recoverable strain exceeding 7%. This functionality persists across a broad range of temperatures, from deep cryogenic 4.2 K to above room temperature, arising from an unconventional temperature dependence of transformation stresses. Below a certain threshold during cooling, the critical transformation stress inversely correlates with temperature. We interpret this behaviour from the perspective of a temperature-dependent anomalous lattice instability of the parent phase. This alloy holds potential in everyday appliances requiring flexible strain accommodation, as well as components designed for extreme environmental conditions such as deep space and liquefied gases.",

          "abstract": "The search for simple principles that underlie the spatial structure and dynamics of plant communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology1,2,3,4,5,6. In particular, the relationship between species coexistence and the spatial distribution of plants is challenging to resolve in species-rich communities7,8,9. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of 720 tree species in 21 large forest plots and their consequences for species coexistence. We show that species with low abundance tend to be more spatially aggregated than more abundant species. Moreover, there is a latitudinal gradient in the strength of this negative aggregation–abundance relationship that increases from tropical to temperate forests. We suggest, in line with recent work10, that latitudinal gradients in animal seed dispersal11 and mycorrhizal associations12,13,14 may jointly generate this pattern. By integrating the observed spatial patterns into population models8, we derive the conditions under which species can invade from low abundance in terms of spatial patterns, demography, niche overlap and immigration. Evaluation of the spatial-invasion condition for the 720 tree species analysed suggests that temperate and tropical forests both meet the invasion criterion to a similar extent but through contrasting strategies conditioned by their spatial patterns. Our approach opens up new avenues for the integration of observed spatial patterns into ecological theory and underscores the need to understand the interaction among spatial patterns at the neighbourhood scale and multiple ecological processes in greater detail.",

Automated biosensor detection of unwitnessed cardiac arrest, and dispatch of medical assistance, may improve survivability given the significant prognostic role of time3,5, but only if the false positive burden on public emergency medical systems is minimized5–7. Here we show that a multimodal, machine learning-based algorithm on a smartwatch can reach performance thresholds making it deployable at societal scale. First, using photoplethysmography (PPG), we show that wearable PPG measurements of peripheral pulselessness (induced via an arterial occlusion model) manifest similarly to pulselessness caused by a common cardiac arrest arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation (VF). Based on the similarity of the PPG signal (from VF or arterial occlusion), we developed and validated a loss of pulse detection algorithm using data from peripheral pulselessness and free-living conditions. Once developed, we evaluated the end-to-end algorithm prospectively: there was 1 unintentional emergency call per 21.67 user-years across two prospective studies; the sensitivity was 67.23% (95% confidence interval, 64.32%–70.05%) in a prospective arterial occlusion cardiac arrest simulation model.

Twinned optically stimulated luminescence and electron spin resonance dating methods constrain the onset of human occupations at Bété I to around 150 ka, linking them with Homo sapiens . Plant wax biomarker, stable isotope, phytolith and pollen analyses of associated sediments all point to a wet forest environment. The results represent the oldest yet known clear association between humans and this habitat type. The secure attribution of stone tool assemblages with the wet forest environment demonstrates that Africa’s forests were not a major ecological barrier for H. sapiens as early as around 150 ka.",

Despite the critical role of phagocytosis during bacterial infection, the fate of phagocytosed microbial cargo and its impact on the host cell are poorly understood. In this study, we show that ingested bacteria constitute an alternative nutrient source that skews immunometabolic host responses. By tracing stable isotope-labelled bacteria, we found that phagolysosomal degradation of bacteria provides carbon atoms and amino acids that are recycled into various metabolic pathways, including glutathione and itaconate biosynthesis, and satisfies the bioenergetic needs of macrophages. Metabolic recycling of microbially derived nutrients is regulated by the nutrient-sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1 and is intricately tied to microbial viability. Dead bacteria, as opposed to live bacteria, are enriched in cyclic adenosine monophosphate, sustain the cellular adenosine monophosphate pool and subsequently activate adenosine monophosphate protein kinase to inhibit the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex C1. Consequently, killed bacteria strongly fuel metabolic recycling and support macrophage survival but elicit decreased reactive oxygen species production and reduced interleukin-1β secretion compared to viable bacteria. These results provide a new insight into the fate of engulfed microorganisms and highlight a microbial viability-associated metabolite that triggers host metabolic and immune responses. Our findings hold promise for shaping immunometabolic intervention for various immune-related pathologies.",

          "abstract": "Hofstadter’s butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature1. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter’s butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields1,2,3. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter’s butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants4,5,6, such as those with moiré superlattices7,8,9,10. Yet, so far, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to investigate the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) near the predicted second magic angle11,12, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter’s spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moiré bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, showing phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter’s original model owing to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in TBG.",

Here we systematically investigate these phenotypes by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility, spatial transcriptomics and glioma organoid explant systems. We discovered four immunomodulatory expression programs: microglial inflammatory and scavenger immunosuppressive programs, which are both unique to primary brain tumours, and systemic inflammatory and complement immunosuppressive programs, which are also expressed by non-brain tumours. The programs are not contingent on myeloid cell type, developmental origin or tumour mutational state, but instead are driven by microenvironmental cues, including tumour hypoxia, interleukin-1β, TGFβ and standard-of-care dexamethasone treatment. Their relative expression can predict immunotherapy response and overall survival. By associating the respective programs with mediating genomic elements, transcription factors and signalling pathways, we uncover strategies for manipulating myeloid-cell phenotypes. Our study provides a framework to understand immunomodulation by myeloid cells in glioma and a foundation for the development of more-effective immunotherapies.",

          "abstract": "Revealing the connectivity of functionally identified individual neurons is necessary to understand how activity patterns emerge and support behaviour. Yet the brain-wide presynaptic wiring rules that lay the foundation for the functional selectivity of individual neurons remain largely unexplored. Cortical neurons, even in primary sensory cortex, are heterogeneous in their selectivity, not only to sensory stimuli but also to multiple aspects of behaviour. Here, to investigate presynaptic connectivity rules underlying the selectivity of pyramidal neurons to behavioural state 1–10 in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), we used two-photon calcium imaging, neuropharmacology, single-cell-based monosynaptic input tracing and optogenetics. We show that behavioural state-dependent activity patterns are stable over time. These are minimally affected by direct neuromodulatory inputs and are driven primarily by glutamatergic inputs. Analysis of brain-wide presynaptic networks of individual neurons with distinct behavioural state-dependent activity profiles revealed that although behavioural state-related and behavioural state-unrelated neurons shared a similar pattern of local inputs within S1, their long-range glutamatergic inputs differed. Individual cortical neurons, irrespective of their functional properties, received converging inputs from the main S1-projecting areas. Yet neurons that tracked behavioural state received a smaller proportion of motor cortical inputs and a larger proportion of thalamic inputs. Optogenetic suppression of thalamic inputs reduced behavioural state-dependent activity in S1, but this activity was not externally driven. Our results reveal distinct long-range glutamatergic inputs as a substrate for preconfigured network dynamics associated with behavioural state.",

Here we harness this resource by implementing a two-node network consisting of several rare-earth ions coupled to nanophotonic cavities25,26,27,28,29,30,31. This is accomplished with a protocol that entangles distinguishable 171Yb ions through frequency-erasing photon detection combined with real-time quantum feedforward. This method is robust to slow optical frequency fluctuations occurring on timescales longer than a single entanglement attempt: a universal challenge amongst solid-state emitters. We demonstrate the enhanced functionality of these multi-emitter nodes in two ways. First, we mitigate the bottlenecks to the entanglement distribution rate through multiplexed entanglement of two remote ion pairs32,33. Second, we prepare multipartite W-states comprising three distinguishable ions as a resource for advanced quantum networking protocols34,35.

The north polar cap of Mars is the only millions-of-years-old surface feature that can induce measurable surface deformation on this planet, thereby holding clues to its present-day internal viscosity structure 5,6 . Here we investigate the emplacement of this ice cap by combining thermal evolution models 7 , viscoelastic deformation calculations 8 and radar observations 6 . We show that downward motion of the northern regions is ongoing and can be constrained by analyses of the time-variable gravity field 9 and NASA’s InSight seismic moment rate 10 . Only models with present-day high viscosities (2–6 × 10 22 Pa s for depths greater than 500 km), strong mantle depletion in radiogenic elements (more than 90%) and thick average crusts (thicker than 40 km) are consistent with the negligible flexure beneath the polar cap seen by radars. The northern lithosphere must deform at less than 0.13 mm per year and have a seismic efficiency less than 0.3 to satisfy gravity and seismic constraints, respectively. Our models show that the north polar cap formed over the last 1.7–12.0 Myr and that glacial isostatic adjustment can be further constrained by future gravity recovery missions to Mars 11,12 .",

The brain endothelial glycocalyx layer, a carbohydrate-rich meshwork composed primarily of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycolipids that coats the BBB lumen, is a key structural component of the BBB3,4. This layer forms the first interface between the blood and brain vasculature, yet little is known about its composition and roles in supporting BBB function in homeostatic and diseased states. Here we find that the brain endothelial glycocalyx is highly dysregulated during ageing and neurodegenerative disease. We identify significant perturbation in an underexplored class of densely O-glycosylated proteins known as mucin-domain glycoproteins. We demonstrate that ageing- and disease-associated aberrations in brain endothelial mucin-domain glycoproteins lead to dysregulated BBB function and, in severe cases, brain haemorrhaging in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that we can improve BBB function and reduce neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in aged mice by restoring core 1 mucin-type O-glycans to the brain endothelium using adeno-associated viruses. Cumulatively, our findings provide a detailed compositional and structural mapping of the ageing brain endothelial glycocalyx layer and reveal important consequences of ageing- and disease-associated glycocalyx dysregulation on BBB integrity and brain health.",

Recently, the interaction of chiral objects with spin currents has attracted enormous attention from both scientific and technological perspectives 3–5 . Of particular interest is the current-driven motion of chiral topological excitations such as chiral magnetic domain walls in chiral three-dimensional magnetic structures that could allow for high-density memory-storage devices. Here we use state-of-the-art multiphoton lithography 6,7 to create three-dimensional chiral magnetic ribbons and perform current-induced motion of chiral domain walls. The ribbons are designed to have a clockwise or anticlockwise chiral twist with a variable magnitude. We find that domain walls can either pass through the ribbon or are impeded, depending on their chirality and configuration and the geometrical chiral twist of the ribbon. The interplay between the magnetic exchange energy and the geometrical twist generates a torsional field that favours chiral Bloch-type walls rather than the Néel-type wall favoured by the intrinsic magnetic properties of the magnetic ribbon itself. Furthermore, the interplay of spin chirality and chiral twist results in a non-reciprocal domain wall motion, namely, a domain wall filter or diode 8–10 . Our findings show how the interplay between geometrical and spin chiralities can lead to new functionalities that could allow for innovative chiral spintronics.",

However, the extent of AMOC weakening is uncertain with wide variation across climate models 1,3,4 and some statistical indicators suggesting an imminent collapse 5 . Here we show that the AMOC is resilient to extreme greenhouse gas and North Atlantic freshwater forcings across 34 climate models. Upwelling in the Southern Ocean, driven by persistent Southern Ocean winds, sustains a weakened AMOC in all cases, preventing its complete collapse. As Southern Ocean upwelling must be balanced by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific, the AMOC can only collapse if a compensating Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation (PMOC) develops. Remarkably, a PMOC does emerge in almost all models, but it is too weak to balance all of the Southern Ocean upwelling, suggesting that an AMOC collapse is unlikely this century. Our findings reveal AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms with implications for past and future AMOC changes, and hence for ecosystems and ocean biogeochemistry. They suggest that better understanding and estimates of the Southern Ocean and Indo-Pacific circulations are urgently needed to accurately predict future AMOC change.",

Furthermore, the multi-cell architecture ensures a sufficient elastocaloric mass for tight assembly while maintaining a low system fluid pressure. Our device achieves a cooling power of 1,284 W on the fluid side at zero temperature lift during the initial 500,000 cycles, demonstrating the potential of this green cooling technology for a decarbonized future5,6.",

However, their target genes and functional contributions to human brain development remain largely uncharacterized. Here we elucidate the cis-regulatory functions of HARs in human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-induced excitatory neurons. Using genomic4 and chromatin looping information, we prioritized 20 HARs and their chimpanzee orthologues for functional characterization via single-cell CRISPR interference, and demonstrated their species-specific gene regulatory functions. Our findings reveal diverse functional outcomes of HAR-mediated cis-regulation in human neurons, including attenuated NPAS3 expression by altering the binding affinities of multiple transcription factors in HAR202 and maintaining iPS cell pluripotency and neuronal differentiation capacities through the upregulation of PUM2 by 2xHAR.319. Finally, we used prime editing to demonstrate differential enhancer activity caused by several HAR26;2xHAR.178 variants. In particular, we link one variant in HAR26;2xHAR.178 to elevated SOCS2 expression and increased neurite outgrowth in human neurons.

          "abstract": "Substantial epigenetic resetting during early embryo development from fertilization to blastocyst formation ensures zygotic genome activation and leads to progressive cellular heterogeneities1,2,3. Mapping single-cell epigenomic profiles of core histone modifications that cover each individual cell is a fundamental goal in developmental biology. Here we develop target chromatin indexing and tagmentation (TACIT), a method that enabled genome-coverage single-cell profiling of seven histone modifications across mouse early embryos. We integrated these single-cell histone modifications with single-cell RNA sequencing data to chart a single-cell resolution epigenetic landscape. Multimodal chromatin-state annotations showed that the onset of zygotic genome activation at the early two-cell stage already primes heterogeneities in totipotency. We used machine learning to identify totipotency gene regulatory networks, including stage-specific transposable elements and putative transcription factors. CRISPR activation of a combination of these identified transcription factors induced totipotency activation in mouse embryonic stem cells. Together with single-cell co-profiles of multiple histone modifications, we developed a model that predicts the earliest cell branching towards the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm in latent multimodal space and identifies regulatory elements and previously unknown lineage-specifying transcription factors. Our work provides insights into single-cell epigenetic reprogramming, multimodal regulation of cellular lineages and cell-fate priming during mouse pre-implantation development.",

By contrast, social isolation generates an aversive state (‘loneliness’) that motivates social seeking and heightens social interaction upon reunion 3–5 . The observed rebound in social interaction triggered by isolation suggests a homeostatic process underlying the control of social need, similar to physiological drives such as hunger, thirst or sleep 3,6 . In this study, we assessed social responses in several mouse strains, among which FVB/NJ mice emerged as highly, and C57BL/6J mice as moderately, sensitive to social isolation. Using both strains, we uncovered two previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus that are activated during either social isolation or social rebound and orchestrate the behaviour display of social need and social satiety, respectively. We identified direct connectivity between these two populations and with brain areas associated with social behaviour, emotional state, reward and physiological needs and showed that mice require touch to assess the presence of others and fulfil their social need. These data show a brain-wide neural system underlying social homeostasis and provide significant mechanistic insights into the nature and function of circuits controlling instinctive social need and for the understanding of healthy and diseased brain states associated with social context.",

          "abstract": "A comprehensive, computable representation of the functional repertoire of all macromolecules encoded within the human genome is a foundational resource for biology and biomedical research. The Gene Ontology Consortium has been working towards this goal by generating a structured body of information about gene functions, which now includes experimental findings reported in more than 175,000 publications for human genes and genes in experimentally tractable model organisms 1,2 . Here, we describe the results of a large, international effort to integrate all of these findings to create a representation of human gene functions that is as complete and accurate as possible. Specifically, we apply an expert-curated, explicit evolutionary modelling approach to all human protein-coding genes. This approach integrates available experimental information across families of related genes into models that reconstruct the gain and loss of functional characteristics over evolutionary time. The models and the resulting set of 68,667 integrated gene functions cover approximately 82% of human protein-coding genes. The functional repertoire reveals a marked preponderance of molecular regulatory functions, and the models provide insights into the evolutionary origins of human gene functions. We show that our set of descriptions of functions can improve the widely used genomic technique of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. The experimental evidence for each functional characteristic is recorded, thereby enabling the scientific community to help review and improve the resource, which we have made publicly available.",

Although the ability to produce new traits can vary between clades and may drive ecological transitions6,7,8,9, the impact of differences in the pace at which innovations evolve at macroevolutionary scales has been overlooked. Complex teeth are one innovation that contributed to the evolutionary success of major vertebrate lineages10,11,12. Here we show that evolutionary lability of tooth complexity, but not complexity itself, spurs rapid diversification across ray-finned fishes. Speciation rates are five times higher when transitions between simple and complex teeth occur rapidly. We find that African cichlids are unique among all fishes; they are dominated by lineages that transition between simple and complex teeth at unparalleled rates. This innovation interacted with the ecological versatility of complex teeth to spur rapid adaptive radiations in lakes Malawi, Victoria and Barombi Mbo. The marked effect on diversification stems from the tight association of tooth complexity with microhabitat and diet. Our results show that phylogenetic variation in how innovations evolve can have a stronger effect on patterns of diversification than the innovation itself. Investigating the impact of innovations from this new perspective will probably implicate more traits in causing heterogeneous diversification rates across the tree of life.",

Although many examples of transcriptional metabolic rewiring have been reported4, a systems-level study of how metabolism is rewired in response to metabolic perturbations is lacking in any animal. Here we apply Worm Perturb-Seq (WPS)—a high-throughput method combining whole-animal RNA-interference and RNA-sequencing5—to around 900 metabolic genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We derive a metabolic gene regulatory network (mGRN) in which 385 perturbations are connected to 9,414 genes by more than 110,000 interactions. The mGRN has a highly modular structure in which 22 perturbation clusters connect to 44 gene expression programs. The mGRN reveals different modes of transcriptional rewiring from simple reaction and pathway compensation to rerouting and more complex network coordination. Using metabolic network modelling, we identify a design principle of transcriptional rewiring that we name the compensation–repression (CR) model. The CR model explains most transcriptional responses in metabolic genes and reveals a high level of compensation and repression in five core metabolic functions related to energy and biomass. We provide preliminary evidence that the CR model may also explain transcriptional metabolic rewiring in human cells.",

Residents of nursing homes are at increased risk of pathogen colonization and infection owing to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and fungi. Nursing homes act as reservoirs, amplifiers and disseminators of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare networks and across geographical regions2. Here we investigate the genomic epidemiology of the emerging, multidrug-resistant human fungal pathogen Candida auris in a ventilator-capable nursing home. Coupling strain-resolved metagenomics with isolate sequencing, we report skin colonization and clonal spread of C. auris on the skin of nursing home residents and throughout a metropolitan region. We also report that most Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Entobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens and other high-priority pathogens (including Escherichia coli, Providencia stuartii, Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii) are shared in a nursing home. Integrating microbiome and clinical microbiology data, we detect carbapenemase genes at multiple skin sites on residents identified as carriers of these genes. We analyse publicly available shotgun metagenomic samples (stool and skin) collected from residents with varying medical conditions living in seven other nursing homes and provide additional evidence of previously unappreciated bacterial strain sharing.

The large physical-qubit overhead associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here, using a superconducting quantum circuit19, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance d = 5 (ref. 10). A stabilizing circuit passively protects cat qubits against bit flips20,21,22,23,24. The repetition code, using ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement, corrects cat qubit phase flips. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below the threshold. The logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat qubit mean photon number, enabled by our realization of a cat-transmon noise-biased CX gate. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average 1.75(2)% for the distance-3 code sections, and 1.65(3)% for the distance-5 code. Despite the increased number of fault locations of the distance-5 code, the high degree of noise bias preserved during error correction enables comparable performance. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings enables us to use a hardware-efficient outer error-correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes can be a compelling model for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian genomes are folded through the distinct actions of structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) complexes, which include the chromatin loop-extruding cohesin (extrusive cohesin), the sister chromatid cohesive cohesin and the mitotic chromosome-associated condensins1,2,3. Although these complexes function at different stages of the cell cycle, they exist together on chromatin during the G2-to-M phase transition, when the genome structure undergoes substantial reorganization1,2. Yet, how the different SMC complexes affect each other and how their interactions orchestrate the dynamic folding of the three-dimensional genome remain unclear. Here we engineered all possible cohesin and condensin configurations on mitotic chromosomes to delineate the concerted, mutually influential action of SMC complexes. We show that condensin disrupts the binding of extrusive cohesin at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, thereby promoting the disassembly of interphase topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops during mitotic progression. Conversely, extrusive cohesin impedes condensin-mediated mitotic chromosome spiralization. Condensin reduces peaks of cohesive cohesin, whereas cohesive cohesin antagonizes condensin-mediated longitudinal shortening of mitotic chromosomes. The presence of both extrusive and cohesive cohesin synergizes these effects and inhibits mitotic chromosome condensation. Extrusive cohesin positions cohesive cohesin at CTCF-binding sites. However, cohesive cohesin by itself cannot be arrested by CTCF molecules and is insufficient to establish TADs or loops. Moreover, it lacks loop-extrusion capacity, which indicates that cohesive cohesin has nonoverlapping functions with extrusive cohesin. Finally, cohesive cohesin restricts chromatin loop expansion mediated by extrusive cohesin. Collectively, our data describe a three-way interaction among major SMC complexes that dynamically modulates chromatin architecture during cell cycle progression.",

          "abstract": "The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage, into a distinct, mature MA lattice 1 . The mechanism of MA lattice maturation is unknown. Here we show that released spacer peptide 2 (SP2), a conserved peptide of unknown function situated about 300 residues downstream of MA, binds MA to induce structural maturation. By high-resolution in-virus structure determination of MA, we show that MA does not bind lipid into a side pocket as previously thought 1 , but instead binds SP2 as an integral part of the protein–protein interfaces that stabilize the mature lattice. Analysis of Gag cleavage site mutants showed that SP2 release is required for MA maturation, and we demonstrate that SP2 is sufficient to induce maturation of purified MA on lipid monolayers in vitro. SP2-triggered MA maturation correlated with faster fusion of virus with target cells. Our results reveal a new, unexpected interaction between two HIV-1 components, provide a high-resolution structure of mature MA, establish the trigger of MA structural maturation and assign function to the SP2 peptide.",

          "abstract": "This time five years ago, the virus that causes COVID-19 was spreading around the globe unchecked. One of the biggest questions that remains is: where did it come from?\n\nToday, mounting evidence from more than a dozen studies points to a person, or people, catching the virus from a wild animal or animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak. And the animal at the top of the list is the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides).\n\n“There is a large focus on raccoon dogs,” says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.\n\nSome scientists, including virologist Edward Holmes at the University of Sydney in Australia, have suspected raccoon dogs all along. On 21 January 2020, he sent an e-mail to Andersen and another colleague, with the subject ‘Outbreak poker’. In jest, he proposed a wager on the animal that might have carried the virus to people. “I’m betting raccoon dog,” he said. Holmes had seen raccoon dogs at the Huanan market when he travelled to Wuhan in 2014.\n\nBut part of the reason that raccoon dogs top the list of suspects is because they have been studied more than other animals, including ones also present at the market, says Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. There are yet more possible candidates, he says.\n\nMarion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, agrees. “We have to be modest about our ability to predict which animal species” sparked the COVID-19 pandemic, she says.\n\nThe origin of the pandemic is still deeply politicized, and the lack of clear answers hasn’t helped. The virus probably originated in bats living in southern China. From there, many scientists think it infected an intermediate animal that passed it to people. The virus could also have passed directly from bats, although that is considered less likely given their habitat is far from Wuhan. And some still suggest that the virus could have escaped, or been deliberately released, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was known to be doing research on coronaviruses.\n\nViral host\n\nOne of the reasons raccoon dogs were suggested as a prime candidate early on is because they were probably involved in passing another, related, virus to people. In 2003, researchers isolated close matches of the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in several civets and a raccoon dog at a live-animal market in Guangdong, China.\n\nThis finding prompted researchers in Germany to investigate these animals’ susceptibility to SARS-CoV-21.\n\nThey found that raccoon dogs can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and — despite not getting that sick themselves — can pass on the infection to other animals.\n\nStudies by Holmes and his colleagues have also shown that farmed and wild raccoon dogs in China are often infected with many viruses that can jump between species. “Raccoon dogs are very common viral hosts,” says Holmes.\n\nRight time, right place\n\nMany of the first cases of COVID-19 involved the Huanan market, suggesting it was the location of the viral spillover. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the first infected people, in late December 2019 and early January 2020, along with geolocation and epidemiological data, support this2.\n\nDuring the outbreak, the market was shut down by the authorities, but researchers know that raccoon dogs were being sold there, for their fur and as food. In June 2021, a study described the results of monthly surveys of live wild animals sold across four markets in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019, including seven stalls at Huanan3. Every month, an average of 38 raccoon dogs were sold at these markets. The most-sold species was the Amur hedgehog (Erinaceus amurensis), at an average 332 individuals a month. Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), hog badgers (Arctonyx albogularis), Chinese bamboo rats (Rhizomys sinensis), and Malayan porcupines (Hystrix brachyura) were also regularly sold.\n\nDecember 2019 sales records from the Huanan market also list trading of live animals or products from bamboo rats, porcupines and hedgehogs, among others.\n\nFurther evidence to support the raccoon-dog theory came in 2023. Chinese researchers published genomic data of swabs taken at the Huanan market in January 2020, after it was shut down, including of stalls, rubbish bins and sewage4. Studies found mitochondrial DNA of raccoon dogs in several swabs, including those that also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Raccoon dogs and hoary bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus) were the most common mammalian wildlife species detected in the mitochondrial DNA; material from civets and hog badgers was also found but not in many samples5. The findings don’t prove that the animals were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but had they been infected, this is the type of evidence you would expect to find, says Andersen.\n\nUnpublished work by Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, suggests that some of the raccoon dogs and greater hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris) at the market were probably sick, although it is not clear what virus they were infected with.\n\nOther animals at the market, which could also have been infected with the virus and possibly passed it to people, include bamboo rats, Malayan porcupines, and Amur hedgehogs. But researchers don’t know how susceptible those species are to SARS-CoV-2 infection and spread.\n\nCellular studies suggest that Himalayan palm civets can be infected with the virus, but whether they can pass the virus onto other animals hasn’t been studied, partly because such studies are expensive and weren’t a priority early in the pandemic, says Koopmans.",

          "authors": "Kelly-Ann Allen",
          "abstract": "What makes a great university? Academics say they value seeing their efforts recognized, witnessing the impact of their work on students and society, and working in a collegial environment. In my studies as a research fellow in educational psychology, I’ve found that students expect more than just a sound education — they want friendship with other students, emotional growth and skills that will help them to secure jobs. None of these factors can be adequately assessed using the dominant measure of success in academia: publications.\n\nPublishing well-cited papers in high-impact journals is central to researchers’ career progression. This results in intense pressure to perform well in this one area, often at the expense of other scholarly activities. Although citation metrics can indicate expertise, they can also amplify power imbalances, because highly cited scholars attract ever-more citations and influence.\n\nThe postdoc experience is broken. Funders such as the NIH must help to reimagine it\n\nEfforts to change evaluation systems have gained momentum over the past decade. The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment — signed by almost 25,000 scientists and organizations — and the Leiden Manifesto for research metrics both advocate for research to be evaluated beyond impact factors. A range of metrics, from policy citations to social-media engagement, can be tracked using online tools. Yet the citation-based h-index remains one of the most predominant ways to evaluate academic impact.\n\nIn my view, we could make academic life more rewarding by systematically scoring the underappreciated behaviours and conduct that researchers value. The product might be called the ‘G+ index’ — G representing generosity, giving and other ‘good things’ in academia. This index could either stand alone or complement existing citation measures.\n\nFor senior academics, mentorship could be judged in terms of the number of first- or last-author papers that are co-authored by early-career researchers, signalling investment in developing others’ careers. To account for varying team sizes, formal acknowledgements of trainees in publications could also be factored in. Early-career researchers could be exempt until a set career stage.\n\nMeasuring societal impact: how to go beyond standard publication metrics\n\nCollaboration scores could measure co-authorships across institutions, countries and disciplines. They could include co-authorship with policymakers, community organizations and industry partners, and with individuals with lived experiences relevant to the research. Care would be needed to avoid disadvantaging scholars with limited resources, who might be less able to make connections.\n\nThe index could reflect good science practices — for instance, by recognizing replication studies. And public reach could be measured in terms of open-science practices — data-sharing, pre-registering protocols and communicating through podcasts, blogs and media contributions.\n\nIn some fields, publishing in practice-based journals could be rewarded to ensure that research reaches professional communities. Similarly, editorial and peer-review work for these journals — and work for scientific societies, regardless of prestige — could be valued.\n\nUltimately, the full list of metrics should be decided by the academic community, reflecting a collective vision for a healthier workplace. Funding bodies and institutions could then incorporate the index into their evaluation criteria, providing both the infrastructure and incentives for adoption. Many of the metrics are already tracked in existing data repositories, but improved systems to collect and amalgamate the data are needed.",

I was on parental leave from my work as a policy officer at the Academy of Medical Sciences, headquartered in London. The Academy’s policy work covers a range of topics, from climate change and health inequities to the funding and regulation of research. My focus before taking leave in April was the impact of early-childhood health on long-term health and well-being, and how this influences national productivity, innovation and prosperity.\n\nI moved into policy work in March 2022, starting with a 10-month position at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, a trade association based in London. But my first experience of policymaking was during a three-month internship in 2021 at the Initiative for Science in Europe, an umbrella body for learned societies and research institutes, based in Strasbourg, France.\n\nI joined the Academy of Medical Sciences after completing a PhD in cell biology at King’s College London and the Francis Crick Institute, also in London. I was invited to speak about my career at a conference for early-career researchers, run by King’s College London’s Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine.\n\nA conference with a baby\n\nOn the day of my talk, held at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London, Aidan and I set ourselves up in the speaker ‘green room’, a repurposed seminar room, which had plenty of space for him to crawl around and feed before the session began. We then moved to the main hall for a panel of speaker flash talks introducing our journeys in science, before switching again to roundtable discussions, during which attendees asked more detailed questions about specific career areas.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how well the day went. There wasn’t great deal of prep required for the talk or the discussions, but I realized I was out of practice speaking to an audience. However, I took inspiration from the other panel members. Some of the audience questions went beyond the practicalities of my career move, instead tackling the nuances of how the policy sector works as well as the challenges of working with different stakeholders and conflicting interests. These definitely challenged me to switch on my professional brain, but it was a positive experience — I enjoyed reconnecting with my work, and I was reminded of why I care so much about my job.\n\nThings that helped the day go successfully\n\nAn accessible and inclusive conference venue. The location had a room for breast-feeding and expressing milk, baby-changing facilities and step-free access so I could bring along a buggy easily, which made the practical side of the day as smooth as possible.\n\nAn enthusiastic and positive environment. At the conference, people told me that they’d love to see more scientists attending events while on parental leave. Two conference attendees kindly offered me extra help if needed. The conference organizers were adaptable and practical in their planning, and excellent at ensuring that we were accommodated.\n\nA supportive manager. My manager followed my lead on how I wanted to engage with work while on leave — I asked to be updated during check-in days about progress on the projects I was involved in, and I planned to think about career development once I returned to work. The reminders of my professional strengths during these conversations, at a time when I was disconnected from work and out of practice with public speaking, helped to give me the confidence to accept the invitation to speak at a conference.",

Credit: Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto/Getty\n\nFive days of indulging in chocolate bars, crisps and other junk foods can lead to lingering changes in brain activity, a study shows1. The resulting brain patterns are similar to those seen in people who have obesity.\n\nA junk-food splurge shifted brain patterns in healthy young men despite their body weight and composition remaining unchanged, according to the study, published on 21 February in Nature Metabolism.\n\n“I didn’t expect the effect to be so clear in a healthy population,” says neuroscientist Stephanie Kullmann at the University of Tübingen in Germany, who led the study.\n\nBut another scientist says that there are limitations to the study, which relied on a nasal spray to deliver the digestive hormone insulin. “The authors give very large doses of insulin,” says physiologist Christoph Buettner, “four to five times the amount that a human releases into the bloodstream over 24 hours.” Buettner, at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was not involved in the study. Kullmann responds that not all of the inhaled insulin reached the brain and that more study is needed to pinpoint how much does.\n\nChocolate and chips\n\nAfter a bite of food, the pancreas releases insulin to aid metabolism. Some of that insulin enters the brain, where it works to dampen appetite. But the brain’s response to the hormone is weakened in some people with obesity2. This ‘brain insulin resistance’ affects how the body processes food.\n\nTo learn more about the effects of insulin in the brain, Kullmann and her colleagues recruited 29 healthy male volunteers (Kullmann has a forthcoming study in women). Eighteen went on a high-calorie diet for five days. A nutritionist made customized 1,500-calorie packs of high-fat, high-sugar snacks for each participant to eat on each of the five days — but the men succeeded in increasing their caloric intake by an average of only 1,200 calories per day. “At the beginning, they were kind of excited,” says Kullmann, but by day 4, eating the extra processed food was a slog. Control participants ate their normal diet during the same period.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet",

We’re talking about the mutually beneficial (symbiotic) relationship between plants and fungi, specifically the mycorrhizal fungi that attach to plant roots and exchange key resources, such as nitrogen and phosphorus trapped in primordial rock, for food from plants3. Mycorrhizal fungi support most of Earth’s vegetation and have a key role in sequestering carbon in the soil, which holds more carbon than does the atmosphere and plant biomass combined1.

When a metal is stretched, defects form in its crystal lattice and thereby dissipate the strain energy (the energy stored from applied stress). This limits the amount of deformation that can be recovered (the recoverable strain) to less than 0.5% and causes permanent shape change. Metals are therefore good at permanently retaining their shape and are resistant to breaking, but they are not suitable for applications in which a material cycles through large shape changes. Writing in Nature, Song et al.1 report an impressive lightweight titanium alloy that has high mechanical strength and yet recovers strain of more than 5% across an extensive temperature range — with potential applications for biomedical devices, energy infrastructure and space exploration.",

What the craft finds could have big ramifications for NASA’s plans to send astronauts to this part of the Moon in the coming years.\n\nMoon mission failure: why is it so hard to pull off a lunar landing?\n\nOne of the missions is a commercial lander; it aims to touch down closer to the Moon’s south pole than any previous mission, carrying NASA instruments including an ice-hunting robot drill. The other spacecraft, NASA’s Lunar Trailblazer, is an orbiter with the goal of producing the highest-resolution maps of water on the Moon.\n\nLunar water could provide a resource for expanded lunar exploration, such as by supplying the raw ingredients for rocket fuel at Moon bases. Scientists have known since 2009 that such water exists, but they want to know much more about where it is and how much there is. The two new spacecraft “are going after really important pieces of that puzzle,” says Parvathy Prem, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, who is not affiliated with either mission.\n\nThe lander is expected to touch down on 6 March. It is the second attempt by Intuitive Machines, a company based in Houston, Texas, whose first lunar spacecraft tipped over on landing last year.\n\nLunar Trailblazer will take a leisurely trajectory and reach the Moon in several months. If all goes well, it will enter its final science-mapping orbit around August.\n\nSearching for water\n\nMany space agencies and scientists are keen to learn more about water at the lunar poles, which hold a geological record of the Solar System’s early history. The Indian mission Chandrayaan-2 is currently orbiting the Moon and building up its own data on where water might exist, as is a Korean probe that carries a NASA instrument to peer into shadowed, potentially ice-rich craters.\n\nIntuitive Machines’ new lander, named Athena, is headed for the Mons Mouton region of the Moon. Researchers think there is water in the lunar soil there, perhaps bound up in minerals or in pores in the soil.\n\nThese six countries are about to go to the Moon — here’s why\n\nAthena will search for water in several ways, including the use of NASA’s ice-mining drill, TRIDENT. If Athena lands successfully, operators will command TRIDENT to penetrate the lunar soil, drilling up to one metre deep to pull up the soil and leave it in a crumbly pile on the surface. A mass spectrometer on board will analyse the pile for signs of water or other volatile substances that might be escaping as gases. That ability to drill and analyse simultaneously provides “critical data on how lunar soils behave”, says Jackie Quinn, the drill’s project manager at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida.",

          "authors": "Jianzhuang Xiao, Shuai Zou, Chi Sun Poon, Man Lung Sham, Zongjin Li, Surendra P. Shah",
          "abstract": "Cheap, strong and versatile, concrete is the second most consumed material globally after water, with 30 billion tonnes used annually (Nature 597, 593–594; 2021). Production of concrete is energy intensive and is responsible for more than 7% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions — of which cement accounts for the vast majority.\n\nExtraction of the minerals and other materials used to make concrete is also environmentally unfriendly. For example, around 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel1, and more than 5 billion tonnes of limestone are mined annually, resulting in habitat loss, soil erosion and pollution. These impacts will only worsen, as the global market for concrete continues to grow.\n\nThe construction industry needs to become more sustainable by minimizing carbon emissions and reducing resource and energy use2. Such a vision was set out, in part, in 2023 at the United Nations climate summit in Dubai through the Cement and Concrete Breakthrough Initiative. Launched by 45 world leaders, this initiative aims to reduce the emissions associated with producing one tonne of cement by around 20% by 2030, compared with 2020 levels. Strategies include increasing the use of alternative fuels and other cement-like materials, using construction materials more efficiently, and implementing carbon capture and storage.\n\nReducing emissions is achievable. But a more comprehensive strategy for sustainable concrete is also needed, with the ultimate goals of net-zero carbon emissions and use of 100% recycled materials (see ‘Steps to net-zero concrete). Here we set out the key ingredients of a ‘net zero concrete’ strategy.\n\nSource: Analysis by J. Xiao et al.\nDesign more efficient kilns\n\nCement is produced by heating a blend of limestone and clay in a kiln. This process releases CO2 as limestone decomposes. It is also energy hungry — the chemical reactions involved require temperatures as high as 1,500 °C. Most kilns run on fossil fuels and have poor thermal insulation.\n\nWhat’s the best way to tackle climate change? An ‘evidence bank’ could help scientists find answers\n\nUpgrading kilns can save energy and reduce carbon emissions. For example, over the past few decades, much of the world has moved away from vertical shaft kilns, which work much like a blast furnace — material is added at the top of the column and this is heated from below using gas or coal, to eventually form the cement component clinker. These are being replaced by rotary kilns, which feature a horizontally inclined, rotating shaft that helps move materials through the kiln.\n\nRotary kilns outperform shaft kilns in terms of production capacity, product quality and operational flexibility, and can process 60 times more cement than the average shaft kiln. Their energy efficiency can be improved by 20–50% by using technologies that conserve or recover waste heat3. Improving insulation and optimizing operations using computer modelling and real-time data can increase the efficiency further.\n\nTo make kilns even more efficient, next-generation technologies are being explored. These include all-electric kilns and ones that suspend raw materials in hot air to speed up reactions. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and biomass, as well as hydrogen, can be deployed, as can carbon capture and storage technologies to lower carbon emissions. Leading Chinese cement manufacturers, including Anhui Conch Cement, China National Building Material and China Resources Cement, have established next-generation technology pilot projects.\n\nUse less clinker\n\nReducing the amount of cement clinker used in concrete can also bring down emissions. Some of it can be substituted with materials that require less energy to produce, including industrial by-products such as fly ash from coal combustion, ground blast-furnace slag from iron production, and recycled powders derived from materials such as glass, brick and concrete.\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nHowever, current standards in China (GB 175-2020) and Europe (BS EN 197-1 2011) only allow up to 20% of the clinker in commonly used types of cement to be substituted by ash and slag. There are ways to replace more of it, while maintaining performance in construction. Updating these standards to reflect ongoing technological advancements is essential to widen adoption.\n\nIn limestone calcined clay cement (LC3), half of the clinker is replaced with a type of clay and a combination of limestone and gypsum, which cuts CO2 emissions by 40% while maintaining the required physical properties4. Major cement manufacturers, such as the Swiss firm Holcim and Germany’s Heidelberg Materials, have already adopted this technology; it is used in the Swiss embassy building in New Delhi, for example.\n\nMoving forwards, it is essential to understand better the properties of various clay sources and to optimize their processing to ensure homogeneity and stability. Long-term durability studies need to be conducted across diverse environmental conditions. And large-scale trials are needed to address manufacturing challenges. Developing standards and increasing awareness among stakeholders is crucial.\n\nUse less cement\n\nReducing the proportion of cement paste in concrete is another strategy. Conventional concrete typically contains about 30% ordinary Portland cement paste by volume. Using less can make concrete harder to work with as it becomes stiffer. But research on optimizing the packing of concrete particles indicates that the volume of paste can be reduced to 18–20% while maintaining performance.\n\nThe world must rethink plans for ageing oil and gas platforms\n\nThe ultra-green concrete5 project, announced in 2023 and supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, has set an ambitious target to reduce the paste content even more, to as low as around 13% by volume. This goal relies on the material having a dense particle structure, known as advanced high-packing, and the incorporation of materials, such as modern superplasticizers. Challenges to overcome include the entrenched misconception that using less paste will affect the concrete’s strength and ensuring that this close-packed concrete meets practical tests, including durability and workability.\n\nAdvances in big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence can also play a part in designing more-sustainable concrete. For example, producers mainly depend on the 28-day compressive-strength benchmark specified in current standards. Through computer modelling, researchers can identify other time points to guide concrete design.\n\nUse less conventional concrete\n\nReducing concrete consumption by extending service life, optimizing the design of structures and using advanced construction technologies, such as 3D printing, offer other ways to reduce carbon emissions and material use.\n\nRisks of bridge collapses are real and set to rise — here’s why\n\nConcrete formulations can be tailored for specific projects to minimize the unnecessary consumption of concrete and its environmental footprint. Options include foamed concrete, or those including a high proportion of recycled content. Old concrete components can be reused by casting them in fresh concrete. And other materials such as fibre-reinforced polymers and steel sleeves can be incorporated to enhance structural performance while using less concrete.\n\nAlthough constructing a building requires a lot of energy, clever designs that lower the amount of energy needed to run it once it is built can save more. For example, using lightweight aggregate, honeycomb structures or composite materials in concrete can enhance the thermal insulation of buildings, so that they can run with smaller and more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.\n\nPhotovoltaic technology could be embedded in concrete, although many research challenges remain, including optimizing their efficiency, quality control during manufacture, degradation, environmental impacts and end-of-use recycling. Advancing these technologies will require close collaboration between material scientists, engineers and architects.\n\nSequester CO2 in concrete\n\nConcrete can be engineered to absorb and store CO2 during its manufacturing, curing, servicing and recycling stages. One study6 estimated that economically viable CO2 mineralization in concrete materials could mitigate up to 15% of CO2 emissions from cement clinker production, and theoretically almost 60% is possible.\n\nThe problem is that some CO2 mineralization technologies are still expensive compared with manufacture of conventional products and other carbon capture and storage methods. For example, producing a carbonated concrete block is around 35% more expensive than producing it with ordinary Portland cement, at a cost of €161 (US$166) to avoid one tonne of carbon emissions6. For now, this limits its use.",

          "abstract": "Emergency: COVID-19 and the Uneven Valuation of Life Claire Laurier Decoteau Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nIn May 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In response, US government and public-service officials promised marginalized communities that they would make real efforts to tackle racial injustice.\n\nYet, says sociologist Claire Laurier Decoteau, both the pandemic and those promises now seem long forgotten in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn Emergency, Decoteau interviews 110 of the city’s residents and 65 officials to methodically dissect COVID-19’s impact on marginalized groups. Her analysis reveals how policies that intended to tackle racial injustice instead produced an endless cycle of inequality.\n\nWhy we need a body to oversee how science is used by governments\n\nAt the time of Floyd’s death, Black Americans accounted for 60% of deaths caused by COVID-19 in Chicago, despite comprising only 30% of its population, a pattern mirrored in many other US cities and Western countries. The increased risk of death is attributable to what Decoteau calls “converging ‘demics’” — the confluence of structural injustices, including poor access to health care, housing and employment, that disproportionately affect Black, Latinx and immigrant Chicagoans.\n\nChicago’s initial response to the pandemic was poor, asserts the author. Instead of addressing systemic problems, public-health officials plugged the gap with short-term interventions, such as welfare payments to cover rent or sick days. Although such policies might have benefited less-vulnerable people, they condemned people on the margins to a “slow or quick death”.\n\nTenants who had informal landlord agreements or an undocumented status struggled to access emergency rental payments, because their landlords frequently would not comply with administrative processes. As a result, vulnerable people who should have been shielding themselves from the virus were unable to do so — instead, they had to work to minimize the risk of being evicted and becoming homeless.\n\nDecreasing the number of cases and deaths among Black and Latinx people became the focus of some public-health efforts. But that did not produce long-term changes for the communities most affected by COVID-19. Although many well-intentioned people have used statistics to show that racism is a public-health crisis, Decoteau cautions against reducing the complex history that produced today’s structural inequalities to quantifiable targets.\n\nCommunity care\n\nDecoteau’s interviews highlight how mutual-aid groups and community organizers were the pandemic’s unsung heroes, often achieving what governments could or would not. Many of the stories are bleak, illustrating how systemic discrimination, from poor housing to police brutality, has a physical and mental toll. Yet I found a hopefulness in their tales of community cooperatives that ran food banks and provided COVID-19 tests by employing people enrolled in drug-recovery programmes.\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, community-led cooperatives, such as food banks, are a lifeline for many.Credit: Scott Olson/Getty\n\nOne volunteer at a community service proclaims: “We need more organizations like this one. We need to grow bigger. We grew up here in the struggle. We know how to cope.” I could not agree more.\n\nIn 2018, I founded a community-based organization in London called Decolonising Contraception, which ran events centred on sexual and reproductive health. Decoteau does a great job of showing what I discovered, too: a top-down approach often has minimal impact on those who require urgent assistance. Too often, red tape and bureaucracy mean that those who are most vulnerable cannot access government support and, instead, end up relying on grass-roots organizations.\n\nMisguided policies\n\nNext, Decoteau illustrates how racial ‘biocapitalism’ — the creation of wealth through the exploitation of people who have been racially categorized — produced policies that caused the death of essential, yet often poorly paid, workers, many of whom in Chicago were Black and Latinx. For example, one such policy introduced extra payments to essential workers in the city. But Candice, a Black woman and former nurse, remarks that: “Every two weeks when you got paid, you got an extra $350 but you couldn’t miss a day. So if you missed a day, you didn’t get the $350.” This policy encouraged people to lie about being unwell, increasing the risk of viral spread.",

          "title": "Can AI help beat poverty? Researchers test ways to aid the poorest people",
          "authors": "Carrie Arnold",
          "abstract": "Beginning in late 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing, the mobile phones of tens of thousands of impoverished villagers in Togo pinged with good news. Their money was ready. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), these villagers in the narrow strip of land in West Africa had been approved to receive around US$10 every two weeks, delivered directly to their mobile money accounts. Although that might not sound like much, it could keep people from going hungry.\n\nConventional poverty-relief projects rely on data gathered through in-person surveys — which were not possible during the pandemic. But Togo’s effort, dubbed Novissi, which means ‘solidarity’ in the local Éwé language, incorporated AI to determine who should receive aid. The project, led by Cina Lawson, the Togo Minister of Digital Economy and Transformation, along with scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and the non-governmental organization (NGO) GiveDirectly, analysed satellite images and data from mobile-phone networks to estimate the wealth of particular regions and individuals1. “We needed a surgical approach,” says Lawson. It was an important moment for the use of AI in anti-poverty work, she says.\n\nSome 700 million people around the globe live in extreme poverty, defined by the World Bank as living on less than $2.15 per day. Ending that poverty, one of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, requires an understanding of who is in need and what their needs are. But measuring poverty has long been a challenge, in large part because of the time and cost involved in trying to collect data from the poorest and most vulnerable populations.\n\nCombine AI with citizen science to fight poverty\n\nAI allowed Lawson to leapfrog the conventional hurdles of using old and incomplete data to quickly make the most of her limited budget. It’s an approach that is garnering both interest and controversy, says Joshua Blumenstock, a computer scientist at University of California, Berkeley, who collaborated on Novissi.\n\nAI tools can not only be fast, says Ariel BenYishay, a development economist at the AidData Research Lab at William & Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Virginia, but they can also include a larger, more representative portion of the population than household surveys do, and identify patterns in data that even specialists could miss. AI might also help researchers to evaluate how well programmes meet their objectives and demonstrate how investments in areas such as health, agriculture, education and infrastructure pay off — or not. The World Bank recognizes this value and has been developing advanced AI tools to try to forecast food crises and violent conflicts, and to pull insights from large swathes of data gathered after an aid intervention. It concluded its Poverty, Prosperity, and Planet report2 in October 2024 by noting that anti-poverty “efforts should focus on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence models to close data gaps and enable more timely monitoring”.\n\nBut there are reasons to be cautious, says human geographer Ola Hall at Lund University in Sweden, who researches the intersection of AI and poverty. AI models have been criticized for being racist, sexist and otherwise biased. Just as household surveys often miss the poorest families because they do not have permanent housing, AI-driven programmes might not help individuals who do not have digital data trails, Hall says. They are nowhere near accurate enough to determine who qualifies for aid or cash subsidies and who doesn’t, he says.\n\nHowever flawed AI might be, though, current systems of evaluating poverty are just as abysmal, says BenYishay. “The baseline isn’t perfect data. It’s actually very crappy data,” he says.\n\nMeasuring poverty\n\nBritish social reformer Charles Booth undertook an early effort to quantify poverty from 1886 to 1903 when he criss-crossed London’s cobblestones collecting data on people’s incomes and social class. He created a colour-coded map of the city and reported his findings in a treatise titled Life and Labour of the People in London. English sociologist Seebohm Rowntree and his team interviewed 11,560 families in York, UK, and published the findings in a 1901 book called Poverty: A Study of Town Life. The team calculated poverty on the basis of the ability to meet a person’s “physical efficiency”, or their minimal nutritional requirements. A sample minimal diet might include bread, porridge, boiled bacon, potatoes, skimmed milk and little else.\n\nAfter US President Lyndon Johnson declared a ‘War on Poverty’ in 1964, the Office of Economic Opportunity adopted a poverty threshold devised by economist Mollie Orshansky that took a similar approach. It defined poverty as the bare minimum income required to cover food, shelter and other basic costs. Around the same time, India performed similar calculations for its populace. Although each expert tinkered with their formulae to account for local variations in rent and food costs, they all defined poverty on the basis of how much money a person lives on per day.\n\nThe dollar-per-day approach is blunt and easy to communicate, says Dean Jolliffe, an economist at the World Bank in Washington DC. Yet, how much money a person spends to get by is just one aspect of poverty. Economist and Anglican priest Sabina Alkire advocates for a more nuanced way to define poverty. “I want to know how many poor people lack a house, how many poor people have a kid out of school, so I can actually respond in very tangible, direct ways,” says Alkire, who is the director of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\nMobile phone data can be used alongside satellite imagery and other data to estimate poverty across regions and countries.Credit: Kelvin Juma\n\nIn the early 2000s, Alkire wanted a way to capture poverty’s various affects on people. Just because someone has enough money to buy food doesn’t mean they have enough for medical care or school fees, says Alkire. In 2008, Alkire worked with James Foster, an economist at the George Washington University in Washington DC, to develop what’s called the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)3. The approach estimates a unified measure of poverty by tallying up the deprivations and their intensity, with a total of ten indicators, including nutrition, school attendance, access to drinking water and what a household uses for cooking fuel.\n\nFor the field of poverty, this was a sea change. It allowed policymakers and others to measure, dissect and target the interacting variables that contribute to poverty at the household level. The United Nations Development Programme replaced its Human Poverty Index, which focused on survival, literacy and standard of living, with Alkire and Foster’s MPI in 2010, although certain United Nations agencies along with the World Bank continue to rely on the dollar-per-day definition.\n\n‘It is chaos’: US funding freezes are endangering global health\n\nResearchers and aid agencies have developed myriad ways other than the MPI to define poverty. These methods vary in the factors they include, depending on what they want to measure and the data at hand, says Jennifer Davis, who heads the Program on Water, Health & Development at Stanford University in California. In a 2024 paper, a team led by Davis and her graduate student Christine Pu evaluated four definitions of poverty that are used in the field, including daily per capita expenditure but not MPI, and found massive differences in how those definitions rank households in Ethiopia, Ghana and Uganda4. “When we did our analysis, not only did we not find much agreement at all for the full sample, we didn’t find it for urban households, or for the bottom 20%, or for the bottom 1% where we might expect the greatest need,” says Pu.\n\nAlong with the lack of agreement on definitions, there’s the problem of time. Even a well-oiled field team needs several hours to survey a single family, says Jolliffe. Although poverty researchers have refined their metrics and are incorporating the latest computational methods for analysing data, they often continue to rely on on-the-ground surveys to collect those data. A lot of people are surprised that we still do household surveys, says Jolliffe. But, “this notion that we have data on everything about everybody is very much a rich-world perspective”.\n\nTurning to AI\n\nAs a PhD student in agricultural and resource economics, Marshall Burke was familiar with laborious data collection. To learn about farming and agriculture practices in East Africa, Burke travelled to Kenya and Uganda, where he spent months talking to farmers and walking their fields. But when Burke started the Environmental Change and Human Outcomes Lab at Stanford University in 2015, he wondered whether the computer revolution might offer better approaches.\n\nThese experiments could lift millions out of dire poverty\n\nDavid Lobell, who had vast experience in remote sensing, occupied the office next to him. Around the same time, a specialist in AI and image recognition, Stefano Ermon, also joined Stanford University. The trio’s discussions turned to how the ever-increasing data from satellite images could be used to help identify people living in poverty around the world. Knowing that night-time lighting can be a rough proxy for wealth, the researchers used night-time satellite imagery of areas across Africa alongside daytime imagery to teach computer models to identify features associated with wealth.\n\nAsking a computer to compare images of areas that are already known to be extremely rich or extremely poor is an electronic version of the game “spot the difference”, Burke says. The algorithms compare the distribution and condition of roads, the amount of green space, the size and spacing of buildings and a multitude of other variables. “All the sorts of things you and I would think to look for in an image are a little bit predictive,” says Burke. “A machine can sort through all that data,” and determine what aspects are most relevant.\n\nIn 2016, the team reported that the AI analyses of the satellite images correlated strongly with on-the-ground measurements of poverty5. As machine learning advanced, Lobell, Burke and Ermon refined their models by incorporating the latest techniques.\n\nUsing a pan-African data set of publicly available satellite images, the trio tested an updated approach in May 2020. When the team compared its machine-learning predictions with wealth-related survey data from 20,000 villages, the algorithm performed just as well as the laborious surveys, but at a fraction of the effort and cost6 (see ‘Poverty predictions’).\n\nSource: Ref. 6\n\n“This was a pretty seminal improvement concept for the development community,” says BenYishay. Other teams are joining the experiment, throwing out a lot of different ideas, he says. Scientists are applying machine learning to look for patterns in satellite images and mobile-phone data, and to analyse the impacts of drought, agricultural productivity, infrastructure investments and more, he says.",

          "abstract": "If the number of on-camera screams is any indication, Kim Kardashian’s first encounter with epigenetics was a thrilling one.\n\nThe reality-television star and her family shrieked and squealed in the season finale of The Kardashians in Los Angeles, California, last July as they each learnt the results of a commercial blood test that purportedly assessed their “biological ages”. Although Kardashian was 43, the placement of chemical markers on her DNA — her ‘epigenetic profile’ — matched that of a 34-year-old, according to the test. Her body, moreover, was ageing 18% more slowly than most people of her age.\n\n“You should give yourself a pat on the back,” said Matthew Dawson as he relayed the results. (Dawson is chief executive of TruDiagnostic in Lexington, Kentucky, the company that sells the test.)\n\nOn the other side of the country, neuropsychologist Terrie Moffitt says she was “mortified” when she saw the segment. Moffitt, who works at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, had spent decades with her colleagues collecting data from around 1,000 people to create the basis for one of the tests provided by TruDiagnostic. She had hoped that her work might one day inform medical decisions or provide a way for researchers to assess whether an anti-ageing treatment is having a positive effect on health. A stunt on a reality-TV show was not the kind of publicity she was aiming for. “I have a snob’s view of reality TV,” she adds.\n\nMixed feelings of enthusiasm and apprehension were common among researchers who spoke to Nature about efforts to develop tests that measure the impact of ageing on the body. With money pouring into the field and an unprecedented level of public attention and excitement, scientists are publishing a steady stream of papers on ways to measure how rapidly a person’s body is declining. Many of the measures look at chemical marks on DNA known as methylation, or at proteins or metabolites that can be found in the blood. These biological markers, or biomarkers, could prove incredibly useful as part of burgeoning efforts to develop drugs and other therapies that would forestall the negative effects of ageing and increase what gerontologists refer to as the healthy lifespan.\n\nOften, however, test results that use these biomarkers are interpreted and presented without a full reckoning of the uncertainties that plague them. It’s a problem not just for commercial tests, but also for media articles and even scientific publications. “There’s a lot of confusion,” says Brian Chen, a molecular epidemiologist at California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute in San Francisco. “I’ve seen, in academia, scientists trying to promote and hype up ‘biological age’ and ageing research in general to generate more interest and funding.”\n\nChen and others worry about the risk of elevated expectations as scientists take on the long and arduous task of validating these tests. “Whether or not at the end of the day this kind of thing is going to be positive or negative for the field is hard to know,” says Matt Kaeberlein, chief executive at Optispan, a health-care technology company in Tukwila, Washington. “If you lose your reputation, that’s hard to get back.”\n\nMarking time\n\nFor the moment, the field is on fire. In December 2024, the US Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health announced a programme to develop and validate biomarkers of ageing. Hevolution Foundation, a charity in Riyadh, has invested US$400 million in healthspan research. And organizers of XPRIZE Healthspan — a competition to find treatments for conditions associated with ageing — are planning a 7-year, $101-million global competition that is dedicated to improving healthspan.\n\nA smorgasbord of tests to assess ageing already exists. Geneticist Steve Horvath, now at Altos Labs in Cambridge, UK, developed one of the first epigenetic clocks more than a decade ago1. He analysed data from 7,800 samples to catalogue which sites in the genome were tagged with methyl groups — a chemical modification to DNA that helps to regulate the expression of genes. He then fed these data, along with the ages of the study participants, into a machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm produced a collection of 353 methylation sites that, taken together, correlated with participants’ chronological ages. Some of these sites were more methylated with age; others were less so.\n\nThose markers became the basis for a test that can predict a person’s chronological age with remarkable accuracy, says Chen, who worked with Horvath. But the test was not as good at predicting how long a person might expect to remain healthy, or when they might die.\n\nSo, Horvath’s team and others began to build new tests, searching for methylation sites that correlate with other age- and health-related measures, such as white-blood-cell counts, the amount of glucose in the blood and levels of a protein that serves as a marker for inflammation2. This time, the goal was to create a clock that reflected a person’s time to death, rather than merely the number of years lived.\n\nPregnancy advances your ‘biological’ age — but giving birth turns it back\n\nA younger ‘age’ based on this test tended to associate with a variety of lifestyle factors, including high income and a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. An older age score was associated with factors such as cigarette smoking or the risk of heart disease, among other ailments.\n\nMoffitt and her colleagues took this a step further, returning to the same study participants every few years to collect a fresh round of health data3. This allowed them to create an epigenetic test that assessed the rate at which age takes its toll on the body, rather than one static number. “It’s capturing the slow, gradual progression of biological decline,” Moffitt says.\n\nThe biology underlying these tests, however, remains a puzzle. There is no clear mechanism that links the patterns of methylation measured in the tests with changes in a person’s health — the patterns are simply correlations fished out from large data sets, with no obvious cause. “Why did the methylation go up, and what went wrong?” asks Horvath. “What does it mean?”\n\nOther kinds of test can provide a clearer link to mechanisms. Those that measure changes in the abundance of certain proteins or in the chemical products of metabolism allow researchers to draw conclusions about what triggered the change. “This is why I chose metabolomics,” says Eline Slagboom, a molecular epidemiologist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, referring to tests that try to survey all of the metabolites in an organism or tissue. “When we have a marker, we also understand a little about why it is important: is it an inflammation marker, a lipid marker? Is it related to glucose?”\n\nSlagboom and her colleagues created a test called MetaboHealth, which is based on 14 metabolites found in the blood that correlate with the likelihood of death from disease4. Others have turned to tests based on proteins: a team led by UK researchers developed one using data from more than 45,000 people that measures the levels of around 200 proteins in blood5.\n\nTurning back time with epigenetic clocks\n\nFor now, however, some researchers are forgoing molecular biomarkers in their clinical trials. Therapies, interventions or lifestyle changes aimed at extending a person’s healthy lifespan must come with a measurable benefit, says Jamie Justice, a gerontologist in Grand Junction, Colorado, who is executive vice-president of health at the XPRIZE Foundation in Culver City, California. “When we talk about that benefit, we’re talking about the way that a person functions, feels or survives” — not simply the chemical composition of their DNA, she says. Experimental therapies tested in the XPRIZE Healthspan programme will not be evaluated on the basis of epigenetic tests. Instead, the competition will focus on factors such as muscle strength and cognition, as well as assays for immune function.\n\nThe prize will be structured so that teams gather data and samples in a standardized way. Justice also hopes to raise funds for a competition in which teams develop and test other biomarkers using those data. “I love biomarkers,” she says. “I love them and I hate them, because I know how hard it is to actually get one developed.”\n\nSeeking validation\n\nResearchers sometimes recoil when they learn just how much work it takes to vet a biomarker fully so it can be used in clinical trials, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. Such tests must be studied repeatedly in a variety of populations, and under the specific conditions in which they will be used in the clinic. A biomarker of ageing that is based on data from people in their forties and fifties, for example, might have little relevance to a frail 80-year-old who has multiple health conditions, says Slagboom. “We have a tendency to try to sell how valuable our marker is,” she says. “But valuable for which purpose?”\n\nThe hype surrounding ageing research has also created a false impression of how well tested the markers have been in different populations, or in different settings, says Moqri. Although epigenetic-clock markers have been used in a vast range of studies, they typically have not been sufficiently validated for use as primary outcomes in clinical trials, he says. “Even those who are running clinical trials, they think that these biomarkers are more advanced than they actually are,” he says.\n\nThere is also disagreement in the field about what the clocks really measure. Despite frequent references to ‘biological age’ in both the media and scientific articles, a 2024 study found little agreement in the community as to what the term means6. In a survey of more than 100 participants at a scientific conference on ageing research, about 30% defined ageing as the loss of function that comes with time. Other definitions included the accumulation of damage with time; a developmental stage; and an increase in disability and death. “Defining biological age is a whole touchy subject in itself,” says Marije Sluiskes, a biostatistician at Leiden University Medical Center.\n\nHacking the immune system could slow ageing — here’s how",

But Erika Cheung is not like most people, in more ways than one. She risked her livelihood, right to privacy and professional relationships by speaking out about scientific fraud.\n\nCheung’s journey from researcher to whistle-blower began when she was a junior scientist, not long after she graduated in 2013 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a bachelor’s degree in molecular and cellular biology.\n\nShe landed a job at Theranos, one of the most exciting companies in California at the time. Elizabeth Holmes had founded the company in 2003, aged just 19, and had claimed that Theranos was going to revolutionize disease diagnostics. The days of multiple blood samples and intrusive medical investigations would be replaced by the start-up’s technology, one that could detect everything from cholesterol to cocaine.\n\nTheranos claimed that cancers, diabetes, anaemia, herpes, HIV/AIDS and many other ailments could all be diagnosed by the company’s ‘Edison device’, using just a few drops of blood from a finger-prick test.\n\nAt its zenith in 2015, Theranos was running close to 900,000 tests per year. It did so without the vigorous oversight of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the lack of which has since been criticized by legal experts as a significant loophole in the regulatory process. Theranos’s activities were classified as ‘laboratory-developed tests’, which the FDA defines as “a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory”. This classification meant that Theranos didn’t need to have its tests evaluated before they were offered and sold to patients.\n\nA promising prognosis\n\nCheung still remembers the excitement of the job interview, although the company wouldn’t divulge much of the detail behind Theranos’s technology, citing concerns over corporate espionage. “You're kept in the dark, and the explanation was trade secrets,” and “you’d find out more when you get inside”, says Cheung. That seemed fair enough to her, given that the company was awash with millions of dollars of investment capital from famous names such as media baron Rupert Murdoch and the Walgreens chain of pharmacies. It was also reassuring that the likes of former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger and William Foege, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were on Theranos’s board. Holmes, for her part, was often proclaimed by the media to be the next Steve Jobs, a comparison made in part because, like the founder of the computer company Apple, she frequently wore a black turtleneck sweater.\n\nIt all seemed legitimate, and Cheung was pleased to have landed a job as a lab assistant at Theranos. She was looking forward to a fruitful career at the cutting edge of medical research.\n\nWould that it were all above board.\n\nIn fact, the science was bogus, the technology was unproven and the boss was a fraud. In 2022, Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for defrauding investors and was ordered to pay back US$452 million. The jury acquitted Holmes of conspiracy to defraud patients and of three counts of fraud against individual patients, and did not reach a verdict regarding three further counts of defrauding individual investors.\n\nElizabeth Holmes verdict: researchers share lessons for science\n\nIt wasn’t too long before Cheung began to suspect that the whole enterprise didn’t pass the sniff test. After she started her job in 2013, the secrecy that defined the interview carried on in the workplace. “The smoke and mirrors didn’t end,” she says. “There were all of these different laboratories that you didn’t have access to,” with something bigger and better supposedly happening behind those doors.\n\nBut in the short term at least, Cheung was preoccupied with making a good impression and settling in. “It takes a while to onboard and just figure out what’s happening at a company, especially a start-up where everything is in chaos and the turnover is so high that they are basically having people quit at the rate they’re hiring,” she says.\n\nEventually, however, Cheung wanted answers to reasonable questions. How did the technology work? How did its results compare with those from conventional testing techniques? Her questions went down like a lead balloon.\n\nShe started digging around the company’s computer records, trying to piece together a research and development (R&D) timeline. “Initially, I bought into the start-up idea, that is, ‘you’re here to fix these problems’. And I was super invested and committed to fixing things. I was definitely stressed; sometimes I was working at least 12 and sometimes 16 hours for 14 days in a row,” she says. But as she started to raise more questions, her access to certain hard drives was cut. To make matters worse, the high turnover of staff meant that it wasn’t clear who she could approach to ask about the history of the technology.\n\n“I didn’t have access to the digital memory of these things,” she says, and ”there were a lot of deliberate ways in which the company had organized itself in order to prevent people from being able to see the full picture”.\n\nSelf-doubt\n\nCheung can’t remember when she first concluded that something pernicious and illegal was afoot. There was no smoking-gun moment. In reality, it was a slow drip, drip of suspicion, followed by fear and then a sense of moral rectitude that led her to the truth about Theranos.\n\nCheung is keen to stress that she wasn’t supremely confident, and was constantly second-guessing herself and her convictions. “I was 22 and I had doubt, asking myself: is this how all lab diagnostics are run?” It seemed outrageous to her, but she “still wasn't too sure”, she recalls.\n\nThe most frustrating thing was the lack of hard information to back up her instincts. “I think that’s an issue for most scientists,” she says, the idea that “if I don’t have the full picture, I could be wrong”.\n\nThis second-guessing and tortured self-doubt comes from an earnest desire to do the right thing, says Rachel Peterson, one of Cheung’s closest friends at university, who became her confidant for all things Theranos. “She is one of the most genuine and brave and tough people I’ve ever met,” she says. ‘\n\n‘Brave’ isn’t an adjective that Cheung likes to use for herself — because she was so conflicted throughout the process. “I don't know if that's how I'd explain how I felt at the time,” she says.\n\nFortunately for Cheung, she happened across a research engineer who became her ally at Theranos —Tyler Shultz, whose grandfather, George Shultz, a former US secretary of state, happened to be on the company’s board. Cheung had worked with Tyler during a night shift in the R&D department.\n\nA scene from the TV miniseries The Dropout, with Camryn Mi-young Kim (left) as Erika Cheung.Credit: Landmark Media/Alamy\n\nShe and Shultz examined the results of some of Theranos’s diagnostic tests, comparing them with the outcomes of conventional tests. “We saw things weren’t right,” says Cheung. “The cancer markers could be threefold different to the standard test. It was the difference between telling someone they don’t have prostate cancer when they do, or telling someone they have hyperthyroidism when they don’t. Crazy stuff.”\n\nIn early 2014, the pair began to work in tandem, gathering as much data as possible so that they couldn’t be easily ignored when they took their findings to someone in authority. They planned to present a dossier of evidence to Shultz’s grandfather and implore him to influence Holmes and the rest of the board to take Theranos’s technology off the market and back into the development labs. In April 2014, they went to George Shultz’s house for dinner and made their case.\n\nThey explained that Theranos’s technology was unsound. “They basically tried to make blood tests for small sample sizes and so they jerry-rigged a bunch of FDA-approved machines. The Edison device was just terrible,” says Cheung. It had a robotic arm, and was supposed to titrate blood samples and add antibodies or reagents to identify a molecule indicating the presence of a disease. “It was like a very impressive PhD project, but it wasn’t ready to be tested on patients and be commercialized,” says Cheung. Over time and with more experience of real labs, she realized “how horrendous this was”, she says.\n\nIn reality, most of Theranos’s testing was being done conventionally by human scientists at the lab bench, although they did not have full blood samples to ensure accuracy.\n\nBut Cheung says that George Shultz was unconvinced. He dismissed their concerns and tried to reassure them that the company was well led by people who were at the top of their game. That came as a blow, not least to Tyler Shultz, who now had to decide whether to go against his grandfather or toe the company line.\n\nThe human cost\n\nCheung already knew in her heart of hearts what she needed to do — she knew before she even had dinner with the Shultzes, when she had seen a patient’s name printed on a blood-sample label. It was a rare moment of clarity for hert. “I started to realize that I wasn’t a scientist tinkering in a lab,” she says. ”I was, in fact, a health-care professional and I could see the names of the people we were providing these faulty results for.” If George Shultz and the rest of the board weren’t going to help, she would have to take a different line of attack.\n\nWhistleblowing in science: this physician faced ostracization after standing up to pharma\n\nThings were starting to take their toll on Cheung, says Peterson. “The number of times when I held her while she was sobbing, just full-on sobbing, even in the years after Theranos, was a constant theme,” remembers Peterson.\n\nWhen the full extent of fraud at Theranos became clear, Peterson told Cheung to get her house in order. “My advice was very American: it was to talk to a lawyer. I said she should then quit and file a complaint with the government,” says Peterson.\n\nCheung took that counsel to heart, quitting the company in 2014; Tyler Shultz left shortly before she did. That same year, Holmes was named one of the richest women in the United States and Theranos raised a further $400 million in funding.\n\nIn 2014, after consulting her lawyer, Cheung filed a complaint with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a US federal agency responsible for administering the government’s health-insurance programmes. Shultz defied his grandfather, using an alias to report Theranos to the New York state authorities.\n\nAlthough Cheung submitted evidence to the CMS under her real name, she asked to be kept anonymous. But the investigations that Cheung’s and Shultz’s whistle-blowing kicked off led to legal action, and it was no longer possible for their names to be kept out of the spotlight. She became an oft-cited name in news coverage of the Theranos hearings.",

          "authors": "Katie L. Burke",
          "abstract": "On the rugged, uninhabited Archipelago of the Recherche off the coast of Western Australia, marine ecologist Jennifer Lavers has front-row access to the wildlife she studies, because she lives nearby. In 2022, Lavers set up her successful marine-ecology research group in the tiny hamlet of Esperance, or Kepa Kurl, on the coast of southwest Australia, a seven-hour drive from the nearest city, Perth. As a researcher studying how plastic pollution affects seabirds and the marine food web, Lavers finds a closeness with nature in such an isolated place, and has used that closeness in her collaborations with the local Aboriginal communities. “The birds sing during the day, the frogs at night and the kangaroos mow our lawn for us,” she says of her home. “It gives me the quiet life that I keep seeking, but also the opportunity to truly embed myself with the Aboriginal community.”\n\nLavers’ career trajectory is unusual, because she’s had to think creatively to build her life and do the work that she wants. Academics tend to move to urban institutions as they progress in their careers (E. Yan et al. Quant. Sci. Stud. 1, 1451–1467; 2020). Most career advice that PhD students receive is biased towards urban or suburban locations; indeed, most of their mentors have followed such paths themselves. But some PhD holders want to live in a place far from a research hub or a university town.\n\nWant to make a difference? Try working at an environmental non-profit organization\n\nIn an academic job market that offers fewer and fewer stable positions, more science PhD holders are forging their own paths in the places where they want to live — whether that means launching a business or a non-profit organization or finding remote work. But doing so isn’t always easy. Small towns and rural areas can have fewer resources than cities do and can leave scientists feeling isolated and without mentorship. Still, the benefits in flexibility, community and autonomy are worth it, say trailblazers on an unusual path.\n\nThe most common reason that people interviewed by Nature’s careers team gave for living in such places was to be near family — many have parenting or caring responsibilities. People also valued a sense of place, living close to nature and the mental-health benefits of their autonomy and community. Some wanted to see their skills benefit the community in which they grew up or, like Lavers, wanted to live long term near field-research locations.\n\n“I advise PhDs with extreme geographical restrictions to think broadly and widely about what they can do,” says Karen Kelsky, a career coach who founded the consultancy The Professor Is In. “It is becoming more normative to not work in academia.” Kelsky, who founded her business after leaving a tenured academic position, needed to stay in Eugene, Oregon, because she shared custody of her children with her ex-spouse. “I wish more academics would be entrepreneurial,” she says, noting that it’s been gratifying for her.\n\nSolopreneurs and start-up firms\n\nFor PhD scientists living outside major research hubs who want to continue using their expertise, a common path is to start their own business, either as a consulting firm or as a freelancer. For instance, ecologist Reilly Dibner founded a science-animation and voice-over acting studio called Ecosystem Films in Laramie, Wyoming. “In creating my business, I found I knew a lot more about being an entrepreneur than I ever imagined, simply because I understood how to navigate the academic landscape. So many skills are transferable,” says Dibner. For example, academics know how to seek out and apply for funding, test ideas, quickly learn new skills and organize ambitious, long-term projects. “I understand discomfort and I know how to bust through work challenges,” Dibner adds. “And I have knowledge, resources and networks of people to tap into for their expertise.”\n\nReilly Dibner works on an animation project at her Ecosystem Films studio.Credit: Gregory Nickerson\n\nTo prepare for being self-employed, networking is key. Entrepreneurs say that their first work usually came from colleagues. Social scientist and writer Luis Alexis Rodríguez-Cruz, who runs a science-writing and research business from his hometown of Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico, says, “Networks of solidarity, trust and friendship expanded the opportunities that I use to build a life and a home.” Although some people interviewed by Nature began consulting part time before leaving a full-time position, many relied on a partner’s income or lived with family while getting their businesses off the ground.\n\nSome business owners don’t want to just go solo; instead, they join forces to build a larger firm. Anna Ortega, co-founder and lead researcher of the Western Wildlife Research Collective, started a business because none of the conventional routes for PhD holders in wildlife biology seemed the right fit for her. She also wanted to move back to her home of Durango, Colorado, to raise her children near their grandparents. “I didn’t want to work for the federal government, I didn’t want to work for a state agency and I didn’t want to work in academia,” she says. “At the same time, I wanted to advance science.” Now, she and two team members do consulting work analysing wildlife data for academic laboratories, state and federal agencies and conservation non-profit organizations.\n\n‘Research that touches the heart’: the scientists who study sex and lov\n\nBusiness owners such as Ortega must navigate the administrative and logistical load of setting up a small firm. Once a business is off the ground, such work can be outsourced, but at the start, the owner usually has to deal with the personnel and financial paperwork. Ortega read widely on business management as she was finishing her PhD and setting up her business.\n\nMark Crane, who splits his time between a small town on the edge of the Cotswolds region, UK, and the mountains of southern Spain, sees the ability to outsource this work as a boon. When he built his agricultural toxicology business, WCA Environment, in Faringdon, UK, in 2005, his team was fully remote. This meant that he could recruit the talent he wanted because he could pay specialists well to work from home. “We would win bids because we were cheaper. We had almost no overhead,” he says. “We contracted out everything that wasn’t scientific on an as-needed basis.” This strategy of recruiting the best talent and keeping overheads low allowed him to compete with much larger companies. In 2012, Crane sold the company back to his employees, giving him the funds necessary for developing his next project, a sustainable almond farm in Spain, and helping his wife to run her environmental consultancy.\n\nSelf-employed PhD scientists working far from research hubs must prevent becoming isolated from an academic community. Ortega says that starting a business with a friend has helped her to feel connected because they communicate weekly about their shared projects. She also goes to conferences often to meet colleagues and has company subscriptions to key journals to stay up to date with the literature.\n\nFounding a non-profit organization\n\nScientists with mission-oriented research that has a low overhead can establish a non-profit organization. When Lavers found herself in a particularly difficult workplace situation after ten successful years in academia, she decided to strike out on her own. She started Adrift Lab, a research group focused on seabirds and marine plastics that collaborates with other scientists around the world. She founded Adrift Lab four years before she left her job at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, so that she could transition to Esperance without disrupting her long-term data collection.\n\n“The ivory tower makes you believe that the only way you can do real science is by being in academia,” says Lavers. “Our model demonstrates quite clearly that that is not a requirement.” Lavers and her two co-supervisors have seen nine master’s and four PhD students graduate over the course of six years in conjunction with the University of Tasmania, where one of her colleagues has a full-time position. The advantage of their model shows in their students’ success. “Most of our PhD students graduate with 5–7 publications as first author,” Lavers says. Lavers holds several part-time positions that allow her to stay involved in academic activities.\n\nJennifer Lavers and her colleagues set up an independent research group called Adrift Lab to study how plastic pollution affects marine and seabird lifeCredit: Blue The Film/Northern Pictures\n\nThinking about non-conventional funding is key, says Lavers. She and her colleagues have found that standard funding, such as grants from national funders, is harder to get as a principal investigator without a customary institutional affiliation. “We have survived because of the generosity of two philanthropists,” she says. “We have 20-year data sets, including the longest-running plastic-ingestion data set in the Southern Hemisphere. And yet we’ve never been successful with state or federal government funding.”\n\nLavers says that her relationship with the lab’s donors has been one of the surprising rewards of this non-profit work model. The philanthropists have come along on field excursions, gotten to know students and even been involved in data collection. “Those relationships have become long-lasting and really close in a way that you would never have with a government department. It builds that sense of community spirit within the lab. Funders get as much out of it as we do,” she says. And this funding model saves Lavers precious time. “I don’t spend weeks of every year writing these long reports that get sent off to the government,” says Lavers. “Instead, I divert that energy to writing papers, helping my students and doing all the things that actually matter.”\n\nHow five researchers fared after their ‘great resignation’ from academia\n\nThe study of marine pollution is a rapidly evolving discipline, and Lavers can pivot quickly to pursue emerging issues in a way that government and university structures don’t allow. She also doesn’t have to fit her research into a department or research institution’s priorities and so can investigate interdisciplinary questions as she sees fit.\n\nLavers notes that establishing an independent lab was easier for her because she already knew how to run a conventional one. She understood the processes in her discipline and what it took to keep fieldwork and a lab running. Without that experience, she acknowledges, it would have been a lot tougher.\n\nLavers’ isolated locale isn’t for everyone. “The nearest major hospital is seven hours away,” she says. “We only have one tiny little airport. There are no major shopping malls or clothing stores or anything like that.” But, for Lavers, the upshot is that she lives a quiet, peaceful life close to nature.",

          "abstract": "Early-career scientists fear that their chances of making a life in the US research scene are slipping away. Credit: Karen Ducey/Getty\n\nThe first in her family to go to university, Suzanne Autrey pushed herself to the brink chasing an academic career. She is now an assistant professor at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and takes delight in teaching geology to other first-generation university students. “I know first-hand that a degree to them doesn’t just change their lives,” Autrey says. “It changes their families’ lives.”\n\nNow, like some other early-career scientists in the United States, Autrey feels her dream of a research career slipping away. The tick-tock of her tenure clock echoes in her ears as she checks and rechecks the status of two crucial grant applications. Both are stalled at the US National Science Foundation, an agency facing the prospect of large budget cuts. She can’t do the research needed to support her tenure bid without those grants. “I’m dead in the water if I can’t get one,” she says.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nAfter a month of repeated threats to US science funding, many early-career researchers such as Autrey are fearing for their careers. These scientists are especially vulnerable: graduate students, postdocs and scientists who are just starting their own laboratories are the researchers most likely to be living pay cheque to pay cheque, most reliant on federal grants for their income and least likely to have job security. Some are considering changing jobs, leaving the country or abandoning research altogether.\n\n“Disruption and uncertainty are the enemy of science,” says Donna Ginther, an economist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. And when disruption and uncertainty strike, she adds, “the people who lose their jobs are students and postdocs”.\n\nIf that happens now, science in the United States could undergo its own generational shift, she says: “Early-career scientists are the future.”\n\nDiminished prospects\n\nDuring its chaotic first month, US President Donald Trump’s administration moved to sharply curtail federal funding for research. Some of the administration’s changes, such as freezing research funds and curtailing reimbursement for overhead costs on federal grants, have been temporarily blocked by the courts. But the administration’s push to shrink the size of the government is clear, and many researchers fear that the system of federal support they have come to rely on is eroding.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\nTheir anxiety was on display at a protest in Washington DC on 19 February, when about 250 graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and research technicians gathered outside the US Department of Health and Human Services to protest against the chaos unleashed by mass layoffs, leadership changes and promises of budget cuts at federal agencies. “Last week aged me a year,” says Alexander Jordan Lara, a research fellow at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Lara’s career is in limbo after his principal investigator, a high-ranking NIH scientist, abruptly retired on 11 February amid the turmoil created by the Trump team’s directives , leaving the fate of the laboratory and its members up in the air.\n\nThat fear radiates beyond employees of federal agencies. At the University of Maryland in College Park, an NIH diversity grant pays neuroscience postdoc Haroon Popal’s salary. Popal counts himself lucky: this year’s salary has already been allocated. But the Trump administration has threatened any funding that falls under the rubric of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and Popal is not counting on getting paid next year. He’s looking for other jobs now, especially any that do not rely on federal funds — even if that means leaving science. “I love my research,” he says, “but I cannot afford to lose a pay cheque.”\n\nFaced with that uncertainty, some young scientists might choose to leave the country rather than leave science, says Ginther. But the United States churned out more than 34,000 science PhD graduates in 2023. Not all of them will choose to stay in science, but whether those who do and seek to leave the United States could be absorbed by other countries is unclear. “I don’t know that the world’s scientific enterprise can absorb the potential loss of talent that we’re creating in the United States,” says Ginther.\n\nFading allure\n\nThe United States has long attracted scientific talent from around the globe. Just a few weeks ago, Adam Pavlinek, a developmental neuroscientist at King’s College London, had planned to start a postdoc at an NIH laboratory later this year. Now, he tracks the recent firings at federal agencies and waits to learn of the fate of the team that he had hoped to join.\n\nNIH pay rise for postdocs and PhD students could have US ripple effect\n\nThe instability in the United States has Pavlinek thinking twice about his plans. “I’m worried that four or five months after I move all my stuff there, I’ll be told, ‘Actually there’s no more funding,’” he says. He has started looking for positions in the United Kingdom.",

          "title": "How scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope",
          "authors": "Harini Nagendra",
          "abstract": "Science is necessary, but clearly not sufficient, for conveying the climate crisis. The past two years have been the hottest on record. Denial of climate change is still widespread and false claims about products’ environmental benefits, or ‘greenwashing’, are on the rise. What can researchers do?\n\nA decade ago, many scientists tended to argue that the best way they could contribute to the climate debate was to publish good ‘policy-relevant’ research — and then leave it to governments and civil-society actors to translate this science into action. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has done tremendous work in collating evidence that demonstrates the dangers of global warming and charting pathways to action. Yet, total annual global greenhouse-gas emissions are projected to be more than 60% higher in 2025 than they were in 1990, when the first IPCC report was published.\n\nClimate scientists study a world in which change is the only constant, where the collapse of our planet’s systems is widespread and evident. Most of these researchers battle a deep sense of sadness, coupled with anxiety about the future and the young people they love and care for, who will inherit a damaged planet. We must continue to document change, model impacts and describe solutions — but we cannot stop there.\n\nYoung people are crucial to research — how can they be paid fairly?\n\nIncreasingly, many climate scientists are embracing climate activism. I am a huge admirer of those who do, and have engaged in it myself — although, some scientists critique activism for its purported bias (U. Büntgen npj Clim. Action 3, 36; 2024). But there are other things we can do, too.\n\nClimate communication is an important pathway to action that we don’t speak about enough. Many academic scientists, who are also teachers, are already deeply invested in it. But we haven’t paid enough attention to communication beyond the classroom.\n\nIn May 2019, Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, launched the Centre for Climate Change and Sustainability (now called the School of Climate Change and Sustainability), aiming to strengthen India’s response to the climate crisis. Over the past five years, my colleagues and I have conducted public lectures and written media articles; taught short courses to upskill professionals including climate journalists, writers and practitioners; and used illustrated books, games and videos to reach diverse audiences. Three years ago, the university launched a multilingual climate festival attended by tens of thousands of young visitors across India.\n\nThrough these experiences and experimentation — ones that are relevant to other low- and middle-income country contexts — I have gathered five important lessons for climate communication.\n\nDon’t only mourn the loss of nature\n\nClimate change, biodiversity collapse and pollution are classic ‘dismal disciplines’, which can plunge young people — the main target of our communication efforts — into depression. I have seen my own students struggle to seek hope when confronted with the realities of climate change. Public communication must move beyond stories of doom and gloom, which — although realistic — have the unfortunate effect of making many people step away, instead of engaging in the conversation.\n\nTo spur climate action, educators must get personal\n\nIn real life, people interact with nature using their senses, and that’s where climate festivals can be effective. Our festivals have included art installations, movie screenings, theatre and folk-art performances, nature walks, leaf painting and mushroom collecting, as well as traditional Indian games with seeds and shells. Such immersive approaches that engage people with nature can help visitors to go beyond passively viewing scientific information and towards a more joyous and active way of interacting with climate research. This enables individuals to personalize and internalize the elements of nature in their own minds and bodies. I hope that these experiences will remain with people for their whole lives.\n\nThe names of these events use the metaphor of the Indian festival or ‘mela’ to celebrate a different facet of nature each year. In 2022, we focused on the ‘Rivers of life’ — moving to ‘Forests of life’ in 2023, ‘Mountains of life’ in 2024 and now ‘Coasts and oceans of life’ this year. We are not being unrealistically optimistic — these festivals showcase the grim realities of vanishing forests, collapsing mountains, polluted rivers and warming oceans. But we also use photoessays and the voices of local people to document the beauty of a snow-capped mountain, the joy of an Indigenous forest festival and the intimate relationship of a shaman with her river goddess. Over time, we find that these are the areas of the festival where people linger, read and interact — their eyes lighting up with hope. Celebrations pull in the crowd — and people stay to discuss the challenges.\n\nUse multilingual communication\n\nClimate-change education is not only for those who speak English, or whatever the dominant language of a region might be. India is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world, yet most scientific discussions in India are restricted to a relatively small section of the population — those who speak English. This leaves out the majority of the country’s people, who also have a stake in India’s climate future and are often highly motivated to act.\n\nAlthough the School of Climate Change and Sustainability develops its climate material in English, it has translated it into Kannada, Hindi and Assamese, and is now interpreting it in other languages. This is not without challenges. For instance, how do you take a technical term such as ‘sustainability’ and translate it into a local Indian language? A direct translation of the term in Kannada is ‘susthirate’, which means permanence, or freedom from instability. It doesn’t work. Instead, the material contains many of these technical terms, written in local script — or uses alternative ways to communicate the same idea without using the term.\n\nAzim Premji University in Bengaluru, India, hosts an annual, multilingual climate festival.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nThe university casts its net widely to find people who can complete the translations. Professional translators, who are used to translating literature and poetry, often use complex language with a literary flourish. However, the comprehensibility of such language can be a barrier for children from low-income, underserved public schools, who constitute about half of the visitors at our climate-change festivals.\n\nThe festival organizers now work with committed middle- and high-school language teachers, who are used to communicating complex ideas using relatively simple vocabulary. This process helps to improve the teachers’ climate-change communication skills, and strengthens the festival’s partnership with teachers, building a larger community.\n\nInvolve young people\n\nThe success of student movements around climate change, such as Fridays for Future and the Sunrise Movement, demonstrates the importance of involving young people in climate communication. However, far too often, some scientists think of young people as recipients of their knowledge, not as communicators with unique perspectives and ways to connect with others of their generation.\n\nOver the past three years, we have worked with more than 200 young interns as part of the climate festivals, who have visited different parts of India to document climate and environmental change on the ground. This has had two important outcomes.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change\n\nFirst, it has built on their capacity and commitment to the subject, transforming them into lifelong climate champions. Some of our youngest student interns — including 14-year-olds — have delivered powerful projects, including a terrarium that was the centrepiece of our art exhibits, and a display exploring the ethics around elephant capture and training in India.\n\nAnother high-school student documented an island in the Sundarbans, a mangrove forest area in the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, that is being swallowed by rising sea levels. Realizing that the residents were also dealing with other challenges, including an inadequate public-health system, the student raised money to help the islanders. Several of our younger visitors have returned to our university, applying to undergraduate programmes and seeking to contribute to climate activities.\n\nSecond, we have found that young people are more likely to react to messages delivered by other young people, rather than to more scientifically advanced, but less accessible, lectures by trained specialists. When students see other young people who have completed exciting projects, it inspires them to join forces and contribute.\n\nElevate traditional knowledge\n\nMost efforts to communicate climate science to the public use researchers to inform and influence people. But scientists and sustainability specialists are not the only people with expert knowledge. They can learn from society, as well as inform.\n\nClimate justice is a central focus for us. Although we work with many scientists, climate practitioners and activists who are excellent at communicating with wider audiences, we have also found that preaching, moralizing and proselytizing — such as by telling people that they are ‘bad’ for consuming more, using plastic, travelling by aeroplane and so on — only turns audiences away. And students often tune these messages out.\n\nExhibitions at an annual climate festival in Bengalaru, India, are used to inspire students.Credit: Harini Nagendra\n\nRather than receiving information through didactical lectures, it is much more effective to get the audience to arrive at such conclusions for themselves — by showing them photographs of people living on the coast whose lives are affected by plastic, for instance.\n\nIndigenous communities, with their deep connection to nature and different epistemological approaches, include experts of a different kind and have been too long ignored by scientists. In November 2023, the two-week ‘Forests of life’ climate festival held at our campus, was inaugurated by Soliga tribal elders. Instead of giving a specialist talk, they performed a traditional harvest dance on stage and invited students to join them. By the end of the performance, even the teachers and security and support staff were dancing with the group, transforming the atmosphere into something transcendental and joyous — a perfect launchpad for the festival.",

          "abstract": "The drive had been lazy, uneventful. Window open, AC off, no online activity for hours, no cravings of any kind. On a whim, Akili had decided to visit the new megastore on the outskirts of the outskirts. Someone had told him it would be worth it. They hadn’t been wrong.\n\nThe building stood alone in an empty field, walls all glass, like the skin had been peeled off and one was now privy to its inner workings. On the inside, the aisles were brimming with wonders in all sorts of guises. Clothes, tools, foodstuffs, gadgets and things Akili didn’t even recognize. But the key in this particular store was that the aisles weren’t static: to save storage space they ebbed and flowed, came together and moved apart like the bellows on a harmonium in a mechanical waltz. Plus, it was not just the transparency, somehow Akili could see things more clearly inside the store than in the field it occupied; the colours were more vivid, he could identify details on the products his brain told him he shouldn’t be able to detect at this distance; even hints of pleasant smells were in the air, which, again, seemed impossible. But most impressive was that the hypnotic movement inside the store was synchronized, it had purpose. As the aisles joined and separated, diligent robots replaced items as others picked them up, taking them to be packed and loaded on delivery drones, which zapped constantly in and out, their hum filling the air as if setting the aisle movements to music.\n\nThere were few people in sight except for the ad-hoc tourists like Akili. Just a couple of technicians who wandered around unjamming and lubricating, probably just fulfilling the Minimum Human Employment Law, but at any rate spoiling the show. Wherever they went, the aisles froze in static, parallel, safe-distance normality, jumping back to life the second motion sensors decided it was safe; like in the old tales of workshops animating to dance and song in the absence of their owners. Of course, all this poetic efficiency was mostly for show. These were lightweight short-range drones; the heavy lifters for larger objects or transatlantic delivery were much farther out, on even cheaper land, probably in much more drab warehouses, with normal boring aisles.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAkili mused that, all in all, it was an interesting and novel spectator sport. Until it wasn’t.\n\nSuddenly, one of those ubiquitous AI-generated, androgynous, race-ambiguous holograms materialized in front of him, eyes the usual disturbing mix of vacant and piercing.\n\n“You have been standing on company property for over five minutes.” The tone was calm, even soothing, but decisive. “According to the terms and conditions of the lease you have tacitly agreed to be approached by a Non-Person Associate.”\n\nThe hologram paused for about half a second and Akili instinctively knew what was happening. He had probably given access to his identity details, and, thus, to his socials, which were being combed through. Not that it mattered, there would probably have been many other ways of getting to the same place even if he had flatly refused, which no one he knew ever did. Why bother? It usually meant you were denied access, got stuck in the middle of something, or that tasks took longer than your attention span. No one craves any of that.\n\n“It looks like you have not made purchases recently,” the hologram stated helpfully. “But do not worry, we have many affordable suggestions that fit your likes and needs. Please make your choice now.”",

Credit: Gordon Scammell/Loop Images/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nA crucial ocean-current system seems unlikely to collapse even in the face of severe climate change ― despite predictions that it would disintegrate if Earth continues to warm. That’s the finding of a study1 suggesting that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will survive at least until the end of the century.\n\nThe study found that the combined forces of various ocean currents and winds would keep the system stable even under the most pessimistic climate scenarios.\n\nThe authors are confident that there is sufficient evidence to support this finding, even though the climate models they analysed do not perfectly mirror reality. “Unlikely isn’t impossible,” says Jonathan Baker, a co-author of the study and a climate scientist at the Met Office in Exeter, UK. “But we have confidence in our results.” The work is published today in Nature.\n\nWater-moving machine\n\nThe AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt in the Atlantic Ocean: warm water travels in the upper layers from south to north. Once the water reaches its northernmost point, it sinks and travels southwards in a cold, deep layer until it reaches the southern oceans, where it rises back up to the surface. The AMOC therefore has a crucial role in the global distribution of heat, salt and other components of seawater.\n\nThe system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (warm water in red, cold water in blue; artist’s illustration) would survive, although in weakened form, even with extreme climate change.Credit: Jonathan Baker (Met Office) and co-authors\n\nThe intensity of the AMOC has declined over time2, a trend traced to polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes linked to climate change. Although scientists agree that the collapse of the AMOC would have devastating consequences for local and regional climates, they are divided on whether and when such an event would occur.\n\nStudies of the AMOC’s future generally rely on analyses of its past behaviour and on models that simulate future scenarios under different climate conditions. Some have concluded that the AMOC would reach a tipping point sometime between 2025 and 2095, then abruptly shut down3. Other research indicates that a collapse is unlikely before the end of the century2, but scientists had not previously identified the factors that might be stopping it from happening.\n\nA passel of models\n\nBaker and his team used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might respond to two extreme scenarios: a four-fold increase in carbon-dioxide levels from pre-industrial levels; and the addition of massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both scenarios, but not collapse.",

Gene therapy to restore the barrier reduced inflammation in the brain and improved learning and memory in aged mice. The work was published today in Nature1.\n\nThe finding shines a spotlight on a cast of poorly understood molecules called mucins that coat the interior of blood vessels throughout the body and give mucus its slippery texture, says Carolyn Bertozzi, a Nobel-prizewinning chemist at Stanford University in California and a lead author of the study. “Mucins play a lot of interesting roles in the body,” she says. “But until recently, we didn’t have the tools to study them. They were invisible.”\n\nSnotty barrier\n\nMucins are large proteins decorated with carbohydrates that form linkages with one another, creating a water-laden, gel-like substance. They are crucial constituents of the blood–brain barrier, a system that restricts the movement of some molecules from the blood into the brain.\n\nResearchers have long sought ways to sneak medicines past this barrier to treat diseases of the brain. Previous work also showed that the integrity of the barrier erodes with age2, suggesting that it could be an important target for therapies to combat diseases associated with ageing, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nConquering Alzheimer’s: a look at the therapies of the future\n\nBut scientists knew little about the contribution of mucins to these changes, until Sophia Shi, a graduate student at Stanford, decided to focus on a mucin-rich layer called the glycocalyx, which lines blood vessels. Shi and her colleagues looked at what happens to the glycocalyx in the brain as mice age. “The mucins on the young blood vessels were thick and juicy and plump,” says Bertozzi. “In the old mice, they were thin and lame and patchy.”\n\nThe team went on to find that mucins in a particular class were less abundant in old mice than in young mice. The scientists also showed that a decrease in the activity of enzymes needed to produce these mucins caused the blood–brain barrier to become leakier.\n\nAnd bolstering the activity of those enzymes in old mice reduced the leakage and improved the animals’ performance on learning and memory tests. Old mice can be forgetful, says Bertozzi. “They can’t get out of the maze like they used to. But they do better on those tests after we restore the mucin barrier.”",

Credit: Eye Of Science/Science Photo Library\n\nResearchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can diagnose a range of infections and health conditions in one sweep, by screening immune-cell gene sequences in blood samples.\n\nIn a study of nearly 600 people, published in Science on 20 February1, the tool identified whether participants were healthy or had COVID-19, type 1 diabetes, HIV or the autoimmune disease lupus, as well as whether they had recently received a flu vaccine.\n\nNeuronostics: Accelerating the diagnosis of epilepsy with computer modelling\n\n“This is a one-shot sequencing approach that captures everything that your immune system has been exposed to,” says Sarah Teichmann, a molecular biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nThe tool is not yet ready for clinical use, but with more work to refine the approach, it could one day help clinicians to deal with “conditions that today don’t have definitive tests”, says study co-author Maxim Zaslavsky, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California.\n\n“From a real-world point of view, the promise would be to have one foundation model for the immune system where you can read out everything that a person has seen, and then link it to their health care,” says Teichmann. “There are a lot of steps on the pathway to realizing that down the line, but this is one step.”\n\nNatural diagnostic\n\nThe immune system holds an extensive record of past and current illnesses through its two major cell types — B cells and T cells. B cells produce antibodies that attach to viruses and harmful molecules, whereas T cells activate other responses or kill infected cells.\n\nWhen a person has an infection, or an autoimmune condition in which the body mistakenly attacks its own tissues, their B cells and T cells increase in number and start to produce specific surface receptors. Sequencing the genes that encode these receptors can unlock the person’s unique record of diseases and infections.\n\n“The immune system is a natural diagnostic, and if we just learn how it can do it, then we could also do it,” says Victor Greiff, a computational immunologist at the University of Oslo.\n\nCurrent diagnostic tools “make some but little use of the immune system’s record of disease exposures”, says Zaslavsky, but most previous efforts have focused on sequences from either B or T cells. “Combining them for this fuller picture of immune activity gives us a more complete read-out of what could be happening.”\n\nSuper-speedy sequencing puts genomic diagnosis in the fast lane\n\nZaslavsky and his colleagues built an AI tool that combines six machine-learning models to analyse gene sequences encoding key regions in B-cell and T-cell receptors, and pick out patterns associated with particular diseases.",

It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nDuring her PhD at the Korea Polar Research Institute in Incheon, South Korea, biochemist Babita Paudel studied antioxidant compounds from lichens and mosses that thrive in Antarctica. On returning to her home country, Nepal, she shifted to studying molecules produced by high-altitude microbes and medicinal plants found there. She co-founded the Center for Natural and Applied Sciences (CENAS) in Kathmandu, where she studies groups of bacteria called actinomycetes, known for producing compounds with antimicrobial activity. To isolate these bacteria, her team collected soil samples from extreme environments, including the base camps at Mount Everest and Annapurna, looking for potential products to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.\n\nBeyond her research, Paudel leads efforts to boost the numbers of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers in Nepal. Supported by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany, her Women in STEM Nepal team travels across the country to conduct capacity-building training for early- and mid-career women. The team organizes sessions on academic writing, building CVs, professional networking and writing grant proposals. In addition, it created Nepal's Women in STEM Nepal database, listing around 650 female researchers. The initiative has connected around 3,200 women interested in STEM careers. Paudel spoke to Nature about what inspired her to take the reins of this countrywide project.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nWhat drives me to help female students to thrive at my Ugandan university\nIt wasn’t a singular event. From the start, my passion was fuelled by strong family support. My father was the principal at a public secondary school. I was a bright student and having good scores encouraged my family to support my science education. At that time, only a small number of female students opted for science subjects. There were very few female professors teaching STEM courses, but seeing their commitment — despite the major household responsibilities that Nepalese society puts on women — inspired me to continue my career as a scientist.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?\n\nI've been fortunate to have my husband as a significant influence and mentor. We both are researchers in biochemistry, and his unwavering support has enabled me to pursue my career despite the responsibilities of raising our two children.\n\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle gender inequality in science?\n\nIn 2021, while participating in an event organized by the Nepal German Academic Association, an alumni body, I was asked to give a presentation on the status of women in science in Nepal. It took me a month to prepare that presentation because there wasn’t any proper database of women scientists. I had to meticulously review data from a government body, the University Grants Commission, and visit department home pages of each of Nepal’s universities to gather information. One 2010 statistic from the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO was particularly shocking: women comprised just 7.9% of the STEM workforce in Nepal, a proportion that was among the lowest in Asia. I realized the urgent need to do something about this.\n\nWere there other surprises that came out of your work?\n\nIn Nepal, there is a substantial disparity for women in STEM owing to various social norms such as domestic and childcare responsibilities, the lack of female-friendly policies in the workplace, and insufficient capacity-building activities, inspiration and motivation.\n\nI found that most Nepalese women in STEM tend to marry after completing their bachelor’s or master’s degrees. This often results in an academic break, one that often leads to a significant loss of confidence, contributing to imposter syndrome. I didn’t realize how pervasive this problem was until I started travelling the country and hearing women’s stories.\n\nAlso, Nepalese society is still patriarchal, and a lot of panel discussions at scientific conferences still tend to exclude female experts. I was surprised by the extent of this inequality. Women are expected to sacrifice the most, not just for their families, but also academically. Even women with advanced degrees often find themselves limited to sometimes entry-level, contract-limited and temporary lecturer positions in universities, with few opportunities for further promotion.\n\nHow does your initiative try to address these disparities?\n\nI’m a Palestinian scientist building a more inclusive future\nWe are building capacity for female students in STEM careers and creating networks of female researchers. In 2022 and 2023, we organized 10 capacity-building activities across 7 provinces in Nepal, engaging 421 female researchers in workshops on professional networking, how to explore work and study opportunities, CV preparation, proposal writing and plagiarism in research. In addition, we hosted ten webinars and published a comprehensive database of national and international funding agencies, scholarships and fellowships on the CENAS website.\n\nWe also created a Facebook group for team members to network, and to disseminate information on scholarships, funding agencies and opportunities. The group has more than 4,000 members. In 2022 and 2023, we also provided travel grants for 25 female students and early-career researchers to participate in and present their research at national and international conferences across Nepal.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something female researcher in Nepal?",

          "abstract": "An artist’s impression of an asteroid.Credit: ESA-Science Office\n\nThe latest calculations indicate that the asteroid known as 2024 YR4 is much less likely to hit Earth than earlier measurements had suggested. Late on 19 February, telescopic observations of the object allowed researchers to revise down the estimated chance of impact in 2032 from 3.1% — the greatest such threat ever recorded — to a still-worrying 1.5%.\n\nAsteroid lost 1 million kilograms after collision with DART spacecraft\n\nThis value is likely to fall even further, to less than 1%, says Richard Moissl, head of the European Space Agency’s Planetary Defence Office, based in Frascati, Italy. As data flood in, uncertainty regarding 2024 YR4’s ‘impact corridor’ — the path it will take in the vicinity of Earth — is shrinking. If, as the uncertainty in an asteroid’s path gets smaller, Earth’s orbit remains within it, the likelihood of impact grows — which is why, earlier this week, space agencies reported that the risk had climbed. But now Earth is on the fringes of this region and edging out.\n\nYR4 has given researchers their first chance to test an international protocol for responding to such hazards, put in place after the Chelyabinsk meteor hit Earth in 2013 without any warning. And with new asteroid-hunting telescopes coming online all the time, astronomers are likely to see many more close calls, says Moissl. “It’s not if, it’s when.”\n\nImpact warning\n\nAsteroids appear on researchers’ radars all the time — but not ones like YR4. It was first spotted in late December, and by 27 January, the object’s likelihood of hitting Earth had crept up above 1%, which triggered the United Nations-mandated International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to spring into action.\n\nIAWN’s network of researchers have been working overtime to precisely calculate the asteroid’s speed and path, says Moissl. It hopes to report an impact risk of below 1% before April, when YR4’s orbit will take it beyond the range of ground-based telescopes until 2028.\n\n‘Head-scratcher’: first look at asteroid dust brought to Earth offers surprises\n\nIAWN’s regular practice exercises, using hypothetical asteroids, have taught scientists to focus on quickly obtaining the most important measurements in real time — those that allow them to pinpoint when and where an asteroid could hit, and the damage it could cause, says Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson and manager of IAWN.\n\nThis kind of rapid applied science is already familiar to meteorologists and seismologists, he says. “You have to coordinate and understand that you’re doing science to save the world, for the lack of a better term,” he says.",

          "abstract": "An 8% stipend increase for UKRI-funded PhD students takes effect from 1 October 2025.Credit: Ladanifer/Getty\n\nPhD students receiving stipends from the United Kingdom’s national research-funding agency are to get an 8% pay hike.\n\nThe announcement from UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) means that the minimum PhD stipend will rise from £19,237 (US$24,300) to £20,780 from 1 October 2025. UKRI describes it as the largest real-terms stipend increase since 2003. The agency supported an estimated 24,000 students in the 2023–24 academic year, amounting to around one in five of doctoral students based in the United Kingdom.\n\nOther changes unveiled by UKRI include allowing students to take up to 28 weeks’ medical leave, more opportunities to extend studentships and greater support for students with disabilities.\n\nAnnouncing the stipend increase on 30 January, UKRI chief executive Ottoline Leyser said: “Postgraduate training is critical to building the workforce needed for an innovation-led economy and public sector, and to delivering outstanding research and innovation outcomes.\n\n“The increase in the postgraduate stipend and changes in terms and conditions we are announcing today are part of our ongoing work to forge a new deal for postgraduates, widening access to the diverse and fulfilling careers that research and innovation has to offer.”\n\nAlongside the announcement, UKRI also published a report that said there was widespread support from universities and other research organizations and UKRI grant holders for setting the stipend in line with the UK national living wage.\n\nFinancial survival\n\nSome researchers hailed the increase as a step towards helping all researchers to survive financially. But others said that much more needs to be done to help them.\n\nStephanie Buller, who researches risk management as part of a UKRI-funded PhD at Cardiff University, says the stipend hike is still too low.\n\nMany first jobs, including apprenticeships aimed at 16- and 18-year-olds that combine practical training with study, can pay more than a PhD does, she adds.\n\nBuller says: “I’ve got an undergraduate [degree], a master’s and 10 years’ experience, so my current skill set is worth £60,000. I've walked away from a very-well-paying job to be a mature student in financial hardship.\n\n“There are hundreds of PhDs up and down the country that are saying, ‘how do I keep a roof over my head and how do I pay for my next meal?’”\n\nPablo Ouro, a civil engineer at the University of Manchester who completed his PhD in 2017, says that the increase is “good news for all PhD students”, but notes that foreign students have extra costs to bear.",

Although international funding does not seem to be specifically threatened by the latest NIH policy changes, some overseas researchers say that concerns about the future of the agency’s funding has spurred them to seek support from other sources.\n\nRevealed: NIH research grants still frozen despite lawsuits challenging Trump order\n\n“The global research endeavour is enormously complex and enormously interdependent, and if a big part of it starts sputtering, the whole thing slows down,” says Ethan Scott, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia, who is a lead investigator on an NIH grant. “It’s difficult to overstate the degree to which the US NIH is one of the major engines behind global biomedical research.”\n\nGrants frozen\n\nAs part of efforts to slash US government spending and bureaucracy, the Trump administration has implemented policies that freeze NIH funding and grant reviews. This month, the NIH said it would slash funding for indirect costs, which pay for necessities such as electricity and waste removal at US research institutions. It proposed cutting the rate from an average of around 40% to 15% of grant awards — although the policy is facing legal challenge.\n\nOn its website, the NIH lists 811 grants to international teams in more than 60 countries, together worth more than $340 million. The nations with the most awards are South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. Grant sizes range from a few thousand dollars to $7 million.\n\nThe policy developments “cast a shadow across future planning”, especially for international collaborations involving interdisciplinary research, says Scott, whose grant looks at how the brain of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) processes visual and auditory information. The NIH has “a very generous and outward-looking policy” of funding researchers overseas, grounded in a philosophy of expanding knowledge and advancing medical research, he says. “The uncertainty that arises for international researchers is whether the NIH will consider continuing to send money overseas.”\n\n‘Devastating’ cuts to NIH grants by Trump’s team put on hold by US judge\n\nInternational collaborations\n\nA researcher in Australia who uses genomic techniques to study health equity and prostate cancer spent their Christmas holiday applying for non-US grants as a backup for the millions of dollars they receive from the NIH and the US Department of Defense. The researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because of fears about their project’s future, says that the collaboration involves some 50 research staff in Australia, the United States and several African countries, among others. “This year I was meant to take a break and just enjoy doing research,” they say. “Instead of taking a break, I’ve just been writing every grant I possibly can,” — for funding from agencies in countries including Australia and the United Kingdom — “anywhere but America”.\n\nThe scientist says that applying for other grants could make those application pools more competitive.",

          "title": "Will AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct",
          "authors": "Felice Frankel",
          "abstract": "One of the privileges of being on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge is seeing glimpses of the future, from advances in quantum computing and energy sustainability and production, to designing new antibiotics. Do I understand it all deeply? No, but I am able to wrap my head around much of it when I am asked to create an image to document the research.\n\nThe joy of being a science photographer is that I must learn about the things I am documenting to produce communicative and trustworthy images, intended as a form of data, for the researchers who welcome me into their laboratories.\n\nBut now, with the wide availability of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) tools, lots of questions must be asked. Will there be a point at which, with just a few keystrokes and prompts, a scientist can create a ‘visual’ of their research, as I do with my camera, and consider that image a record of the work? Will researchers, journals and readers be able to spot artificially created images and understand that they do not truly document the work? And finally, from a personal point of view, will there still be a place for a science photographer like me to advance the communication of research? Here’s what I have found out while experimenting with artificial intelligence (AI) image generators.\n\nReality and representation\n\nFirst, let’s remind ourselves of the differences between a photograph, in which each pixel corresponds to real-world photons, and a genAI visual, created with a diffusion model — a complex computational process that generates something that seems real but might never have existed.\n\nTo explore these differences, I decided to experiment with genAI visuals made with Midjourney and OpenAI’s DALL-E diffusion models to reproduce the work shown in one of my most popular science photographs — with help from scientific-visualization researcher Gaël McGill at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1997, Moungi Bawendi, a chemist at MIT, asked me to take a picture of his nanocrystals (quantum dots). When excited with ultraviolet light, these crystals fluoresce at different wavelengths depending on their size. Bawendi, who later shared a Nobel prize for this work, did not like the first image (see ‘Three views’), in which I had placed the vials flat on the lab bench, taking a top-down photograph. You can tell that was how I had placed them, because you can see the air bubbles in the tubes. It was intentional; I thought it made the image more interesting.\n\nCredit: Felice Frankel\n\nThe second iteration was used on the November 1997 cover of the Journal of Physical Chemistry B (see ‘Three views’). That photograph provides a straightforward record of the research and highlights the importance of collaborating with the scientist — an essential part of my process.\n\nTo generate a comparable image in DALL-E, I used the prompt “create a photo of Moungi Bawendi’s nanocrystals in vials against a black background, fluorescing at different wavelengths, depending on their size, when excited with UV light”.\n\nChina made waves with Deepseek, but its real ambition is AI-driven industrial innovation\n\nPeople might think that the image the program produced is attractive (see ‘Three views’), but it is not even close to the reality captured in the original photograph. DALL-E introduced bead-like dots that were not in the prompt. The algorithm presumably found the words ‘quantum dots’ in the data set of the AI model that underlies it and used that information to replace the words “nanocrystals”.\n\nMore troubling is the fact that, in each vial, there are dots with different colours, implying that the samples contain a mix of materials that fluoresce at a range of wavelengths — this is inaccurate. Furthermore, some of the dots are shown lying on the surface of the table. Was that an aesthetic decision made by the model? I find the resulting visual fascinating (see Supplementary Information).\n\nThe results of my AI experimentation are often cartoon-like images that can hardly pass as reality — let alone documentation — but there will be a time when they will be. In conversations with colleagues in research and computer-science communities, they all agree that we should have clear standards on what is and is not allowed. In my opinion, a genAI visual should never be allowed as documentation.\n\nManipulated versus AI generated\n\nThe advent of AI means that we need to clarify three core issues related to visual communication: the difference between illustration and documentation, the ethics of image manipulation and the desperate need for visual-communication training for scientists and engineers.\n\nDecisions about how to frame an image — what to include or leave out — are already a manipulation of reality. The tools that people decide to use are also part of the manipulation. Each digital camera creates a distinct photograph. An Apple iPhone’s algorithm enhances image colours differently to that of a Samsung phone. Similarly, the near-infrared images produced by the James Webb Space Telescope are designed to be different from, yet complement, the Hubble Space Telescope’s optical scans.\n\nHow AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history\n\nTaking the point even further, the colours we see in all of those amazing images of the Universe are digitally enhanced and give us yet more renditions of reality. Seen through this lens, it is clear that humans have been, in effect, artificially generating images for years, without necessarily labelling them as such. However, there is a crucial difference between enhancing a photograph with software to depict reality and creating a reality from trained data sets.\n\nAs a science photographer, I am acutely aware of the difference between an illustration and a documentary photograph, but I am less confident that AI programs can make this distinction. An illustration or diagram is a representation of something, subjectively translating and visually describing a concept or structure using notations, colours, shapes and so on. A documentary optical photograph, or one made using scanning or transmission electron microscopy, is created with photons and electrons and is therefore a representation of an item, even if it is not the item itself. The difference between the two is in the intent.\n\nWith illustration, the intent is to describe and clarify the work. GenAI visuals will probably excel in that task. But for a documentary photograph, the intent is to bring us as close to reality as we can. Both are, in essence, already a form of manipulation or an act of artificial generation, and therein lies the importance of defining and discussing their ethics before we include genAI tools.\n\nPublishers now have software in place to identify various manipulations in images that already exist (see Nature 626, 697–698; 2024), but, frankly, AI programs will eventually be able to circumvent these fail-safes. There are efforts under way to find ways to trace the provenance of a photograph or to document any manipulation of the original. For example, the forensic photography community, through the global Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, provides technical information to camera manufacturers regarding the ability to trace the provenance of a photograph by keeping a record in the camera of any manipulation. As one can imagine, not all manufactures are on board.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nThe scientific community still has time to create a system of transparency and form guidelines regarding AI-generated images. At a minimum, every genAI visual should be clearly labelled as such, and the process and tools used to create it should be clearly stated and include, where possible, credit for any source images provided to the AI engine. However, listing the sources poses a challenge.\n\nTwo articles have raised an important issue by highlighting potential privacy and copyright violations when using diffusion models (N. Carlini et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/grqmsb (2023); and see go.nature.com/4jqyevn). Credit is only feasible in a closed system (which diffusion models are not) for which the training data are known and fully documented. For example, Springer Nature, which publishes Nature (Nature is independent of its publisher), has recently included an exception into its policy for Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold program to cover this sort of use (for models trained on a specific set of scientific data). However, people should keep in mind that AlphaFold is not a genAI tool that creates images — it generates structural models (coordinate data) that are then turned into images by people (not by genAI tools).\n\nHappily, efforts are addressing privacy issues. Creators can now use a kind of ‘tamper-evident’ metadata called Content Credentials to, as Adobe explains in its manual, “obtain proper recognition and promote transparency in the content creation process” (see go.nature.com/3wx92ng).\n\nEthical standards\n\nFor years, I have suggested that scientists need to be trained in the ethics of visual communication, and the easy availability of AI image-creation software adds urgency to this discussion.\n\nFor example, I recall one experience with an engineer who altered a photograph that I had made of their research and wanted to publish it, along with the submitted article (see Supplementary Information). The researcher did not consider that altering the image was, in fact, similar to changing their data because they had not been taught the basic ethics of image manipulation and visual communication.",

Nature has now confirmed with several sources that the US State Department delegation is not attending the meeting, which is slated to end with the adoption of an outline for the panel’s seventh climate assessment, due for completion by late 2029. The IPCC assessments, which are the gold-standard guide to the pace and effects of climate change, are used by governments to shape their climate policies.\n\nWhat Trump’s flurry of executive orders means for science\n\nNASA has also cancelled a contract that funded a team including scientists and others to provide administrative and technical support to the climate-assessment effort, according to a US official who is familiar with the situation but asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press. The team would have supported Calvin and her co-chair, Joy Jacqueline Pereira, a geologist at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia in Bangi. The cancellation was reported by the Washington Post and independently confirmed by Nature. A NASA spokesperson said that the move was prompted by guidance “to eliminate non-essential consulting contracts”.\n\nThe absence of the US delegation from the meeting “is obviously a loss for the international community,” says Li Shuo, the director of the Asia Society Policy Institute’s China Climate Hub in Washington DC. “The US plays an important role in the IPCC process, contributing both financial and intellectual support.”\n\nIPCC spokesperson Andrej Mahecic declined to comment, except to say that the organization has not received official notification of any decisions regarding a change in status of the technical support team. For now, the process is moving forwards, he said.\n\nNASA officials confirmed that Calvin would not be attending the meeting in China but declined to make her available for an interview. The White House referred Nature's queries to the State Department; officials there declined to comment.\n\nOutsized role\n\nThe United States has historically made substantial scientific and monetary contributions to the IPCC. US scientists publish research that informs the assessment and run computer simulations of the climate that feed into it. For the seventh report, Calvin was co-chairing one of three IPCC working groups; hers was assessing the scientific literature on options to reduce emissions and halt global warming.\n\nCalvin’s support team would have helped with everything from reviewing the literature and designing graphics to managing travel logistics. The group was funded by a NASA contract but situated in the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), a White House organization that coordinates climate work across federal agencies. That contract has now been ended, according to the US official. “We don’t know if Kate will be allowed to continue as a co-chair” of the working group, they said.\n\n“It would be a real shame if the administration pulled Kate out of that role, not just for her, but for the US,” says Andy Miller, who was one of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s liaisons to the USGCRP until his retirement in December. “And it would be a loss for IPCC to lose someone of Kate's caliber.”\n\nScramble to recover",

          "abstract": "In fields such as computing, information security and precise measurement, quantum systems promise to outperform classical ones. And there’s been much progress over the century since the formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum computers have reached the ‘quantum advantage’ milestone: they are able to solve problems that classical supercomputers cannot. And one method of secure communication, quantum cryptography, uses keys that are known only to the parties involved — a form of unconditional security, which means the protection cannot be broken even with unlimited computer power.\n\nHow to introduce quantum computers without slowing economic growth\n\nQuantum sensors are measuring both time and gravity with unprecedented precision. For instance, gravimeters for detecting earthquakes and for navigation are already commercially available.\n\nHowever, other than these encryption devices and quantum sensors, few quantum technologies have practical applications. In the next few years, quantum simulations will probably advance fields such as quantum chemistry and high-temperature superconductivity. The community is making progress, but the development of noise-resilient quantum computers that can be used for a wide range of problems will take another 10–15 years. Current challenges include protecting the fragile states of quantum bits (qubits) from errors and unwanted interference from the environment.\n\nThree steps would help to spur the field.\n\nFirst, calm down the quantum-computing hype. As a quantum physicist with more than 30 years of experience, I’ve seen how oversold promises have attracted a lot of capital and attention but can lead to unrealistic expectations. Some companies suggest that they can provide quantum-computing services, for example, when they have merely demonstrated small-scale quantum algorithms.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nExaggerated claims can mislead the public and investors and undermine societal confidence in quantum information technology. For example, January saw a collective plunge in quantum-computing stocks, triggering concerns that this technology bubble has now burst.\n\nTo prevent such stock-market jitters, academic and industrial research communities, as well as the media, must accurately communicate the state of quantum technology to the public, to foster realistic expectations.\n\nSecond, stable and long-term government investment is essential for the continued advancement of quantum information technology. Unlike mature technologies, such as the Internet or mobile phones, quantum information research cannot yet rely fully on market-driven financing.\n\nGovernments in the United States, Europe and China have increased their investments in quantum information research and development over the past few years. For example, the US National Quantum Initiative invested US$3.75 billion in 2023 — nearly triple its five-year budget of $1.3 billion (see go.nature.com/3cw6qtr). The next budget is in the process of being reauthorized, with a plan to allocate $2.7 billion over five years. But the eventual investment might be higher.",

          "abstract": "To build and establish essential international networks, gain international experience and secure a position on the academic tenure track, early-career researchers are increasingly seeking employment opportunities abroad1,2. Relocation to a foreign country — particularly one with a different culture and language — is an inherently challenging undertaking. Early-career researchers often encounter difficulties even before departing. A typical example would be the frustrating cycle between residence permit and employment contract: in many cases, obtaining a visa or residence permit is necessary to secure an employment contract. However, without proof of employment and a rental agreement, obtaining a visa can be difficult. In situations in which institutions fail to provide specialized and dedicated support, delays in the researcher’s arrival may occur that limit the ability of the early-career researcher to achieve and show their full potential within the host institution.\n\nAfter arrival, those who do not speak the local language may face additional challenges3. Although researchers typically use a common language (often English), administrative staff of the employing institutions might not, which makes tasks such as completing paperwork and reading email correspondence difficult. These activities frequently require help from a bilingual third party, which is not always available or advisable for sensitive matters. Furthermore, such challenges often extend beyond the walls of the institution into daily life, including in finding accommodation, setting up a local bank account, navigating taxes, and scheduling private or occupational medical appointments.",

          "abstract": "Memorability, the likelihood that a stimulus is remembered, is an intrinsic stimulus property that is highly consistent across people—participants tend to remember or forget the same faces, objects and more. However, these consistencies in memory have thus far only been observed for visual stimuli. Here we investigated memorability in the auditory domain, collecting recognition memory scores from over 3,000 participants listening to a sequence of speakers saying the same sentence. We found significant consistency across participants in their memory for voice clips and for speakers across different utterances. Regression models incorporating both low-level (for example, fundamental frequency) and high-level (for example, dialect) voice properties were significantly predictive of memorability and generalized out of sample, supporting an inherent memorability of speakers’ voices. These results provide strong evidence that listeners are similar in the voices they remember, which can be reliably predicted by quantifiable low-level acoustic features.",

          "abstract": "There is a push to shrink the anticipated 17-year research-to-practice gap for psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT), offering precarious hope to those with disabling mental health conditions. However, numerous questions regarding how PAT works, how well it works, for whom and in what context remain. Substantial changes to current systems of care, including regulatory approvals, clinical training and access will all be required to accommodate PAT, a multimodal therapy that combines pharmacological and psychotherapy components that are not routinely available outside clinical research settings. Implementation science can help to reduce the gap in a way that maintains scientific rigour by simultaneously examining the safety, effectiveness and implementation of PAT. Specifically, precision implementation science methods (for example, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs), hybrid study designs, valid measurement of fidelity and use of theory-based models and frameworks for treatment development will accelerate the process of implementation while balancing safety and quality. The time to proceed, with accelerated caution, is now.",

          "abstract": "Modern economies require increasingly diverse and specialized skills, many of which depend on the acquisition of other skills first. Here we analyse US survey data to reveal a nested structure within skill portfolios, where the direction of dependency is inferred from asymmetrical conditional probabilities—occupations require one skill conditional on another. This directional nature suggests that advanced, specific skills and knowledge are often built upon broader, fundamental ones. We examine 70 million job transitions to show that human capital development and career progression follow this structured pathway in which skills more aligned with the nested structure command higher wage premiums, require longer education and are less likely to be automated. These disparities are evident across genders and racial/ethnic groups, explaining long-term wage penalties. Finally, we find that this nested structure has become even more pronounced over the past two decades, indicating increased barriers to upward job mobility.",

We conducted a systematic literature review and pre-registered meta-analysis of 303 effect sizes from 67 experimental articles evaluating accuracy ratings of true and fact-checked false news ( N Participants = 194,438 from 40 countries across 6 continents). We found that people rated true news as more accurate than false news (Cohen’s d = 1.12 [1.01, 1.22]) and were better at rating false news as false than at rating true news as true (Cohen’s d = 0.32 [0.24, 0.39]). In other words, participants were able to discern true from false news and erred on the side of skepticism rather than credulity. We found no evidence that the political concordance of the news had an effect on discernment, but participants were more skeptical of politically discordant news (Cohen’s d = 0.78 [0.62, 0.94]). These findings lend support to crowdsourced fact-checking initiatives and suggest that, to improve discernment, there is more room to increase the acceptance of true news than to reduce the acceptance of fact-checked false news.",

Variant-level fine mapping prioritized potential causal variants and functional genomic analysis identified variants that regulate the binding of transcription factors. We validated that 80% of the identified functional variants are regulatory variants, and expression quantitative trait loci analysis uncovered the potential target genes regulated by the prioritized risk variants. Gene-level analysis, including transcriptome and proteome-wide association studies, colocalization and Mendelian randomization-based analyses, prioritized potential causal genes and drug targets. Gene prioritization analyses highlighted likely causal genes, including TMEM106B, CTNND1, AREL1 and so on. Pathway analysis indicated significant enrichment of depression risk genes in synapse-related pathways. Finally, knockdown of Tmem106b in mice resulted in depression-like behaviours, supporting the involvement of Tmem106b in depression.

          "abstract": "Adaptation is the process by which we adjust internal models of the body, world and mind in response to sensory feedback. Although adaptation is studied extensively in the context of motor control, there is limited evidence that cognitive functions such as working memory are subject to the same error-driven adaptive control mechanism. To examine the possibility that internal spatial representations undergo adaptation, we had participants perform a task that interleaved a perceptual discrimination task and a spatial working memory task. Perceptual discrimination trials (85% of trials) presented an initial peripheral cue to exogenously capture attention, immediately followed by a displaced target stimulus. This sequence of events served to repeatedly induce a covert attentional allocation error. Interleaved spatial working memory trials (15% of trials) presented a stimulus at a pseudorandom peripheral location followed by a delay interval. On half of the working memory trials, the stimulus was surreptitiously presented at the same location as the initial attentional cue. We found that as attentional errors accumulated over the course of the experiment, participants’ spatial recall shifted to counteract the attentional error. The magnitude of this shift was proportional to the number of induced errors. Recall performance recovered rapidly following the offset of error trials. Multiple control experiments ruled out alternative explanations for these results, such as oculomotor confounds and attentional biases unrelated to error. These findings indicate that the computational mechanisms governing the adaptation of motor commands appear to similarly serve to adjust and calibrate spatial cognition.",

          "abstract": "A weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has been found to be globally beneficial by economic assessments. This result emerges because AMOC weakening would cool the Northern Hemisphere, thereby reducing expected climate damages and decreasing estimates of the global social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC). There are, however, many other impacts of AMOC weakening that are not yet taken into account. Here, we add a second impact channel by quantifying the effects of AMOC weakening on ocean carbon uptake, using biogeochemically-only coupled freshwater hosing simulations in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. Our simulations reveal an approximately linear relationship between AMOC strength and carbon uptake reductions, constituting a carbon cycle feedback that leads to higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and stronger global warming. This AMOC carbon feedback, when incorporated into an integrated climate-economy model, leads to additional economic damages of several trillion US dollars and raises the SCC by about 1%. The SCC increase is similar in magnitude, but of opposite sign, to the SCC effect of Northern Hemisphere cooling. While there are many other potentially relevant economic impact channels, the AMOC carbon feedback alone could thus flip the consequences of AMOC weakening into a net cost to society.",

          "abstract": "Sociotechnical systems, where technological and human elements interact in a goal-oriented manner, provide important functional support to our societies. Here, we draw attention to the underappreciated concept of timeliness—i.e., system elements being available at the right place at the right time—that has been ubiquitously and integrally adopted as a quality standard in the modus operandi of sociotechnical systems. We point out that a variety of incentives, often reinforced by competitive pressures, prompt system operators to myopically optimize for efficiencies, running the risk of inadvertently taking timeliness to the limit of its operational performance, correspondingly making the system critically fragile to perturbations by pushing the entire system toward the proverbial “edge of a cliff.” Invoking a stylized model for operational delays, we identify the limiting operational performance of timeliness, as a true critical point, where the smallest of perturbations can lead to a systemic collapse. Specifically for firm-to-firm production networks, we suggest that the proximity to critical fragility is an important ingredient for understanding the fundamental “excess volatility puzzle” in economics. Further, in generality for optimizing sociotechnical systems, we propose that critical fragility is a crucial aspect in managing the trade-off between efficiency and robustness.",

          "abstract": "High-profile incidents of police violence against Black citizens over the past decade have spawned contentious debates in the United States on the role of police. This debate has played out prominently in the news media, leading to a perception that media outlets have become more critical of the police. There is currently, however, little empirical evidence supporting this perceived shift. We construct a large dataset of local news reporting on the police from 2013 to 2023 in 10 politically diverse U.S. cities. Leveraging advanced language models, we measure criticism by analyzing whether reporting supports or is critical of two contentions: 1) that the police protect citizens and 2) that the police are racist. To validate this approach, we collect labels from members of different political parties. We find that contrary to public perceptions, local media criticism of the police has remained relatively stable along these two dimensions over the past decade. While criticism spiked in the aftermath of high-profile police killings, such as George Floyd’s murder, these events did not produce sustained increases in negative police news. In fact, reporting supportive of police effectiveness has increased slightly since Floyd’s death. We find only small differences in coverage trends in more conservative and more liberal cities, undermining the idea that local outlets cater to the politics of their audiences. Last, although Republicans are more likely to view a piece of news as supportive of the police than Democrats, readers across parties see reporting as no more critical than it was a decade ago.",

Here, we show, using analytical and individual-based models, that individual preferences, even when weak, determine the equilibrium point of cultural dynamics when acting together with nondirectional social influence in three out of four cases we study. The results have implications regarding the importance of keeping into account individual-level, nonsocial, factors, when studying cultural evolution, as well as regarding the interpretation of cross-cultural regularities, that must be expected, but can be product of weak directional forces, intensified by social influence.",

Understanding how conservation efforts are allocated is paramount to effectively protect threatened species. We analyzed ~14,600 conservation projects over a 25-y period, revealing substantial taxonomic biases in funding. When matched with formal assessments of species’ threat status, several highly threatened groups such as amphibians receive little and ever-decreasing support. Within particular groups (e.g., Mammalia, Reptilia), funding is directed to a very narrow selection of taxa, leaving the majority of their threatened species with limited or no support. More attention is urgently needed to assess the extinction risks of neglected taxa, especially smaller species. Paradoxically, while approximately 6% of species identified as threatened were supported by conservation funds, 29% of the funding was allocated to species of “least concern”. A more holistic distribution of conservation funding is, therefore, urgently needed if we are to protect biodiversity efficiently. We suggest avenues and mechanisms for a more balanced coverage of threatened species within conservation programs and highlight some of the benefits that could be derived from such an approach.",

ATL has a very poor prognosis and lacks satisfactory treatments; therefore, it is critical to identify potential targets in ATL cells in order to develop effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report the identification of two oncogenes, AK4 and RHOC, as target genes of miR-455-3p, a tumor-suppressive microRNA in ATL patients. Importantly, AK4 and RHOC are highly expressed in ATL and exhibit oncogenic potentials in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal a functional overlap of AK4 and RHOC, including activating oncogenic pathways such as Myc targets and deregulating lipid metabolism such as enhancing the production of sphingomyelin, a tumor-promoting lipid. In particular, compared to other types of T cell malignancy such as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), ATL is sensitive to sphingomyelin inhibition and AK4 or RHOC depletion. Altogether, we report a distinct dependency of ATL on AK4 and RHOC oncogenes and an oncometabolite sphingomyelin, which together represent targetable vulnerabilities of ATL that could be exploited for developing effective therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Female mosquitoes are vectors of many devastating human diseases because they require blood feeding to initiate reproduction. Thus, elucidation of molecular mechanisms managing female mosquito reproduction is essential. Although the regulation of gene expression during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle has been studied in detail, how this process is controlled at the chromatin level remains unclear. Chromatin must be accessible for transcription factors (TFs) governing gene expression. A specialized class of TFs, called pioneer factors (PFs), binds and remodels closed chromatin, permitting other TFs to bind DNA and activate the gene expression. Here, we identified a homolog of the vertebrate PF FoxA in the mosquito Aedes aegypti and used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate mosquitoes deficient in AaFoxA . We found that ovary development was severely retarded in mutant females. Multiomics and molecular biology analyses have shown that AaFoxA increased histone acetylation and decreased methylation of H3K27 by controlling the chromatin accessibility of histone modification enzymes and chromatin remodelers. AaFoxA is bound to the loci of chromatin remodelers, changing their chromatin accessibility and modulating their temporal expression patterns. AaFoxA increased the accessibility of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) and E74 loci, indicating the important role of AaFoxA in the hormonal regulation of mosquito reproductive events. Further, the CUT&amp;RUN and ATAC-seq analyses revealed that AaFoxA temporarily bound closed chromatin, making it differentially accessible during the mosquito gonadotrophic cycle. Hence, this study demonstrates that AaFoxA modulates chromatin dynamics throughout female mosquito reproduction.",

All three Escherichia coli TLS polymerases interact with the β 2 processivity clamp through a conserved clamp-binding motif (CBM), which is indispensable for TLS. Notably, Pol IV also interacts weakly with the rim of the clamp through non-CBM residues. Ablating this “rim contact” in cells results in selective sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, raising the question how the rim contact contributes to TLS. Here, we show that the rim contact is critical for TLS past a strong replication block but barely necessary for a weak blocking lesion. Within the in vitro reconstituted E. coli replisome, the rim mutation compromises Pol IV-mediated TLS past 3-deaza-methyl dA, a strong block, whereas barely affecting TLS past N 2 -furfuryl dG, a weak block. Similar observations are also made in E. coli cells bearing a single copy of these lesions in the genome. At lesion-stalled replication forks, single-stranded DNA binding protein locally enriches Pol IV, enabling it to bind the low-affinity rim site. This interaction poises Pol IV to better compete with Pol III, the replicative polymerase, which competitively inhibits Pol IV from interacting with the clamp through its CBM. We propose that this bipartite clamp interaction enables Pol IV to rapidly resolve lesion-stalled replication at a strong block through TLS, which reduces damage-induced mutagenesis.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductor quantum dots (QD) promise unique electronic, optical, and chemical properties, which can be exquisitely tuned by controlling the composition, size, and morphology. Semiconductor QDs have been synthesized primarily via two approaches, namely, epitaxial growth and wet-chemical synthesis. However, the properties of epitaxial QDs (eQDs) are susceptible to wetting layer formation and substrate dislocations, while colloidal QDs (cQDs) face fluorescence intermittency issues. Here, we report on the synthesis of a class of QDs that can overcome the fundamental limitations of eQDs and cQDs. By exploiting the sp 2 bonding of layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we show that GaN QDs can be epitaxially grown through a weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction without two-dimensional wetting layer formation. The photoluminescence intensity of GaN van der Waals quantum dots (vQDs) is more than six times stronger than that of conventional GaN eQDs and no optical blinking was observed from vQDs. We show that the interadatom bond strength is about one order of magnitude stronger compared with that between the adatoms and the hBN substrate. This work shows that vQDs have unique properties that are difficult to achieve using existing QDs synthesis methods and thus can potentially enable new classes of high-performance optoelectronic and quantum devices.",

          "abstract": "The genome-wide association studies identified genes associated with many diseases, but the identification and verification of disease variants are still challenging due to small effects and large number of individual variants. In this paper, we propose a powerful method that first quantifies the strength of regional associations at each single nucleotide polymorphism and converts these measures into time series data before using a change point detection algorithm to identify significant regions. In our extensive simulation study, the proposed method consistently demonstrates greater power than existing alternatives, achieving a relative increase of over 20% in challenging scenarios where true causal variants are sparse and multiple association regions exist at the same time, while maintaining a lower false positive rate.",

We report an experimental ultrafast generation and detection of the coherent amplitude mode (AM) of its CDW state. A salient feature emerges: The coherent CDW mode AM exhibits an unusual T 3.56 temperature dependence below 65 K, in addition to the T 2 temperature dependence observed in the 65 to 200 K range. This behavior suggests the enhancement of in-gap electronic excitations below 65 K and the emergence of a new phase of matter. Consequently, the intriguing quantum state leads to a crossover. Our investigation provides insights into understanding the interplay among various degrees of freedom in quantum materials.",

          "authors": "Spencer P. Alliston, Chris Dames, Matthew J. Powell-Palm",
          "abstract": "Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid–solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entropic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59% (to 5.6 K), eutectic temperature by 45% (to 9.7 K), and eutectic composition by 43% (to 4.7 mol%), as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that, for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.",

          "abstract": "Scaffold proteins are key players in many signaling pathways where they ensure spatial and temporal control of molecular interactions by simultaneous tethering of multiple signaling components. The protein JIP1 acts as a scaffold within the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway by assembling three kinases, MLK3, MKK7, and JNK, into a macromolecular complex that enables their specific activation. The recruitment of these kinases depends on the 450-amino acid intrinsically disordered tail of JIP1, however, the structural details of this tail and the molecular mechanisms by which it binds kinases have remained elusive. Here, we provide an atomic resolution structural description of the JIP1 tail, and we study its interaction with the kinase JNK1. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that JNK1 not only engages with the well-known docking site motif (D-motif) of JIP1, but also interacts with a noncanonical F-motif. We determine the crystal structure of the JIP1–JNK1 complex at 2.35 Å resolution revealing a bipartite binding mode of JIP1. Our work provides insights into the sequence determinants of F-motifs suggesting that these motifs may be more prevalent in JNK substrates than previously recognized. More broadly, our study highlights the power of NMR spectroscopy in uncovering kinase interaction motifs within disordered scaffold proteins, and it paves the way for atomic-resolution interaction studies of JIP1 with its multitude of interaction partners.",

          "abstract": "Many insect migrants rely on favorable seasonal winds to carry out long-range latitudinal migrations. In East China, the annual advance and retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon produces ideal conditions for seasonal range expansion and contraction of many migratory crop pests. However, climate-induced changes in the strength, timing, and location of the monsoon are impacting wind systems which may, in turn, affect migration patterns. We investigated these questions in the rice leafroller (RLR) moth, a severe pest of rice that annually invades the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) of China from winter-breeding areas further south. Using a 24-y dataset of RLR population dynamics from 31 monitoring stations across Southeast China, we investigated the impact of changes in monsoon wind regimes on fall migration patterns of the pest. Historically, RLR emigrated from the LYRV to South China on the favorably directed winds produced by the retreat of the monsoon at the end of the outbreak season (from mid-August onward). We show that in the recent 12-y period, prevailing late-season winds remain northward for longer than previously, preventing locally produced moths from emigrating southward. Additionally, winds now facilitate mass late-season immigrations into the LYRV, creating an ecological trap, as immigrants do not have time to produce another generation. As a consequence of the changing wind patterns, pest pressure is declining, and climate-induced changes to the East Asian summer monsoon result in seasonal migration becoming a riskier strategy. Such changes in insect migration patterns have severe implications for the population dynamics of windborne migrants, ecosystem functioning, and pest management strategies.",

          "abstract": "Brain age (BA), distinct from chronological age (CA), can be estimated from MRIs to evaluate neuroanatomic aging in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. BA, however, is a cross-sectional measure that summarizes cumulative neuroanatomic aging since birth. Thus, it conveys poorly recent or contemporaneous aging trends, which can be better quantified by the (temporal) pace P of brain aging. Many approaches to map P , however, rely on quantifying DNA methylation in whole-blood cells, which the blood–brain barrier separates from neural brain cells. We introduce a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) to estimate P noninvasively from longitudinal MRI. Our longitudinal model (LM) is trained on MRIs from 2,055 CN adults, validated in 1,304 CN adults, and further applied to an independent cohort of 104 CN adults and 140 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In its test set, the LM computes P with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16 y (7% mean error). This significantly outperforms the most accurate cross-sectional model, whose MAE of 1.85 y has 83% error. By synergizing the LM with an interpretable CNN saliency approach, we map anatomic variations in regional brain aging rates that differ according to sex, decade of life, and neurocognitive status. LM estimates of P are significantly associated with changes in cognitive functioning across domains. This underscores the LM’s ability to estimate P in a way that captures the relationship between neuroanatomic and neurocognitive aging. This research complements existing strategies for AD risk assessment that estimate individuals’ rates of adverse cognitive change with age.",

High-confidence manually curated datasets of bicistronic loci from two divergent green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Auxenochlorella protothecoides , revealed a preference for weak Kozak-like sequences for ORF 1 and an underrepresentation of potential initiation codons before the ORF 2 start codon, which are suitable conditions for leaky ribosome scanning to allow ORF 2 translation. We used mutational analysis in A. protothecoides to test the mechanism. In vivo manipulation of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence and start codon altered reporter expression at ORF 2, with a weaker Kozak-like sequence enhancing expression and a stronger one diminishing it. A synthetic bicistronic dual reporter demonstrated inversely adjustable activity of green fluorescent protein expressed from ORF 1 and luciferase from ORF 2, depending on the strength of the ORF 1 Kozak-like sequence. Our findings demonstrate that translation of multiple ORFs in green algal bicistronic transcripts is consistent with episodic leaky scanning of ORF 1 to allow translation at ORF 2. This work has implications for the potential functionality of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) found across eukaryotic genomes and for transgene expression in synthetic biology applications.",

While surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy delays disease progression, these treatments do not lead to tumor control, and targeted therapies or biologics have failed to further improve survival. Utilizing a transient radiation-induced state of multipotency, we used the adenylcyclase activator forskolin to alter the fate of irradiated glioma cells. The effects of the combined treatment on neuronal marker expression, cell cycle distribution, and proliferation were studied. Gene expression profiling was conducted using bulk RNA-seq. Changes in cell populations were investigated using single-cell RNA-seq. Effects on glioma stem cells (GSCs) were studied in extreme limiting dilution assays, and the effects on median survival were studied in both syngeneic and PDOX mouse models of GBM. The combined treatment induced the expression of neuronal markers in glioma cells, reduced proliferation, and led to a distinct gene expression profile. scRNA-seq revealed that the combined treatment forced glioma cells into a microglia- and neuron-like phenotype. In vivo, this treatment led to a loss of GSCs and prolonged median survival. Collectively, our data suggest that revisiting a differentiation therapy with forskolin in combination with radiation could lead to clinical benefit.",

          "abstract": "Chromatin architecture facilitates accurate transcription at a number of loci, but it remains unclear how much chromatin architecture is involved in global transcriptional regulation. Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture alters global chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multiomics analyses with sorted juvenile postmitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and we identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. CTCF depletion leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (&gt;3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (&gt;27,000 sites) before any prominent cellular or physiological phenotypes arise. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy at euchromatin, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility and frequently inhibits expression of these direct binding targets, which are enriched for binding motifs of transcription repressors. These findings provide different and sometimes opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cellular heterogeneity and cell-type specificity when performing multiomics analyses. CTCF knockout rods undergo complete degeneration by adulthood, indicating an essential role for their viability. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.",

RORγt + DCs entail various populations described in different contexts including Janus cells/RORγt-expressing extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs), subtypes of Thetis cells, RORγt + -DC (R-DC) like cells, cDC2C and ACY3 + DCs. We show that in response to inflammatory triggers, RORγt + DCs can migrate to lymph nodes and in the spleen can activate naïve CD4 + T cells. These findings expand the functional repertoire of RORγt + DCs beyond the known role of eTACs and Thetis cells in inducing T cell tolerance to self-antigens and intestinal microbes in mice. We further show that RORγt + DCs with proinflammatory features accumulate in autoimmune neuroinflammation in mice and men. Thus, our work establishes RORγt + DCs as immune sentinel cells that exhibit a broad functional spectrum ranging from inducing peripheral T cell tolerance to T cell activation depending on signals they integrate from their environment.",

Structural variants (SVs), arising from copy-number-imbalanced and -balanced DNA rearrangements, are a major driver of tumor evolution, yet understudied posttherapy. Here, we adapted single-cell template-strand sequencing (Strand-seq) to a HER2+ breast cancer model to investigate the formation of doxorubicin-induced de novo SVs. We coupled this approach with nucleosome occupancy (NO) measurements obtained from the same single cell to enable simultaneous SV detection and cell-type classification. Using organoids from TetO-CMYC/TetO-Neu/MMTV-rtTA mice modeling HER2+ breast cancer, we generated 459 Strand-seq libraries spanning various tumorigenesis stages, identifying a 7.4-fold increase in large chromosomal alterations post-doxorubicin. Complex DNA rearrangements, deletions, and duplications were prevalent across basal, luminal progenitor (LP), and mature luminal (ML) cells, indicating uniform susceptibility of these cell types to SV formation. Doxorubicin further elevated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), indicative of genomic stress persisting posttreatment. Altered nucleosome occupancy levels on distinct cancer-related genes further underscore the broad genomic impact of doxorubicin. The organoid-based system for single-cell multiomics established in this study paves the way for unraveling the most important therapy-associated SV mutational signatures, enabling systematic studies of the effect of therapy on cancer evolution.",

Here, we determined the spatial localization, protein carriers, and cellular function of O-GalNAc glycans in the mouse brain. We observed striking spatial enrichment of O-GalNAc glycans in neuronal tracts, and specifically at nodes of Ranvier, specialized structures involved in signal propagation in the brain. Glycoproteomic analysis revealed that more than half of the identified O-GalNAc glycans were present on chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans termed lecticans, and display both domain enrichment and regional heterogeneity. Inhibition of O-GalNAc synthesis in neurons reduced binding of Siglec-4, a known regulator of neurite growth, and shortened the length of nodes of Ranvier. This work establishes a function of O-GalNAc glycans in the brain and will inform future studies on their role in development and disease.",

Recently, TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been recognized as the pore-forming subunit of the MT channel, but TMC1/2 functional expression in heterologous cells—which is critical for unequivocally identifying them as the bona fide pore-forming subunit of the MT channel—has not been achieved because ectopic TMC1/2 become trapped in the ER. Here, we report that adding a Fyn lipidation tag to mouse TMC1/2 (mTMC1/2) drove their cell-surface expression, and, importantly, full-length mTMC1/2 expressed alone functioned as mechanosensitive channels, underscoring the view that TMC1/2 constitute the sole pore-forming subunit of the MT channel. Moreover, mouse transmembrane inner ear (TMIE) (mTMIE) protein robustly stimulated TMC1/2 channel activity by modulating their gating. Intriguingly, the N-terminal 27 residues of mTMIE were dispensable for regulating TMC1/2 in our in vitro functional assay, whereas, in striking contrast, mutating mTMIE C76C77, the predicted palmitoylation sites, eliminated mTMIE stimulation of mTMC1/2, indicating a crucial role of the palmitoyl group in regulating TMC1/2 gating. mTMC1/2+mTMIE form 18 pS and 24 pS single channels, respectively. mTMC1/2+mTMIE single channels showed biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to those of the MT channel. Our findings provide insights into several fundamental and debated aspects of the function of TMC1/2 and TMIE, and our functional assay of TMC1/2 and TMIE in heterologous cells will facilitate further functional and structural characterization of these proteins and other MT-complex components.",

          "abstract": "Building differences between genetically equivalent units is a fundamental challenge for all multicellular organisms and superorganisms. In ants, reproductive or worker fate is typically determined during the larval stage, through feeding regimes managed by adult caretakers. However, the feeding care provided to larvae varies significantly across ants, as does phenotypic divergence between queen and worker castes. Here, we employed comparative phylogenetic methods and causal inference to investigate the relationships between larval feeding care, caste size dimorphism, and social complexity across ant diversity. We digitized the life’s work of George and Jeanette Wheeler, cataloging the larval morphology of over 700 species, and we compiled data on species diets and larval feeding behaviors from the literature and our own observations. We measured queen–worker size dimorphism in 392 species and gathered data for colony size, worker polymorphism, and worker reproduction. Our analyses revealed that ancestral active-feeding larvae evolved passive morphologies when adults began feeding them individually, typically with processed material and often following a shift to nonpredatory diets. Greater queen–worker size dimorphism coevolved with larval passiveness, alongside traits indicative of increased social complexity, including larger colony sizes, worker subcastes, and a reduction in workers’ reproductive potential. Likelihood comparisons of causal phylogenetic models support that extended alloparental care facilitated stronger caste dimorphism, which, in turn and along with increased colony sizes, promoted higher social complexity. Our results suggest that enhanced adult control over larval development enabled greater phenotypic specialization within colonies, with profound implications for social evolution.",

The molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from cortical neurogenesis to gliogenesis, and the subsequent fate determination of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons, remain unclear. Here, we report that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a fundamental role in promoting cortical gliogenesis and the generation of Tri-IPCs. Additionally, sonic hedgehog-smoothened-glioma-associated oncogene homolog (SHH-SMO-GLI) activator signaling has an auxiliary function to ERK during these processes. We further demonstrate that, from Tri-IPCs, NOTCH signaling is crucial for the fate determination of astrocytes, while ERK signaling plays a prominent role in oligodendrocyte fate specification, and SHH signaling is required for the fate determination of olfactory bulb interneurons. We provide evidence suggesting that this mechanism is conserved in both mice and humans. Finally, we propose a unifying principle of mammalian cortical gliogenesis.",

To identify molecular defects that take place in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of patients with C9orf72 ALS/FTD, we compared healthy controls with C9orf72 ALS/FTD donor samples staged based on the levels of cortical phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein (pTDP-43), a neuropathological hallmark of disease progression. We identified distinct molecular changes in different cell types that take place during FTD development. Loss of neurosurveillance microglia and activation of the complement cascade take place early, when pTDP-43 aggregates are absent or very low, and become more pronounced in late stages, suggesting an initial involvement of microglia in disease progression. Reduction of layer 2-3 cortical projection neurons with high expression of CUX2/LAMP5 also occurs early, and the reduction becomes more pronounced as pTDP-43 accumulates. Several unique features were observed only in samples with high levels of pTDP-43, including global alteration of chromatin accessibility in oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes; higher ratios of premature oligodendrocytes; increased levels of the noncoding RNA NEAT1 in astrocytes and neurons, and higher amount of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6.

          "abstract": "Proteins and the complexes they form are central to nearly all cellular processes. Their flexibility, expressed through a continuum of states, provides a window into their biological functions. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an ideal tool to study these dynamic states as it captures specimens in noncrystalline conditions and enables high-resolution reconstructions. However, analyzing the heterogeneous distributions of conformations from cryo-EM data is challenging. We present RECOVAR, a method for analyzing these distributions based on principal component analysis (PCA) computed using a REgularized COVARiance estimator. RECOVAR is fast, robust, interpretable, expressive, and competitive with state-of-the-art neural network methods on heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets. The regularized covariance method efficiently computes a large number of high-resolution principal components that can encode rich heterogeneous distributions of conformations and does so robustly thanks to an automatic regularization scheme. The reconstruction method based on adaptive kernel regression resolves conformational states to a higher resolution than all other tested methods on extensive independent benchmarks while remaining highly interpretable. Additionally, we exploit favorable properties of the PCA embedding to estimate the conformational density accurately. This density allows for better interpretability of the latent space by identifying stable states and low free-energy motions. Finally, we present a scheme to navigate the high-dimensional latent space by automatically identifying these low free-energy trajectories.

We took inspiration from a sequence-specific, covalent protein–DNA conjugation method based on the Rep nickase of a porcine circovirus called “HUH tag”. Though wild-type HUH protein has no detectable activity toward an RNA probe, we engineered an RNA-reactive variant, called “rHUH”, through 7 generations of yeast display–based directed evolution. Our 13.4 kD rHUH has 12 mutations relative to HUH and forms a covalent tyrosine-phosphate ester linkage with a 10-nucleotide RNA recognition sequence (“rRS”) within minutes. We engineered the sensitivity down to 1 nM of target RNA, shifted the metal ion requirement from Mn 2+ toward Mg 2+ , and demonstrated efficient labeling in mammalian cell lysate. This work paves the way toward a potentially powerful methodology for sequence-specific covalent protein–RNA conjugation in biological systems.",

Heme and nonheme S=1 Fe IV =O sites have been synthesized and studied for decades but little quantitative experimental comparison of their electronic structures has been available, due to the lack of direct methods focused on the iron. This study allows a rigorous determination of the electronic structure of a nonheme Fe IV =O center and its comparison to an Fe IV =O heme site using 1s2p resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) and Fe L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Further, variable temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT-MCD) of the ligand field transitions, combined with nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy of the two S=1 Fe IV =O systems show that the equatorial ligand field decreases from a nonheme to a heme Fe IV =O site. Alternatively, RIXS and Fe L-edge XAS combined with MCD show that the Fe d π orbitals are unperturbed in the Fe IV =O heme relative to the nonheme site because the strong axial Fe-O bond uncouples the Fe d π orbitals from the porphyrin π -system. As a consequence, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the H-atom abstraction reactions are actually very similar for heme compound II and nonheme Fe IV =O active sites.",

          "abstract": "A key limitation of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapy is their reduced efficacy toward cancers with a low tumor mutational burden (TMB). Since low-TMB tumors express fewer neoantigens, they are less responsive to ICI therapy like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4. In preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of low-TMB melanoma, we recently demonstrated that exposure to 6-thioguanine (6TG) significantly improved tumor control by increasing TMB and creating a proinflammatory tumor microenvironment. The combination of 6TG with anti-PD-1 further improved tumor control, although it did not fully inhibit tumor growth. We here investigated additional ICI combinations, assessing anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-1 to improve efficacy. ICI eliminated tumors in 6TG-exposed mice when ICI treatment was initiated at tumor volumes of 20 mm 3 , stopped tumor growth at volumes of 120 mm 3 , and had no effect at volumes of 300 mm 3 . Finally, we showed that mice achieving complete tumor regression with 6TG and ICI treatment exhibited lasting immune memory, which effectively suppressed tumor growth at relapse upon re-exposure to tumor cells. These findings may pave the way to effective application of ICI to low-TMB cancers, when initiated at low tumor volume.",

          "abstract": "Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species—a phenomenon known as Peto’s paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto’s paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto’s paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses.",

          "abstract": "Successful tuberculosis therapy requires treatment with an unwieldy multidrug combination for several months. Thus, there is a growing need to identify novel genetic vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to develop new, more effective antitubercular drugs. Consequently, recent efforts to optimize tuberculosis (TB) therapy have exploited Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) chemical genetics to identify pathways influencing antibiotic efficacy, novel mechanisms of antibiotic action, and new targets for TB drug discovery. However, the influence of the complex host environment on these interactions remains largely unknown, leaving the therapeutic potential of the identified targets unclear. In this study, we leveraged a library of conditional mutants targeting 467 essential Mtb genes to characterize the chemical–genetic interactions (CGIs) with TB drugs directly in the mouse infection model. We found that these in vivo CGIs differ significantly from those identified in vitro. Both drug-specific and drug-agnostic effects were identified, and many were preserved during treatment with a multidrug combination, suggesting numerous strategies for enhancing therapy. This work also elucidated the complex effects of pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that relies on aspects of the infection environment for efficacy. Specifically, our work supports the importance of coenzyme A synthesis- inhibition during infection, as well as the antagonistic effect of iron limitation on PZA activity. In addition, we found that inhibition of thiamine and purine synthesis increases PZA efficacy, suggesting additional therapeutically exploitable metabolic dependencies. Our findings present a map of the unique in vivo CGIs, characterizing the mechanism of PZA activity in vivo and identifying potential targets for TB drug development.",

We modeled the causal effects of climate on annual lake chlorophyll (a measure of algal biomass) over 34 y for 24,452 lakes across broad ecoclimatic zones of the United States and evaluated the potential for regime shifts. We found that algal biomass was causally related to climate in 34% of lakes. In these cases, 71% exhibited abrupt but mostly temporary shifts as opposed to persistent changes, 13% had the potential for regime shifts. Climate was causally related to algal biomass in lakes experiencing all levels of human disturbance, but with different likelihood. Climate causality was most likely to be observed in lakes with minimal human disturbance and cooler summer temperatures that have increased over the 34 y studied. Climate causality was variable in lakes with low to moderate human disturbance, and least likely in lakes with high human disturbance, which may mask climate causality. Our results explain some of the previously observed heterogeneous climate responses of lake algal biomass globally and they can be used to predict future climate effects on lakes.",

          "abstract": "Analyzing cardiac pulse waveforms offers valuable insights into heart health and cardiovascular disease risk, although obtaining the more informative measurements from the central aorta remains challenging due to their invasive nature and limited noninvasive options. To address this, we employed a laboratory-developed cuff device for high-resolution pulse waveform acquisition and constructed a spectral machine learning model to nonlinearly map the brachial wave components to the aortic site. Simultaneous invasive aortic catheter and brachial cuff waveforms were acquired in 115 subjects to evaluate the clinical performance of the developed wave-based approach. Magnitude, shape, and pulse waveform analysis on the measured and reconstructed aortic waveforms were correlated on a beat-to-beat basis. The proposed cuff-based method reconstructed aortic waveform contours with high fidelity (mean normalized-RMS error = 11.3%). Furthermore, continuous signal reconstruction captured dynamic aortic systolic blood pressure (BP) oscillations (r = 0.76, P &lt; 0.05). Method-derived central pressures showed strong correlation with the independent invasive measurement for systolic BP (R 2 = 0.83; B [LOA] = −0.3 [−17.0, 16.4] mmHg) and diastolic BP (R 2 = 0.58; B [LOA] = −0.7 [−13.1, 11.6] mmHg). Shape-based features are effectively captured by the spectral machine learning method, showing strong correlations and no systemic bias for systolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.05), diastolic pressure–time integral (r = 0.95, P &lt; 0.05), and subendocardial viability ratio (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the nonlinear transformation of wave components from the distal to the central site predicts the morphological waveform changes resulting from complex wave propagation and reflection within the cardiovascular network. The proposed wave-based approach holds promise for future applications of noninvasive devices in clinical cardiology.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity in sensory cortex is modulated by behavioral and cognitive factors, and this modulation is thought to contribute to the selection of specific sensory information needed to achieve behavioral goals. In contrast, more abstract behavioral variables that are independent of stimulus selection, such as stimulus–response mapping, are thought to be encoded by neurons outside of sensory cortex. We show that information about such mapping is robustly encoded in the responses of neurons in primate visual cortex. Monkeys were trained to alternate between two tasks that differed in the rule governing the mapping of a remembered visual cue onto an eye movement response. During the memory-delay period, neurons in area V4 reliably signaled the remembered cue location in both tasks. However, the encoding of cue location depended critically on the stimulus–response mapping rule. Thus, V4 delay activity encoded the mapping rule and signaled the preparation of the appropriate motor response rather than spatial working memory per se, contrary to previous assumptions. In addition, we probed the origins of motor-related delay activity and found that it was reduced during local inactivation of the frontal eye field (FEF). The results demonstrate that behavioral modulation of visual cortical activity is not solely related to the selection of sensory stimuli but instead reflects a distinct mechanism for sensory-guided motor output.",

          "abstract": "The Huns appeared in Europe in the 370s, establishing an Empire that reshaped West Eurasian history. Yet until today their origins remain a matter of extensive debate. Traditional theories link them to the Xiongnu, the founders of the first nomadic empire of the Mongolian steppe. The Xiongnu empire dissolved, however, ~300 y before the Huns appeared in Europe, and there is little archaeological and historical evidence of Huns in the steppe during this time gap. Furthermore, despite the rich 5th to 6th centuries current era (CE) archaeological record of the Carpathian Basin, the cultural elements of connections with the steppe are limited to few findings and even fewer solitary eastern-type burials. In this study, we coanalyze archaeological evidence with 35 newly sequenced and published genomic data for a total of 370 individuals—from 5th to 6th century CE contexts in the Carpathian Basin including 10 Hun-period eastern-type burials, 2nd to 5th century sites across Central Asia and 2nd c. before current era (BCE) to 1st c. CE Xiongnu period sites across the Mongolian steppe. We find no evidence for the presence of a large eastern/steppe descent community among the Hun- and post-Hun-period Carpathian Basin population. We also observe a high genetic diversity among the eastern-type burials that recapitulates the variability observed across the Eurasian Steppe. This suggests a mixed origin of the incoming steppe conquerors. Nevertheless, long-shared genomic tracts provide compelling evidence of genetic lineages directly connecting some individuals of the highest Xiongnu-period elite with 5th to 6th century CE Carpathian Basin individuals, showing that some European Huns descended from them.",

However, this process requires materials with exceptional selectivity and capacity for REEs due to their low concentration and high presence of interfering ions. Herein, we synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and subsequently modified it with tributyl phosphate (TBP) to enhance its affinity and selectivity for the recovery of REEs. The distribution coefficients ( K d ) of ZIF-8-TBP for REEs (neodymium, Nd, and dysprosium, Dy) were orders of magnitude higher than the K d of main interfering ions (e.g., Mg, Ni Al, and Fe). Particularly, the maximum sorption capacities ( q m ) for Nd and Dy were 475 and 529 mg g −1 , respectively. In addition, the separation factor between Dy (a representative of heavy REE) and Nd (a representative of light REE) reached 24, greatly exceeding the figures reported previously. Importantly, the outstanding ability of ZIF-8-TBP for selective separation and recovery of REEs was demonstrated via its application to real samples including mining wastewater, and leaching solutions from REE filter cakes and discarded NdFeB magnets. Multiscale simulations reveal that ZIF-8-TBP possessed a stronger binding strength and greater sorption energy for REE ions. These results indicate that ZIF-8-TBP could effectively harvest REEs from wastes and offers an efficient alternative for industrial applications in REE recovery.",

The consistent dip inclinations, absence of dissection by fluvial channels along the extended traverse, and low permittivity of the sediments are consistent with terrestrial coastal deposits—and discount fluvial, aeolian, or magmatic origins favored elsewhere on Mars. The structure, thickness, and length of the section support voluminous supply of onshore sediments into a large body of water, rather than a merely localized and short-lived melt event.

Moreover, the steroid hormone ecdysone, which is mainly synthesized in the female ovary during sexual maturation, acts on LK neurons via the ecdysone receptor to suppress sexual receptivity. We further found that LK suppresses female receptivity through its receptor LKR in central pC1 neurons, a decision center for female sexual behavior.

This allows us to directly visualize the spatial variations in density, orientational order, and the entanglement, a mesoscopic field that we define in terms of a local average crossing number, a measure of the topological complexity of the packing. We find that increasing the aspect ratio of the constituent rods in a packing leads to a proliferation of regions of strong entanglement that eventually percolate through the system and correlated with a sharp transition in the mechanical stability of the packing. To corroborate our experimental findings, we use numerical simulations of contacting elastic rods and characterize their stability to static and dynamic loadings. Our experiments and computations lead us to an entanglement phase diagram which we also populate using published experimental data from pneumatically tangled filaments, worm blobs, and bird nests along with additional numerical simulations using these datasets. Together, these show the regimes associated with mechanically stable entanglement as a function of the statistics of the packings and loading, with lessons for a range of systems from reconfigurable architectures and textiles to active morphable filamentous assemblies.",

          "abstract": "The cGAS–STING pathway mediates innate immune responses to cytosolic DNA. In addition to its well-established role in inducing inflammatory cytokines, activation of the cGAS–STING pathway also induces noncanonical autophagy, a process involving the conjugation of the ATG8 family of ubiquitin-like proteins to membranes of the endolysosomal system. The mechanisms and functions of STING-induced autophagy remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that STING activation induced formation of pH-elevated Golgi-derived vesicles that led to ATG16L1 and V-ATPase-dependent noncanonical autophagy. We showed that STING-induced noncanonical autophagy resulted in activation of the MiT/TFE family of transcription factors (TFEB, TFE3, and MITF), which regulate lysosome biogenesis. We found that lipidation of the ATG8 proteins, particularly GABARAPs, inhibited phosphorylation of MiT/TFE transcription factors by mTORC1. The lipidated GABARAPs bound to the Folliculin-interacting proteins (FNIPs), thereby sequestering the FNIP-folliculin protein complexes from activating mTORC1, resulting in dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MiT/TFE transcription factors. Furthermore, we found that STING-induced autophagy activated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein implicated in Parkinson’s disease, through GABARAPs lipidation. We further showed that STING-induced autophagy induced ALIX-mediated ESCRT machinery recruitment to mitigate endolysosomal perturbation. These results reveal the multifaceted functions of STING-induced noncanonical autophagy in regulating endolysosomal homeostasis.",

RBPMS promotes contractile VSMC differentiation, reduces plaque cap development in high-fat diet-fed apolipoprotein E-null ( ApoE −/− ) murine atherosclerotic arteries, and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. Mechanistically, the RBPMS protein interacts with the myocardin ( MYOCD ) pre-mRNA and enhances MYOCD_v3 / MYOCD_v1 transcript balance through alternative exon 2a splicing. RBPMS promotes the VSMC contractile phenotype and reduces their fibroproliferative activity in a MYOCD_v3a-dependent manner. RBPMS enhances Myocd_v3 / Myocd_v1 transcript balance in both atherosclerotic and injured vessels. RBPMS may inhibit VSMC-driven plaque cap development and intervention-induced restenosis.",

          "abstract": "The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media suffers from sluggish kinetics, primarily due to the spin-dependent electron transfer involved. The direct generation of spin-polarized electrons at catalytic surfaces remains elusive, and the underlying mechanisms are still controversial due to the lack of intrinsically chiral catalysts. To address this challenge, we investigate topological homochiral PdGa (TH PdGa) crystals with intrinsically chiral catalytic surfaces for ORR. Through spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, we show that both structural chirality and spin–orbit coupling are critical for inducing spin polarization at the surface of TH PdGa. As a result, TH PdGa achieves a kinetic current density over 100 times higher than the achiral PdGa (AC PdGa) at 0.85 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. This work underscores the pivotal role of spin polarization in enhancing acidic ORR activity and lays the groundwork for the rational design of chiral catalysts for spin-dependent catalysis.",

          "abstract": "DNA is heterogeneously packaged into chromatin, which is further organized into topologically associating domains (TADs) with sharp boundaries. These boundary locations are critical for genome regulation. Here, we explore how the distribution of DNA-packing density across chromatin affects the TAD boundary locations. We develop a polymer-physics-based model that utilizes DNA accessibility data to parameterize DNA-packing density along chromosomes, treating them as heteropolymers, and simulates the stochastic folding of these heteropolymers within a nucleus to yield a conformation ensemble. Such an ensemble reproduces a subset (over 60%) of TAD boundaries across the human genome, as confirmed by Hi-C data. Additionally, it reproduces the spatial distance matrices of 2-Mb genomic regions provided by FISH experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that utilizing DNA accessibility data alone as input is sufficient to predict the emergence and disappearance of key TADs during early T cell differentiation. We show that stochastic folding of heteropolymers in a confined space can replicate both the prevalence of chromatin domain structures and the cell-to-cell variation in domain boundary positions observed in single-cell experiments. Furthermore, regions of lower DNA-packing density preferentially form domain boundaries, and this preference drives the emergence of TAD boundaries observed in ensemble-averaged Hi-C maps. The enrichment of TAD boundaries at CTCF binding sites can be attributed to the influence of CTCF binding on local DNA-packing density in our model. Collectively, our findings establish a strong link between TAD boundaries and regions of lower DNA-packing density, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying TAD formation.",

          "abstract": "The experience of human parenthood is near ubiquitous and can profoundly alter one’s body, mind, and environment. However, we know very little about the long-term neural effects of parenthood for parents themselves, or the implications of pregnancy and caregiving experience on the aging adult brain. Here, we investigate the link between the number of children parented and age on brain function in 19,964 females and 17,607 males from the UK Biobank. In both females and males, parenthood was positively correlated with functional connectivity, such that higher number of children parented was associated with higher connectivity, particularly within the somato/motor network. Critically, the spatial topography of parenthood-linked effects was inversely correlated with the impact of age on functional connectivity across the brain for both females and males, such that the connections that were positively correlated with number of children were negatively correlated with age. This result suggests that a higher number of children is associated with patterns of brain function in the opposite direction to age-related alterations. Overall, these results indicate that the changes accompanying parenthood may confer benefits to brain health across the lifespan, altering aging trajectories, consistent with animal models of parenthood and preliminary findings of “younger-looking” brain structure in human parents. Observing this effect in both females and males implicates the caregiving environment, rather than pregnancy alone, and highlights the importance of future work to disentangle the underlying mechanisms related to the direct impact of caregiving, the indirect impact of the environment, and the result of covarying sociodemographic factors.",

          "abstract": "Humans often take actions to assist others experiencing unresponsiveness, such as transient loss of consciousness. How other animals react to unresponsive conspecifics—and the neural mechanisms driving such behaviors—remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrated that mice exhibit rescue-like social behaviors toward unresponsive conspecifics, characterized by intense physical contact and grooming directed at the recipient’s facial and mouth areas, which expedite their recovery from unresponsiveness. We identified the medial amygdala (MeA) as a key region that encodes the unresponsive state of others and drives this head-directed physical contact. Notably, the behavioral responses toward unresponsive conspecifics differed from those directed at awake, stressed individuals, and these responses were differentially represented in the MeA. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying prosocial responses toward unresponsive individuals.",

At the same time, quantum computing likely will not supplant classical computing in the foreseeable future—after all, quantum computing architectures are best equipped to solve certain problems, but not every problem. Quantum computers almost certainly will work in concert with classical processing, where each computing architecture will handle those parts of a calculation that it is best suited to tackle. For that to happen, the quantum computing hardware will require software that combines quantum with classical computing. It also must be devised in a user-friendly way so that nonquantum scientists and software developers working on problems such as modeling molecules with unprecedented accuracy and calculating interesting properties of structured datasets can run quantum computational tasks without having in-depth knowledge of quantum computing.",

On the Greenland ice sheet, borehole fiber-optic observations revealed a brittle deformation mode that is incompatible with viscous flow, over length scales similar to the resolution of modern ice sheet models: englacial ice quake cascades that are unobservable at the surface. Nucleating near volcanism-related impurities that promote grain boundary cracking, the ice quake cascades appear as a macroscopic form of crystal-scale wild plasticity. A conservative estimate indicates that seismic cascades are likely to produce strain rates that are comparable in amplitude with those measured geodetically, providing a plausible missing link between current ice sheet models and observations.",

We report that mice exhibit stereotypic behaviors toward unconscious or dead social partners, which escalate from sniffing and grooming to more forceful actions such as mouth or tongue biting and tongue pulling. The latter intense actions, more prominent in familiar pairs, begin after prolonged immobility and unresponsiveness and cease when the partner regains activity. Their consequences, including improved airway opening and clearance and accelerated recovery from unconsciousness, suggest rescue-like efforts. Oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus respond differentially to the presence of unconscious versus active partners, and their activation, along with oxytocin signaling, is required for the reviving-like actions. This tendency to assist unresponsive members may enhance group cohesion and survival of social species.",

Promoters such as cesium, rhenium, and molybdenum each add a few percent of selectivity enhancements to achieve 90% overall, but their codependence on Cl makes optimizing and understanding their function complex. We took a theory-guided, single-atom alloy approach to identify nickel (Ni) as a dopant in Ag that can facilitate selective oxidation by activating molecular oxygen (O 2 ) without binding oxygen (O) too strongly. Surface science experiments confirmed the facile adsorption/desorption of O 2 on NiAg, as well as demonstrating that Ni serves to stabilize unselective nucleophilic oxygen. Supported Ag catalyst studies revealed that the addition of Ni in a 1:200 Ni to Ag atomic ratio provides a ~25% selectivity increase without the need for Cl co-flow and acts cooperatively with Cl, resulting in a further 10% initial increase in selectivity.",

Using high-speed x-ray imaging, we demonstrate that the flow vortex–induced protrusion on the rear keyhole wall is crucial in initiating keyhole instability. Applying a transverse magnetic field suppresses the keyhole instability by driving a secondary thermoelectric magnetohydrodynamics (TEMHD) flow that alters the net flow vortex. This minimizes protrusions and large-amplitude keyhole oscillations. The suppression effectiveness depends on the laser scanning direction relative to the magnetic field orientation because this controls the Seebeck effect–induced Lorentz force’s direction. We show that at LPBF length scales, electromagnetic damping is weak, and for alloys with a large Seebeck coefficient, TEMHD becomes the dominant mechanism controlling flow behind the keyhole.",

Yet, this vision requires a fundamental physical challenge to be overcome: The collective must be strong, to support loads, yet flow, to take new forms. We achieve this in a material-like robotic collective by modulating the interunit tangential forces to control topological rearrangements of units within a tightly packed structure. This allows local control of rigidity transitions between solid and fluid-like states in the collective and enables spatiotemporal control of shape and strength. We demonstrate structure-forming and healing and show the collective supporting 700 newtons (500 times the weight of a robot) before “melting” under its own weight.",

          "abstract": "Evolvability—the capacity to generate adaptive variation—is a trait that can itself evolve through natural selection. However, the idea that mutation can become biased toward adaptive outcomes remains controversial. In this work, we report the evolution of enhanced evolvability through localized hypermutation in experimental populations of bacteria. The evolved mechanism is analogous to the mutation-prone sequences of contingency loci observed in pathogenic bacteria. Central to this outcome was a lineage-level selection process, where success depended on the capacity to evolve between two phenotypic states. Subsequent evolution showed that the hypermutable locus is itself evolvable with respect to alterations in the frequency of environmental change. Lineages with localized hypermutability were more likely to acquire additional adaptive mutations, revealing an unanticipated benefit.",

          "abstract": "Extreme heat is well-documented to adversely affect health and mortality, but its link to biological aging—a precursor of the morbidity and mortality process—remains unclear. This study examines the association between ambient outdoor heat and epigenetic aging in a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 56+ ( N = 3686). The number of heat days in neighborhoods is calculated using the heat index, covering time windows from the day of blood collection to 6 years prior. Multilevel regression models are used to predict PCPhenoAge acceleration, PCGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPACE. More heat days over short- and mid-term windows are associated with increased PCPhenoAge acceleration (e.g., B prior7-dayCaution+heat : 1.07 years). Longer-term heat is associated with all clocks (e.g., B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 2.48 years for PCPhenoAge, B prior1-yearExtremecaution+heat : 1.09 year for PCGrimAge, and B prior6-yearExtremecaution+heat : 0.05 years for DunedinPACE). Subgroup analyses show no strong evidence for increased vulnerability by sociodemographic factors. These findings provide insights into the biological underpinnings linking heat to aging-related morbidity and mortality risks.",

HARMONI operates at subsecond resolution, estimating 3D mesh representations and spatial interactions of humans, and adapts to challenging natural environments using an environment-targeted synthetic data generation module. Deployed on 500 hours from the SEEDLingS dataset, HARMONI generates detailed quantitative measurements of 3D human behavior previously unattainable through manual efforts or 2D methods. HARMONI identifies longitudinal trends in child-caregiver interaction, including child movement, body pose, dyadic touch, visibility, and conversational turns. The integrated visual and audio analysis further reveals multimodal trends, including associations between child conversational turns and movement. Open-sourced for large-scale analysis, HARMONI facilitates advancements in human development research. HARMONI achieves 63 to 80% consistency on key attributes with human annotators on SEEDLingS and 84 to 93% consistency on videos taken from a laboratory setting while achieving &gt;100 times savings in time.",

To model SCCOHTs, we have established eight patient-derived tumoroid lines from tumor lesions of three patients with SCCOHT. The tumoroids recapitulate genomic and transcriptomic characteristics of the corresponding patient tumors and capture intrapatient tumor heterogeneity. Organoid drug profiling using a library of 153 clinical compounds identified methotrexate as an effective and selective drug against SCCOHTs with a clinically relevant IC 50 of 35 nanomolars. RNA sequencing demonstrated that methotrexate induced TP53 pathway activation and apoptosis.

In a liquid crystal (LC), the topological nature of disclination lines and colloids induces chiral colloidal entanglements. How the chirality of the entanglements is deterministically created and how the chirality conversion is actuated in the disclinations with Möbius strip topology have never been explored. Here, we create colloidal entanglements with designed chirality in the nematic disclination loops with Möbius topology. An irreversible process of chirality change is revealed if we move the colloidal entanglement along the loops. A nonreciprocal chirality conversion in the dynamical colloidal entanglements is demonstrated, which is induced by the interplay between topological profiles and the geometrical curvature of the disclination loop. Colloidal entanglements in opposite chirality are templated in arbitrary shapes of disclination lines. This work opens opportunities to design smart colloidal materials.",

The DET1-DDB1-DDA1 (DDD) complex associates with the Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) and a second ubiquitin ligase, COP1, to control ubiquitination of transcription factors involved in neurological, metabolic, and immune cell development. Here, we report the structure of the human DDD complex, revealing a specific segment of DET1 that can recruit ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes. Structural variability analysis, mass spectrometry, and mutagenesis based on AlphaFold predictions suggest that dynamic closure of DET1, stabilized by DDA1, underlies coordinated recruitment of E2 enzymes and COP1. Biochemical assays suggest that the E2 acts as a recruitment factor to bring COP1 to DET1 for more effective substrate ubiquitination, which parallels a catalytically inactive E2 enzyme (COP10) in plant DDD complexes. This work provides a clear architecture for regulation and cooperative CRL4 DET1-COP1 complex assembly, which can affect degradation of diverse targets by COP1 complexes.",

The coherence of interactions is determined by the single-pass atomic absorption and number of photon round-trips. Reducing the cavity loss has enabled resonators supporting 1 million roundtrips but with limited material choices and increased alignment sensitivity. Here, we present a high–numerical aperture, lens-based resonator that pushes the single-atom single-photon absorption probability near its fundamental limit, reducing the mode size at the atom to order λ. This resonator provides a single-atom cooperativity of 1.6 in a cavity where the light circulates ∼10 times. We load single 87 Rb atoms into this cavity, observe strong coupling, and demonstrate cavity-enhanced atom detection with fidelity of 99.55(6)% and survival of 99.89(4)% in 130 μs. Introducing intracavity imaging systems will enable cavity arrays compatible with Rydberg atom array computing technologies, expanding the applicability of the cavity QED toolbox.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) materials are emerging as a promising platform for epitaxial growth, largely free from the constraints of lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient mismatches. Among them, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), known for their superior electrical properties, are ideal for ultrathin semiconductor applications. Their unique epitaxial characteristics enable seamless integration with 3D materials, facilitating the development of gate stacks and heterojunction devices. In this regard, developing a process for growing high-quality 3D epitaxial materials before and after the growth of 2D TMDs and understanding the 2D/3D interface are crucial. This study demonstrates the sequential growth of fully epitaxial ZnSe/MoSe 2 /ZnSe heterostructures using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. ZnSe and MoSe 2 , sharing chalcogen elements, enable large-area quasi van der Waals epitaxy with sharp interfaces without intermediate phase. Multiscale analysis involving transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculation reveals lattice commensurability, van der Waals gaps, termination, and interfacial reconstruction. Understanding these interactions is crucial for advancing multidimensional integration of 2D and 3D materials.",

Corpuscles are composed of a mechanoreceptor afferent surrounded by lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs), enclosed by a multilayered outer core. The spatial arrangement of these components and their contribution to sensory tuning are unclear. We report the three-dimensional architecture of the Pacinian corpuscle and reveal the role of its cellular components in touch detection. In the prevailing model, the outer core acts as a mechanical filter that limits static and low-frequency stimuli from reaching the afferent terminal—the presumed sole site of touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for the sensory tuning to transient touch and vibration; instead, these properties arise from the inner core. By acting as additional touch sensors, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast inactivating ion channels. Thus, functional tuning of the Pacinian corpuscle is enabled by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.",

          "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are a mechanism by which species adapt to environmental variability and fundamental to understanding species behavior. However, we lack data and a standardized framework to accurately assess and compare temporal activity for species during rapid ecological change. Through a global network representing 38 countries, we leveraged 8.9 million mammalian observations to create a library of 14,587 standardized diel activity estimates for 445 species. We found that less than half the species’ estimates were in agreement with diel classifications from the reference literature and that species commonly used more than one diel classification. Species diel activity was highly plastic when exposed to anthropogenic change. Furthermore, body size and distributional extent were strongly associated with whether a species is diurnal or nocturnal. Our findings provide essential knowledge of species behavior in an era of rapid global change and suggest the need for a new, quantitative framework that defines diel activity logically and consistently while capturing species plasticity.",

However, their preparation methods remain a challenge. Here, we develop a gas-solid reactive sintering technique that successfully fabricates a variety of textured lithium ceramics, including electrolyte and electrode materials. These textured lithium ceramic electrolytes exhibit large columnar grains perpendicular to the surface. The textured electrodes indicate an out-of-plane crystallographic texture. As a result, the Li-ion transport pathways across the grain boundary plane are avoided in the textured lithium ceramic with low tortuosity, resulting in great ionic conductivity enhancement by 42 times compared to its traditional equiaxed counterpart. In addition, both Monte Carlo simulation and finite element analysis support the experimental results. This innovative gas-solid reactive sintering technique can extend to prepare various structured and functional ceramics with tailored structures and properties.",

While polaron formation is believed to facilitate efficient carrier transport, the elementary processes of the underlying electron-lattice coupling are yet poorly understood because of the multiscale chemical and structural heterogeneities. Here, we resolve in combined ground- and excited-state spatiospectral ultrafast nanoimaging how structural characteristics are related to both molecular cation and polaron dynamics. We use the observed nanoscale spatial variations of the formamidinium (FA) cation transient vibrational blue shifts as a local probe of the nonlocal polaron-cation coupling. From the correlation with nanomovies of the polaron dynamics, we then infer how a softer more polarizable lattice supports stable polarons and longer-lived residual carriers. This, together with a relative intragrain homogeneity in contrast to high intergrain heterogeneity, suggests pathways for improved synthesis and device engineering, and that perovskite photonics performance is still far from any fundamental limits.",

However, the mechanisms of force generation and transmission remain unclear. We determined the electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the dimeric F 1 -like ATPase complex. The structure revealed an assembly distinct from those of dimeric F 1 F O -ATPases. The F 1 -like ATPase unit associated by two subunits GliD and GliE was named G 1 -ATPase as an R 1 domain of rotary ATPases. G 1 -β subunit, a homolog of the F 1 -ATPase catalytic subunit, exhibited a specific N-terminal region that incorporates the glycolytic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase into the complex. Structural features of the ATPase displayed strong similarities to F 1 -ATPase, suggesting a rotation based on the rotary catalytic mechanism.

Yet, plasticity rules operating on one-shot episodic memory timescales rarely depend on both pre- and postsynaptic spiking, challenging Hebbian theory in this crucial regime. Here, we present an episodic memory model governed by a simpler rule depending only on presynaptic activity. We show that this rule, capitalizing on high-dimensional neural activity with restricted transitions, naturally stores episodes as paths through complex state spaces like those underlying a world model. The resulting memory traces, which we term path vectors, are highly expressive and decodable with an odor-tracking algorithm. We show that path vectors are robust alternatives to Hebbian traces, support one-shot sequential and associative recall, along with policy learning, and shed light on specific hippocampal plasticity rules. Thus, non-Hebbian plasticity is sufficient for flexible memory and learning and well-suited to encode episodes and policies as paths through a world model.",

Projections of how those hazards will change are affected by uncertainties in the climate sensitivity of climate models, among other factors. While the level-of-global-warming approach can circumvent model climate sensitivity uncertainties in some applications, practitioners faced with specific adaptation responsibilities often find such projections difficult to use because they generally require time-oriented information. Earth system projections following specified emissions scenarios can, however, be constrained by applying the level-of-global-warming approach to observationally constrained warming projections to yield more reliable time-oriented projections for adaption planning and implementation. This approach also allows individual groups to produce consistent and comparable assessments of multifaceted climate impacts and causal mechanisms, thereby benefiting climate assessments at national and international levels that provide the science basis for adaptation action.",

Here, we report that during oxidative stress, TDP-43 becomes SUMO2/3-ylated by the SUMO E3 ligase protein PIAS4 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4) and enriches in cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). Upon pharmacological inhibition of TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation or PIAS4 depletion, TDP-43 enrichment in SGs is accompanied by irreversible aggregation. In cells that are unable to assemble SGs, SUMO2/3-ylation of TDP-43 is strongly impaired, supporting the notion that SGs are compartments that promote TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation during oxidative stress. Binding of TDP-43 to UG-rich RNA antagonizes PIAS4-mediated SUMO2/3-ylation, while RNA dissociation promotes TDP-43 SUMO2/3-ylation. We conclude that SUMO2/3 protein conjugation is a cellular mechanism to stabilize cytosolic RNA-free TDP-43 against aggregation.",

Elevated spike-specific IgG4 reduced binding to FcγRIIIa and decreased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, in individuals with lower total spike-specific IgG, IgG4 acted in synergy with other IgG subclasses to improve FcγRI and FcγRIIa binding and consequently antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Furthermore, this trend was more pronounced with more recent SARS-CoV-2 variants where vaccination induced comparably lower total spike-specific titers. These observations were further confirmed by in silico modeling where antibody subclass concentrations and FcγR polymorphisms were modulated. Collectively, we illustrate that the impact of elevated IgG4 titers upon Fc functions is dependent on multiple interconnected antibody and antigen factors, which should be taken into consideration when dissecting the mechanisms driving an effective Fc-mediated response following vaccination.",

Owing to the high Li affinity of Sn single atoms, Sn/CS@SC can promote storage of quasi-metallic Li within the inner void space other than direct plating of metallic Li on the outer surface. Moreover, the subnanopores with a strong spatial confinement effect can prevent the penetration of ester electrolyte for reduced side reactions.

Here, we reveal the meiosis-specific Skp1–Cul1–F-box-protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF RMF as a key regulator of this reorganization in Arabidopsis . We find that the nuclear lamina proteins of the CRWN family are degraded in an SCF RMF -dependent manner in this process.

However, the cause of this trend in the BKS atmospheric circulation remains unknown. Here we show that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary driver of the strengthening of the BKS anticyclonic circulation, with anthropogenic aerosols playing a secondary role, both together accounting for about 86% of the observed circulation trend. Both forcings induce an amplified BKS low-tropospheric warming through coupling with strong sea ice loss. This amplified warming raises geopotential height aloft through thermal expansion, causing an anomalous anticyclonic anomaly, which in turn enhances warming and sea ice loss, forming a positive feedback loop. Our work provides a theoretical framework for understanding Arctic atmospheric circulation responses to anthropogenic warming and may have implications for climate and environment in the Arctic and beyond.",

          "abstract": "This study focuses on the question how and where information acquired by FLS2 perception of flg22 is transformed into electrical signals crucial for generation of local and systemic defense responses. In Arabidopsis thaliana and Vicia faba leaves, FLS2 density was high in the epidermis and vascular parenchyma, low in mesophyll, and absent in sieve elements (SEs). Aequorin-based examinations disclosed dual cytosolic Ca 2+ peaks shortly after flg22 application, which corresponded with two voltage shifts from the epidermis to SEs. These signals were converted into rapid long-range action potentials (APs) or slower short-range variation potentials (VPs). Modified phytohormone-levels demonstrated systemic AP effects. Jasmonic acid up-regulation was significantly higher in wild-type than Atseor1/2 mutants. Abundant Ca 2+ influx associated with VPs was responsible for transient sieve element occlusion (SEO) near the flg22 perception site, whereas SEO was absent in Atseor1/2 and Atfls2 mutants. Biological relevance of SEO was demonstrated by higher susceptibility of Atseor1/2 mutants to Pseudomonas syringae than wild-type plants.",

However, the roles of mechanically heterogeneous primary tumor microenvironment in metastatic organotropism remain an enigma. This study reports that persistent priming in soft but not stiff niches that mimic primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity induces transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of neuron and promotes the acquisition of brain metastatic potential. Soft-primed cells generate brain metastases in vivo through enhanced transendothelial migration across blood-brain barrier and brain colonization, which is further supported by the findings that tumor cells residing in local soft niches of primary xenografts exhibit brain metastatic tropism. Mechanistically, soft niches suppress cytoskeleton-nucleus–mediated mechanotransduction, which promotes histone deacetylase 3 activity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 3 abolishes niche softness-induced brain metastatic ability. Collectively, this study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of local niche softness within primary tumors in brain metastasis, highlighting the significance of primary tumor mechanical heterogeneity in metastatic organotropism.",

They rely on inventories of past landslide locations, which are difficult to collect and often nonrepresentative. Furthermore, susceptibility maps are most needed in regions without the means to assemble an inventory. To overcome these challenges, we develop a method for assessing shallow landslide susceptibility based on a probabilistic morphometric analysis of the landscape’s topography, rather than the characteristics of landslides. The model assumes that hillslopes with higher relief and gradient compared to the surrounding landscape are more prone to landslides. We demonstrate the superior performance of this approach over contrasting data-driven models across the northwestern United States. As our morphometric model only requires elevation data, it overcomes the major limitations of data-driven models and facilitates the creation of effective susceptibility models in areas where it was previously unfeasible.",

Soluble N -ethylmaleimide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins drive vesicle fusion, and SNARE proteins seem to be partially assembled before fusion occurs. However, the molecular mechanisms of the vesicle fusion arrest and how vesicle fusion is rescued from the arrest remain not fully understood. We have previously shown that as a lipid catalyst, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) electrostatically triggers vesicle fusion by lowering the hydration energy, and masking PIP2 arrests vesicle fusion in a state of the partial SNARE assembly. In this study, we show that calmodulin and protein kinase C–epsilon unmask PIP2 through the dissociation of myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate from membranes and, thus, rescue basal fusion and potentiate synaptotagmin-1–mediated Ca 2+ -dependent vesicle fusion.

Fortuitously, we discovered an anoxic deep-sea brine pool sited close enough to shore to chronicle floods, yet be otherwise undisturbed by animals. Cores retrieved from the pool delivered a 1600-year rainfall record. We merge these core-layer histories with modern rainfall statistics, satellite observations, and simulations to deliver a high-resolution quantitative Late Holocene hydroclimate record for Arabia. We find that the modern era is 2.5 times drier than the last 1.6 thousand years. The Little Ice Age stands out as particularly wet. That period experienced a fivefold increase in rainfall intensity compared to today. Though hyperarid now, the flood layers demonstrate that climate shifts can generate weather conditions unwitnessed in the modern era.

This protocol enables the simultaneous transmission of information and key exchange using the same single photons and is robust against loss and error because it uses error correction and spectrum expansion techniques. In a proof-of-principle demonstration using weak coherent pulses, the system achieved a real-time secure transmission rate of 2.38 kilobits per second over a 104.8-kilometer standard telecommunication fiber, which set world records in both aspects.

We apply a statistical physics model—concurrence percolation—to uncover the origin of stronger connectivity on hierarchical scale-free networks, the ( U , V ) flowers. These networks allow full analytical control over path connectivity through two adjustable path-length parameters, ≤ V . This precise control enables us to determine critical exponents well beyond current simulation limits, revealing that classical and concurrence percolations, while both satisfying the hyperscaling relation, fall into distinct universality classes. This distinction arises from how they “superpose” parallel, nonshortest path contributions into overall connectivity. Concurrence percolation, unlike its classical counterpart, is sensitive to nonshortest paths and shows higher resilience to detours as these paths lengthen. This enhanced resilience is also observed in real-world hierarchical, scale-free internet networks. Our findings highlight a crucial principle for QN design: When nonshortest paths are abundant, they notably enhance QN connectivity beyond what is achievable with classical percolation.",

Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridges between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in dense clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by their mutual gravity.

Single-nuclei transcriptomics and FISH studies revealed that GLP-1Rs are expressed primarily on GABA neurons in the VTA. Using in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the efficacy of a systemic GLP-1R agonist to attenuate cocaine seeking was associated with increased activity of VTA GABA neurons and decreased activity of VTA dopamine neurons.

However, recent estimates on younger OJN eruption ages cast doubt on the link between OJN volcanism and OAE1a. Here, we further demonstrate the synchroneity between OJN volcanism and OAE1a by refining the chronology of Pacific volcanogenic sedimentary records on Magellan Rise, nearby OJN, with detailed osmium and carbon isotopic stratigraphy. Our geochemical data reveal that a thick tuffaceous interval at this site was deposited during OAE1a. Furthermore, multisite compilation of osmium isotopes, Pacific volcanic ash beds, and paleontological data just above OJN basalts illustrate that explosive OJN eruptions spanned ~5 million years, peaking around OAE1a. Their synchroneity strongly indicates that OJN volcanism most likely caused OAE1a and relevant late Barremian to mid-Aptian environmental perturbations.",

Directional dichroism is the nonreciprocal phenomenon of light; the light transmittance varies depending on the direction of light propagation. It arises from interference between electromagnetic fields of light, resulting in the nonreciprocal transmittance determined by the resonance light absorption. For the maximum interference, it shows one-way transparency, and achieving this is an outstanding experimental challenge. Concerning energy dispersion, the resonance generally occurs only at a specific energy with a narrow bandwidth. When the excited state of the magnon spontaneously decays into lower energy states, the absorption linewidth gets broader. Here, using electron spin resonance, we identify the specific absorption mode in a multiferroic material Sr 2 CoSi 2 O 7 with the spontaneous magnon decay accompanied by the maximum interference, achieving the broadband one-way transparency.",

In this study, we developed a low-input ac 4 C sequencing technology, ac 4 C LACE-seq, and mapped 8241 ac 4 C peaks at the whole-transcriptome level using 50 mouse oocytes at the germinal vesicle stage. Oocyte-specific Nat10 knockout wiped out ac 4 C signals in oocytes and caused severe defects in meiotic maturation and female infertility. Mechanically, Nat10 deletion led to a failure of ac 4 C deposition on mRNAs encoding key maternal factors, which regulate transcriptome stability and maternal-to-zygotic transition. Nat10 -deleted oocytes showed decreased mRNA translation efficiency due to the direct inhibition of ac 4 C sites on specific transcripts during meiotic maturation. In summary, we developed a low-input, high-sensitivity mRNA ac 4 C profiling approach and highlighted the important physiological function of ac 4 C in the precise regulation of oocyte meiotic maturation by enhancing translation efficiency.",

These cell type–dependent variations in nuclear architecture and chromatin organization exhibit strong correlations with both the total transcriptional activity of the cell and transcriptional regulation of cell type–specific marker genes.

Our results revealed fully quantized rotational states of methane with minimal interference from surrounding H 2 molecules, enabling precise determination of the rotational constant for each hydrogen cluster. The cluster-size dependence of the determined rotational constant aligns with behavior predicted by path-integral Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that more than 60% of the hydrogen molecules in the clusters participate in quantum bosonic exchanges, a characteristic feature of superfluidity.

By engineering a resonance at the pump wavelength and leveraging the field enhancement provided by the ENZ effect, the photon pair generation efficiency of the 68-nanometer-thick metasurface is substantially boosted compared to that of an unpatterned indium tin oxide film. More notably, the ENZ metasurface platform facilitates versatile manipulation of the system’s anisotropic second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, enabling direct control over the polarization states of the photon pairs and generating a polarization-entangled Bell state without additional components.

To tackle these, a circular RNA (cRNA)–based IL-2 therapy using immunomodulatory lipid nanoparticles [ursodeoxycholic acid lipid nanoparticles (ULNPs)] and sustained-release hydrogel was developed. Fusing fragment crystallizable (Fc) region into IL-2 and encoding this fusion protein IL-2-Fc (IL-2F) in cRNA (cRNA IL-2F ) greatly extend the half-life. ULNPs containing ursodeoxycholic acid, a transforming growth factor-β1 inhibitor, suppress the function of T reg cells. Consequently, the ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F formulation promotes CD8 + T cells and suppresses T reg cells, increasing the CD8 + /T reg ratio for effective immunotherapy. Furthermore, a locally administrated hydrogel loading with ULNPs-cRNA IL-2F sustains the release, enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity. This innovative approach achieves remarkable tumor inhibition in both melanoma and orthotopic glioma models with or without surgery, offering a promising future for cancer immunotherapy.",

Crucially, the canonical ultrastructure of the synaptonemal complex is altered upon weakening this interface using charge-reversal mutations. We developed a thermodynamic model that recapitulates our experimental observations, indicating that the liquid-like central region can assemble by wetting the axes without active energy consumption.

Our present cryo-EM analysis of Aquifex aeolicus RseP ( Aa RseP) revealed that a substrate-like membrane protein fragment from the expression host occupied the active site while spanning a transmembrane cavity that is inaccessible via lateral diffusion. Furthermore, in vivo photocrosslinking supported that this substrate accommodation mode is recapitulated on the cell membrane.

Here, we demonstrate a conceptually unique thermal diffusivity microscope capable of performing high-resolution local measurements of anisotropic thermal diffusivity. The microscope features a unique micro four-point probe for fast, nondestructive scanning without calibration or extra sample preparation.

We integrated three pigment types into a global ecosystem model: a green-light specialist, a blue-light specialist, and a chromatic acclimator. Laboratory studies defined each type’s specific absorption properties. Our results indicate that chromatic acclimation offers an evolutionary advantage by enabling Synechococcus to adapt to varying light environments. This ability to mimic blue- and green-light specialists and enhance absorption at intermediate states, particularly in areas with high seasonal light variations, increases Synechococcus distribution and biomass.

Here, we demonstrate that Wnt signaling affects mechanosensitivity at both cellular and tissue levels to drive WIHN. Atomic force microscopy revealed an attenuated substrate rigidity response in epidermal but not dermal cells of healing wounds. Super-resolution microscopy and nanoneedle probing of intracellular compartments in live human keratinocytes revealed that Wnt-induced chromatin remodeling triggers a 10-fold drop in nuclear rigidity without jeopardizing the nucleocytoskeletal mechanical coupling. Mechanistically, Wnt signaling orchestrated a massive reorganization of actin architecture and recruited adherens junctions to generate a mechanical syncytium—a cohesive contractile unit with superior capacity for force coordination and collective durotaxis.

Previous estimates on internal tides focused regionally spanning a decade, leaving a knowledge gap regarding their long-term global behavior, especially over centuries. Because of limited long-term observations, a critical question arises: How will global warming affect internal tides? Using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the High-Resolution Empirical Tidal (HRET) model, we identify a robust accelerating trend in globally averaged internal tide speeds. This trend, increasing from historical rates (0.4 centimeters per second per decade) to future projections (2.0 centimeters per second per decade), is primarily driven by intensified upper-ocean stratification, with background currents playing a secondary role. Our findings suggest that internal tides propagate faster in a warming climate, potentially influencing energy cascade and marine biological productivity.",

Here, we introduce an approach that selectively excites NMR resonances that undergo chemical exchange while suppressing the signal arising from nondynamic components of the system. We show that for exchange rates spanning more than four orders of magnitude, one can still selectively excite spins undergoing exchange while suppressing static resonances. Generalizing this approach, to selectively excite (or selectively preserve) only members of an ensemble that have undergone exchange or rearrangement, has the potential to improve the analytical power of many spectroscopic techniques.",

Disrupting histone recycling to either the leading or lagging strand induces asymmetric histone inheritance, affecting epigenome maintenance and cellular identity. However, the order and kinetics of these effects remain elusive. Here, we use inducible mutants to dissect the early and late consequences of impaired histone recycling. Simultaneous disruption of both leading (POLE4) and lagging strand (MCM2-2A) recycling pathways impairs the transmission of parental histones to newly synthesized DNA, releasing some parental histones to the soluble pool. Subsequently, H3K27me3 accumulates aberrantly during chromatin restoration in a manner preceding gene expression changes. Loss of histone inheritance and the ensuing chromatin restoration defects alter gene expression in embryonic stem cells and challenge differentiation programs and cell viability.

          "abstract": "Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) usually lead to significantly improved clinical benefits in immunotherapy but are rarely observed within native tumors. The current approaches are difficult in effectively inducing TLS formation, let alone fully exploiting its anticancer efficacy. Here, a biomimetic nanovesicle (ADU-S@M1) is constructed to target tumors and then to produce abundant activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in situ by polarizing the tumor-associated macrophages toward M1 phenotype and promoting dendritic cell maturation. These activated APCs effectively initiate the TLS de novo neogenesis by acting as lymphoid tissue inducer cells that secrete lymphotoxin α and tumor necrosis factor α while normalizing the intratumoral vasculatures. In addition, they induce robust in situ adaptive immune responses by presenting the antigens released from the M1 cell–destroyed tumors and transporting them to the nearby TLS. Therefore, the development of tumors in mice, especially immune-cold tumors, was efficiently prevented, providing a promising strategy for promoting cancer immunotherapy.",

A promising mechanism for large-scale natural H 2 generation is serpentinization of exhumed mantle material. We study this serpentinization-related H 2 generation during rifting and subsequent rift-inversion orogen development using numerical geodynamic models. Serpentinization-related H 2 generation is best known from rifted margins and spreading ridges. However, because orogens are colder than rift environments, conditions for serpentinization and natural H 2 generation are considerably better in orogenic settings: We find that yearly H 2 generation capacity from serpentinization in the overriding mantle wedge during rift inversion may be up to 20 times larger than during rifting. Moreover, suitable reservoirs and seals required for economic H 2 accumulations to form are readily available in rift-inversion orogens but are likely absent during bulk serpentinization in rift settings. Together with indications of ongoing natural H 2 generation in the Balkans and Pyrenees, our model results provide a first-order motivation for natural H 2 exploration in rift-inversion orogens.",

Herein, we show that TPE-Gal, which contains a tetraphenylethene unit and a galactose moiety, offers a promising molecular therapy designed to light up and eliminate senescent cells through a hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by β-galactosidase, an enzyme overexpressed in senescent cells. The reaction produces TPE-OH, which, in turn, increases reactive oxygen species levels within the senescent cells, leading to noninflammatory apoptosis of senescent cells. This targeted clearance mechanism helps to alleviate osteoporosis symptoms and promotes bone injury healing. Moreover, apoptotic vesicles, which are generated during the process, are partly phagocytosed by macrophages, mimicking physiological metabolic processes. This study opens new avenues for addressing bone health issues through the designed bioclearance of senescent cells, aligning with the body’s natural pathways for maintaining homeostasis.",

In the oceans, cyanobacterial diazotrophs, mostly prevalent in warm tropical and subtropical waters, were traditionally considered the sole contributors to marine N 2 fixation. Recently, an almost ubiquitous distribution of N 2 -fixing heterotrophic bacteria has been discovered in the pelagic ocean. However, the mechanisms enabling heterotrophic diazotrophs to thrive in cold high-latitude waters and their contribution to the global nitrogen budget are unknown. Using a data-driven cell-based metabolic model, we show that heterotrophic bacteria inside sinking particles can fix N 2 over a wide range of temperatures, explaining their ubiquitous presence in the oceans. We estimate that heterotrophic diazotrophs account for about 10% of global marine N 2 fixation, with the highest contribution in oxygen minimum zones.

The MoS 2 channel was squeezed within a distributed Bragg reflector microcavity which was combined with a transparent graphene gate-electrode and a hexagonal boron nitride insulator. We observe trion polaritons with distinct lower polariton branch (LPB) and upper polariton branch (UPB). This allows us to modulate the intensity and energy switchings via gate bias: At gate bias below threshold voltage, both polaritons are decoupled, and above threshold voltage, they are coupled to form LPB-UPB pair, and at high bias, complex polaritons (CPB) emerge due to polariton screening, a phenomenon consistent with Rabi splitting. Further, we observe a peculiar nonlinearity at intermediate power regime.",

We show that large closed-basin lakes can combine high P concentrations at steady state with extremely high rates of biological productivity. Our case study is Mono Lake in California, which has close to 1 millimolar dissolved P at steady state despite extremely high rates of biological productivity, in contrast to smaller closed basins where life is scarce. Hence, large closed-basin lakes offer an environment where high rates of prebiotic P productivity can plausibly coexist with high steady-state P concentrations. Such lakes should have readily formed on the heavily cratered and volcanically active surface of early Earth.",

Here, we unveil a single-protein mechanism for ionic strength sensing and mitigation in animal cells, one that is notably different from the analogous high osmolarity glycerol kinase cascade in yeast. The Rel family transcription factor NFAT5 directly senses intracellular ionic strength using a C-terminal prion-like domain (PLD). In response to elevated intracellular ionic strength, this PLD is necessary and sufficient to coordinate an adaptive gene expression program by recruiting the transcriptional coactivator BRD4. The purified NFAT5 PLD forms condensates in response to elevated solution ionic strength in vitro, and human NFAT5 alone is sufficient to reconstitute a mammalian transcriptional response to ionic stress in yeast. We propose that ion-sensitive conformational changes in a PLD directly regulate transcription to maintain ionic strength homeostasis in animal cells.",

In-depth functional studies in vitro and in vivo further reveal that specific ncUCEs can be enhancers of tumor suppressors (such as ARID1B) and silencers of oncogenic proteins (such as RPS13). Moreover, several miRNAs located in ncUCEs are recurrently mutated.

However, the mechanisms regulating this conversion remain unclear. In this study, we showed that removal of toxic and bitter SGAs is under the control of DNA demethylation, ethylene, and key transcription factors by forming a feedback loop that governs the expression of key GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM ( GAME ) genes during ripening. Moreover, the ethylene-inducible transcription factors NON-RIPENING, RIPENING INHIBITOR, and FRUITFULL1 coordinately regulate the expression of GAME31 , GAME40 , GAME5 , and the glycoalkaloid transporter gene GORKY , whereas jasmonic acid–induced MYC2 modulates the transcription of GAME36 .

Yet, wildfires rely on the availability of ignition and fuel, which are underrepresented in fire forecast and prediction practices. By analyzing satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis, here we show that near-surface weather only partially captures wildfire occurrence and intensity across the daily to seasonal timescales. Beyond near-surface weather, convection and fuel abundance play a complementary role in regulating burning processes. Specifically, enhanced atmospheric convection is identified for over 40% of the low-human-impact regions and 61% of global burnable areas during wildfire ignition and spreading periods. Meanwhile, 56% of shrublands and 54% of grasslands see higher fuel load with actual occurrence of fire.

Here, we report an unexplored associative strategy to realize DME formation at room temperature and the generation of olefins even at 413 kelvin, which is achieved by coinjecting basic acetone to manipulate the local chemical microenvironment of the methanol reactant inside the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The crucial role of acetone in accelerating methanol direct dehydration to DME is highlighted as the obvious destabilization effect for the adsorbed methanol cluster with strong hydrogen bonds and the subsequent traction of water during DME formation.

In this study, we suppress first-cycle voltage hysteresis and irreversible O 2 evolution in Li-rich oxide cathodes through covalency competition induced by the substitution of electropositive groups. We found that the nonequivalent electron distribution within an asymmetric M A -O-M B backbone (metal-to-metal charge transfer via oxygen ligands) increases electron density on electronegative transition metal ions, preventing them from reaching unstable oxidation states within an operating voltage range.

With the exceptional compatible and elastic properties, a wirelessly charging stretchable display integrated circuit and even intelligent electronic skin are achieved, capable of mimicking human touch to sense the weight, temperature, and shape of objects.",

          "authors": "Sanjana Kumaraguru, James Morgan, Fong Kuan Wong",
          "abstract": "Beyond their role as immune sentinels, microglia are actively involved in establishing and maintaining cortical circuits. Alteration in microglial numbers has been associated with abnormal behaviors akin to those observed in neurodevelopmental disorders. Consequently, establishing the appropriate microglial numbers during development is crucial for ensuring normal cortical function. Here, we uncovered a dynamic relationship between pyramidal cells and microglia that tunes microglial numbers and development through distinct phases of mouse postnatal development. Changes in pyramidal cell activity during development induce differential release of activity-dependent proteins such as Activin A, which, in turn, adjusts microglial numbers accordingly. Decoupling of this relationship not only changes microglial numbers but has a long-term consequence on their role as synaptic organizers, which ultimately affects cortical function. Our findings reveal that microglia adapt their numbers to changes in pyramidal cell activity during a critical time window in development, consequently adjusting their numbers and function to the demands of the developing local circuits.",

          "abstract": "Inspired by the remarkable adaptability observed in biological organisms, multifunctional soft robotics have emerged as promising systems capable of navigating complex environments. In this study, we present a strategy for weaving fiber soft actuators to overcome the existing limitations in deformation capabilities and complex manufacturing processes. This strategy combines traditional rope artistry with the advanced responsive characteristics of electro-driven liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) fibers, facilitating the efficient creation of multifunctional soft actuators. Leveraging this strategy, we have developed four distinct types of soft actuators: the double twisting weaving actuator (DTWA), the circular four-strand weaving actuator (CFWA), the orthogonal weaving actuator (OWA), and the diagonal weaving actuator (DWA). These weaving fiber soft actuators can be readily assembled in various soft robots, granting multiple functionalities, including surface shape programmability, biomimetic blood pumping inspired by the cardiac muscle, and versatile locomotion modes such as crawling and swimming. Our proposed strategy offers unprecedented opportunities for multifunctional soft robots in performing complex tasks.",

Emerging see-through color-tunable applications pose a synergetic demand on electrochromic device, concurrently having ultralow field driving, operation in transmissive mode, and high-purity and tunable interference colors of sci-fi perception. However, such an electrochromic device remains elusive. Herein, we invent a transmissive electro-interference-color device based on two-dimensional titania liquid crystals (2D TiO 2 LCs), demonstrating a record-high electroresponse sensitivity of ~1.5 × 10 −7 square meters per square volt among all wide-bandgap media. Consequently, the device works under an electric field of 6 × 10 3 volts per meter (three orders of magnitude lower than that of conventional LCs), operates in a transmissive mode with ~85% transparency, and displays pure and tunable interference colors. The electro-interference-color device serves as a good example to fabricate diverse see-through chromatic applications as conceptually demonstrated smart windows with functions of privacy protection, energy saving, and artistic presentation as well as transparent display.",

          "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) represents a promising gene-specific therapy against tumors. However, its clinical translation is impeded by poor performance of lysosomal escape and tumor targeting. This challenge is especially prominent in glioblastoma (GBM) therapy, necessitating the penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Leveraging the intrinsic tumor-targeting and BBB traversing capability of human H-ferritin, we designed a series of ferritin variants with positively charged cavity and truncated carboxyl terminus, termed tHFn(+). These nanocarriers respond to weak acid and disassemble in endosomal compartments, exposing the internal positive charges to facilitate the lysosomal escape of loaded small interfering RNA (siRNA). Functioning as universal siRNA nanocarriers, tHFn(+) significantly enhanced the uptake of different siRNAs and suppressed gene expressions associated with GBM progression. Furthermore, tHFn(+) traversed the BBB and targeted glioma in vivo by binding to its receptors (e.g., transferrin receptor 1). tHFn(+)-delivered siRNAs exhibited exceptional therapeutic effects against glioma in vivo, advancing RNAi therapeutics beyond GBM for the treatment of various diseases.",

          "abstract": "Oocytes naturally present mechanical defects that hinder their development after fertilization. Thus, in the context of assisted reproduction, oocyte selection based on their mechanical properties has great potential to improve the quality of the resulting embryos and the success rate of these procedures. However, using mechanical properties as a quantifiable selective criterion requires robust and nondestructive measurement tools. This study developed a constriction-based microfluidic device that monitors the deformation of mouse oocytes under controlled pressure. The device can distinguish mechanically aberrant oocyte groups from healthy control ones. On the basis of a mathematical model, we propose that deformability measurements infer both oocyte tension and elasticity, elasticity being the most discriminating factor in our geometry. Despite force transmission during oocyte deformation, no long-term damage was observed. This noninvasive characterization of mouse oocyte deformability in microconstrictions allows for a substantial advance in assessing the mechanical properties of mammalian oocytes and has potential application as a quantifiable selective criterion in medically assisted reproduction.",

          "abstract": "Implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide effective medical solutions for diverse health care applications. Electrical circuits are crucial for implantable devices due to the requirement of intended functions, such as communication with external devices. Circuits have several risks, such as biocompatibility issues, power limitations, or size constraints. In this work, we propose a passive modulated ultrasound (PMU) principle for IMDs and develop a circuit-free ultrasonic system (CUS) for thoracic pressure monitoring. The PMU principle can passively modulate monitored physiological signals into ultrasound pulses without using electrical circuits or power supply. The size of the developed CUS is only 2.5 millimeters in radius and 850 micrometers in height. Animal experiments demonstrated that the CUS, with a high sensitivity (−22.96 millivolts per kilopascal), can monitor thoracic pressure to assist in diagnosing different heart diseases, including cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction. The PMU provides a human-friendly wireless sensing and communication strategy for IMDs, which promotes advancements in health care applications within the human body.",

          "abstract": "The proliferation of marine algae in the Neoproterozoic Era is thought to have stimulated the ecology of predatory microbial eukaryotes. To test this proposal, we introduced algal particulate matter (APM) to marine sediments underlying a modern marine oxygen minimum zone with bottom-water oxygen concentrations approximating those of the late Neoproterozoic water column. We found that under anoxia, APM significantly stimulated microbial eukaryote gene expression, particularly genes involved in anaerobic energy metabolism and phagocytosis, and increased the relative abundance of 18 S rRNA from known predatory clades. We additionally confirmed that APM promoted the reproduction of benthic foraminifera under anoxia with higher-than-expected net growth efficiencies. Overall, our findings suggest that algal biomass exported to the Neoproterozoic benthos stimulated the ecology of benthic predatory protists under anoxia, thereby creating more modern food webs by enhancing the transfer of fixed carbon and energy to eukaryotes occupying higher trophic levels, including the earliest benthic metazoans.",

          "abstract": "Biological membranes consist of a lipid bilayer studded with integral and peripheral membrane proteins. Most α-helical membrane proteins require protein-conducting insertases known as translocons to assist in their membrane insertion and folding. While the sequence-dependent propensities for a helix to either translocate through the translocon or insert into the membrane have been codified into numerical hydrophobicity scales, the corresponding propensity to partition into the membrane interface remains unrevealed. By engineering diagnostic glycosylation sites around test peptide sequences inserted into a host protein, we devised a system that can differentiate between water-soluble, surface-bound, and transmembrane (TM) states of the sequence based on its glycosylation pattern. Using this system, we determined the sequence-dependent propensities for transfer from the translocon to a TM, interfacial, or extramembrane space and compared these propensities with the corresponding probability distributions determined from the sequences and structures of experimentally determined proteins.",
