          "abstract": "Exposure to economic inequality is widely thought to erode subjective well-being and mental health1,2,3,4,5, which carries important societal implications6,7,8,9,10. However, existing studies face reproducibility issues11,12,13, and theory suggests that inequality only affects individuals in disadvantaged contexts14,15,16. Here we present a meta-analysis of 168 studies using multilevel data (11,389,871 participants from 38,335 geographical units) identified across 10 bibliographical databases (2000–2022). Contrary to popular narratives, random-effects models showed that individuals in more unequal areas do not report lower subjective well-being (standardized odds ratio (OR+0.05) = 0.979, 95% confidence interval = 0.951–1.008). Moreover, although inequality initially seemed to undermine mental health, the publication-bias-corrected association was null (OR+0.05 = 1.019; 0.990–1.049)17. Meta-analytical effects were smaller than the smallest effect of interest, and specification curve analyses confirmed these results across ≈95% of 768 alternative models18. When assessing study quality and certainty of evidence using ROBINS-E and GRADE criteria, ROBINS-E rated 80% of studies at high risk of bias, and GRADE assigned greater certainty to the null effects than to the negative effects. Meta-regressions revealed that the adverse association between inequality and mental health was confined to low-income samples. Moreover, machine-learning analyses19 indicated that the association with well-being was negative in high-inflation contexts but positive in low-inflation contexts. These moderation effects were replicated using Gallup World Poll data (up to 2 million participants). These findings challenge the view that economic inequality universally harms psychological health and can inform public health policy.",

          "abstract": "Amazonia is the largest 1 and the most species-rich tropical forest region on Earth 2 , where hundreds of Indigenous cultures and thousands of animal species have interacted over millennia 3,4 . Although Amazonia offers a unique context to appraise the value of wildlife as a source of food to millions of rural inhabitants, the diversity, geographic extent, volumes and nutritional value of harvested wild meat are unknown. Here, leveraging a dataset comprising 447,438 animals hunted across 625 rural localities, we estimate an annual extraction of 0.57 Mt of undressed animal biomass across Amazonia, equivalent to 0.34 Mt of edible wild meat. Just 20 out of 174 taxa account for 72% of all animals hunted and 84% of the overall biomass extracted. We show that this amount of wild meat can meet nearly half of protein and iron dietary requirements for rural peoples, along with a substantial portion of their needs for B vitamins (18–126%) and zinc (23%). However, wild meat productivity is likely to have decreased by 67% in nearly 500,000 km² of highly deforested areas of Amazonia. Furthermore, the availability of wild meat per capita decreases significantly in areas with higher human population, greater proximity to cities, and more extensive deforestation. These findings highlight the urgent need to preserve the forest to safeguard biodiversity and traditional wild meat food systems, which will be essential for ensuring Amazonian peoples’ well-being and achieving several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 5 .",

          "abstract": "The discovery of Shimao city (around 2300–1800 bce1), a premier state-level Neolithic fortified settlement in Shaanxi, China2, played an important role in helping us understand the emergence of socially stratified urban societies. However, key questions remain regarding how ancestry and kinship shaped the hierarchy of this class-based society characterized by human sacrifice. The origin of the founding populations of Shimao and other Loess Plateau settlements, and their interactions within the broader ancestral landscape, have yet to be determined. Here we present, by sequencing 144 ancient genomes from Shimao city and its satellites, pedigrees among tomb owners spanning up to four generations. These findings reveal a predominantly patrilineal descent structure across Shimao communities, and possibly sex-specific sacrificial rituals. We also characterize the population history, revealing that Shimao culture-related populations originated mostly from a Yangshao culture-related population present at least 1,000 years earlier, and the lasting inflow of Yumin-related populations from Inner Mongolia did not interrupt regional genetic continuity. Broader genetic influence from southern mainland ancestry over Shimao culture-related populations supports evidence of rice farming expanding further north than previously expected. Together, these results uncover fine details of the regional peopling and social structure of early state establishment.",

          "authors": "Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon",
          "abstract": "Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using single-qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution1. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators2 or using entangled states to enhance measurement sensitivity3. Here we describe protocols for using optically unresolved NV centre pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise at nanometre length scales. For noninteracting NV centres, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations, leveraging the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable phase cycling even for co-aligned NV centres that are spectrally unresolved. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole–dipole coupling between two NV centres and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centres. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV centre spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in more than an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate methods for detecting high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centres.",

          "abstract": "Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth’s deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5,6,7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8,9,10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration.",

          "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.",

          "abstract": "The identification of therapeutic strategies to induce sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free control of HIV infection is a major priority.1 Combination immunotherapy including HIV vaccination, immune stimulation/latency reversal, and passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise in non-human primate models,2–6 but few studies have translated such approaches into people. We performed a single-arm, proof-of-concept study in ten people with HIV on ART combining the following three approaches: (1) therapeutic vaccination with an HIV/Gag conserved element (CE)-targeted DNA+IL-12 prime/MVA boost regimen followed by (2) administration of two bNAbs (10-1074, VRC07-523LS) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (lefitolimod) during ART suppression, followed by (3) repeat bNAb administration at the time of ART interruption (NCT04357821). Seven of the ten participants exhibited post-intervention control after stopping ART, independent of residual bNAb plasma levels. Robust expansion of activated CD8+ T cells early in response to rebounding virus correlated with lower median viral load following peak viremia off ART. These data suggest that combination immunotherapy approaches might prove effective to induce sustained control of HIV by slowing rebound and improving CD8+ T cell responses, and that these approaches should continue to be optimized.",

          "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological strategy that relies on small molecules such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or molecular glues, which induce proximity between a target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to prompt target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 1 . Sporadic reports indicated that ligands designed to inhibit a target can also induce its destabilization 2–4 . Among others, this has repeatedly been observed for kinase inhibitors 5–7 . However, we lack an understanding of the frequency, generalizability and mechanistic underpinnings of these phenomena. Here, to address this knowledge gap, we generated dynamic abundance profiles of 98 kinases after cellular perturbations with 1,570 kinase inhibitors, revealing 160 selective instances of inhibitor-induced kinase destabilization. Kinases prone to degradation are frequently annotated as HSP90 clients, therefore affirming chaperone deprivation as an important route of destabilization. However, detailed investigation of inhibitor-induced degradation of LYN, BLK and RIPK2 revealed a differentiated, common mechanistic logic whereby inhibitors function by inducing a kinase state that is more efficiently cleared by endogenous degradation mechanisms. Mechanistically, effects can manifest by ligand-induced changes in cellular activity, localization or higher-order assemblies, which may be triggered by direct target engagement or network effects. Collectively, our data suggest that inhibitor-induced kinase degradation is a common event and positions supercharging of endogenous degradation circuits as an alternative to classical proximity-inducing degraders.",

We demonstrate how soil compaction stress, via ethylene, upregulates Auxin Response Factor1 in the root cortex, which represses cellulose synthase (CESA) genes. CESA repression drives radial expansion of root cortical cells by modifying the thickness of their cell walls, which results in a thicker epidermis and thinner cortex. Our research links ethylene signalling with root cell wall remodelling, and reveals how dynamic regulation of cellulose synthesis controls root growth in compacted soil.",

          "abstract": "Cancer is generally thought to be caused by expansion of a single mutant cell1. However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations2,3. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (123 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood4. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps—40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia—were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution.",

Artificial neural networks trained to perform multiple tasks will reuse representations 4 and computational components 5 across tasks. By composing tasks from these subcomponents, an agent can flexibly switch between tasks and rapidly learn new tasks 6,7 . Yet, whether such compositionality is found in the brain is unclear. Here we show the same subspaces of neural activity represent task-relevant information across multiple tasks, with each task flexibly engaging these subspaces in a task-specific manner. We trained monkeys to switch between three compositionally related tasks. In neural recordings, we found that task-relevant information about stimulus features and motor actions were represented in subspaces of neural activity that were shared across tasks. When monkeys performed a task, neural representations in the relevant shared sensory subspace were transformed to the relevant shared motor subspace. Monkeys adapted to changes in the task by iteratively updating their internal belief about the current task and then, based on this belief, flexibly engaging the shared sensory and motor subspaces relevant to the task. In summary, our findings suggest that the brain can flexibly perform multiple tasks by compositionally combining task-relevant neural representations.",

Here we sought to understand how organisms evolve completely new sets of centromeres that still effectively engage with the kinetochore machinery by identifying and tracking thousands of centromeres across two major fungal clades, including more than 2,500 natural strain isolates and representing over 1,000 million years of evolution. We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection and that the kinetochore, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, appears to act as a filter to determine which new centromere variants are tolerated.

          "abstract": "HIV cure is exceptionally rare, documented in only six cases among the estimated 88 million individuals who have acquired HIV since the epidemic's onset1–6. Successful cures, including the pioneering Berlin patient, are limited to individuals receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-SCT) for hematological cancers. HIV resistance from stem cell donors with the rare homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation was long considered the main mechanism for HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART), but recent reports highlight CCR5-independent mechanisms as important contributors to HIV cure6–8. Here, we provide new evidence for this conceptual shift, reporting exceptionally long, treatment-free HIV remission following allo-SCT with functionally active CCR5. A heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 male living with HIV received allo-SCT from an HLA-matched unrelated heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 donor as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Three years after allo-SCT, the patient discontinued ART. To date, HIV remission has been sustained for over six years with undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Reservoir analysis revealed intact proviral HIV before transplantation, but no replication-competent virus in blood or intestinal tissues after allo-SCT. Declining or absent HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses support the absence of viral activity. High antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity at the time of transplantation may have contributed to HIV reservoir clearance. These results demonstrate that CCR5Δ32-mediated HIV resistance is not essential for durable remission, underscoring the importance of effective viral reservoir reductions in HIV cure strategies.",

          "abstract": "Lineage plasticity is a cancer hallmark that drives disease progression and treatment resistance1,2. Plasticity is often mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that may be reversible; however, there are few examples of such reversibility. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), plasticity mediates resistance to androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors and progression from adenocarcinoma to aggressive subtypes, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE)3,4,5. Here we show that plasticity-associated treatment resistance in CRPC can be reversed through the inhibition of NSD2, a histone methyltransferase6. NSD2 upregulation in CRPC-NE correlates with poor survival outcomes, and NSD2-mediated H3K36 dimethylation regulates enhancers of genes associated with neuroendocrine differentiation. In prostate tumour organoids established from genetically engineered mice7 that recapitulate the transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states, and in human CRPC-NE organoids, CRISPR-mediated targeting of NSD2 reverts CRPC-NE to adenocarcinoma phenotypes. Moreover, a canonical AR program is upregulated and responses to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide are restored. Pharmacological inhibition of NSD2 with a first-in-class small molecule reverses plasticity and synergizes with enzalutamide to suppress growth and promote cell death in human patient-derived organoids of multiple CRPC subtypes in culture and in xenografts. Co-targeting of NSD2 and AR may represent a new therapeutic strategy for lethal forms of CRPC that are currently recalcitrant to treatment.",

          "abstract": "Upon viral infection, the current paradigm of humoral immunity posits that germinal centre reactions occurring within secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) yield effector plasma cells that subsequently traffic to infected organs or the bone marrow1,2,3. However, it is not well understood how viral tissue tropism may govern the spatiotemporal dynamics of such responses. Here we demonstrate that infection with a prototypical systemic virus indeed induces liver-trafficking plasma cells generated in SLOs, whereas strictly hepatotropic hepaciviral infection elicits locally primed, virus-specific plasma cells in the liver independently of SLO contribution. Such locally derived progenies emerged from inducible hepatic-associated lymphoid tissue (iHALT) structures containing generative foci of T follicular helper cells, myeloid cells and germinal centre-like B cells, often arising from single founder clones unique to individual periportal structures and locally supporting somatic hypermutation. Critically, the cellular composition, cell–cell contact partners and microarchitecture of such iHALT structures in mice were closely mirrored upon hepaciviral infection in humans. Functionally dependent upon CD40L signalling and cognate B cell receptor specificity, emerging CXCR4+VLA-4+LFA-1+CD44+CD138+ plasma cells were immediately retained along CXCL12+fibronectin+ICAM2+osteopontin+type I collagen+ periportal fibroblast tracts, acting as cognate anchoring pairs that were critical to their maintenance therein. In summary, we characterize humoral immunity exclusively generated and maintained within its extralymphoid site of viral infection in the liver amidst SLO dormancy, in which functional iHALT successfully compensates for strictly hepatotropic virus-induced SLO-evasion strategies to prevent persistent infection.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductors are among the most promising platforms to implement large-scale quantum computers, as advanced manufacturing techniques allow fabrication of large quantum dot arrays1. Various qubit encodings can be used to store and manipulate quantum information on these quantum dot arrays. Regardless of qubit encoding, precise control over the exchange interaction between electrons confined in quantum dots in the array is critical. Furthermore, it is necessary to execute high-fidelity quantum operations concurrently to make full use of the limited coherence of individual qubits. Here we demonstrate the parallel operation of two exchange-only qubits, consisting of six quantum dots in a linear arrangement. Using randomized benchmarking (RB) techniques, we show that issuing pulses on the five barrier gates to modulate exchange interactions in a maximally parallel way maintains the quality of qubit control relative to sequential operation. The techniques developed to perform parallel exchange pulses can be readily adapted to other quantum-dot-based encodings. Moreover, we show the first, to our knowledge, experimental demonstrations of an iSWAP gate for exchange-only qubits and of a charge-locking Pauli spin blockade (PSB) readout method. The results are validated using cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB)2, a technique useful for performance characterization of larger quantum computing systems; here it is used for the first time on a quantum system based on semiconductor technology.",

Watching others being touched activates brain areas representing our own sense of touch: the visual system recruits touch-related computations to simulate bodily consequences of visual inputs 1 . One long-standing question is how the brain implements this interface between visual and somatosensory representations 2 . Here, to address this question, we developed a model to simultaneously map somatosensory body part tuning and visual field tuning throughout the brain. Applying our model to ongoing co-activations during rest resulted in detailed maps of body-part tuning in the brain’s endogenous somatotopic network. During video watching, somatotopic tuning explains responses throughout the entire dorsolateral visual system, revealing an array of somatotopic body maps that tile the cortical surface. The body-position tuning of these maps aligns with visual tuning, predicting both preferences for visual field locations and visual-category preferences for body parts. These results reveal a mode of brain organization in which aligned visual–somatosensory topographic maps connect visual and bodily reference frames. This cross-modal interface is ideally situated to translate raw sensory impressions into more abstract formats that are useful for action, social cognition and semantic processing 3 .",

Using deep long-read bulk metagenomic sequencing, we tracked prophage integration dynamics in stool samples from six healthy individuals, spanning a 2-year timescale. Although most prophages remained stably integrated into their hosts, approximately 5% of phages were dynamically gained or lost from persistent bacterial hosts. Within a sample, we found that bacterial hosts with and without a given prophage coexisted simultaneously. Furthermore, phage induction, when detected, occurred predominantly at low levels (1–3× coverage compared to the host region), in line with theoretical expectations4. We identified multiple instances of integration of the same phage into bacteria of different taxonomic families, challenging the dogma that phages are specific to a host of a given species or strain5. Finally, we describe a new class of ‘IScream phages’, which co-opt bacterial IS30 transposases to mediate their mobilization, representing a previously unrecognized form of phage domestication of selfish bacterial elements. Taken together, these findings illuminate fundamental aspects of phage–bacterial dynamics in the human gut microbiome and expand our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that drive horizontal gene transfer and microbial genome plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Glasses-free three-dimensional (3D) displays provide users with an immersive visual experience without the need of any wearable devices1,2. To achieve high-quality 3D imaging, a display should have both large linear dimensions and a wide viewing angle. However, the trade-off between spatial extent and bandwidth of optical systems, the space–bandwidth product, conventionally constrains the simultaneous maximization of the two. The two most common approaches to 3D displays are holographic3,4 and automultiscopic1,5,6, which, respectively, sacrifice either scale or viewing angle. Recently, some implementations enhanced by artificial intelligence have shown directions to mitigate these constraints, but they still operate within a set space–bandwidth product7,8. As a result, it remains challenging to fabricate large-scale wide-angle 3D displays9. Here we report the realization of a large-scale full-parallax 3D display with seamless viewing beyond 100°, maintained at over 50 Hz and 1,920 × 1,080 resolution on a low-cost light-field delivery setup. This device, called EyeReal, is realized by accurately modelling binocular view and combining it with a deep-learning real-time optimization, enabling the generation of optimal light-field outputs for each of the eyes.

          "abstract": "Stem-like progenitors are self-renewing cytotoxic T cells that expand as effector cells during successful checkpoint immunotherapy 1,2 . Emerging evidence suggests that tumour-draining lymph nodes support the continuous generation of these stem-like cells that replenish tumour sites and are a key source of expanded effector populations 3–6 , underlining the importance of understanding what factors promote and maintain activated T cells in the stem-like state. Here, using advanced three-dimensional multiplex immunofluorescence imaging, we identify antigen-presentation niches in tumour-draining lymph nodes that support the expansion, maintenance and affinity evolution of TCF-1 + PD-1 + SLAMF6 high stem-like CD8 + T cells. Contrary to the prevailing view that persistent T cell receptor (TCR) signalling drives terminal effector differentiation, prolonged antigen engagement days beyond initial priming sustains the proliferation and self-renewal of these stem-like T cells in vivo. The inhibitory PD-1 pathway has a central role in this process through fine-tuning the TCR signal input that enables the selective expansion of high-affinity TCR stem-like clones as a renewable source of effector cells. PD-1 blockade disrupts this tuning, leading to terminal differentiation or death of the most avid anti-tumour stem-like cells. Our results therefore reveal a relationship between TCR ligand affinity recognition, a key negative-feedback regulatory loop and T cell stemness programming. Furthermore, these findings raise questions about whether anti-PD-1 blockade during cancer immunotherapy provides a short-term anti-tumour effect at the cost of diminishing efficacy due to progressive loss of these critical high-affinity precursors.",

Its unique ‘string’ architecture3, where multiple cells are connected in series, requires high-voltage pass operation that causes a large amount of undesired power consumption4. Lowering the pass voltage, however, poses a challenge: it leads to an associated reduction in the memory window, restricting the multi-level operation capability. Here, with a gate stack composed of zirconium-doped hafnia and an oxide semiconductor channel, we report ultralow-power ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) that resolve this dilemma. Our FeFETs secure up to 5-bit per cell multi-level capability, which is on par with or even exceeds current NAND technology, while showing nearly zero pass voltage, saving up to 96% power in string-level operations over conventional counterparts.

          "abstract": "Mechanical transmission is essential in force-related activities ranging from the daily tying of shoe laces1 to sophisticated surgical2 and robotic operations3,4. Modern machines and robots typically use complex electronic devices designed to sense and limit force5, some of which still face challenges when operating space is limited (for example, in minimally invasive surgeries)6 or when resources are scarce (for example, operations in remote areas without electricity). Here we describe an alternative slipknot-based mechanical transmission mechanism to control the intelligent operation of both human and robotic systems. Through topological design, slipknot tying and release can encode and deliver force with a consistency of 95.4% in repeating operations, which circumvents the need for additional sensors and controllers. When applied to surgical repair, this mechanism helped inexperienced surgeons to improve their knotting-force precision by 121%, enabling them to perform surgical knots as good as those of experienced surgeons. Moreover, blood supply and tissue healing after surgery were improved. The mechano-intelligence exhibited in slipknots may inspire investigations of knotted structures across multiple length scales. This slipknot-gauged mechanical transmission strategy can be widely deployed, opening up opportunities for resource-limited healthcare, science education and field exploration.",

          "abstract": "Land-use change causes widespread shifts in the composition and functional diversity of species assemblages. However, its impact on ecosystem resilience remains uncertain. The stability of ecosystem functioning may increase after land-use change because the most sensitive species are removed, which leaves more resilient survivors 1–3 . Alternatively, ecosystems may be destabilized if land-use change reduces functional redundancy, which accentuates the ecological impacts of further species loss 4,5 . Current evidence is inconclusive, partly because trait data have not been available to quantify functional stability at sufficient scale. Here we use morphological measurements of 3,696 bird species to estimate shifts in functional redundancy after recent anthropogenic land-use change at 1,281 sites worldwide. We then use extinction simulations to assess the sensitivity of these altered assemblages to future species loss. Although the proportion of disturbance-tolerant species increases after land-use change, we show that this does not increase stability because functional redundancy is reduced. This decline in redundancy destabilizes ecosystem function because relatively few additional extinctions lead to accelerated losses of functional diversity, particularly in trophic groups that deliver important ecological services such as seed dispersal and insect predation. Our analyses indicate that land-use change may have major undetected impacts on the resilience of key ecological functions, hindering the capacity of natural ecosystems to absorb further reductions in functionality caused by ongoing perturbations.",

A partial foot (BRT-VP-2/73)2 and several isolated teeth from two Burtele (BRT) localities, however, were not identified to the species level. Recently recovered dentognathic specimens clarify not only the taxonomic affinity of the BRT hominin specimens but also shed light on the diet and locomotion of A. deyiremeda. Here we present a comparative description of these specimens and show that they are attributable to A. deyiremeda. We also find it parsimonious to attribute the BRT foot to this species based on the absence of other hominin species at BRT. The new material demonstrates that overall, A. deyiremeda was dentally and postcranially more primitive than A. afarensis, particularly in aspects of canine and premolar morphology, and in its retention of pedal grasping traits. Furthermore, the low and less variable distributions of its dental enamel δ13C values are similar to those from Ardipithecus ramidus and Australopithecus anamensis, indicating a reliance on C3 foods. This suggests that A. deyiremeda had a dietary strategy similar to the earlier A. ramidus and A. anamensis. The BRT foot and its assignment to A. deyiremeda provides conclusive evidence that arboreality was a significant component of the positional behaviour of this australopith, further corroborating that some degree of arboreality persisted among Pliocene hominins1,3,4,5,6,7.",

Prior studies support a role for CD8+ T cells5-9 but the precise features of CD8+ T cells involved in PIC remain unclear. Here we mapped and functionally profiled CD8+ T cell responses to autologous HIV epitopes using longitudinal samples from four ATI trials in bNAb recipients. PIC was associated with superior pre-intervention HIV-specific CD8+ T cell proliferative capacity, stem cell-like memory phenotype, and recall cytotoxicity against autologous HIV peptide-pulsed CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cell stemness was further increased following bNAb administration without emergence of new clonotypes targeting defined HLA-optimal epitopes. Multimodal single-cell analyses revealed molecular features associated with PIC and HIV-specific CD8+ T cell stemness, including signatures of metabolic fitness and reduced T cell exhaustion.

Here we propose and demonstrate an entanglement-enhanced sensing protocol that overcomes these limitations through the strategic use of entangled NV pairs. Our approach achieves a 3.4-fold enhancement in sensitivity and a 1.6-fold improvement in spatial resolution relative to single NV centres under ambient conditions. The protocol uses carefully engineered entangled states that amplify target spin signals through quantum interference while suppressing environmental noise. Crucially, we extend these capabilities to resolve metastable single-spin dynamics, directly observing stochastic transitions between different spin states by identifying state-dependent coupling strengths. This dual functionality enables simultaneous detection of static and dynamic spin species for studying complex quantum systems. The achieved performance establishes entanglement-enhanced sensing as a viable pathway towards atomic-scale characterization of quantum materials and interfaces.",

Here we use three closely related species, Drosophila sechellia (Dsec), Drosophila simulans and Drosophila melanogaster, to study taste circuit1 and food choice evolution. Dsec, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia; noni), whereas the other two are generalists living on diverse diets2. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in Dsec and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity by means of calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni activates bitter-sensing neurons more strongly in Dsec than in the other two species owing to a small deletion in a single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain3, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sucrose signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data indicate that altered food choice may not be explained by peripheral receptor changes alone but rather by modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.",

          "abstract": "An AI-detection tool developed by Pangram labs found that peer reviewers are increasingly using chatbots to draft responses to authors.Credit: breakermaximus/iStock via Getty\n\nWhat can researchers do if they suspect that their manuscripts have been peer reviewed using artificial intelligence (AI)? Dozens of academics have raised concerns on social media about manuscripts and peer reviews submitted to the organizers of next year’s International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), an annual gathering of specialists in machine learning. Among other things, they flagged hallucinated citations and suspiciously long and vague feedback on their work.\n\nGraham Neubig, an AI researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was one of those who received peer reviews that seemed to have been produced using large language models (LLMs). The reports, he says, were “very verbose with lots of bullet points” and requested analyses that were not “the standard statistical analyses that reviewers ask for in typical AI or machine-learning papers.”\n\nBut Neubig needed help proving that the reports were AI-generated. So, he posted on X (formerly Twitter) and offered a reward for anyone who could scan all the conference submissions and their peer reviews for AI-generated text. The next day, he got a response from Max Spero, chief executive of Pangram Labs in New York City, which develops tools to detect AI-generated text. Pangram screened all 19,490 studies and 75,800 peer reviews submitted for ICLR 2026, which will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in April. Neubig and more than 11,000 other AI researchers will be attending.\n\nPangram’s analysis revealed that around 21% of the ICLR peer reviews were fully AI-generated, and more than half contained signs of AI use. The findings were posted online by Pangram Labs. “People were suspicious, but they didn’t have any concrete proof,” says Spero. “Over the course of 12 hours, we wrote some code to parse out all of the text content from these paper submissions,” he adds.\n\nThe conference organizers say they will now use automated tools to assess whether submissions and peer reviews breached policies on using AI in submissions and peer reviews. This is the first time that the conference has faced this issue at scale, says Bharath Hariharan, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and senior programme chair for ICLR 2026. “After we go through all this process … that will give us a better notion of trust.”\n\nAI-written peer review\n\nThe Pangram team used one of its own tools, which predicts whether text is generated or edited by LLMs. Pangram’s analysis flagged 15,899 peer reviews that were fully AI-generated. But it also identified many manuscripts that had been submitted to the conference with suspected cases of AI-generated text: 199 manuscripts (1%) were found to be fully AI-generated; 61% of submissions were mostly human-written; but 9% contained more than 50% AI-generated text. Pangram described the model in a preprint1.\n\nAI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried\n\nFor many researchers who received peer reviews for their submissions to ICLR, the Pangram analysis confirmed what they had suspected. Desmond Elliott, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen, says that one of three reviews he received seemed to have missed “the point of the paper”. His PhD student who led the work suspected that the review was generated by LLMs, because it mentioned numerical results from the manuscript that were incorrect and contained odd expressions.\n\nWhen Pangram released its findings, Elliott adds, “the first thing I did was I typed in the title of our paper because I wanted to know whether my student’s gut instinct was correct”. The suspect peer review, which Pangram’s analysis flagged as fully AI-generated, gave the manuscript the lowest rating, leaving it “on the borderline between accept and reject”, says Elliott. “It's deeply frustrating”.\n\nRepercussions\n\nThe ICLR 2026 team permitted authors and reviewers to use AI tools to polish text, generate experiment codes or analyse results, but mandated disclosure of such uses. It also prohibited AI use that would have breached the confidentiality of manuscripts or produced falsified content.",

          "authors": "Kerry Brown",
          "abstract": "Two conversations have stayed with me over the past 25 years. Around 2001, a European Union official in Beijing — where I was then a UK diplomat — told a group of us that the reason countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom were allowing technology transfer to China was to see a day when the nation could return the favour. And, in 2017 in Austria, a retired UK security official stated wearily that if there was one constant in policymaking towards China, it was to perpetually be five to ten years behind the times.\n\nHow China can become a biotechnology superpower\n\nThose points resonate in 2025. China has become an important player in research and development (R&D). Yet, most of the outside world has still not woken up to this fact.\n\nOn 23 October, China’s Communist Party announced that, for the next five years, it will focus on “high-quality development” with “innovation as the fundamental driving force”. This will require, it says, “substantial improvements in scientific and technological self-reliance and strength” (see go.nature.com/4ahcvj8). Policymakers should take this statement seriously for three reasons.\n\nFirst, China has an incentive. At a meeting a few days later, Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump agreed to halt their tariff wars and trade skirmishes. But China knows that its technological dependence on the United States and others is a vulnerability, and that it needs to become autonomous.\n\nSecond, it is not just words but hard cash that the Chinese government is committing to achieving its goals. The nation’s R&D investments increased nearly sixfold between 2007 and 2023, overtaking the EU’s and coming close to US figures (see go.nature.com/4a2xres). The latest plans indicate that this trend is set to continue.\n\nChinese scientists increasingly lead joint projects with the UK, US and Europe\n\nAnd third, China has the human capital, too. In 2020, the nation produced 3.6 million graduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), compared with 2.6 million in India and 820,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4ppekyx). And, in 2022, some 50,000 people in China graduated with STEM PhDs, compared with 34,000 in the United States (see go.nature.com/4iedi4z). China’s leading universities, including Fudan in Shanghai and Tsinghua in Beijing, rank highly on global lists.\n\nOver the past half-century, China’s development was achieved mainly by 250 million labourers moving from rural areas to urban ones, making the country the ‘factory of the world’. By contrast, going forwards, it will be young Chinese scientists who will drive progress.\n\nA powerful example is the unexpected January release of DeepSeek, an app based on artificial intelligence developed by a 200-strong technology company in Hangzhou. Despite criticism that DeepSeek has a lower capacity than other AI models, the firm’s proof that China could produce its own AI systems provided a powerful symbolic moment.\n\nHow provinces and cities can sustain US–China climate cooperation\n\nChinese leaders admit that their country has a long way to go. But it would take a brave person to dismiss China’s chance of achieving its goal of becoming a technological superpower by 2035. That is why it is important for other governments to engage with China effectively.",

Credit: Addictive Stock Creatives/Alamy\n\nInserting easy-to-release slipknots into surgical thread could help surgeons to tie perfect sutures — tight enough to help heal a wound but not so tight that they damage tissue.\n\nResearchers worked out how to precisely control a knot’s geometry and friction so that they could ‘program’ it to open when tugged on with a specific force.\n\nThis allows a surgeon — or a robot — stitching up a wound to pull a suture closed with just the right amount of force, tugging the free end of the knotted thread and stopping when the knot unfurls. Getting the force right is important: stitches that are too tight or too loose can lead to complications.\n\nIn simulated operations described in Nature on 26 November1, the slipknot technique allowed inexperienced surgeons to perform sutures as well as their experienced peers. When used in rats, slipknot-aided colon surgery led to blood flow being restored faster, fewer leaks and less scar tissue than is usually the case for conventional stitches.\n\nStitches made simple\n\nSurgeons usually gauge how much tension is in stitches by look and feel — a skill that takes years to learn and remains variable even in experts.\n\nAdding a slipknot to the thread creates “a kind of built-in mechanical fuse” that limits how much force can be transmitted to the tissue, says Tiefeng Li, a researcher in mechanics and robotics at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, who co-led the team of mathematicians, mechanics researchers and clinicians behind the research. “The surgeon only needs to follow a very simple rule: pull until it unfurls, then you know you are at the intended force.”\n\nA simple slipknot comes undone if the thread is pulled hard enough. Credit: Chaoyang Zhao, Kaihang Zhang, Tiefeng Li\n\nThe type of knot used consists of a loop that unravels when one end of the thread is pulled. Although such knots seem simple, the mechanics inside them are complex, says Li. “When a slipknot opens, the thread bends, twists, slides and rubs against itself, and the geometry of the knot changes very quickly,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Afrodi sat on the very edge of her seat. They were here, they were finally here. Like the rest of her team, her eyes were glued to the full-wall screen. Venus: the final frontier.\n\nNot that the public thought that, of course: completely uninhabitable was completely uninteresting. Afrodi couldn’t disagree more. She’d been enamoured with Venus ever since childhood, staring up at it through her mum’s telescope. A perfect, rose-tinted disk. She’d loved the constellations, loved the other planets, but none had captured her like Venus. She felt drawn to it.\n\nAs a teen, Afrodi had observed the public’s obsession with Mars. She read Kim Stanley Robinson’s Red Mars, listened to talks about a Mars landing, of potential colonization plans. She couldn’t understand the appeal. The next summer was the hottest on record, with each year after predicted to be ever hotter. Who wanted to live in a dusty red desert? People think Mars is Earth’s closest relative — but they’re wrong. Mars is small, more akin to the Moon. Venus is Earth’s dangerous sister.\n\nAt university she’d studied astrophysics, absorbing everything she could about Venus’s history. She learnt that once, perhaps a billion years ago, Venus could have been habitable. Afrodi found this enchanting. What would it have been like on the surface? When they first found hints that there might have been life on Mars, her classmates buzzed with excitement. But why should she care about crusty old Mars when Venus rained diamonds?\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nTop of her class was a boy named Res, from Greece. He wanted to be the next Michael Collins, overseeing his very own Neil and Buzz to their safe landing on Mars. He told everyone about Collins’s joke with the Moon landers, that they should say ‘Oh God, what is that thing?’ and cut their mic. He told everyone he had something even funnier he’d make his crew say. Afrodi wasn’t sure Res had the right impression of Collins’s job, but she didn’t care to correct him. Instead, she kept her nose down and learnt everything about Venus.\n\nThe biggest problem astronomers had in viewing the surface was the temperature, which regularly rose to more than 800 K: robot-meltingly and electronic-fryingly hot. The picture they did have was mainly from spectroscopic data and wavelength information, rather than anything seen. Afrodi did a master’s in materials, and a joint PhD in robotics and astrophysics. She wanted to see Venus under her protective shell. She learnt about tungsten, which would withstand temperatures about ten times Venus’s heat. She risked her life hanging around active volcanoes, testing her tungsten-crafted cooling mechanisms and a heat-resistant nanopolymer designed by one of her classmates.\n\nWhen she got an active picture from the inside of a volcano, Afrodi leapt for joy. It would be possible. Her dream would be possible. She left the robot down there for four weeks, just to be completely sure, and once she pulled it out she sent it to Antarctica, to see if it could handle the cold of space.\n\nRes was in her postdoc programme. He didn’t remember her. She didn’t care. They worked together under a disinterested supervisor. Res told her he’d hoped to work on a Mars project, but slots were highly sought after and he’d missed out on a place, which is why he’d been stuck with this second-rate Venus shit. He asked her what she’d wanted to do. She told him they were going to be the first to see the surface of Venus and he should grow up — but in more colourful language.\n\nHe was a nuisance for the next two or so months, rabbiting on about Mars. She learnt to tune it out, like the trains passing her window at night.\n\nGradually — as they worked together on the templates she had for a robot, figured out landing gear, how to get it into space, the trajectory and timing — his Mars worship stopped. She was quiet and introspective, and he did not pick up enthusiasm, exactly, from her, but he grew to appreciate Venus nonetheless. In his own way.\n\nTheir first date was to the observatory in Tartu, Estonia. He’d planned the trip without telling her where they were going, held her hand as they gazed up at Venus’s pink-gold surface. London was on fire while they were away. She’d had to pay for the taxi to get home, as surge pricing ballooned it to twice his budget. But he didn’t complain, eating packed cheese sandwiches every day for the next month to pay her back. She accepted only half.",

          "abstract": "An AlphaFold model of Tmem81, a membrane protein involved in the fusion of egg and sperm.Credit: Google DeepMind/EMBL-EBI (CC-BY-4.0)\n\nFor nearly a decade, Andrea Pauli, a biochemist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, has been trying to work out how sperm and egg get together.\n\nIn 2018, her laboratory found a protein on the surface of zebrafish (Danio rerio) eggs, called Bouncer, that was essential for fertilization. But Pauli’s team and others struggled to show how Bouncer recognized sperm cells. Then a revolution happened.\n\nAlphaFold reveals how sperm and egg hook up in intimate detail\n\nFive years ago, in late November 2020, researchers at London-based Google DeepMind unveiled AlphaFold2. The artificial-intelligence tool for predicting protein structures generated stunningly accurate 3D models that, in some cases, were indistinguishable from experimental maps, dominating a long-running structure-prediction challenge. The first version of AlphaFold was announced in 2018, but its predictions weren’t nearly as good as its successor, which limited its impact.\n\nThe 2021 release of AlphaFold2’s code and a database that has swelled to hundreds of millions of predicted structures mean that scientists can now get a reliable prediction for almost any protein.\n\n“Having models for anything has had a huge impact,” says Janet Thornton, a bioinformatician at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL–EBI). “It’s like the second coming of structural biology.”\n\nRapid discovery\n\nFor Pauli’s team, the software shone a light on a path they might otherwise never have found. The model predicted that a protein, called Tmem81, stabilizes a complex of two other sperm proteins, creating a pocket for Bouncer to bind to1. Experiments backed up the tool’s predictions. AlphaFold “speeds up discovery”, says Pauli. “We use it for every project.”\n\nHer team’s paper about this, published in 2024, is one of nearly 40,000 journal articles to cite the 2021 Nature paper describing AlphaFold22. Unlike many other highly cited life-sciences and biomedical papers from the same period, including seminal reports about the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in AlphaFold doesn’t seem to be slowing down (see ‘Peak citations’).\n\nDeepMind’s John Jumper — who shared half of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with chief executive Demis Hassabis for developing AlphaFold — says he is “deeply proud” of how useful the tool has been for scientists such as Pauli. “When will someone win one of these major awards because they used AlphaFold?” he wonders.\n\nPart of AlphaFold2’s rapid impact is down to its accessibility, say researchers. Google DeepMind made the underlying code and other parameters freely available to scientists, and it quickly became possible for them to run the software themselves at scale: this is what Pauli’s team did.\n\nSource: AlphaFold Protein Structure Database\n\nSome 3.3 million users in more than 190 countries have accessed the AlphaFold database (AFDB), which is hosted by EMBL–EBI and contains more than 240 million structural predictions, encompassing most known proteins. More than one million AFDB users come from low- and middle-income countries, including China and India (see ‘Global appeal’).\n\nProtein-structure revolution\n\nThe field in which AlphaFold seems to have made its biggest impact is structural biology. Researchers who used AlphaFold submitted around 50% more protein structures to a repository of experimental models, called the Protein Data Bank (PDB), than did a non-AlphaFold-using ‘baseline’ of structural-biology researchers, finds a Google DeepMind-funded study of AlphaFold’s impacts released this week. AlphaFold2 use was also associated with higher rates of PDB submissions than those of researchers using other ‘frontier’ methods in AI, structural biology and protein structure prediction (see ‘Protein pile-up’).\n\nSource: AI in science: Emerging evidence of impact from AlphaFold2\n\nJumper says he is especially gratified that AlphaFold2 — which was trained using PDB data — has proved so useful for deducing protein structures. The predicted structures can help researchers to make sense of raw data generated by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. “I love that it helps the people that gave us the data,” Jumper adds.",

          "title": "This AI combo could unlock human-level intelligence",
          "authors": "Nicola Jones",
          "abstract": "Will computers ever match or surpass human-level intelligence — and, if so, how? When the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), based in Washington DC, asked its members earlier this year whether neural networks — the current star of artificial-intelligence systems — alone will be enough to hit this goal, the vast majority said no. Instead, most said, a heavy dose of an older kind of AI will be needed to get these systems up to par: symbolic AI.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nSometimes called ‘good old-fashioned AI’, symbolic AI is based on formal rules and an encoding of the logical relationships between concepts1. Mathematics is symbolic, for example, as are ‘if–then’ statements and computer coding languages such as Python, along with flow charts or Venn diagrams that map how, say, cats, mammals and animals are conceptually related. Decades ago, symbolic systems were an early front-runner in the AI effort. However, in the early 2010s, they were vastly outpaced by more-flexible neural networks. These machine-learning models excel at learning from vast amounts of data, and underlie large language models (LLMs), as well as chatbots such as ChatGPT.\n\nNow, however, the computer-science community is pushing hard for a better and bolder melding of the old and the new. ‘Neurosymbolic AI’ has become the hottest buzzword in town. Brandon Colelough, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park, has charted the meteoric rise of the concept in academic papers (see ‘Going up and up’). These reveal a spike of interest in neurosymbolic AI that started in around 2021 and shows no sign of slowing down2.\n\nPlenty of researchers are heralding the trend as an escape from what they see as an unhealthy monopoly of neural networks in AI research, and expect the shift to deliver smarter and more reliable AI.\n\nA better melding of these two strategies could lead to artificial general intelligence (AGI): AI that can reason and generalize its knowledge from one situation to another as well as humans do. It might also be useful for high-risk applications, such as military or medical decision-making, says Colelough. Because symbolic AI is transparent and understandable to humans, he says, it doesn’t suffer from the ‘black box’ syndrome that can make neural networks hard to trust.\n\nSource: updated from ref. 2\n\nThere are already good examples of neurosymbolic AI, including Google DeepMind’s AlphaGeometry, a system reported last year3 that can reliably solve maths Olympiad problems — questions aimed at talented secondary-school students. But working out how best to combine neural networks and symbolic AI into an all-purpose system is a formidable challenge.\n\n“You’re really architecting this kind of two-headed beast,” says computer scientist William Regli, also at the University of Maryland.\n\nWar of words\n\nIn 2019, computer scientist Richard Sutton posted a short essay entitled ‘The bitter lesson’ on his blog (see go.nature.com/4paxykf). In it, he argued that, since the 1950s, people have repeatedly assumed that the best way to make intelligent computers is to feed them with all the insights that humans have arrived at about the rules of the world, in fields from physics to social behaviour. The bitter pill to swallow, wrote Sutton, is that time and time again, symbolic methods have been outdone by systems that use a ton of raw data and scaled-up computational power to leverage ‘search and learning’. Early chess-playing computers, for example, that were trained on human-devised strategies were outperformed by those that were simply fed lots of game data.\n\nThis lesson has been widely quoted by proponents of neural networks to support the idea that making these systems ever-bigger is the best path to AGI. But many researchers argue that the essay overstates its case and downplays the crucial part that symbolic systems can and do play in AI. For example, the best chess program today, Stockfish, pairs a neural network with a symbolic tree of allowable moves.\n\nAI models that lie, cheat and plot murder: how dangerous are LLMs really?\n\nNeural nets and symbolic algorithms both have pros and cons. Neural networks are made up of layers of nodes with weighted connections that are adjusted during training to recognize patterns and learn from data. They are fast and creative, but they are also bound to make things up and can’t reliably answer questions beyond the scope of their training data.\n\nSymbolic systems, meanwhile, struggle to encompass ‘messy’ concepts, such as human language, that involve vast rule databases that are difficult to build and slow to search. But their workings are clear, and they are good at reasoning, using logic to apply their general knowledge to fresh situations.\n\nWhen put to use in the real world, neural networks that lack symbolic knowledge make classic mistakes: image generators might draw people with six fingers on each hand because they haven’t learnt the general concept that hands typically have five; video generators struggle to make a ball bounce around a scene because they haven’t learnt that gravity pulls things downwards. Some researchers blame such mistakes on a lack of data or computing power, but others say that the mistakes illustrate neural networks’ fundamental inability to generalize knowledge and reason logically.\n\nMany argue that adding symbolism to neural nets might be the best — even the only — way to inject logical reasoning into AI. The global technology firm IBM, for example, is backing neurosymbolic techniques as a path to AGI. But others remain sceptical: Yann LeCun, one of the fathers of modern AI and chief AI scientist at tech giant Meta, has said that neurosymbolic approaches are “incompatible” with neural-network learning.\n\nCan AI be truly creative?\n\nSutton, who is at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and won the 2024 Turing prize, the equivalent of the Nobel prize for computer science, holds firm to his original argument: “The bitter lesson still applies to today’s AI,” he told Nature. This suggests, he says, that “adding a symbolic, more manually crafted element is probably a mistake”.\n\nGary Marcus, an AI entrepreneur, writer and cognitive scientist based in Vancouver, Canada, and one of the most vocal advocates of neurosymbolic AI, tends to frame this difference of opinions as a philosophical battle that is now being settled in his favour.\n\nOthers, such as roboticist Leslie Kaelbling at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, say that arguments over which view is right are a distraction, and that people should just get on with whatever works. “I’m a magpie. I’ll do anything that makes my robots better.”\n\nMix and match\n\nBeyond the fact that neurosymbolic AI aims to meld the benefits of neural nets with the benefits of symbolism, its definition is blurry. Neurosymbolic AI encompasses “a very large universe”, says Marcus, “of which we’ve explored only a tiny bit”.\n\nThere are many broad approaches, which people have attempted to categorize in various ways. One option highlighted by many is the use of symbolic techniques to improve neural nets4. AlphaGeometry is arguably one of the most sophisticated examples of this strategy: it trains a neural net on a synthetic data set of maths problems produced using a symbolic computer language, making the solutions easier to check and ensuring fewer mistakes. It combines the two elegantly, says Colelough. In another example, ‘logic tensor networks’ provide a way to encode symbolic logic for neural networks. Statements can be assigned a fuzzy-truth value5: a number somewhere between 1 (true) and 0 (false). This provides a framework of rules to help the system reason.\n\nAnother broad approach does what some would say is the reverse, using neural nets to finesse symbolic algorithms. One problem with symbolic knowledge databases is that they are often so large that they take a very long time to search: the ‘tree’ of all possible moves in a game of Go, for example, contains about 10170 positions, which is unfeasibly large to crunch through. Neural networks can be trained to predict the most promising subset of moves, allowing the system to cut down how much of the ‘tree’ it has to search, and thus speeding up the time it takes to settle on the best move. That’s what Google’s AlphaGo did when it famously outperformed a Go grandmaster.",

          "authors": "Itai Yanai",
          "abstract": "Metamorphosis: A Natural and Human History Oren Harman Basic Books (2025)\n\n“Metamorphosis is wild,” marvels historian Oren Harman. A caterpillar completely dissolves inside its chrysalis, before reconstructing itself in the shape of a butterfly. The ‘immortal jellyfish’ (Turritopsis dohrnii) reverts from its mature, floating form into a polyp that dwells on the ocean bed when threatened, only to eventually turn back into a mature jellyfish again — never dying of old age.\n\nSurvival of the nicest: have we got evolution the wrong way round?\n\nHow such weird natural phenomena strike at the core of our understanding of biology is the focus of Harman’s beautiful book, Metamorphosis. The author uses the life stories of four scientists to argue that studies of metamorphosis — drastic changes in the body plan of an organism after birth — have been key to our understanding of the mechanisms of genetic inheritance, organismal development and evolution. It is a sweeping biography that is also part biology textbook, part cultural human history and part personal odyssey.\n\nHarman begins in the 1600s, when philosopher Aristotle’s influence on popular theories was still prevalent and science and magic co-existed in the minds of scholars. “In reports of the highest caliber, sightings of new planets lay side by side with sightings of unicorns and dogs who could bark in French,” he notes. Many people still adhered to Aristotle’s theory that spontaneous generation — the miraculous formation of a living organism from dead material — accounted for metamorphoses.\n\nIt was against this backdrop that naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian travelled to South America in 1699 to document the life cycles of insects. According to Aristotle, most insects are ‘imperfect’ animals — born in a state that is completely different from their adult form. Driven by her obsession with metamorphosis, Merian published an illustrated book on the insects of Suriname, which remains a classic for its demonstration of caterpillar–butterfly life cycles.\n\nAs Harman shows, the work of naturalists in the seventeenth century led to an understanding that, rather than appearing through spontaneous generation, animals arise from fertilized eggs. Later, studies of butterflies developing in their chrysalises contributed crucial insights to the debate on whether an organism builds itself from scratch, as we now know to be the case, or whether the adult form exists inside the egg and simply grows larger.\n\nBiology as history\n\nNext, Harman turns to zoologist Ernst Haeckel, a nineteenth-century adopter of Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Haeckel viewed it as ridiculous to expect that living organisms could be reduced to simply ‘cold’ physical forces, as his university professors thought. Nor did he take to the romanticism of the natural philosophers, who thought that vital forces animated living creatures.\n\nFrom egg to animal: retracing an embryo’s first steps\n\nInstead, Haeckel saw biology as a historical science and argued that the ways in which species develop are intimately tied to their evolution over eons. For example, the human embryo changes shape as it develops: from a single cell to a mass of cells, then a body that temporarily has a tail and gills, followed by webbed fingers that later separate as the embryo takes on its mature form. To Haeckel, “Nothing made more clear how we humans had once been amoebas, sea squirts, fish, amphibians, then four-legged mammals.”\n\nHaeckel dubbed this concept the biogenetic law and argued that it accounted for the apparent tendency of animals to become increasingly complex as they evolved. This tendency has been disproven as a law, but is sometimes still used as a rule of thumb. It is known by biologists today as ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\n\nA dragonfly transitioning to its adult form.Credit: Education Images/UIG/Getty\n\nHarman argues that metamorphosis is related to this concept, albeit tangentially, because the rate at which organisms metamorphose from a fertilized egg into their mature form can be explained by the biogenetic law. Haeckel emerges as an early forefather of the field that would come to be dubbed ‘evo-devo’.\n\nThe author also notes Haeckel’s tarnished legacy. He promoted theories of race that were related to his biogenetic law, which some historians have argued contributed to the rise of the Third Reich in Germany. Haeckel insisted on the supremacy of “civilized” Europeans and argued that, by flipping the lens of his biogenetic law, it was possible to predict how successful various groups of people would be — if development reveals secrets of the deep past, then it might also uncover aspects of the future of humanity.",

There, invertebrates emerged roughly 700 million years ago — some 200 million years before their spined cousins, the vertebrates.\n\n“The more I learned,” writes marine ecologist Drew Harvell, “about the critters in the oceans without backbones—the corals, sponges, worms, jellyfish, clams, crabs, and octopuses that make up 99 percent of diversity in the oceans—the more awe I felt in seeing the marvellous adaptations they had for getting food, reproducing, and avoiding their killers in an environment spinning with an abundance of life.” She calls her appealing book exploring this underwater universe, written after a lifetime of study, “a deep dive”.\n\nThe turning point of her career came while working on the remote Pacific shores of the Salish Sea, on the border between Canada and the United States. She witnessed that, when exposed to a predator, Bryozoa — creatures that resemble corals and are often referred to as ‘moss animals’ — grow “a forest of long, dense spines”. In other words, they shift into a form that is “as different as another species” is.\n\nHer tour of wondrous animals, from extremely strong corals to sponges that release compounds now used as drugs, shows how climate change threatens their existence. We need to conserve this “menagerie” — not least to ensure the survival of our own species.\n\nSex Is a Spectrum\n\nAgustín Fuentes Princeton Univ. Press (2025)\n\nA tropical Atlantic fish, the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), launches this fascinating book about sex. Females produce eggs and males make sperm. But if the group’s largest male gets killed, a female takes over by rapidly altering its reproductive organs to become the main sperm producer.\n\n“On the face of it, sex is a paradox,” writes anthropologist Agustín Fuentes. “Wouldn’t life be easier if organisms just kept copying themselves to reproduce?” In fact, he argues, the biology of sex does not entail a binary distinction. “It’s about patterns of variation in bodies, behaviour, and lives that differ, overlap and intertwine.” And this includes humans: women and men overlap more than is generally accepted. But, he admits, there is little academic agreement about human sexual orientation, other than that it is “complicated”.\n\nHe notes that this idea of overlap goes back a long way. In ancient Greece and Rome, philosophers and physicians such as Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen did not regard men and women as distinct beings with different biologies. Their view persisted through the Renaissance and into the early eighteenth century. Only then, especially during the nineteenth century, did the binary view prevail among scientists, epitomized in the works of Charles Darwin. But Darwin, for all his study of fishes, never encountered the bluehead wrasse.\n\nMāori anthropologist Mākereti Papakura studied and wrote about her community and culture.Credit: Mitchell Library/State Library of New South Wales\n\nIntrepid Women\n\nEd. Julia Nicholson Bodleian Library (2025)\n\nIn 1927, Mākereti Papakura, a Māori woman, enrolled as a student at the University of Oxford, UK — the first woman from an Indigenous community to do so. She and her family donated several Māori objects to Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum over her lifetime and after. In 1930, she died, aged 56, just before completing her thesis on Māori culture. In 2025, Oxford’s vice-chancellor posthumously awarded Papakura an MPhil in anthropology for her work, in the presence of more than 100 members of her family and community.\n\nA fascinating photograph of her in Māori dress forms the cover of Intrepid Women, a stunningly illustrated book inspired by an exhibition at the Pitt Rivers Museum in 2018–19. Edited by the exhibition’s co-curator Julia Nicholson, the book celebrates six pioneering anthropologists who did fieldwork between 1910 and 1957, when such work was frowned on for women. As Nicholson notes: “Some of these intrepid women had advantages of class, money and education,” but all faced the fact that “men held the positions of power and influence”.\n\nUnlike Papakura, the other five women studied communities other than their own for their research. Barbara Freire-Marreco lived with Pueblo peoples in the United States; Maria Czaplicka with reindeer herders in Siberia; Beatrice Blackwood with villagers in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands; Elsie McDougall with textile artists in Mexico and Guatemala; and Ursula Graham Bower with Naga people in northeastern India.\n\nMemory Lane\n\nCiara Greene & Gillian Murphy Princeton Univ. Press (2025)\n\nMolecular biologists examine memory through neurotransmitters such as dopamine; neuroscientists through groups of cells working in concert; and psychologists through organismal activity as a whole. None of these researchers considers memories to be stored in our brains in a filing system, unlike how people tend to imagine them while desperate to recall, say, a forgotten name.\n\nPsychologists Ciara Greene and Gillian Murphy’s universally appealing book discusses memory in terms of a neighbourhood, Memory Lane. It is a place that is “constantly under construction, with individual buildings being built, remodelled, and even razed to the ground”. In other words, it is a site for imperfect recollections, and memory recall is a reconstructive process. The authors’ goal “is to explain how this continuous reconstruction supports our daily activities, keeping our memories alive and lived in rather than perfectly preserved monuments to the past”.\n\nSuch reconstructions can, however, trigger false memories. Around 70% of wrongful US court convictions arise from an eyewitness’s misidentification. Greene and Murphy describe a woman who was convinced that she recalled the appearance of a man who raped her — she even picks him from a live line-up. After a decade in prison, the man is released when advances in DNA evidence identify the actual rapist. The woman, appalled by her false memory, subsequently became friends with the wrongly convicted man and they now work together to raise public awareness of misidentification.\n\nSleep Works\n\nSebastian P. Klinger Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (2025)\n\nMost humans spend one-third of their lives asleep, unaware of themselves. Before psychiatrist Hans Berger published, in 1929, the first study of electroencephalography — revealing the slumbering brain’s electrical activity — sleep science did not exist. Sleep was a mystery; Sigmund Freud excluded it from his influential 1899 study of dreams, arguing that dreamless sleep was inaccessible to science.\n\nHowever, physicians, drug manufacturers and writers, such as Franz Kafka and Marcel Proust, struggling with insomnia or an addiction to sleeping pills were keenly interested in sleep during those 30 intervening years. These groups preoccupy Sebastian Klinger, a cultural historian and literary scholar based in Freud’s home city, Vienna.\n\nKlinger’s engaging book ponders “What kind of activity is sleep? Who sleeps? How can we represent sleep?” He answers by bringing together three ways of thinking — scientific, pharmaceutical and literary. “By looking closely at the historical entanglements and interactions of these fields, we can gain an understanding into modernist culture that the familiar study of dreams does not supply.”\n\nThese connections can be disturbing. The barbiturate Veronal was sold as a sleeping aid from 1903 until the mid-1950s. The drug’s use led to instances of self-poisoning and some suicides. When a character took their own life in Hermann Broch’s 1930s novel The Sleepwalkers (Die Schlafwandler in German), “the mere mention of Veronal suffices to convey what has happened”.\n\nThe Age of Diagnosis\n\nSuzanne O’Sullivan Thesis (2025)\n\nIn 2019, the UK health secretary praised a direct-to-consumer genetic test that revealed his 15% risk of prostate cancer, and planned its widespread use. However, this statistic was not significant, given that the average lifetime risk for men is 18%, comments neurologist Suzanne O’Sullivan.\n\nHer riveting book — based on more than three decades of experience as a physician and clinical neurophysiologist — argues that new technologies can lead to overdiagnosis. Both doctors and patients often welcome a diagnosis. But it is “supposed to lead to something. Traditionally, it should explain symptoms, indicate next steps, introduce people to fellow sufferers”, she remarks. “New diagnostic criteria need to be measured more by their ability to make quality of life better—not by how many patients they can find.”\n\nPart of this growing problem is that a condition’s accepted diagnostic criteria might change over time, thus altering the number of people diagnosed with it. Autism spectrum disorder, first described by a psychiatrist in 1943, is a well-known example. Diagnoses increased by 787% in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2018, in part because physicians expanded the condition’s range of symptoms. A diagnosis of autism is welcomed by people “who are struggling and in need of help”, O’Sullivan observes. But she also notes the “potential impact of negative perceptions” and argues that the long-term outcomes of the recognition of “mild autism in adults” should be examined further.\n\nClamor\n\nChris Berdik W. W. Norton (2025)\n\nThe World Health Organization treats noise as a leading environmental threat. The European Environment Agency reported in 2020 that noise triggers some 48,000 cases of heart disease and causes 12,000 premature deaths every year. And the American Public Health Association argues that noise might be placing more than 100 million people at risk — children are among the most vulnerable.\n\nThe underlying problem, according to science writer Chris Berdik, is that “noise took over our world while we weren’t really listening”. “Sounds can trigger a visceral, even furious response from us in the moment, but barely a shrug when that moment passes,” Berdik notes.\n\nThis might explain why audiologists often struggle to persuade people to wear ear protection. Berdik illustrates this dilemma succinctly by noting that a man working in a factory whose hearing had worsened, according to tests, agreed to protect his ears only when informed that he would lose the ability to hear his favourite sounds: the “soft, high-pitched kiss of a trout” as it takes the fly at the end of his fishing line “and the little splash that followed”.\n\nDrawing on research in acoustics, neuroscience and urban planning, Berdik’s resonant book explores a phenomenon that is both familiar and unfamiliar to us all. Will his readers learn to listen and to make an effort to reduce the noise causing their chronic stress, sleep deprivation and related diseases?\n\nCuneiform, an ancient writing system, was used to jot down anything from accounts of barley distributions (pictured) to instructions on how to exorcize a ghost.Credit: Sepia Times/UIG/Getty\n\nBetween Two Rivers\n\nMoudhy Al-Rashid Hodder (2025)\n\nCuneiform is the world’s oldest writing system.

          "abstract": "Credit: Christopher Michel (CC-BY-SA-4.0)\n\nThe world has lost a giant of virology, molecular biology and science advocacy with the death of David Baltimore, at age 87. Baltimore demonstrated that RNA viruses that cause cancer contain an enzyme capable of directing the synthesis of DNA from an RNA template. We now know this enzyme as reverse transcriptase and the viruses as retroviruses, reflecting the backward flow of genetic information in this type of virus.\n\nThis is how the world finally ends the HIV/AIDS pandemic\n\nThe discovery of reverse transcriptase in 1970 explained a mystery in the capabilities of these viruses. It clarified how an RNA virus could generate a genomic copy of itself that could persist in the infected cell and be inherited by daughter cells. It also revealed how, much later, cells could produce further copies of the viral RNA. The idea that this mechanism could involve the formation of a DNA copy of the RNA genome was proposed by Howard Temin, who shared the 1975 medicine Nobel with Baltimore and Renato Dulbecco. But accepting this theory required unusual willingness on Baltimore’s part to challenge the central dogma of molecular biology — specifically, the principle that information flows in all living systems from DNA to RNA to protein.\n\nReverse transcriptase has become an essential tool in modern molecular biology, because the ability to make DNA copies of any RNA molecule, coupled with the extraordinary power of recombinant DNA methods, enables the characterization of the RNA molecules that define cell types and their functions.\n\nBaltimore was born and grew up in New York City. He graduated with a chemistry degree at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, in 1960. He then joined the graduate biology programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, before moving to The Rockefeller University in New York City, where he completed a PhD in animal virology. After a postdoc at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California, he returned to MIT in 1968 to establish his own group, where he made his first seminal discovery. His laboratory went on to show how reverse transcriptase orchestrates, through an extraordinarily complex series of steps, the formation of a double-stranded DNA copy of the single-stranded retroviral RNA genome.\n\nIt’s time to admit that genes are not the blueprint for life\n\nBaltimore uncovered aspects of the replication of many other viruses, including poliovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus. He discovered and characterized several cancer-causing genes, including the one encoding the v-abl tyrosine kinase in Abelson murine leukemia virus. The mammalian homologue, c-ABL, later proved to be the driver of chronic myeloid leukaemia in humans, a cancer now treated successfully with the kinase inhibitor Gleevec (imatinib) and its successors.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Conferences offer researchers from under-represented backgrounds a chance to network.Credit: Dave Kotinsky/Getty\n\nSeveral US conferences that bring together scientists from under-represented groups have seen their attendance levels drop this year, in the wake of funding cuts and directives from the administration of US President Donald Trump targeting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\n\nSuch conferences typically provide crucial networking opportunities for scientists from marginalized backgrounds, including Black, Latino and Indigenous researchers. Fewer people attending this year means fewer chances for students and scientists to advance their careers, says Allen Pierre-Louis, a physicist and PhD student at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. “This is another leak in the pipeline that was already not in a great place.”\n\nScientific conferences are leaving the US amid border fears\n\nThe crowds have been noticeably thinner than usual at some major conferences held in the past few months. Fewer than 700 scientists — compared with last year’s 1,100 — gathered last week at a joint meeting of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and the National Society of Hispanic Physicists (NSHP) in San Jose, California. And last month, there were only a few thousand attendees, rather than the usual 5,000–6,000, at a multidisciplinary science conference in Columbus, Ohio, organized by the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS).\n\nFederal agencies that would normally have exhibit booths at such meetings to promote their research, as well as staff members on site to speak to prospective employees, were also not present. Federal funding that is normally available to pay for students’ travel to these conferences has also dried up.\n\n“Investing in these students isn’t ‘charity’ — it’s essential for the nation’s scientific future,” says Mario Borunda, a physicist at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater and the NSHP president. “If we exclude brilliant minds because they can’t afford a plane ticket or because they don’t see themselves represented in the field, the US loses that talent forever.”\n\nProjects cancelled\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that directed the government to terminate programmes related to DEI, which it called “illegal and immoral discrimination”. Agencies soon began cancelling projects, affecting a wide swathe of researchers. One of those agencies was NASA, which terminated a US$530,000 grant that was meant to support the NSBP/NSHP meeting over three years.\n\nThat and other cuts left the conference with none of the federal funding it usually relies on, says Stephen Roberson, the NSBP president. “The reason given for this behaviour is because our organization is considered a DEI organization instead of a scientific non-profit organization,” he says. NASA did not respond to a request for comment from Nature.\n\nTrump called for ‘gold-standard science’: how the NIH, NSF and others are answering\n\nBecause of the cuts, the conference had to cut back on travel, lodging and other support it usually provides to students and other attendees. Without that support, “the costs become prohibitive for many people”, says Pierre-Louis, who is the student council representative on the NSBP board. “I think it sends a message to the country about who is doing science and is seen as being worthy of doing science.”\n\nThere is no ‘woke’ agenda to the meeting, Borunda notes: conference registration is open to anyone, and the talks are on scientific topics, including quantum and plasma physics. “There is a sense of solidarity here that remains strong,” he says.\n\nThe SACNAS conference, a meeting officially known as NDiSTEM, was held in Columbus last month, but many federal agencies and industry partners withdrew from participating because of Trump’s DEI directive and budget cuts, says the organization’s executive director, Juan Amador. One immediate consequence was that the conference lost much of the content meant to connect students with the latest in artificial intelligence (AI) research happening at government agencies and in the private sector. “With them being gone we didn’t have a whole lot of AI — that puts the students behind,” Amador says.",

          "abstract": "The Genesis Mission aims to provide researchers with the computing power and data sets necessary to train artificial-intelligence models.Credit: William Potter/iStock via Getty\n\nThe White House has launched a plan to accelerate research in the United States, by building artificial intelligence (AI) models on the rich scientific data sets held by the country’s 17 national laboratories, as well as harnessing their enormous computing resources.\n\nAn executive order issued on 24 November instructs the US Department of Energy (DoE) to create a platform through which academic researchers and AI firms can create powerful AI models using the government’s scientific data. Framed as part of a race for global technology dominance, it lists collaborations with technology firms including Microsoft, IBM, OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, as well as quantum-computing companies such as Quantinuum. Such a vast public–private partnership would give companies unprecedented access to federal scientific data sets for AI-driven analysis.\n\nThe effort, dubbed the Genesis Mission, aims to “double the productivity and impact of American research and innovation within a decade”, in a variety of fields from fusion energy to medicine. The project expects to “unlock breakthroughs in medicine, energy, materials science and beyond”, says Michael Kratsios, the US president’s science adviser. It also aims to build AI agents — general models with the ability to harness tools such as specialized software and coding suites — that can generate hypotheses and automate research workflows.\n\nLabs around the world are already training AI systems on scientific data, to boost their capabilities in scientific domains and attempting to use AI models to make discoveries. But some researchers remain sceptical that general AI tools are capable of making truly fresh insights, and warn that their inherent flaws make the value of agents unclear.\n\nThe new US initiative formalizes and expands ongoing AI research efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump. “The impact is that it enables many more scientists and researchers to have access to all of the infrastructure that they need to explore important scientific questions that the country cares about,” says Lynne Parker, a robotics engineer at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who led AI-policy initiatives for the administrations of Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, but was not involved in the current initiative. “That really has not been possible before.”\n\nSupercomputers at national laboratories, including the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, will probably be used as part of the Genesis Mission.Credit: Argonne National Laboratory/Getty\n\nTrump’s team has been working to funnel money and attention to AI projects even as it tries to gut federal research spending more broadly. The White House has the power to shape the direction of research at the DoE’s network of national laboratories. It did not give an estimated price tag for the AI initiative; any extra funding beyond the laboratories’ normal budgets would have to be approved by the US Congress.\n\nNature looks at how the project might affect researchers and AI companies, and its promises and risks.\n\nWhat are government-funded scientists being asked to do?\n\nThe scale and timeline of the plan is ambitious. In 60 days, the DoE is expected to create a list of 20 potential science and technology challenges for the project to tackle, in areas of national priorities such as nuclear fusion, quantum information science and crucial materials. The agency is supposed to create a full inventory of available federal computing resources and identify initial data assets to use, then work out how to safely include external data sets. The administration expects to demonstrate the platform’s capability for one of these research challenges in nine months.\n\nThese early steps will probably build on projects that are already under way at the national laboratories. For instance, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee has been working on advancing AI research using a hybrid approach that uses both quantum and classical computing. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California is using AI to find ways to speed up network traffic.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nThe “DoE has been making a case for ‘AI for science’ for over seven years, and this executive order is the starting pistol to get on with it”, says Michael Norman, an astrophysicist at the University of California, San Diego, and former director of the San Diego Supercomputer Center. “It is an exciting direction indeed.”\n\nWhat are companies being asked to do?\n\nThe project has named more than 50 collaborating companies, including some that have already been working on their own ‘AI scientists’. FutureHouse, a start-up based in San Francisco, California, for instance, launched a commercially available, AI-driven research platform earlier this month.\n\nThe precise role of these private companies in the Genesis plan remains unclear — although Trump’s executive order says the project will entail “collaboration with external partners possessing advanced AI, data, or computing capabilities or scientific domain expertise”. Such partnerships could include research agreements to jointly develop technologies, or a user-facility agreement for external researchers to conduct work in government facilities. Chip-manufacturing and computer companies such as NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have reportedly agreed to build facilities in national labs, according to a report by The New York Times.\n\nThree ways ex-CDC chief says that Trump team is sidelining science\n\nSome partnerships are already under way. In October, for instance, Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois announced a partnership with NVIDIA and technology firm Oracle to build two next-generation AI supercomputing systems. At least two national laboratories already have arrangements with the company OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, to host local AI models that can process classified data on computers in the facilities. In February, the company held an ‘AI jam session’ with researchers from nine US national labs that allowed scientists to test the use of OpenAI’s reasoning models in their specific domains.\n\nWhat are the opportunities?\n\nThe new Genesis Mission is meant to provide “secure access to appropriate datasets, including proprietary, federally curated, and open scientific datasets, in addition to synthetic data generated through DOE computing resources”, according to the executive order. Creating a national-scale platform that harnesses rich data sets usually housed in the walls of the national laboratories could be a boon for researchers. Although task-specific models such as the protein-folding model AlphaFold were built on open scientific data sets, general-purpose AI systems such as OpenAI’s GPT-5 are thought to be largely built on data scraped from the Internet.\n\nIt isn’t yet clear which data sets would be involved, but possible candidates include information gathered at facilities such as the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. That facility collects neutron-scattering data, which illuminate how materials behave at the atomic scale, says Georgia Tourassi, the lab's associate director for computing and computational sciences. “From atomistic measurements to exascale simulations, such data sets can immediately accelerate the development of trustworthy, science-capable AI models,” she says.",

          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "CAR T cells (pictured) are being used to treat autoimmune diseases.Credit: Eye Of Science/SPL\n\nEngineered immune cells are being used to successfully treat people with a range of debilitating autoimmune conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used to treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.\n\nCAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.\n\nThe use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells1. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment2, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.\n\nSimon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms any more,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”\n\nCAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for several types of cancer since it was first approved to treat blood cancers in 2017.\n\nA new frontier\n\nUlcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.\n\nIn September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis3. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.\n\nEarlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus4. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs5. Last year, Du was also involved in a world-first study of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases6.\n\nAs part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.\n\nThe results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Some German universities, such as the University of Hamburg, are trying to add more permanent research positions.Westend61 / Getty Images\n\nAfter 13 years of jumping between temporary contracts at German institutions, Dorothée Goetze, who was a history postdoc, was fed up. So in 2021, when she was offered a full-time, permanent lecturing position at Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall she leapt at the opportunity.\n\nPart of the reason for leaving was simple: the permanence of the new post, a rarity both in and outside Germany. But Goetze says that there were other troubling aspects of German academia that led her to expand her job search. “When I started to look at other countries, I realized that there are other ways to structure an academic system.”\n\nAlthough Germany has become a hub for international students and researchers, attracting a growing number of foreign scholars each year, those who remain in academia after graduation often face an intensely hierarchical system with few permanent positions. This has led many, including Goetze, to search for jobs at universities and research institutions outside the country — or, in some cases, to leave academia completely.\n\nNature Career Guide: Germany\n\nLast year, the Postdoc Network of the Max Planck Society published a survey of close to 900 postdocs from 74 of the 85 Max Planck Institutes, in which only one-quarter of international respondents said that they were sure they wanted to stay in Germany after their postdoc (see go.nature.com/486jceo). A similar survey by the postdoc network of the Leibniz Association revealed that some 42% of respondents had considered moving abroad (see go.nature.com/3xesmtz).\n\n“There are a lot of good reasons to embark on a PhD or research career in Germany,” says Shyam Krishnan, a stem-cell biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology in Jena, Germany, and a spokesperson for the Leibniz PostDoc Network. These include the country’s globally respected research profile and ample opportunities for funding and collaborations, according to Krishnan.\n\nHowever, it is not always possible for early-career researchers to take advantage of these benefits — for example, most are on short-term contracts that don’t align with the long grant-application processes, Krishnan says. “When it comes to career paths, it becomes really difficult, especially for people coming from abroad.”\n\nA popular destination\n\nIn 2025, Germany had the fourth highest number of international students globally, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a figure totalling around 423,000 people.\n\nThe number of international students in Germany has steadily increased in the past decade, thanks to factors such as the affordability of education, a high quality of life and employment opportunities after graduation. Between 2013 and 2023, the Wissenschaft weltoffen report — using data from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) — highlighted a 74% rise in the number of foreign students enrolled at German universities. The majority of these individuals were in bachelor’s or master’s programmes.\n\nA structured system: the secrets of Germany’s scientific reputation\n\nInternational scholars are also common at the postdoctoral level and above. In 2022, foreign nationals made up around 15% of academic staff members across German universities — encompassing all roles from graduate-student research assistants to professors. At the Max Planck institutes, which employ the highest proportion of foreign scholars, more than half of the researchers come from abroad.\n\nThese numbers will probably continue to rise. In the past few months alone, there have been several announcements of initiatives aimed at recruiting international students and scholars. In October, for example, the DAAD launched Academic Horizons, a funding programme that helps universities to attract international scholars to master’s and doctoral programmes in disciplines such as artificial intelligence and quantum technology.\n\nThere are also several efforts aimed at attracting talent from the United States, where cuts to science funding and decreased workforce numbers have led many researchers to consider leaving the country. The Volkswagen Foundation, for example, recently announced the Transatlantic Bridge Professorships, which will provide financial support for US-based professors who are working on topics such as democracy and academic freedom to conduct their work in Germany.\n\nTo stay or to leave?\n\nAlthough Germany is an attractive destination for scholars, those who remain in the academic system after their doctoral studies face notable challenges. Two of the frequently cited issues are a lack of job security, owing to the lack of permanent positions, and a strictly hierarchical system that places a disproportionate amount of power in the hands of a few.\n\nIn German academia, short-term contracts are the norm: according to the 2025 National Report on Early Career Researchers (known as the BuWik), a mere 4% of early-career researchers are not on a temporary contract (see go.nature.com/4i78g4o). Older and more-experienced researchers tend to be in more permanent positions — this includes 38% of doctorate holders aged between 40 and 45 and 28% of junior research group leaders.\n\nAre these the happiest PhD students in the world?\n\nIn a bid to alleviate this problem, the German government passed the Academic Fixed-Term Contract Act in 2007 (also known as the Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz, or WissZeitVG; see go.nature.com/48kzoyl). This law limits the time that early-career researchers can be placed on fixed-term contracts to, in most cases, six years pre-PhD and six years post-PhD (nine years after medicine PhDs), with the intention of encouraging universities to hire these researchers permanently, rather than keeping them temporarily employed indefinitely.\n\nHowever, critics of the WissZeitVG argue that it backfired because it failed to lead to a growth in permanent positions. They say that it instead forces researchers out of academia — leading to knock-on effects such as lower-quality research and a loss of qualified personnel. “What universities do in most cases is say, ‘We cannot employ you temporarily any more, so we won’t employ you,’” says Mathias Kuhnt, a sociology postdoc at the Dresden University of Technology.\n\nIn some fields, such as social science and the humanities, contracts are not only short-term; they’re also often part-time. Amrei Bahr, a philosopher at the University of Stuttgart, has had fixed-term, mostly part-time contracts during and after her doctoral studies. Now, with her non-tenure-track junior professorship, Bahr is on a four-year contract with a possible two-year extension. “If I get the two years, I will be 42 once this is over,” Bahr says. “Then I will probably drop out.” Bahr is currently applying for other, longer-term professorships, but given the dearth of these positions, dropping out of academia is a likely outcome.\n\nPlanning an exit\n\nBahr is not alone. In 2024, the DZHW published a Barometer for Science report — a nationwide survey that included more than 11,000 academics in Germany — which revealed that 57% of researchers had contemplated leaving academia in the past two years (see go.nature.com/3jdogk0). Among postdocs on fixed-term contracts (which make up the majority), this rose to 71%. Work–life balance, workload and the WissZeitVG were cited as contributing factors.\n\nHistorian Astrid Wendel-Hanson left Germany for a position with a longer-term contract.Marten Puidak\n\n“Germany is incredibly valuable in terms of the resources it has for academics,” says Astrid Wendel-Hanson, a historian who moved to Germany after her PhD, but left earlier this year after accepting a position as an associate professor at Tallin University in Estonia. “But it can be very difficult to stay optimistic and to remain in a system that seems to actively be trying to push you away.” Although one of the reasons for the move was to be closer to family, Wendel-Hanson’s new contract is four years long — longer than what would be permitted under the WissZeitVG.\n\nGermany is not the only country with precarious employment in academia, however. According to a 2024 OECD report, in Australia, casual hires — those on hourly or seasonal contracts — make up the majority of academic staff members, and in the United States, part-time and non-tenure-track positions are increasingly becoming the norm (OECD. The State of Academic Careers in OECD Countries; 2024).",

          "title": "ADHD diagnoses are growing. What’s going on?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "In some parts of the world, record numbers of people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the United States, for example, government researchers last year reported that more than 11% of children had received an ADHD diagnosis at some point in their lives1 — a sharp increase from 2003, when around 8% of children had (see ‘ADHD among US boys and girls’).\n\nWhy is autism really on the rise? What the science says\n\nBut now, top US health officials argue that diagnoses have spiralled out of control. In May, the Make America Healthy Again Commission — led by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — said ADHD was part of a “crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment” and suggested that ADHD medications did not help children in the long term.\n\nSo what, exactly, is going on?\n\nOne thing that’s clear is that several factors — including improved detection and greater awareness of ADHD — are causing people with symptoms to receive a diagnosis and treatment, whereas they wouldn’t have years earlier. Clinicians say this is especially true for women and girls, whose pattern of symptoms was often missed in the past. Although some specialists are concerned about the risks of overdiagnosis, many are more worried that too many people go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nAt the same time, the rise in awareness and diagnoses of ADHD has fuelled a public debate about how it should be viewed and how best to provide support, including when medication is required. The emergence of the neurodiversity movement is challenging the view of ADHD as a disorder that should be ‘treated’, and instead proposes that it’s a difference that should be better understood and supported — with more focus on adapting schools and workplaces, for instance.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\n“I do have a big problem with ‘disorder’,” says Jeff Karp, a biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who has ADHD. “It’s the school system that’s disordered. It’s not the kids.”\n\nBut many clinicians and people with ADHD argue that it is associated with difficulties — ranging from academic struggles to an increased chance of injuries and substance misuse — that justify its label as a medical condition, and say that medication is an important and effective part of therapy for many people.\n\n“I hear a lot of people talking about ADHD being a gift and a superpower, and I do applaud that,” says Jeremy Didier, a clinician specializing in ADHD who is president of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a non-profit US group based in Lanham, Maryland, and who has ADHD herself. “But I do not want to downplay the impact that ADHD can have on someone’s life when it’s either undiagnosed or poorly managed.”\n\nShe and others say both models — neurodiversity and medical — have merit. “Bringing those two together in a meaningful and productive way, I think that’s maybe the biggest challenge” for the field, says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.\n\nA real rise\n\nA slew of studies suggests that diagnoses of ADHD have gone up in many high-income countries in the past two to three decades — similar to a rise in autism diagnoses (see ‘ADHD on the rise’). The rate of new ADHD diagnoses in the United Kingdom, for example, doubled in boys and quadrupled in girls between 2000 and 2018, according to one study2. In adults, the rate shot up even more. “We have numbers suggesting that we’re seeing a rise,” says Max Wiznitzer, a paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nSource: US CDC NHIS Annu. Rep. (https://go.nature.com/3XEGYXJ).\n\nSo what explains the surge? It doesn’t seem to be a big rise in the prevalence of the symptoms and traits that characterize ADHD — namely hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, researchers say. When scientists use standard procedures to rigorously assess symptoms in representative samples of a population, they find that the ‘true’ prevalence of ADHD is fairly consistent in different parts of the world — estimated at around 5.4% in children3 and 2.6% in adults4, according to two comprehensive global studies.\n\nExperts say there are several reasons these figures are much lower than the 11% diagnosis level in US children that the country’s health authorities reported last year1. That number comes from the US National Survey of Children’s Health conducted in 2022, in which parents were asked whether a doctor or other health-care provider had ever said their child has ADHD. But this method of assessing prevalence would lead to inflated counts, says Luis Rohde, a psychiatrist and ADHD specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Some children were probably misdiagnosed — perhaps by a physician without specialist training — and would not be classified as having ADHD in a thorough clinical evaluation. Some parents might have misremembered, perhaps if they were told that their child had symptoms without a formal diagnosis, he says. And some children who once had a diagnosis would no longer have received one at the time of the survey if their symptoms had waned and they were reassessed.\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nResearchers and specialists highlight other factors that are likely to be driving up the number of diagnoses. One is a change in diagnostic criteria in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In the fourth edition of this widely used manual, introduced in 1994, a child or adult ADHD diagnosis required the presence of at least six of a list of nine inattention symptoms and/or six or more of nine hyperactivity symptoms, and stipulated that these had to be present before the age of seven. (This reflects the idea that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises during childhood brain development.)\n\nWhen the fifth edition, DSM-V, arrived in 2013, the criteria were slightly relaxed. Symptoms had to be present before age 12, and adult diagnosis required a minimum of five symptoms. (Children still had to have at least six.) “So when we expand the criteria, obviously you increase a little bit the prevalence,” says Rohde, who was involved in those revisions. It has also become more common for clinicians to diagnose ADHD along with other conditions, when in the past they tended to focus on one, says Bölte: “That fuels the figures.” ADHD commonly occurs with autism, as well as with anxiety, depression and other disorders.\n\nThe impairment requirement\n\nToday, a thorough ADHD assessment involves collecting a detailed history and completing behaviour questionnaires, including input from family members and, for children, from schools. In the United States, the condition can be diagnosed by a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, other mental-health specialists and primary-care physicians such as paediatricians, who might not have dedicated training in ADHD. But countries differ: in Brazil and many other low- and middle-income nations, people with ADHD symptoms tend to be sent to neurologists and psychiatrists for ADHD assessment and diagnoses, and there is a shortage of such specialists, Rohde says.\n\nThe DSM-V defines three ‘presentations’ of ADHD. People with ‘predominantly inattentive’ ADHD show symptoms such as making careless mistakes, struggling to sustain attention, losing things and being easily distracted. Those with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have traits such as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively and interrupting others. In a third, combined presentation, people show both sets of symptoms. A diagnosis requires that symptoms are present for at least six months and in two or more settings (such as school, home, work); are not explained by another condition such as anxiety; and cause an impairment, such as struggling with schoolwork, losing a job or having relationship problems.\n\nIllustration by Ada Zielińska\n\nThe impairment requirement is key, clinicians say. These traits vary across the population: some individuals are very hyperactive or inattentive, and some not at all. But people tend to be diagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms significantly interfere with their lives. “The medical part of ADHD comes in when your life is becoming derailed,” says Margaret Sibley, a specialist in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nBölte says that clinicians are interpreting the diagnostic criteria “far more liberally and openly” than in the past. This is another factor — aside from changes in the diagnostic criteria — that is driving the apparent surge in ADHD.\n\nBut working out when someone crosses the impairment line involves a subjective and sometimes tricky judgement, say specialists. And there is an ongoing debate about whether a person’s level of impairment should be defined relative to their own potential or to a population average.\n\nWhat’s clear is that more parents as well as children are deemed as crossing that threshold. Wiznitzer says that when he diagnoses a child, “almost invariably [one of] the parents has it”, too. (That’s because genes are a major contributor to ADHD: the disorder has a heritability5 of roughly 70–80%.) Even though the parents were probably symptomatic as children, many were not identified as having the condition, he says. But now, they are.\n\nADHD on TikTok\n\nAnother reason why diagnoses have surged is an increase in public awareness of ADHD — fuelled by an explosion of discussion on TikTok and other social media.\n\nInformation online “connects with some people who have had these symptoms and impairments for a long time, but never understood what they were,” says Sibley. That leads them to seek information and professional help, pushing diagnoses up. And people might be eager to receive a diagnosis if it allows them to access help and services for themselves or a child, such as adaptations to support learning at school.\n\nThe surge in ADHD has led to concerns, particularly in the United States, about questionable diagnoses being given without a thorough clinical evaluation — through online services, for example, or by medical professionals without ADHD training. “They’ve got a visit for 15 or 20 minutes, and the diagnosis is made,” says Stephen Hinshaw, a specialist in child and adolescent mental health and ADHD at the University of California, Berkeley. But Didier says that a bigger problem is the number of people with ADHD who are undiagnosed or untreated. She emphasizes how important it is for people to have access to a thorough, accurate assessment from a trained professional who specializes in ADHD.\n\nThe lack of recognition of ADHD is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, says Rohde. “The problem here is clearly underdiagnosis, stigma and undertreatment,” he says, which particularly affects “vulnerable people and communities”.\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nMany specialists say they’re observing a rapid rise of diagnoses in girls and women6. In part, that’s thought to be because women and girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattention — rather than more-noticeable hyperactivity — and to find organizational and other strategies that ‘mask’ those symptoms. Didier says that, despite being an ADHD specialist and diagnosing the condition in three of her sons, she and other ADHD practitioners missed the signs and symptoms in her daughter until she was a teenager. “It’s egregious that we don’t have more research on ADHD trajectories in women,” Sibley says.\n\nChanges in the world itself are yet another possible contributor to increased diagnoses. Some researchers speculate that schools, work, technology and other aspects of modern lives have become so complex and taxing that they are pushing more people beyond the threshold of impairment. In Sweden, says Bölte, schools are sometimes chaotic, with complex schedules and grading systems. “Many students are very confused and fed up with school and do not understand it any more,” he says.\n\nA study published last year7 revealed that parents think their children are struggling more. The research team examined how parents viewed the ADHD symptoms of more than 27,000 nine-year-old children born in Sweden. Parents consulted in 2016–18 tended to say that their children were more impaired than did parents consulted in 2004–06, even though their kids had the same number of symptoms. “Environment around the child is crucial,” says Samuele Cortese, who studies ADHD at the University of Southampton, UK, and was involved in the work.\n\nContext is key\n\nKarp describes ADHD as “context-dependent”. In a school where children are expected to sit still and be quiet, “it makes these traits seem like a problem”, he says. But when someone with ADHD is in an environment that nurtures and empowers them, they “can then channel their neurotype to do incredible things”. Karp is not against medication — and sometimes takes it himself — but would like more emphasis on institutions and society evolving so that people with ADHD can thrive.\n\nResearchers, meanwhile, are finding evidence that the severity of symptoms can vary over time. In a 2021 study, Sibley and her colleagues analysed detailed records of more than 550 children who were diagnosed with ADHD and followed for up to 16 years8. The researchers found that 64% of young people had fluctuations in ADHD — times when their symptoms faded but then recurred.\n\nSibley and her team hypothesized that people’s symptoms might flare up when they were facing increased demands in their lives, such as when starting a new school or having a child. But in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, according to a later analysis by Sibley and her colleagues9. This could be because people are able to take on more responsibility when their symptoms abate. But the alternative explanation — one that has “really resonated”, Sibley says — is that people with ADHD need a degree of activity and accountability in their lives to perform and stay engaged. Sibley thinks there might be a U-shaped curve: too many or too few demands and obligations mean that people with ADHD don’t function at their best — but at a “sweet spot”, they do.",

Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/Science Photo Library\n\nIn a technological tour de force, researchers have sequenced the whole genomes of more than 100 individual cells from one 74-year-old man. The results exposed chaos within: an extra chromosome arm here, a missing chunk of chromosome there, and smaller snippets of DNA altered, deleted or duplicated. In several of the cells, the Y chromosome had been lost entirely.\n\n“There were some cells in there that were very messed up,” says Joe Luquette, who studies bioinformatics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and is an author of the study.\n\nCancer drugs are closing in on some of the deadliest mutations\n\nThe findings, which were posted earlier this month on the preprint server bioRxiv1 and have not yet been peer reviewed, paint a comprehensive portrait of the genetic variation present within a person. That portrait is just the beginning: the study is a pilot project for a US$140-million consortium that aims to catalogue mutations in cells from 19 sites in the body, using cells from 150 donors2.\n\nThe resulting catalogue will provide a valuable tool for researchers studying the influence of genetic variation between the cells of a single individual — a phenomenon known as mosaicism — on health and on diseases such as cancer, says Soichi Sano, who studies mosaicism in the cardiovascular system at Japan’s National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center in Suita. “I’m sure that this field will be accelerated very rapidly,” he says.\n\nA lifetime of mutations\n\nPeople accumulate changes to their DNA over the course of their life, whether from errors that occur during DNA replication and repair, or from exposure to DNA-damaging environmental factors, such as ultraviolet light or tobacco smoke.\n\nAs DNA-sequencing technologies have improved, researchers have gained a clearer picture of how common mosaicism is, and how it can affect health. The accumulation of DNA mutations in some cells over time can cause cancer, for example, and loss of the Y chromosome in blood cells is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease3 and fatal heart attack4.\n\n‘Phenomenal’ tool sequences DNA and tracks proteins — without cracking cells open\n\nBut it is difficult to catalogue those differences or to determine when in life they arise. Most genome sequencing is performed by isolating DNA from many cells at once and sequencing it in bulk, making it difficult to detect DNA variants that are present in only one or a few cells. And although methods for analysing the genomes of a single cell are becoming more advanced, these techniques often focus on sequencing RNA molecules, which can be present in many copies per cell, says Diane Shao, a neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who has studied mosaicism in the developing brain5. It is a much greater challenge to sequence DNA from individual cells, because there are only two copies of the genome to work with, she says.",

Many scientists walked away dismayed and disappointed.\n\nDespite years of commitments and research that have laid the groundwork for action, the climate summit achieved “essentially nothing”, says Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.\n\nBut, there were some signs of hope that multilateralism can tackle climate change. Over the course of two weeks, representatives from nearly 200 governments worked through hot days, long nights, a fire in the venue and numerous protests — including by Indigenous groups and others fighting for the protection of the Amazon and other tropical forests.\n\nHeatwaves linked to emissions of individual fossil-fuel and cement producers\n\nIn the end, governments agreed to a package of measures that pushes forward discussions on financial aid and a new ‘just transition’ mechanism designed to ensure a fair and equitable shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. A glaring omission was language calling for the creation of road maps to phase out fossil fuels and halt deforestation, but Brazil has announced it will push those ideas forward independently of the COP process.\n\nHere, Nature takes a look at the results from COP30 and what comes next.\n\nSidestepping fossil fuels\n\nThe summit failed to deliver major new pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. Of the 194 entities and countries that sent representatives to COP30, roughly 80 didn’t submit new commitments for 2035, as required under the accord, and the rest submitted weak pledges that are unlikely to alter the global trajectory. As a result, scientists with the Climate Action Tracker consortium still project that the world is on track for upwards of 2.6 ° C of warming by 2100.\n\n“The new commitments don’t even move the needle,” says Niklas Höhne, a climate-policy researcher at the NewClimate Institute, an environmental think tank based in Berlin. “It’s really a sign that countries have limited appetite to support something more ambitious on climate.”\n\nFossil fuels took centre stage briefly. More than 80 countries joined Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the call for the creation of a road map to phase out fossil fuels, but the proposal ultimately foundered after reported opposition from oil-producing nations including Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the idea isn’t dead yet. Brazil promised to push forwards with it independently of the COP process, while the governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced that they would host the first global conference on the just transition away from fossil fuels in April next year.\n\nProtesters carrying signs that read “our forests are not for sale” broke through security lines of the COP30 climate talks on 12 November.Credit: Pablo Porciuncula/AFP via Getty\nFinancing climate action\n\nOne of the largest disputes at the summit was who should pay for climate action and help developing nations to prepare for and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of global warming. Progress was made: wealthier nations committed to tripling the amount of money they provide to help low-income countries tackle global warming — to US$300 billion annually by 2035. The agreement also carries forward a broader goal of boosting the total to $1.3 trillion annually from all sources, including private investments.\n\nBut questions remain about how this will be financed. Previous deals on climate action have been plagued by delays in achieving financial goals as well as by disagreements about how much money should come from publicly funded grants, as opposed to loans and private investments.\n\nChina pledges to cut emissions by 2035: what does that mean for the climate?\n\nThe final deal at COP30 lays out a process to clarify these issues over the next two years. It’s a step towards ensuring that wealthy countries meet their responsibilities to provide climate finance to those in need, says Jodi-Ann Wang, who researches equity and climate finance at the London School of Economics and Political Science.",

Although a patchwork of national and regional regulations exists, for many countries binding rules are still being fleshed out.\n\nIn October, at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country’s proposal to create a body known as the World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization (WAICO), which would bring nations together as a step towards creating a global governance system for AI.\n\nChina seeks self-reliance in science in next five-year plan\n\nThe proposal is part of a wider drive to be at the helm of efforts to govern AI, in contrast to a US approach that is focused on deregulation. When it comes to transparency and AI policy, “China is the good guy at the moment,” Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton, UK, told reporters at an event in London in October.\n\nMany hurdles lie in the way to creating a binding intergovernmental agreement on AI, but some advocates say it is possible, comparing the technology to other risky but useful endeavours for which agreements exist, such as nuclear power and aviation. Nature looks at China’s approach, what a global AI governance body might look like and its chance of success.\n\nHow does the Chinese AI ecosystem differ from those of other countries?\n\nEncouraged by the government, Chinese firms tend to release models as open weight, meaning that they can be downloaded and built on. And compared with Western nations, China has less of a focus on making machines that could outsmart humans — often referred to as artificial general intelligence — and is instead concentrating on a race to use AI to drive economic growth. This is exemplified by a policy introduced in August called AI+, says Kwan Yee Ng, who leads international AI governance at Concordia AI, a Beijing-based consultancy that focuses on AI safety.\n\nHow does China approach AI regulation?\n\nChina was among the first nations to introduce AI-specific regulations, beginning in 2022, and has wide-ranging rules on harmful content, privacy and data security, for example. Developers of public-facing AI-powered services must let Chinese regulators test their systems ahead of deployment, says Ng. The result is that models such as those developed by the Hangzhou-based company DeepSeek, which found world fame with its R1 model earlier this year, are among “the most regulated in the world”, says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. Despite this, the authorities often take a soft approach to enforcing that regulation, says Angela Zhang, a law researcher and specialist in AI regulation at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.\n\nBy contrast, the United States has no comprehensive legislation on AI at the federal level, and in January President Donald Trump revoked an executive order aimed at ensuring AI safety. He has positioned his administration as pro-industry, last month suggesting in a social-media post that it would add a clause to a federal bill to prevent states from regulating AI. The European Union approach has been to classify AI systems by risk level, with different rules relating to transparency and oversight at each tier, and obligations that came into force in August, aimed at the most powerful AI systems. The UK government, meanwhile, has shelved plans to introduce comprehensive AI legislation until next year, at the earliest.\n\nWhat international legislation exists to govern AI?\n\nVery little. The only legally binding international regulation comes from the Council of Europe, an international organization of European member states, separate from the European Union, which established its Framework Convention on AI in May 2024. The treaty commits any signatory country to implementing its broad obligations — such as ensuring that AI activities align with human rights — through their national laws. But there are no sanctions or a supranational enforcement body, says Lucia Velasco, an economist and researcher at the Oxford Martin School’s AI Governance Initiative, who is based in New York.\n\nCompanies and nations have also signed various non-binding agreements, such as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, the OECD AI Principles and the Bletchley Declaration, an international agreement signed by 28 countries at the UK AI Safety Summit in 2023. Several expert groups have produced documents outlining the risks, one of the most prominent being the International AI Safety Report. The United Nations (UN) is running a ‘dialogue’ process and has created a scientific panel to guide countries’ regulatory efforts.\n\nWhat has China proposed?\n\nWAICO would be a way for countries to coordinate AI governance rules while “fully respecting the differences in national policies and practices” and championing the global south, Chinese officials have said. China has proposed that the body’s headquarters be in Shanghai, but other details remain uncertain.\n\nWAICO looks unlikely to govern AI directly in any enforceable way (and China has said it backs a UN approach to governing global AI) but it could be a route for countries to gradually coalesce around a framework.\n\nXi’s call to create WAICO was at least the fourth such push from a Chinese official in four months, suggesting the idea is important to the government, says Ng. One reason is commercial, says Zhang. “The fact that China is able to set standards helps China’s product diffusion all over the world,” she says.\n\nThe move also gives China some diplomatic cachet. “China is trying to be like [an older] brother to the global south, arguing ‘we also need to have our voice in the governance of AI and not be dictated to’,” says Zhang.\n\nWhat would a global form of governance look like?\n\nWe don’t know. AI-safety experts often cite nuclear-power regulation and the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency as an analogy, says Ng. Standards set by the UN agency are non-binding but are complemented by legally binding treaties it helped to forge, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety.",

          "abstract": "The Max Planck Institutes in Germany house cutting-edge equipment, such as this ultra-high vacuum facility at The Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics in Halle. Credit: Hendrik Schmidt/dpa/ALAMY\n\nIn 2019, shortly after finishing her master’s at Nanjing University in China, Xinyi Zhao opened an e-mail to learn that she had been offered a PhD position at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. “When I told my parents, they asked me to double-check whether the offer was real, as they weren’t familiar with the institute.” But Zhao knew of its glowing scientific reputation. “I felt very excited but also quite surprised,” says Zhao. “I heard they do amazing research.” Six years on, she’s still happily employed in Germany, now as a postdoc at the Berlin-based Max Planck Institute for Human Development.\n\nNature Career Guide: Germany\n\nBetween 2012 and 2022, the number of international scientists at the country’s four largest non-university research organizations doubled, from 8,115 to 16,6251. These institutes — the Max Planck Society, the Leibniz Association, the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres and the Fraunhofer Society — all ranked among the world's top 20 non-profit organizations for research output in 2025, according to the Nature Index Research Leaders. The country’s universities also maintain a strong international profile, with 8 included in the world’s top 100, as reported in the Times Higher Education’s 2026 World University Rankings.\n\nXinyi Zhao, a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, likes the research environment in Germany. Credit: Sarah Otterstetter / Max Planck Institute for Human Development\n\nGermany’s success in academic-excellence rankings lies partly in the structure of its scientific ecosystem — in which each research organization specializes in a particular kind of science — alongside the remarkably stable flow of public research funding. “Germany is a country without natural resources,” says Otmar Wiestler, former president of the Helmholtz Association. “We don’t have cheap labour. All we have is the brains of our people.” As a result, he adds, “the German government is really committed to promoting research and innovation”.\n\nStreamlined systems\n\nIn 2023, around 3.1% of Germany’s gross domestic product (GDP) — roughly €132 billion (US$152 billion) — was spent on research and development, a lower percentage than those of Israel (6%) and the United States (3.4%), but higher than the relative research spending of the United Kingdom (2.6%) and China (2.7%). Around one-third of this spending was from the public sector and the rest came from private industry. German governmental support for science has remained stable throughout various political leaderships. In the past 20 years, “we have never had a year where federal spending has decreased”, says Max Voegler, the vice-president of Global Strategic Networks for Germany, Austria and Switzerland at the Amsterdam-based academic publisher Elsevier, who co-wrote a report on Germany’s research system earlier this year2.\n\nAlthough the bulk of the funding for research and teaching in countries such as France and the United Kingdom comes from the central governments, in Germany, the task of supporting academic activities falls to both federal and state governments. These jointly provide the majority of the institutional funding for most of the country’s non-university research organizations. And in contrast to the United States and the United Kingdom, where universities draw much of their income from tuition fees, German states are responsible for providing the base funding for universities.\n\nOtmar Wiestler, former president of the Helmholtz Association, says that the German government is committed to promoting research and innovation.Phil Dera/Helmholtz\n\nFunding flows into a highly structured research ecosystem consisting of more than 420 universities, most of which are public, and four main non-university research organizations. Each of the four fulfils a defined, specialized task, says Rainer Frietsch, a specialist in science-and-innovation research at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research. The Max Planck Society, for instance, focuses on fundamental research, with each of its 84 institutes around the country specializing in a range of fields, such as animal behaviour and neurogenetics. The Leibniz Society’s institutes strive to integrate scientific knowledge into society by giving economic reports and providing museums that conduct research and communicate findings. The Helmholtz Association’s centres house some of the country’s largest pieces of research equipment, including the world’s largest artificial sun, used in the study of solar processes.\n\nThe 75 institutes of the Fraunhofer Society, meanwhile, fulfil the distinct task of conducting applied research; for instance, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg are developing more-efficient solar cells, and scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials, which has several centres across Germany, are identifying innovative non-stick coatings for food-processing tools. Some of the society’s projects are for and funded by industry partners. Many countries, including France, the United Kingdom and China, have tried to emulate the Fraunhofer model in some form, but it works best in Germany’s research landscape, according to Frietsch. “Fraunhofer is as successful as it is because the whole system has exactly the layout that it has,” he says: the defined task division of the research organizations efficiently avoids overlap.\n\nAlthough distinct in their operations, Germany’s universities and non-university research organizations aren’t siloed from one another, says Voegler; universities often work with the non-university institutions nearby. In 2005, partly as a way of encouraging collaboration, the federal and the state governments launched the Excellence Initiative, which includes funding for interdisciplinary research projects at clusters of institutions.\n\nFrom 2026 to 2032, the initiative — now called the Excellence Strategy — has pledged €539 million per year for 70 ‘clusters of excellence’ projects across the country. One of these is the Cardio–Pulmonary System Cluster of Excellence in the state of Hessen, which brings together researchers from Goethe University Frankfurt, Justus Liebig University Giessen and the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim to study heart and lung disease. By promoting the exchange of expertise across research entities, “suddenly the whole becomes much more than the sum of its parts”, Voegler says.\n\nChampioning discovery\n\nDuring discussions on European Union science-funding programmes, some member states have expressed a desire to invest mainly in applied research, Wiestler says. But German representatives have defended the need to focus on fundamental, ‘blue sky’ research — work for which practical applications aren’t immediately obvious. Enrico Schleiff, the president of Goethe University Frankfurt, attributes the emphasis on basic research to the fact that freedom of science is a constitutional right in Germany, enabling scientists to determine the direction of their research without government or political influence — something he says has led to many fruitful discoveries.\n\nSome of those impactful discoveries include the development of blinatumomab, the first T-cell engager drug, which coaxes patients’ immune cells into attacking leukaemia cells. More recently, scientists at Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen–Nuremberg were part of a team that discovered that these and other kinds of cancer immunotherapies could also be used to target the dysfunctional, body-attacking immune cells responsible for causing autoimmune diseases such as lupus. “Now the whole world is developing T-cell engagers” for this purpose, says Patrick Baeuerle, a biotechnology entrepreneur and the co-founder and chief scientific advisor of Cullinan Therapeutics, a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that licensed a T-cell engager drug from a China-based biotech firm in June.\n\nPatrick Baeuerle is a biotechnology entrepreneur and the co-founder and chief scientific adviser of Cullinan Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Credit: Cullinan Therapeutics\n\nOne of Germany’s long-standing weaknesses, Wiestler says, is that its research products are seldom commercialized in the country, because it lacks the kind of start-up culture and abundant sources of venture-capital funding that supports the biotech scene in countries such as the United States and Israel. That’s partly why the Helmholtz Association, for instance, has been increasingly establishing partnerships with companies to translate findings into marketable products. One example is the creation in 2023 of the Solar TAP Innovation platform — a joint venture between several Helmholtz Centres and industry partners to develop innovative solar technologies — and the Joint Innovation Lab, a collaboration between the German Cancer Research Center and the Hamburg-based skincare company Beiersdorf to develop strategies to prevent skin cancer.",

          "abstract": "A tropical forest meets the Atlantic Ocean at the Amazon Delta.Credit: NASA/Alamy\n\nAs the world gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the COP30 United Nations climate conference, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reignited an old but urgent debate: whether the multilateral process that has sustained climate diplomacy for three decades is still fit for purpose. His proposal for a global climate council — a smaller, more agile entity to lead negotiations and ensure that climate commitments are implemented — reflects mounting frustration with the slow pace of outcomes from the annual Conference of the Parties (COP).\n\nHow to fight climate change without the US: a guide to global action\n\nLula’s proposal deserves serious consideration. The COP process has become sprawling, performative and, at times, politically paralysed. Yet, as someone who helped to draft the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1991–92, I think that the answer is not to abandon this architecture, but to reform it.\n\nWhen we negotiated the UNFCCC, our goal was to create a durable legal scaffold that was flexible enough to evolve with scientific understanding and national capacities for climate action. In 1992, there was no precedent for a framework that addressed an issue that spanned every economy, ecosystem and generation of people. We had the science, but not yet the institutions or political will to act at scale. The framework-convention model allowed successive protocols, decisions and mechanisms to develop.\n\nThat design has proven remarkably resilient. If someone had told me in 1992 that the world would still be negotiating climate action at COP30, I might have sighed. Yet, if they had told me that every nation would still be adhering to the same framework, guided by science and law, I would have been profoundly hopeful — as I am today.\n\nClimate diplomacy is slow because it is systemic. It forces nations to reconcile competing imperatives — development versus decarbonization, growth versus justice, and responsibility versus capability. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was born from these tensions: recognition that all countries share the problem but not the same level of blame or means to act.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nProgress has been incremental but cumulative. The UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and Paris agreement have created a coherent legal architecture for climate governance. The International Court of Justice delivered an advisory opinion in July, reaffirming that states have binding obligations to protect the climate, an indication of how far we’ve come.\n\nCriticism of the COP process is understandable. Yearly gatherings of tens of thousands of people can seem detached from the crisis outside the conference halls. But dismissing COPs ignores their ability to provide universality, legitimacy and accountability. President Lula’s call for a leaner climate council acknowledges this frustration while maintaining the inclusivity of the COP process.",

          "abstract": "The invention of agriculture is widely thought to have spurred the emergence of large-scale human societies. It has since been argued that only intensive agriculture can provide enough surplus for emerging states. Others have proposed it was the taxation potential of cereal grains that enabled the formation of states, making writing a critical development for recording those taxes. Here we test these hypotheses by mapping trait data from 868 cultures worldwide onto a language tree representing the relationships between cultures globally. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses indicate that intensive agriculture was as likely the result of state formation as its cause. By contrast, grain cultivation most likely preceded state formation. Grain cultivation also predicted the subsequent emergence of taxation. Writing, although not lost once states were formed, more likely emerged in tax-raising societies, consistent with the proposal that it was adopted to record those taxes. Although consistent with theory, a causal interpretation of the associations we identify is limited by the assumptions of our phylogenetic model, and several of the results are less reliable owing to the small sample size of some of the cross-cultural data we use.",

We evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can provide valid predictions of well-being across global populations. Using natural-language profiles from 64,000 individuals in 64 countries, we benchmark four leading LLMs against self-reports and statistical models. Unlike regressions, which estimate relationships from survey data, LLMs draw only on individual characteristics (e.g., sociodemographic, attitudinal, and psychological factors) together with associations encoded during pretraining, rather than from the survey’s subjective well-being responses. They produced plausible patterns consistent with known correlates such as income and health, but systematically underperformed relative to regressions and showed the largest errors in underrepresented countries, reflecting biases rooted in global digital and economic inequality. A preregistered experiment revealed that LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic associations rather than conceptual understanding, leading to predictable distortions in unfamiliar contexts. Injecting contextual information partly reduced—but did not remove—these biases. These findings demonstrate that while LLMs can simulate broad correlates of life satisfaction, they fail to capture its experiential and cultural depth. Accordingly, they should not be used as substitutes for human self-reports of well-being; doing so would risk reinforcing inequality and undermining human agency.",

The record shows that changes in local rainfall amount were coincident with changes in Greenland temperatures, with increased precipitation and enhanced multidecadal hydroclimatic variability during the Bølling–Allerød chronozone, followed by a drier and dustier Younger Dryas. Comparison with regional paleoclimate data suggests similar precipitation patterns across the FC, but with greater hydroclimate variability during the BA and drier conditions during the YD in the eastern sector. Crucially, the record provides a detailed and well-dated paleoenvironmental template by which to contextualize specific cultural events at the subregional scale, as revealed by recent archaeological research on key sites sharing similar environmental settings, allowing to investigate the role of climatic and environmental changes in shaping different neolithization patterns across the FC.",

          "abstract": "Why and when do people draw upon religious and supernatural solutions to problems? Cognitive scientists and anthropologists have proposed a range of answers, stressing religion and ritual’s capacity to alleviate anxiety, create a sense of order, or explain otherwise inexplicable events. Here, we leverage a unique dataset of 3,655 folk cures for 35 diseases, collected in 1937/8 from a mostly rural Irish sample born roughly between 1850 and 1925. Since the diseases vary in theory-relevant ways and the cures vary in the degree to which they include religious and supernatural elements, this dataset facilitates a unique test of these predictions in a premodern western population. In preregistered tests, we find that diseases judged by two doctors to have causes and mechanisms that would be unclear to the patients were more likely to have supernatural/religious treatments. Contra common predictions, severe and disabling diseases did not have more supernatural/religious cures and anxiety-provoking diseases did not have more ritualistic cures.",

          "abstract": "To migrate efficiently through tissues, cells must transit through small constrictions within the extracellular matrix. However, in vivo environments are geometrically, mechanically, and chemically complex, and it has been difficult to understand how each of these parameters contribute to the propulsive strategy utilized by cells in different confining environments. To address this, we employed a sacrificial micromolding approach to generate polymer substrates with tunable stiffness, controlled adhesivity, and user-defined microscale geometries. We combined this together with live-cell imaging and three-dimensional traction force microscopy to quantify the forces that cells use to transit through constricting channels. Surprisingly, rather than enlarging the constriction via pushing forces, we observe that mesenchymal cells migrating through compliant constrictions generate inwardly directed contractile forces that decrease the size of the opening and pull the channel walls closed around the nucleus. This had the effect of increasing nuclear deformation compared to cells migrating through comparably sized rigid confinements. Additionally, the nucleus took longer to transit through compliant constrictions compared to similarly sized rigid constrictions. These findings show that nuclear deformation during confined migration can be accomplished by internal cytoskeletal machinery rather than by reactive forces from the substrate, and our approach provides a mechanism to test between different models for how cells translocate their nucleus through narrow constrictions. The methods, analysis, and results presented here will be useful to understand how cells choose between propulsive strategies in different physical environments.",

          "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is catalyzed by a large nitrogenase enzyme complex, has evolved in both bacteria and archaea. Indeed, nitrogen-fixing species are found in diverse living environments, and BNF has evolved even in aerobic bacteria, although the function of nitrogenase is inhibited by oxygen. BNF is, however, highly energy-costing, requiring 16 ATPs in a single nitrogen fixation reaction. To explain this paradox, we hypothesized that nitrogen-fixing species gain not only nitrogen-fixing ( nif ) genes but also non- nif genes to facilitate nitrogen fixation. We examined over 3500 nitrogen-fixing genomes and found that they have gained genes directly or indirectly related to BNF in diverse types of living environments, so that nitrogen-fixing species tend to have larger genomes than their non-nitrogen-fixing relatives. Interestingly, the non- nif genes gained tend to be located near nif -gene clusters, probably to achieve proximity effects such as coordinated gene regulation. For example, the most frequent among the genes gained are ABC transporter genes, which facilitate the absorption and physiological metabolism of carbon (e.g., sugars), nitrogen (e.g., amino acids), and trace elements (e.g., molybdenum), and many ABC transporter genes lie close to nif -gene clusters. From our findings, we propose the following scenario: BNF evolved in many archaea and bacteria because BNF is advantageous to its hosts, although it incurs a high energy cost. Then, gaining genes to facilitate BNF compensates the cost of BNF, facilitating the spread of nitrogen fixers to all living habitats. This expansion benefits the biosphere, as nitrogen is essential for all organisms.",

Starting with some initial subgraph, at each iteration, we apply a randomly selected edit to the current subgraph. Such edits vary in nature from simple edits consisting of adding or deleting an edge, or compound edits which can affect several edges at once. This evolving process generates a random walk on the set of all possible subgraphs of the host graph. We show that the eigenvalues of this random walk can be naturally indexed by subsets of edges of the host graph. We also provide, in the case of simple edits, a closed-form formula for the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix and a sharp bound for the rate of convergence of this random walk. We consider extensions to the case of compound edits; examples of this model include the previously studied Moran forest model and a dynamic random intersection graph model. Evolving graphs arise in a variety of fields ranging from deep learning and graph neural networks to epidemic modeling and social networks. Our random evolving process serves as a general stochastic model for sampling random subgraphs from a given graph.",

          "abstract": "Nearly all biological processes depend on protein–protein interactions (PPIs). While various methods exist to study these interactions, investigating those that involve nuclear proteins, including structurally complex proteins containing long disordered regions, remains a significant challenge. Here, we developed nxReLo, a simple and fast cell culture-based colocalization assay, designed to identify and characterize interactions between nuclear proteins. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) safeguard germline genome integrity, and the PPIs that facilitate piRNA production are therefore essential for animal reproduction, yet remain incompletely understood. We used nxReLo to investigate interactions between members of the Drosophila melanogaster Rhino–Deadlock–Cutoff (RDC) complex and two associated components, Bootlegger and Moonshiner, a nuclear protein network required for piRNA expression. We demonstrate the utility of the nxReLo assay by systematically screening pairwise interactions within the RDC network and by assembling a multiprotein complex from four components. By combining nxReLo assays with AlphaFold structural prediction, we characterized the Cutoff–Deadlock and the Bootlegger–Deadlock complexes in detail, providing molecular and structural insights. Specifically, we refined the domains involved in the interaction and identified interface point mutations that interfered with complex formation, validating the predicted structures. In conclusion, nxReLo facilitates rapid and simple testing of direct interactions between nuclear proteins in a cellular context, which is particularly important when working with structurally challenging proteins or when established interaction assays prove unsuccessful.",

This process is down-regulated by inflammatory signals and up-regulated during gestation, providing mechanistic insight into the epidemiology associating IgG glycosylation, pregnancy and inflammatory disease.

To date, only a few studies have extended HHG spectroscopy to liquids, and much remains unresolved concerning the information that can be extracted from HHG spectra about the local liquid environment and the potential of HHG as a nonlinear probe of solvation dynamics. In this work, we investigate HHG in liquid binary solutions consisting of mixtures of aromatic benzene derivatives solvated in methanol. We observe evidence of a localized solvation structure that is imprinted on the harmonic spectra in the form of a strongly suppressed harmonic order, and an overall reduction of the total harmonic yield. We characterize this behavior as a function of laser parameters, concentration, and other halogenated benzene derivatives in methanol solution. Guided by theory, we interpret the results in terms of a localized solvation shell that is formed in specific solutions and acts like a local scattering barrier in the HHG process. This work demonstrates the potential of high-harmonic spectroscopy in liquids to extract detailed information about the structure and dynamics of solvation while expanding our understanding of the fundamental mechanism of HHG in systems with short-range order.",

          "abstract": "Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of multiprotein complexes such as actin filaments help explain the mechanisms of assembly and interactions with partner proteins. Yet, rapid cooling during freezing may not preserve the conformations at physiological temperature. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations starting with cryo-EM reconstructions can provide additional insights. For example, at 310 K, adenosinediphosphate (ADP)-actin filaments fluctuate on a nanosecond time scale around higher entropy states with partly twisted subunits and smaller rotations along short-pitch helix than the cryo-EM reconstructions, while cryogenic temperatures favor flattened conformations. In the active site, the positions of Q137 and the catalytic water 1 and activating water 2 optimal for in-line attack on the γ-phosphate of ATP are very rare at 310 K, explaining in part the slow rate of ATP hydrolysis in filaments. This favorable arrangement of the waters is not observed in simulations of actin monomers. At 310 K, subunits in ADP-P i -actin filaments have their backdoor gates open 60% of the time for phosphate release, a conformation not observed by cryo-EM. Rare fluctuations open binding sites for cofilin and phalloidin. The twisted conformations of pointed end subunits and interactions of the D-loop of the penultimate subunit explain the slow association of new subunits. The terminal subunit at the barbed end is tethered to its neighbor along the long-pitch helix but dissociates transiently from its lateral neighbor. These effects of subfreezing temperatures on actin filaments are surely not an isolated example, so molecular dynamics simulations of structures of other frozen proteins will be informative.",

To investigate the interaction of CutA with potential substrates and cofactors, we performed a series of native metabolomics experiments with CutA and cell extracts from which we identified the lumazine 2’-deoxyxanthopterin B2, a previously uncharacterized pteridine, to bind CutA in both species. Based on these results, we identified a set of other pteridines, including the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, as ligands of CutA. In the presence of pterins, we observed an increased affinity of CutA for copper ions. In addition, E. coli CutA mutants exhibited decreased copper resistance.

Here, we demonstrate that planetary organic haze chemistry produces a suite of sulfur biomolecules including cysteine, coenzyme M, taurine, and potentially methionine and homocysteine. These compounds may form high in the atmosphere and subsequently deposit to early surface environments in sufficient amounts to support a budding global biosphere.

          "abstract": "Octocorals are the major source of marine-derived bioactive terpenoids. However, the vast majority of explored chemistry is known from shallow-water species, leaving deep-sea octocorals largely unexplored. Recent genomic work uncovered terpene biosynthetic pathways encoded in octocoral genomes, enabling deeper investigation into the evolution and ecological distribution of these compounds. Here, we collected nine deep-sea octocoral specimens representing both taxonomic orders and profiled their terpenoid chemistry. These samples revealed extensive diversity in sesquiterpene scaffolds, along with repeated detection of five widespread structural families of diterpenes (xeniaphyllene-, cembrene B-, elisabethatriene-, cembrene A-, and klysimplexin R; collectively, “XBECK-type” diterpenoids). Phylogenetic analysis of terpene cyclase (TC) sequences from these samples, combined with publicly available sequences and functional characterization of selected genes, indicated that most TC genes encode functionally diverse sesquiterpene cyclases that corresponded to deeply rooted taxonomic origins, rather than biochemical function. We further identified five monophyletic clades, each comprising isofunctional enzymes that produce precursors for distinct XBECK-type diterpenoids and showing broad representation across octocoral taxa. These findings suggest that diterpenoid biosynthesis evolved early in coral evolution, with the last common ancestor already possessing multiple functionally distinct TC enzymes. Our results establish terpenoid production as an ancient, central trait of octocorals, irrespective of habitat, thereby highlighting the tremendous potential of deep-sea corals as sources for bioactive terpenoids. Finally, these findings raise intriguing questions about the evolutionary origins of these pathways within early cnidarians and across animal phyla more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 1 (USP1) plays a critical role in the progression and chemoresistance of various cancers, making USP1 inhibitors a promising therapeutic option in cancer treatment. However, the role of USP1 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) has remained unexplored. Our study uncovers a USP1-dependent survival axis driving chemoresistance in PTCL. USP1 is significantly upregulated in PTCL patients and correlates with poor prognosis through promoting mortalin degradation via TRAF2 deubiquitination. USP1 overexpression enhances TRAF2 stability by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby elevating TRAF2 levels. This, in turn, facilitates mortalin degradation, leading to diminished mortalin expression, reduced mitochondrial localization of mortalin, and impaired apoptosis. Notably, silencing mortalin in PTCL cells further decreases sensitivity to doxorubicin and suppresses apoptotic pathways. Mechanistically, reduced mitochondrial localization of mortalin disrupts calcium transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria through the IP 3 R–mortalin–VDAC1 complex. The impaired calcium shuttling triggers the activation of NF-κB and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, ultimately attenuating apoptosis. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP1 with ML323 effectively enhances PTCL cell sensitivity to doxorubicin, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy to improve treatment outcomes in PTCL patients. Collectively, we have found that USP1 represents a compelling therapeutic target for addressing chemoresistance and improving outcomes in PTCL therapy.",

Sorting of actin isoforms into distinct cellular compartments is believed to be controlled by actin-binding proteins (ABPs), but little is known about how ABPs can differentiate between actin isoforms. We show that the actin-binding repeat (ABR) of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus effector VopV binds to cytoplasmic actin in a unique mode with a low nanomolar affinity, over a thousand times stronger than to muscle actin. Actin mutagenesis and cryo-EM reconstructions reveal that isoform-specific residues of previously unassigned function deep in the cleft between the two actin protofilament strands determine this selectivity. These results suggest a mechanism of highly selective, isoform-specific interactions between actin and its partners, and have broad implications for understanding the evolution of actin. Furthermore, our findings have implications in the pathogenesis of V. parahaemolyticus , whose invasion of intestinal epithelial cells relies on the interaction of VopV with cytoplasmic F-actin.",

This enables automated segmentation and extraction of calcium signals with high signal-to-noise ratios and reduces optical crosstalk compared to conventional volume reconstruction methods.

          "abstract": "LAZY proteins function early in the process of orienting growth of land plants with respect to the gravity vector (gravitropism). In Arabidopsis , an oppositely oriented and LAZY-independent form of gravitropism causes the inflorescence stems of a lazy quadruple mutant ( atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ) to grow down and along the surface of the soil. Here, we report on a suppressor mutation that restores an upright inflorescence to a plant lacking LAZY functions. The suppressor of lazy quadruple 1 ( slq1 ) mutation alters one amino acid in a protein belonging to the NPH3/RPT2-like (NRL) family. The wild-type SLQ1 protein restores prostrate growth to the atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 mutant when expressed specifically in the gravity-sensing endodermal cells of the stem. The SLQ1 protein interacts head-to-tail with itself and, regardless of direction, with a homologous protein called SETH6. Distinct subcellular bodies apparently containing concentrated head-to-tail SLQ1 oligomers coated with SETH6 occurred primarily at sites of contact between the ER and the plasma membrane (PM), including plasmodesmata. The suppressing slq1 mutation (S149F) prevented these bodies from forming and reinverted the auxin gradient in the atlazy1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 inflorescence, switching its gravitropism from downward to upward. Thus, SLQ1 and at least one homolog (SETH6) function at ER–PM contact sites to counter the LAZY-dependent mechanism, not by inhibiting it but by regulating an apparently LAZY-independent gravity-directed process for creating an auxin gradient.

          "abstract": "Coronaviruses rely on intricate interactions with host proteins to create an environment conducive to their replication and survival. The 3CL protease of coronavirus acts as a key mediator, serving a dual role in cleaving viral polyproteins to produce essential components for replication and targeting host proteins to disrupt regulatory pathways and suppress immune defenses. However, the mechanisms by which 3CL protease manipulates host proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we identify STIM1, a substrate of the 3CL protease, as a dual immune suppressor. Cleavage at the Q496 residue generates two stable products, N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) fragments, which acquire de novo immunomodulatory functions. NT suppresses MAVS aggregation and MAVS-TRAF2-TBK1 signalosome formation, while CT attenuates IKKα-induced p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation by interacting with HSP70. Collectively, these dual modules simultaneously lead to the suppression of IFN-β production and the weakening of antiviral defenses. These findings reveal a distinct function of STIM1 and delineate a strategy employed by coronaviruses to modulate host immunity, offering insights into viral pathogenesis and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "The estimation of natural selection is used to understand ecological and evolutionary processes in wild populations and is often used to predict change. However, the direct application of quantitative genetic methods, originally developed in animal breeding, has been less successful in the wild; in particular, predictions of evolutionary change are often made that are not observed. This misprediction, known as the “paradox of stasis,” can arise due to bias in estimates of selection via nonrandom missing data in phenotypes if viability selection has previously occurred on correlated traits. Here, we check for this bias in a wild population of Soay sheep where estimates of selection suggest that “bigger is better” for adult size, but evolutionary change of the predicted magnitude does not occur. We establish that standard procedures for estimating total lifetime selection are biased by prior viability selection. In particular, while phenotypically large lambs have high first year survival, we also show that lambs that are genetically predisposed to large adult size traits also suffer elevated juvenile mortality. While the phenotypic traits driving early-life selection against large adult body size are unknown, our genetic analysis reveals correlated selection against larger adult sizes that essentially resolves the paradox of stasis for adult body size traits in this wild population. The pattern we reveal is potentially widespread in nature; previous results showing predominantly positive selection of large body size could in general be explained by this kind of antagonistic prior viability selection.",

While precipitation increase (Pi) is a major facet of climate change, its impacts on root- and AMF-mediated SOC formation and stability remain largely unexplored. Here, we combined a meta-analysis across global grasslands with a multiyear precipitation manipulation experiment in a semiarid grassland on the Loess Plateau to disentangle the relative effects of roots and their associated AMF on microbial communities and SOC as influenced by Pi. We show that Pi induced tradeoffs between roots and AMF, and promoted SOC formation and stability via the mycelium- rather than the root-pathway, leading to an increase of 136% (±40) and 297% (±90) in mycelium-derived C and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC), respectively. Pi altered plant community composition, favoring subshrubs and forbs over grasses. Also, Pi reduced specific root length, but increased root diameter, tissue density, and root colonization and extraradical biomass of AMF. Furthermore, Pi-induced change in AMF shifted the soil bacterial community by favoring K-strategists, increasing bacterial necromass C and promoting MAOC accumulation. Our findings provide direct evidence that Pi enhances AMF-driven SOC sequestration by expanding the mycorrhizosphere and promoting microbiota with high C use efficiency, highlighting a key mechanism by which mycorrhizal fungi mediate SOC formation and stability under shifting precipitation regimes.",

Recent studies have revealed that many mosquito species regularly engage in high-altitude wind-borne migration, but its epidemiological significance remains unclear. The hypothesis that high-flying mosquitoes spread pathogens over long distances has not been directly tested. Here, we report that high-flying mosquitoes are commonly infected with arboviruses, protozoans, and helminths and provide a insights into this pathogen–vector aerial network. A total of 1,017 female mosquitoes intercepted on nets suspended from helium balloons at 120 to 290 m above ground over Mali and Ghana were screened for infection with arboviruses, Haemosporida, and filariae. The mosquitoes collected at altitude comprised 61 species, across 10 genera, dominated by Culex , Aedes, and Anopheles . Infection and infectiousness (capacity to transmit a pathogen to another host inferred based on disseminated infection) rates of migrant mosquitoes were 7.2% and 4.4% with Plasmodium spp., 1.6% and 0.6% with filariae, and 3.5% and 1.1% with flaviviruses, respectively. Twenty-one mosquito-borne pathogens were identified, including Dengue, West Nile, and M’Poko viruses, 15 avian Plasmodium species including Plasmodium matutinum , and three filariids, including Pelecitus sp. Confirmed head–thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in Culex perexiguus , Mansonia uniformis , and Anopheles squamosus reveal that pathogens carried by high-altitude wind-borne mosquitoes are capable of infecting hosts far from their departure location. This high-altitude traffic of sylvatic pathogens (circulating in wild animals) may be key to their maintenance among enzootic foci as well as initiating outbreaks at distant locations.",

Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the GTPase Drp1 at the constriction site, which is proposed to be driven by the actin–myosin contractile force. However, the mechanism that propels constriction remains unclear, and the potential involvement of additional mechanisms in this process remains an open question. Here, using structured illumination microscopy, electron microscopy, and correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM), we show that the type III intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) participates in mitochondria constriction and fission by interacting with Drp1. Remarkably, loss of GFAP results in hyperfused mitochondria under physiological and even Ca 2+ -induced mitochondrial fission conditions. Additionally, mutations in GFAP, the cause of Alexander disease, result in more Drp1 localized to GFAP and lead to significantly increased mitochondrial fissions. Taken together, these findings propose a role of type III intermediate filaments in mitochondrial division.",

To further investigate the effects of species-specific PrP primary structural variation on the evolution of prion host range and strain properties during interspecies transmissions, we generated mice with precisely controlled expression of both murine and either deer or elk PrP C and challenged them with cervid or murine prions. While CWD prion transmission was inhibited to varying degrees under these conditions, the strain properties and species specificities of the resulting cervid prions were not impacted. By contrast, although murine prions induced conformational conversion of mouse but not coexpressed cervid PrP C , the resulting prions produced disease in mice expressing either cervid or mouse PrP C . Our findings show that while mouse PrP C inhibited conformational conversion of deer or elk PrP C without affecting the host range of CWD prions, coexpression of cervid PrP C influenced the selection of strains with expanded host range properties during conformational conversion of mouse PrP C by murine prions. Our studies reveal diverse influences of bystander PrP C expression on the replication, host range, and strain properties of prions generated during conformational conversion of their coexpressed cognate PrP C . These cooperative or inhibitory effects occur in trans and derive from species-specific primary structural variations between coexpressed PrP C substrates and infectious prions.",

Compared to a standard ready-to-use supplementary food, a microbiome-directed complementary food (MDCF-2) designed to repair these perturbations produced superior improvements in ponderal and linear growth in clinical trials of Bangladeshi children with moderate acute malnutrition. Here, “reverse translation” experiments are performed where intact fecal microbiomes collected from trial participants before and at the end of treatment are introduced into female gnotobiotic mice just after delivery of their pups. Pups received diets designed to resemble those consumed by children in the trials to recreate “unrepaired” and “repaired” gut ecosystems. Analyses of the abundances of bacterial strains (metagenome-assembled genomes), their expressed genes, and metabolic products, combined with assessments of ponderal growth and intestinal epithelial lineage transcriptomes (single-nucleus RNA-Seq with follow-up immunocytochemistry) disclosed effects of MDCF-2 associated microbiome repair that cannot be determined, in part because “no treatment” control arms cannot be ethically incorporated into these trials. Specifically, microbiome repair in these mice produced significant increases in ponderal growth, changes in microbial gene expression consistent with a less virulent gut ecosystem and alterations in expression of i) components of cell junctions in the enterocytic and goblet cell lineages, ii) pathways for synthesis and secretion of eicosanoid immune effectors in chemosensory tuft cells, and iii) goblet cell pathways involved in glycosylation and secretion of mucin. Experiments of the type described can help formulate and test hypotheses about how microbiome repair affects host biology.",

          "authors": "Pouriya Alinaghi, Martin Janssens, Fredrik Jansson",
          "abstract": "Marine shallow cumulus clouds have long caused large uncertainty in climate projections. Such “trade cumuli” frequently organize into mesoscale (10 to 500 km) structures, through two processes that couple the clouds to shallow mesoscale circulations: i) mesoscale moisture aggregation and ii) cold pools, driven by mesoscale rain evaporation beneath the mesoscale cloud structures. Since global climate models do not capture these mesoscale processes, while the degree of mesoscale organization is observed to correlate to shortwave cooling, it has been suggested that mesoscale processes modulate contemporary estimates of cloud response to global warming. Here, we show that introducing mesoscale dynamics can indeed substantially alter top-of-the-atmosphere radiative budget, if the balance between the two circulations is upset. By homogenizing mesoscale rain evaporation patterns, we suppress the formation and effects of cold pools in a large ensemble of large-domain, large-eddy simulations. The experiments reveal that cold pool dynamics reduce mesoscale ascent in the cloud systems, thereby arresting a runaway self-aggregation of moisture into very moist, cloudy regions that occurs without them. This reduces the net rainfall of the cumulus fields, moistens the cloud layer and thus reduces the emission of clear-sky longwave radiation to space, giving an ensemble-averaged warming of 1.88 W/m 2 . Our results highlight that the proper interplay between mesoscale processes is critical for capturing radiative budgets-especially in kilometer-scale climate models that only partially resolve shallow cumulus aggregation and cold pools.",

Here, we introduce a de novo designed family of ice-binding twistless alpha-helical repeat (iTHR) proteins. Each iTHR protein comprises two planar layers of parallel alpha-helices connected by loops—a structural topology not seen in native IBPs. The ice-binding helices contain an ordered array of TXXXAXXXAXX motifs, precisely spaced to complement the pyramidal {201} and secondary prism {110} planes of the ice lattice, with a designed 98.2° residue turn angle that orients all threonines uniformly toward the ice surface. iTHR proteins show high solubility, thermostability, and produce varied ice crystal morphologies depending on their intended target facet. Crucially, iTHRs exhibit ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) at critical concentrations comparable to those of many native globular IBPs. Extensive site-specific mutagenesis shows that ice-binding activity in iTHR proteins is robust, remaining largely unaffected by changes in chemical composition. Variation in the repeat number reveals a nonmonotonic relationship to IRI activity. X-ray crystal structures of two designs confirm the intended orientation of threonines, uniformly pointing toward the ice surface. The iTHR family provides a versatile platform to systematically investigate the complex structure–activity relationships underlying protein–ice interactions.",

In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time, as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN 2 mo following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against two different types of vaccines. On the one hand, we observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with an messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. In contrast, we observed an enhanced response when vaccinated with influenza vaccine inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.",

It has long been suggested that plant defense activity must be linked to cellular energy and metabolic states to optimize the balance between growth and defense. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate immune activity in relation to cellular energy status remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the plant energy sensor SNF1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1) plays a critical role in modulating defense responses and bacterial resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana . Bacterial elicitor-induced expression of defense marker genes, such as PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1 ( PR1 ), is significantly repressed under sugar-limited conditions in wild-type seedlings, whereas this expression is markedly enhanced in the snrk1α1i/α2 knockdown mutants. SnRK1 restricts defense-related gene expression and resistance to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, which are partly dependent on salicylic acid (SA). In addition, we found that the SnRK1 kinase activity is increased by high humidity. Consistently, SnRK1 is critical for the suppression of SA-mediated defense responses under high humidity conditions. SnRK1 physically associates with the SA-related transcription factors TGACG SEQUENCE-SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEIN 4 (TGA4) and TGA2 to attenuate PR1 expression. These findings provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms linking cellular energy status with immune regulation in plants.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic levitation provides a unique method for manipulating small particles as it completely evades effects from gravity, container walls, or physical handling. These advantages make it a tantalizing platform for studying complex phenomena in many-particle systems. In most standing-wave traps, however, particles interact via acoustic scattering forces that cause them to merge into a single dense object. Here, we introduce a complementary approach that combines acoustic levitation with electrostatic charging to assemble, adapt, and activate complex, separated many-particle systems. The key idea is to superimpose electrostatic repulsion on the intrinsic acoustic attraction, rendering a so-called “mermaid” potential where interactions are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. By controlling the attraction–repulsion balance, we can levitate expanded structures where all particles are separated, collapsed structures where they are in contact, and hybrid ones consisting of both expanded and collapsed components. We find that collapsed and expanded structures are inherently stable, whereas hybrid ones exhibit transient stability governed by acoustically unstable dimers. Furthermore, we show how electrostatics allow us to adapt between configurations on the fly, either by quasistatic discharge or discrete up/down charge steps. Finally, we demonstrate how large structures experience selective energy pumping from the acoustic field—thrusting some particles into motion while others remain stationary—leading to complex dynamics including coupled rotations and oscillations. Our approach establishes a design space beyond acoustic collapse, offering possibilities to study many-particle systems with complex interactions, while suggesting pathways toward scalable integration into materials processing and other applications.",

          "abstract": "Synapses must be resilient to the challenges they confront during development, experience, disease, and aging. A conserved form of adaptive plasticity, observed at the glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), is expressed following acute pharmacological blockade of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs). This challenge is counteracted by enhanced presynaptic neurotransmitter release to maintain stable synaptic strength. This retrograde form of homeostatic plasticity is termed presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). How retrograde PHP signaling is acutely induced in the postsynaptic compartment is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that acute PHP induction does not require reductions in ionic flow through GluRs. Rather, pharmacological blockade provokes nanoscale changes in GluR organization that propagates remodeling of the postsynaptic apparatus. These postsynaptic structural changes are necessary for the presynaptic remodeling that characterizes PHP, including enhanced active zone intensity. Next, using a CRISPR-based genetic screen, we identify Discs large (DLG), the fly homolog of mammalian PSD-95, as a key postsynaptic substrate selectively required for acute PHP signaling. Finally, we find that homeostatic remodeling of both pre- and postsynaptic compartments persists in the absence of synaptic activity. Together, we propose that acute pharmacological perturbation of GluRs triggers activity-independent conformational signaling that is propagated throughout the postsynaptic apparatus, transmitting retrograde information that rapidly induces PHP.",

          "abstract": "The timing and quality of sleep is regulated by circadian- and sleep–wake-driven processes. The core clock gene Bmal1 not only affects the circadian timing of sleep, but also the response to sleep deprivation (SD), which, in turn, causes long-term changes in cortical Bmal1 expression. We aimed at separating the circadian- and sleep–wake-driven contributions to BMAL1 binding to its target genes in the cerebral cortex by scheduling 6 SDs at 4 h intervals across the daily 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. We show that BMAL1 rhythmically bound its tissue-specific targets with tissue-specific dynamics, reaching peak binding 2 to 4 h later in the cortex than in the liver, while trough times did not differ. The SDs affected BMAL1 binding most significantly in the cortex, causing 80% of rhythmically bound regions to lose rhythmicity, suggesting BMAL1 binding has a prominent sleep–wake-driven component in this tissue. Analyses of the promoters of other core clock-genes indicate that BMAL1 binding to Bhlhe41 and Nr2d1 have a strong sleep–wake-driven component, while for Per2 two binding regions were identified one with circadian- and the other with sleep–wake-driven binding dynamics. Our results attest to a nonadditive interaction of time-of-day and time-spent-awake affecting the core molecular circadian circuitry. It further highlights that rhythms in gene expression in peripheral tissues are an emergent property of molecular interactions beyond that of the core molecular clock circuitry.",

          "abstract": "The activation of blood monocytes and the infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the vessel walls are the central part of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the processes remain unclear. Here, we report that G-protein signaling modulator 1 (GPSM1) plays a critical role in atherogenesis. We found that GPSM1 expression in lesional macrophages was increased during atherosclerosis development both in mice and humans. Myeloid-specific GPSM1 ablation protects mice against atherosclerosis and reduces aortic inflammation in both Apoe −/− mice and an AAV-PCSK9 injection model. Conversely, myeloid-restricted overexpression of GPSM1 accelerates aortic inflammation and promotes atherosclerosis development in mice. Mechanistically, GPSM1 deficiency suppressed monocyte activation including chemotaxis and adhesion through inhibition of the p38/ERK MAPK pathway regulated by the cAMP/PKA/KLF4/PMP22 axis, thereby alleviating proinflammatory responses within atherosclerotic plaques. Blockade of PMP22 using siRNA-loaded liposomes protected GPSM1 overexpression mice from atherosclerosis. Furthermore, a small-molecule compound inhibiting GPSM1 function could suppress atherosclerosis in vivo. In conclusion, our findings establish that GPSM1 is a regulator of atherosclerosis development and targeting GPSM1 might be a promising therapy against atherosclerosis.",

          "abstract": "Following the late 2022 transition from its “dynamic zero-COVID” policy, China experienced a major nationwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron wave. To characterize the wave’s transmission dynamics, we used a Bayesian framework to fit a deterministic transmission model to two key data streams: reported COVID-19 daily case counts preceding the policy shift (up to November 11, 2022) and weekly virological and influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance data afterward (through February 12, 2023). We estimated a nationwide cumulative infection attack rate reaching 87.8% (95% CrI: 75.9 to 93.3%) by mid-February 2023. Notably, 84.1% of the population became infected within just 1 mo following the full policy relaxation on December 7. The estimated time-varying effective reproduction number peaked at 5.69 (95% CrI: 4.56 to 6.85) on December 8, 2022. Although transmission intensity increased during the Spring Festival travel rush (Chunyun), widespread population immunity prevented a subsequent wave. Prior to the Chunyun period, distinct relationships emerged: Estimated transmission rates showed a significant positive correlation with long-term population behavioral response coefficient (reflecting cumulative infections; Pearson correlation: ρ = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001), while mobility patterns correlated positively with short-term behavioral response coefficient (reflecting current infection prevalence; Pearson correlation: ρ = 0.87, P &lt; 0.001). These dynamic behavioral associations, which we further validated against empirical data on keyword search and media coverage, then weakened during the Chunyun period. In summary, this analysis quantifies Omicron’s transmission potential and highlights the importance of incorporating time-varying behavioral factors into epidemic models to accurately describe transmission dynamics, especially during periods of abrupt policy change.",

          "abstract": "Perennial plants, such as trees native to temperate and boreal regions, exhibit meristems that undergo annual cycles of activity and rest to synchronize their growth cycles with seasonal changes, ensuring survival under harsh winter conditions. The arrest of shoot meristem growth, known as growth cessation, is a critical initial step for trees to enter dormancy. This process is triggered by a combination of endogenous and exogenous signals, yet the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying growth cessation remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that Populus orthologs of APETALA2-like transcription factors (AP2Ls), the primary regulators of global proliferative arrest (GPA) in Arabidopsis , play a crucial role in the regulation of seasonal growth cessation in hybrid aspen trees. In particular, AP2Ls act as important activators of the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T2 ( FT2 ), a key gene for short-day-induced growth cessation. This contrasts with the established role of AP2Ls as repressors of FT in annual plants. Yet, the pathway itself is conserved with the pathway regulating GPA in annual plants, a completely different process during the plant life cycle. Our research highlights both the conserved roles and functional diversities of AP2Ls in a more general balancing of meristem proliferation and arrest in perennial plants, providing insights into the evolutionary adaptation of growth regulation mechanisms across plant species.",

Although trans -SNARE complex formation is essential for function, a similar trans -interaction mechanism for the exocyst remains uncertain. We employed advanced live-cell imaging combined with genetic and pharmacological techniques to dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of exocyst subunit interactions and cargo vesicle association in Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyl cells. Our results demonstrate that subunits from SC1 and SC2 colocalize and undergo actin-dependent transport to the plasma membrane (PM). Disruption of either SEC6 (SC1) or EXO70A1 (SC2) prevented PM association of both subcomplexes, indicating cytoplasmic preassembly of the cis -exocyst complex before PM recruitment. Critically, we found that the exocyst does not directly bind vesicles carrying cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs). Instead, exocyst subunits first migrate on CSC-negative vesicles, which then coalesce with CSC-carrying vesicles at the cell cortex via heterotypic fusion. Together, our findings reveal a parallel mechanism for exocyst assembly and cargo loading. This coordinated process may represent a broadly conserved strategy to ensure efficient membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells.",

To test whether bacterial methylglyoxal resistance is required for robust infections, we sought to identify M. tuberculosis defense mechanisms against methylglyoxal. We identified phoP mutants were among the most highly sensitive strains to methylglyoxal in vitro. phoP mutants are highly attenuated in mice but a phoP mutant was even more attenuated in mice that accumulate methylglyoxal. We further found phoP bacilli were more permeable to methylglyoxal and accumulated glycated proteins. Suppressor mutations in the fatty acid β-oxidation genes fadE25 or fixB restored impermeability and resistance to methylglyoxal to a phoP mutant. Together, our data show that an important role for PhoP is to provide M. tuberculosis resistance to methylglyoxal toxicity in vivo by regulating cell envelope integrity.",

These mutations can disrupt MFN2-dependent regulation of diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology including organelle morphology, motility, mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts (MERCs), and respiratory chain activity. However, no therapies currently exist to mitigate the mitochondrial dysfunction linked to genetic deficiencies in MFN2. Herein, we performed a drug repurposing screen to identify compounds that selectively activate the integrated stress response (ISR)—the predominant stress-responsive signaling pathway responsible for regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. This screen identified the compounds parogrelil and MBX-2982 as potent and selective activators of the ISR through the OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling axis. We show that treatment with these compounds promotes adaptive, ISR-dependent remodeling of mitochondrial morphology and protects mitochondria against genetic and chemical insults. Moreover, we show that pharmacologic ISR activation afforded by parogrelil restores mitochondrial tubular morphology, promotes mitochondrial motility, rescues MERCs, and enhances mitochondrial respiration in MFN2 -deficient cells. These results demonstrate the potential for pharmacologic ISR activation through the OMA1-DELE1-HRI signaling pathway as a potential strategy to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in CMT2A and other pathologies associated with MFN2 deficiency.",

While previous work has focused on optimizing self-assembly through fine-tuned reaction parameters or using phase-separated liquid compartments with fast particle exchange, the role of slow intercompartmental exchange remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that slow particle exchange between reaction domains can enhance self-assembly efficiency through a cooperative mechanism: delay-facilitated assembly. Using a minimal model of irreversible self-assembly in two compartments with distinct reaction and exchange dynamics, we identify scenarios where slow particle exchange maximizes yield and minimizes assembly time for given suboptimal reaction dynamics, even under conditions where isolated compartments would fail to facilitate any self-assembly. The mechanism relies on a separation of timescales between intracompartmental reactions and intercompartmental exchange and is robust across a wide range of geometries, including spatially extended domains with diffusive transport. We demonstrate that this effect enables geometric control of self-assembly processes through compartment volumes and exchange rates, eliminating the need for fine-tuning local reaction rates. These results offer a conceptual framework for leveraging spatial separation in synthetic self-assembly design and suggest that biological systems may use slow particle exchange to improve assembly efficiency.",

We present a Pb–Pb isochron age of 2,194 ± 5 Ma for black shales from the Francevillian FB Formation, Gabon—an LJE type locality—coinciding with the emplacement of the Large Igneous Province that gave rise to the extensive Birimian–Eburnean orogenic segment. This orogeny produced very large volumes of juvenile crust in the form of oceanic plateau basalts that were eventually reworked through subduction and collisions. These processes released substantial volcanic CO 2 into the ocean–atmosphere system, disrupting the carbon and oxygen cycles for 100 to 200 My. Volcanic outgassing likely outpaced alkalinity production from weathering, leading to an increase in the δ 13 C of sedimentary carbonates. Reanalysis of global δ 13 C–δ 18 O datasets reveals a previously unrecognized dual bimodality, attributed here to episodic volcanic degassing and subsequent oceanic carbonate saturation. Weathering of emergent crust enhanced nutrient fluxes, driving primary productivity and organic carbon burial. We further propose that volcanic CO 2 emissions modulated the Dole Effect by shifting the balance between terrestrial and marine photosynthetic oxygen production, altering atmospheric oxygen isotope ratios independently of climate. These processes collectively drove the δ 13 C excursion of the LJE and may have fostered conditions conducive for early eukaryotic evolution.",

ADGRG6/GPR126 is an aGPCR critical for axon myelination, heart development, and ear development; ADGRG6 is also associated with developmental diseases and cancers. ADGRG6 has a large, alternatively spliced, five-domain extracellular region (ECR) that samples different conformations and is essential for receptor function in vivo. However, the mechanistic details of how the ECR regulates signaling are unclear. Herein, we studied the conformational dynamics of the conserved CUB domain which is located at the distal N terminus of the ADGRG6 ECR and is deleted in an alternatively spliced isoform (ΔCUB). We show that the ΔCUB isoform has decreased signaling and is insensitive to inclusion of an activating splice insertion (+ss). Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the CUB domain is involved in interdomain contacts to maintain a compact ECR conformation. A cancer-associated CUB domain mutant, C94Y, drastically perturbs the ECR conformation and results in elevated signaling, whereas another CUB mutant located near a conserved Ca 2+ -binding site, Y96A, decreases signaling. Our results suggest an ECR-mediated mechanism for ADGRG6 regulation in which the CUB domain instructs conformational changes within the ECR to regulate receptor signaling.",

The success of this approach depends on the internalization and retention of the payload in target cells. This study introduces a method using a small protein domain engineered for conditional target affinity, enabling lysosomal trafficking independent of the biological fate of the receptor. Specifically, we describe the development of an EGF receptor binder, CaRA EGFR , with calcium-regulated affinity (CaRA), meaning the target binding strength is tailored by the available calcium concentration. This allows for endosomal dissociation, as calcium levels are lower in endosomes than in the bloodstream. Affinity measurements and structural modeling reveal the molecular basis of the calcium modulated affinity. Live cell imaging demonstrates efficient internalization and lysosomal trafficking of the calcium-dependent domain, while the EGF receptor is recycled to the membrane. When used as a drug carrier, CaRA EGFR effectively delivers the toxin to the lysosomes, resulting in potent cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 0.8 nM in EGFR-expressing cancer cells",

          "abstract": "All vertebrate adaptive immune systems exhibit distinct lymphocyte lineages. In jawless vertebrates, such as lampreys, T-like cells are thought to develop in lympho-epithelial structures at the tips of gill filaments, termed thymoids. However, it is unclear whether thymoids are functionally equivalent to the thymus of jawed vertebrates. Indeed, because the structural modules that are somatically assembled to form the antigen receptors of jawless and jawed vertebrates differ, development and selection of T cells may be governed by clade-specific genetic networks. To address this question, we have replaced the mouse Foxn1 gene, a key regulator of the thymic microenvironment in jawed vertebrates, with the orthologous FOXN1 lamprey gene, which is expressed in the thymoids alongside genes orthologous to known targets of the mouse Foxn1 transcription factor. The reconstituted thymi support normal T cell development, and, to a lesser extent, also support B cell development, indicating that the lamprey FOXN1 gene can rescue the block of thymic epithelial cell differentiation in mice deficient for the endogenous Foxn1 gene. The absence of overt autoimmunity in transgenic mice suggests that the reconstituted thymic microenvironment directs the development of a self-tolerant T cell repertoire. These findings highlight the remarkable similarity of thymic epithelial functions in jawed and jawless vertebrates, despite more than 500 My of independent evolution. Our results thus suggest that the emergence of the Foxn1 transcription factor in the common ancestor of vertebrates was associated with the advent of a specialized tissue environment supporting the development and selection of T cells.",

Here, we describe the structural, functional, and regulatory effects of site-specific acetylation on an expanded set of conserved lysines in PKM2 and selected lysines in PKM1. To study homogeneously acetylated proteins, we genetically encoded the incorporation of acetylated lysine into PKM variants expressed in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells. Our integrated biochemical, structural, and computational approach revealed K115 acetylation as an inhibitory modification in both PKM1 and PKM2 that stabilizes a closed active site conformation of the proteins. We also show that, in contrast to K115 acetylation, previously reported acetylation of K305 inhibits PKM2 but has no effect on the activity and oligomerization of PKM1. These findings propose the existence of both uniform and isoform-specific regulatory mechanisms of PKM, mediated by acetylation.",

Lrig1 + cells exhibited hallmark features of quiescent stem cells—including slow cycling, long-term persistence, and differentiation potential—and contributed to sustained VF regeneration and repair after naphthalene injury. By one week post injury Lrig1 + progeny restored the damaged VF epithelium. Transcriptionally, these cells suppressed cell type specific genes and proliferation while activating programs related to RNA metabolism, epigenetic regulation, and protein ubiquitination, consistent with quiescence and readiness for activation. Lrig1 + cells were enriched in basal, parabasal, and immature secretory populations within surface epithelium and submucosal glands, residing in niches characterized by transcriptional flexibility and spatial shielding from direct stress—features that likely prevent premature or chronic mobilization. Notably, analogous LRIG1 expressing cells were identified in human laryngeal and VF tissues, highlighting the translational relevance of our findings. To explore regulation of Lrig1 + cell quiescence, we conditionally deleted Notch1, which led to epithelial hyperplasia, expansion of secretory populations, and mucus hyperproduction.

Soil incubation experiments with seven soils explored how straw and three types of MNC—gram-positive bacterial necromass carbon (G + -NC), gram-negative bacterial necromass carbon (G − -NC), and fungal necromass carbon (F-NC)—affect As methylation. Our results demonstrated that all types of MNC enhanced As methylation, and G − -NC exhibiting the most pronounced effect on methylated As accumulation.

By analyzing the polarization state of photons emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering, self-interactions, and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA sequence linked to Huntington’s disease exhibits unusual flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a tool for quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental biological processes.",

          "abstract": "Gene duplication followed by adaptation to new selection pressures has been proposed to be of central importance in the evolution of venom toxins. Coupling high-quality genome data with quantitative bioactivity readouts can be used to understand how venom toxins evolved, but such studies are rare. Here, we report a near chromosomal-level genome assembly for Doratifera vulnerans (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae), which is venomous in the larval stage. We identify 115 gene loci that produce the polypeptide toxins in venom, including numerous multigene families as well as single-copy genes. Previously described membrane-permeabilizing peptides that cause pain are shown to be encoded by a gene cluster on chromosome 7 that also encodes multiple members of the cecropin family, which are insect innate immunity peptides. These data reveal the origin of defensive toxins from immune peptides followed by strong sequence divergence driven by positive selection pressures. Dv13, which is present as a trace component in the venom, and which has sequence features conserved with canonical cecropin A, potently inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, but only weakly permeabilized the membranes of mammalian neurons with EC 50 values &gt;100 µM. In contrast, peptides Dv11 and Dv12 are abundant in the venom, have sequence features divergent from Dv13, and potently disrupt mammalian neuronal membranes with EC 50 values as low as 190 nM, but have reduced antimicrobial activity. These data provide evidence for the adaptation of innate immune peptides as specialized defensive venom toxins and provide a natural experiment informing the structure–activity relationships of cecropin family peptides.",

Understanding their mechanical behavior under high strain rates is essential for the use of these materials in extreme environments. We report on a highly unusual fracture behavior observed in borosilicate glass facilitated by stress-induced molecular rearrangements, allowing the glass to withstand tensile stresses up to 11 GPa. Converging surface acoustic waves (SAW) with controlled amplitude are generated optically and used to investigate the high-strain-rate (10 8 s −1 ) fracture behavior of borosilicate glass. Above a tensile stress threshold of 6 GPa, fracture of the glass surface is observed, characterized by ejection of material and radial cracking. Unexpectedly, upon further increase of the SAW stress, a second threshold of 8 GPa tensile stress is observed above which the fracture probability dramatically decreases. Raman spectra and nanoindentation measurements of shocked samples indicate significant changes in the topology and coordination numbers of silicon and boron atoms in the amorphous network. These results suggest the ability of thresholded atomic rearrangements to serve as an intrinsic high-strain-rate toughening mechanism for enhanced fracture toughness in amorphous borosilicate glass under dynamic strain conditions.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are bacterial viruses that provide alternatives to small-molecule drugs to combat infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To infect a bacterial host, a phage needs to bind to the bacterial surface via receptor binding proteins (RBPs), which are critical for determining host specificity. For functionally important receptors, the RBP–receptor interaction could be exploited via phage steering, where emerging bacterial resistance due to receptor modification could make bacteria less fit or virulent. Despite this, relatively little is known about RBP–receptor interactions. Here, we build on the recent discovery of coliphages that have the outer membrane (OM) lipopolysaccharide translocon LptDE as their terminal receptor and show via cryogenic electron microscopy that, surprisingly, the RBP of the small siphophage Oekolampad binds to a hitherto unobserved, open state of LptDE. The open lateral gate of LptD is occupied by a β-strand peptide originating from the degraded N-terminal jellyroll domain of LptD, suggesting the possibility of LptD inhibition via peptidomimetics. A structure of LptDE in complex with the superinfection exclusion (SE) protein Rtp45 of the Oekolampad-related phage Rtp shows a mechanism of SE where Rtp45-induced conformational changes in LptD resulting from steric clashes preclude RBP binding. Finally, analysis of spontaneous Oekolampad-resistant Escherichia coli mutants identifies mutations in LptD that abolish the LptDE–RBP interaction in vitro. SDS-EDTA sensitivity assays of the mutants show no major OM defects, consistent with largely preserved LptDE function, and suggesting that phage steering via LptDE might be challenging.",

          "abstract": "Long-range cerebellar outputs are critical for shaping brain-wide functional architecture, influencing motor, cognitive, and affective domains. Proper cerebellar development and its efferent circuits are essential for brain maturation, and disruptions in these pathways have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. However, despite the early developmental onset, the spatiotemporal dynamics of cerebellar connectivity remain largely unknown, limiting mechanistic understanding of cerebellar contributions to brain development and disease. Here, we combine viral genetic tracing with high-resolution whole-brain 3D imaging to generate a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of cerebellar output development in mice. This systematic characterization uniquely distinguishes how excitatory and inhibitory cerebellar projections establish, expand, and refine their connectivity across the brain. Both axon types reach their principal brain targets within a narrow perinatal window, coinciding with the earliest formation of presynaptic terminals, and subsequently undergo postnatal expansion followed by region- and cell type–specific refinement. These findings define critical windows in the assembly of cerebellar output circuits, providing a framework to decipher the principles of cerebellar circuit formation and their impact on brain-wide function. Importantly, they also pinpoint periods of heightened vulnerability, when genetic or environmental perturbations are most likely to derail cerebellar-driven circuit maturation. By establishing this developmental blueprint, our study not only advances fundamental knowledge of brain wiring but also lays the groundwork for translational efforts to connect early cerebellar dysfunction with the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for accurate epidemic forecasting to predict pathogen spread, evolution, and evaluate intervention strategies. Forecast reliability hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across population segments, which may be inferred from contact surveys or mobility data. However, these indirect approaches make it difficult to estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp-up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between geographically defined communities. Our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from others based on how rapidly allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the United States, we uncover networks of intercommunity transmission that reflect geographical relationships while exposing significant long-range interactions. The scaling of importation rate with distance is consistent across both countries, yet weaker than expected based on mobility data, highlighting limitations of indirect inference. We show that transmission patterns can change between waves of variants of concern and analyze how the inferred heterogeneity in intercommunity transmission impacts evolutionary forecasts. While applied here to geographically defined communities, our approach could be applied to those defined by other traits (e.g., age, socioeconomic status), provided time-series data can be stratified accordingly. Overall, our study highlights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.",

CLDN14 is strongly upregulated by high blood calcium, restricts this paracellular calcium flux, and is linked to kidney stone disease. How CLDN14 controls paracellular calcium flux and structurally incorporates into this complex junction is unknown. Using confocal and super-resolution microscopy, we show that CLDN14 preferentially associates with CLDN19, thereby gradually replacing CLDN16 in the CLDN19 copolymer in vitro and in mice in vivo. The claudin switch depends on CLDN14 polymerization and occurs on a timescale of days via a pathway independent of dynamin-mediated endocytosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism of tight junction regulation, demonstrating how dynamic claudin remodeling within this complex structure controls renal calcium excretion and contributes to kidney stone pathogenesis.",

Whether BLTPs are active in this environment and which lipid species are substrates for transport has been unknown. Here, we use synthetic organelles with bilayers (liposomes), monolayers (artificial lipid droplets), or a mixture of the two membrane structures to demonstrate the tight binding of ATG2 specifically to monolayers via its collection of COOH-terminal amphipathic helices. This stable binding enables ATG2 to transfer phospholipids much more effectively. Unexpectedly, the neutral lipid triacylglycerol is also rapidly transported, with kinetics similar to those of phospholipid transport. Lipidomics of purified ATG2A suggests that a similar transfer of both phospholipids and triacylglycerol occurs in cells.

Further, prehabilitation induces repartitioning of glucose metabolism in obese mice: Uptake and oxidation of glucose are enhanced in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and reduced in tumors. These increases in muscle glucose metabolism and reductions in tumor glucose metabolism, correlated with slower tumor progression. Using [U- 13 C 6 ] glucose infusion, we show that exercise increases the fractional contribution of glucose to oxidative metabolism in muscle while reducing it in tumors, suggesting that aerobic exercise shifts systemic glucose metabolism away from the tumor microenvironment and toward metabolically active tissues.

Here, we show that targeting Lamin A/C also plays a previously unrecognized role in HCMV-induced rewiring of cytoskeletal connections that control nuclear movement and cell migration at later stages of infection. Specifically, HCMV was found to employ distinct strategies to downregulate Lamin A/C and SUN2, which together regulate linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes that most often connect the nuclear membrane with cytoplasmic actin filaments. Unexpectedly, inhibition of the viral kinase, pUL97, or expression of nonphosphorylatable mutants of Lamin A/C failed to restore SUN2 expression or significant actin filament assembly. Moreover, exogenous reexpression of SUN2 also failed to restore actin filaments. Instead, restoration of SUN2 or Lamin A/C expression impaired the formation of acetylated microtubules in infected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of pUL97, expression of Lamin A/C mutants or depletion of the tubulin acetyl transferase, ATAT1, all impaired HCMV-induced nuclear movement and cell migration. Our findings reveal that HCMV uses multiple strategies to selectively downregulate Lamin A/C and SUN2 in order to prevent these proteins from interfering with the formation of acetylated microtubules that mediate nuclear movement and cell migration, revealing additional roles for Lamin A/C remodeling during infection and insights into how cells control cytoskeletal interactions with the nucleus.",

A central question is whether clustering of bubbles enhances or suppresses their rise velocity compared to isolated single bubbles in quiescent fluid. We address this issue using a recently developed three-dimensional Lagrangian bubble tracking technique, with accurate rise velocity measurements obtained by simultaneously tracking tracer particles around each bubble. For bubbles within swarms, we find that clustered bubbles rise faster than unclustered ones. A conditional analysis based on cluster orientation suggests that this enhancement results from a wake suction effect acting on trailing bubbles. However, even clustered bubbles rise considerably slower than isolated single bubbles due to their exposure to turbulence generated by other bubbles, which randomizes their trajectories and reduces rising efficiency.",

          "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline, microporous silicates widely used in catalysis and separations, yet the molecular mechanisms of their formation remain unresolved. Experiments indicate that hydrothermal synthesis of silica zeolites from clear solution proceeds through amorphous nanoaggregates that gradually develop zeolite order in an apparently continuous amorphous to crystal transformation. Here, we combine molecular simulations with advanced algorithms that identify zeolite order and computer vision to elucidate the pathway from clear solution to zeolite nanocrystal. We show that at conditions of hydrothermal synthesis of silica zeolites, the transformation of precursor aggregate into zeolite is not limited by nucleation barriers but by the slow dynamics of reorganization in the glassy precursor matrix. The negligible nucleation barriers result in spinodal-like crystallization that leads to a gradual formation of a mosaic of small crystallites that explain the seemingly continuous character of zeolite crystallization and the catalytic activity of X-ray amorphous, protozeolites and embryonic zeolites. We find that zeolite-like porosity and short-range order emerge early within glassy precursors, well before crystallinity is detected in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images or X-ray diffraction. The nanoaggregate’s temperature-size phase diagram reveals a convergence of the zeolite–amorphous equilibrium and maximum crystallization rate at ~3 nm diameter nanoparticle diameters and ~200 °C. This convergence signals the termination of the first-order amorphous-to-zeolite transition. Our results provide a unifying framework for understanding nucleation of silica zeolites from solution and suggest that barrierless nucleation may govern the formation of other nanoparticle systems, including minerals and oxides synthesized far below their bulk melting points.",

Its primary target is the growth plate—a cartilaginous structure driving bone elongation—yet the cellular mechanisms underlying GH action remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a direct role for GH in regulating a recently defined population of cartilaginous stem cells within the growth plate. Using multiple transgenic mouse models, we show that GH reduces the pool of slow-cycling, label-retaining stem cells by promoting their differentiation into transient progenitors. Clonal and lineage-tracing analyses reveal that these stem cells renew via population asymmetry and that GH promotes their committed cell division, leading to stem cell depletion. Conversely, genetic deletion of the GH receptor in stem cells impairs their ability to generate chondrocytes, confirming a direct GH effect. These findings support a general principle by which endocrine cues regulate tissue regeneration, establish a mechanistic link between GH signaling and cartilaginous stem cells, and provide a potential explanation for certain related clinical observations, such as the declining long-term efficacy of GH therapy.",

          "abstract": "Most biological populations are rich in diversity, and negative frequency-dependent (NFD) selection is a well-known mechanism thought to underlie this stable coexistence of multiple variants. Recent studies confirm its widespread presence at local spatial scales, however it remains unclear whether these local-scale dynamics are sufficient to maintain diversity across larger, landscape-level scales. While prior theoretical work has found that local NFD selection can indeed promote global coexistence, these studies only analyzed contiguous landscapes. In contrast, many ecosystems are not contiguous, but rather spatially fragmented or exhibit spatial variation in the local carrying capacity. Using a population-genetic model based on the classic island framework, we show that, in fragmented populations, NFD selection can paradoxically reduce coexistence and shorten fixation times, relative to neutrality. Fragmentation also generates a nonmonotonic relationship between fixation time and population size, with diversity minimized at intermediate scales, contrasting with the classical species–area relationship. Extending the model to a multispecies context reveals that these effects also shape species-level diversity. This allows us to develop a test for the influence of NFD selection in fragmented systems, based on the predicted nonmonotonic species–area relationship. Applying this test to an avian diversity dataset from the Ryukyu Islands, we find a signature suggesting that NFD selection and habitat fragmentation may interact to suppress biodiversity in this system. Together, our findings suggest that fragmentation can undermine the stabilizing effects of NFD selection, calling into question its generality as a mechanism for maintaining biodiversity in heterogeneous landscapes.",

In mammals, tracheal multiciliated cells (MCCs) play an important role in elimination of hazardous microorganisms by driving a unidirectional mucus flow. Although uniform orientation of ciliary beating is critical for the unidirectional flow, it remains unknown how MCCs establish uniform orientations and maintain identities of hundreds of ciliary membranes. This study focuses on investigating the roles of Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Family Member 3 (Tppp3) in MCC function. We generated a Tppp3-deficient mouse ( Tppp3 ∆ex2-4/∆ex2-4 ; Tppp3 knockout (KO)) and found that the Tppp3 KO mouse exhibited cough and hyposmia phenotype. The loss of Tppp3 disrupted the apical microtubules (MTs) meshwork in the tracheal MCCs, leading to random orientation and alignment of basal bodies (BBs) of the motile cilia. Unexpectedly, aberrant ciliary membrane fusions occurred in the trachea of the Tppp3 KO mice. We examined the underlying molecular mechanism of the ciliary membrane fusion by isolating the tracheal cilium. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis as well as pharmacological analysis revealed that hyperaccumulation of a long chain ceramide at the ciliary membrane caused the membrane fusion. In addition, sensory cilia formation was impaired in the olfactory sensory neuron of the Tppp3 KO mice. Due to the lack of Tppp3, dendritic MT assembly that underlies long-range migration of BBs toward the cell surface was impaired.

          "abstract": "Protein misfolding plays a central role in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), often driven by specific aggregation-prone segments such as A β 17–23 and A β 37–42 of amyloid- β 42 (A β 42), α -Syn 66–74 and α -Syn 71–82 of α -synuclein ( α -syn), hIAPP 22–27 of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), and TTR 105–115 of transthyretin (TTR). Capturing the atomic-level structural features of these transient and dynamically fluctuating regions remains challenging. Two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy provides rich vibrational fingerprints that are highly sensitive to protein conformational dynamics, but extracting atomic-resolution structural information from these complex signals is nontrivial. In this study, we present a machine learning framework that integrates 2DIR spectra with deep structural modeling to reconstruct the three-dimensional atomic structures of monomeric intrinsically disordered aggregation-prone segments of amyloidogenic proteins. Using this model, we were able to predict the conformational ensembles of aggregation-prone segments from amyloid- β 42, α -synuclein, human islet amyloid polypeptide, and transthyretin, as well as the structural evolution of A β 42 bound to a small-molecule inhibitor, directly from computationally derived 2DIR spectra. An attention module highlights the most informative spectral features associated with local structural variations, providing interpretable links between spectra and structure. This generalizable strategy paves the way for interpreting time-resolved spectroscopic studies and offers a promising computational framework for probing misfolding-related structural dynamics and therapeutic mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Structural coloration offers many advantages over conventionally used pigment-based colors due to their nontoxic, fade-resistant, and environmentally friendly nature. These colors arise from the structural arrangements of colorless materials at the nanoscale, which create optical resonances and vibrant hues. Over the last decade, dynamic color generation has been the subject of extensive research across various scientific disciplines. However, commercial adoption has been limited by the absence of effective tuning mechanisms, structural complexities, and fabrication challenges. In this work, we demonstrate active color tuning based on phase modulation of a multilayer stack composed of a phase-changing material (PCM) and a high-index material on a reflective surface. We elucidate the underlying interfacial and cavity phase modulation mechanisms responsible for the dynamic color changes, highlighting the potential for tailoring the optical properties of this thin-film stack for a wide range of practical applications. Furthermore, we showcase the lithography-free implementation of this concept for large-area, color-tunable textiles, complex surfaces, and temperature-sensitive consumer product labeling, highlighting its efficacy in tunable, scalable, and sustainable coloration. Leveraging dynamic phase modulation, this concept holds immense promise for applications in thermal sensing, advanced textile engineering, camouflage, and reconfigurable displays.",

          "abstract": "Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka–Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (nonrandom) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction conditions. These results can be understood through a quantity we term “dressed invasion fitness,” which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

ARGs can be specified in terms of topologies and coalescence times. The coalescence times are usually estimated using an informative prior derived from coalescent theory, but this may generate biased estimates and can also complicate downstream inferences based on ARGs. Here, we introduce, Prior-Oblivious Length Estimation in Genealogies with Oriented Networks (POLEGON), an approach for estimating branch lengths for ARGs which uses an uninformative prior. Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and leads to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions (population expansion, bottleneck, split, etc.). It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates. We apply the method to data from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate population size histories and differential mutation signatures across populations. We also estimate coalescence times in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region and show that they exceed 30 My in multiple segments.",

Even in the absence of antibiotic resistance, hvKp liver abscesses often respond poorly to treatment, sometimes requiring surgical resection. The reason for these poor outcomes remains unknown. Here, we established an hvKp wound model in outbred immunocompetent mice, which progresses to systemic infection and hepatic abscesses that were intractable to antibiotic therapy. Using a combination of quantitative and infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization imaging mass spectrometry, we found that antibiotics fail to kill K. pneumoniae in liver abscesses, independently of resistance or spatial distribution of antibiotics. Our results show that antibiotic concentrations detected in the liver are sufficient to eradicate hvKp under standard in vitro conditions, but the continued presence of viable bacteria in vivo indicates that hvKp adopts an antibiotic-tolerant state within the liver. Notably, the inadequate antibiotic efficacy observed in our mouse studies mirrors clinical outcomes. These findings underscore the urgent need to elucidate the mechanism underlying hvKp tolerance, which could inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21 to 46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron–phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order.",

In paired dorsal-anterior-lateral neurons—critical for aversive olfactory memory—Rrp1 knockdown impairs memory formation, whereas its overexpression enhances retention. Pharmacological inhibition of Rrp1 redox activity with E3330 suppresses Period and CaMKII expression, disrupting LTM formation. Notably, human APE1 redox activity rescues memory deficits in Rrp1-deficient flies, promotes de novo Period synthesis, and facilitates LTM formation. Moreover, Rrp1 is required for CREBA-mediated LTM acceleration, revealing a redox-dependent link between transcriptional regulation and memory persistence. These findings establish Rrp1 as a critical modulator of LTM in Drosophila and highlight redox regulation as a conserved mechanism underlying memory formation.",

          "abstract": "The rate and spectrum of somatic mutations can diverge from that of germline mutations. This is because somatic tissues experience different mutagenic processes than germline tissues. Here, we use nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq) to identify somatic mutations in Arabidopsis shoots with high sensitivity. We report a somatic mutation rate of 3.6 × 10 −8 mutations/bp, ~2 to 7× measured germline mutation rates. Somatic mutations displayed elevated signatures consistent with oxidative damage, UV damage, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Both somatic and germline mutations were enriched in transposable elements and depleted in genes, but this depletion was greater in germline mutations. Somatic mutation rate correlated with proximity to the centromere, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene/TE content, properties which were also largely true of germline mutations. We note that DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility have different predicted effects on mutation rate for genic and nongenic regions; DNA methylation associates with a greater increase in mutation rate when in nongenic regions, and accessible chromatin associates with a lower mutation rate in nongenic regions but a higher mutation rate in genic regions. Together, these results characterize key differences and similarities in the genomic distribution of somatic and germline mutations.",

          "abstract": "Life-history trade-offs between reproduction and survival are well documented, yet the biological mechanisms underlying costs remain unclear. Telomere length (TL) is a potential biomarker for such costs, although its association with reproductive efforts is mixed. Bats, particularly the long-lived greater horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ), provide a rare opportunity to explore these dynamics due to their longevity and low reproductive rates. We examined telomere dynamics in 202 female R. ferrumequinum (819 samples) from a wild population with over 65 y of monitoring, to assess whether reproductive effort leads to telomere shortening (cost of reproduction) or whether longer telomeres were associated with greater reproductive success (reflecting individual quality). Using Bayesian models, we show that females breeding from 2 y of age had significantly shorter relative TL (rTL) compared to females delaying reproduction until later ages. Selective disappearance was evident, with individuals possessing shorter rTL less likely to persist in the population. Cumulative reproductive success showed a positive nonsignificant association with rTL, consistent with the idea that long-term costs may be mitigated by individual quality or selective disappearance of low-quality individuals. However, short-term reproductive costs were evident, particularly in older females that bred in the previous year. Female R. ferrumequinum rTL declined during annual summer reproductive periods, particularly through the energetically demanding lactation stage. Within individuals, shorter rTL was associated with a reduced probability of surviving to the following year. These findings highlight the interplay between reproductive investment, telomere dynamics, and survival, supporting aspects of both the cost of reproduction and individual quality hypotheses in long-lived, low-fecundity species such as bats.",

The correlation length at the freeze-out instant t ̂ when the order parameter catches up with the posttransition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well, we analyze the Landau–Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry-breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.",

In plants, light not only initiates photomorphogenesis but also reshapes higher-order chromatin architecture.

Here, we applied Fiber-seq, a long-read, single-molecule chromatin profiling method, to construct near-nucleotide resolution maps of chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning, and cytosine methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize. We observed that light exposure during photomorphogenesis led to significant, locus-specific changes in chromatin accessibility—both increases and decreases—especially in genes related to photosynthesis, hormone signaling, and development. Analysis of chromatin accessibility changes in cop1-6 , pifq , and hy5 hyh mutants revealed that classical light signaling pathways regulate chromatin accessibility. Additionally, using high-fidelity long-read sequencing, we profiled DNA methylation in previously inaccessible repetitive regions such as 5S rRNA gene clusters and CEN180 satellite repeats. These heterochromatic loci exhibited distinct light-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility that were undetectable using prior methods. In maize, we demonstrated that Fiber-seq identifies a broader range of biologically relevant open chromatin regions, enabling both high-accuracy de novo genome assembly and the detection of fine-scale structural variants. Collectively, Fiber-seq offers an integrated view of chromatin states across regulatory and repetitive elements, providing critical insights into how environmental signals reshape plant epigenomes.",

A central question concerns which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations are responsible for sustaining steady-state hematopoiesis in vivo without conditioning. Noninvasive HSC fate-mapping strategies to address this question require specific labeling of LT-HSCs only. In this study, we selectively labeled a subset of Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs—excluding short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs)—to track the progeny of these cells. Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs comprise ~1 in 100,000 bone marrow cells. MPPs were not labeled until several months post-induction, indicating their derivation from LT-HSCs. At no time were MPPs labeled and LT-HSCs not, consistent with the origin and maintenance of MPPs from LT-HSCs. Hoxb5+ LT-HSCs are the principal contributors to steady-state in situ hematopoiesis, but only a fraction of LT-HSCs were labeled by the Cre/LoxP conversion to a lineage-tracing color. We tested whether quiescent HSCs could have incised the DNA at loxp sites, but did not finish the rearrangement. Analysis of phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) revealed that quiescent LT-HSCs retain Cre/LoxP-induced DNA incisions, which are repaired upon cell cycle entry, leading to the appearance of newly labeled LT-HSCs at later time points, mainly of the myeloid-biased HSC. Moreover, most LT-HSCs exhibit marked expansion in response to hematopoietic stress. With the age-related shift of blood formation from balanced to myeloid biased, the myeloid-biased HSCs expand preferentially after 6 mo of tracking.",

In this study, we realized an effective n = 3-body Hamiltonian interaction using an ensemble of laser-cooled atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity with the pseudospin 1 / 2 encoded by two atomic momentum states. We applied two dressing tones that induce the atoms to exchange photons via the cavity to realize a virtual six-photon process; lower-order interactions destructively interfered. We also observed signatures of a n = 4-body interaction mediated by a virtual eight-photon process. Our approach may be extensible to three-body interactions in multilevel systems or to even higher-order interactions.",

This ability requires (i) extracting a steady rhythmic pulse, or beat, out of continuous sounds; (ii) projecting this pattern forward in time; and (iii) timing motor commands to anticipate future beats. Here, we demonstrate that macaques can synchronize to a subjective beat in real music and even spontaneously do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential “vocal-learning hypothesis” that musical beat synchronization is privileged to species with complex learned vocalizations. We propose an alternative view of musical beat perception and synchronization as a continuum onto which different species can be mapped based on their capacity to coordinate the general abilities listed above through association with reward.",

Swapping HOAP’s adaptively evolving interaction partner, HipHop (HP1-HOAP–interacting protein), between closely related Drosophila species disrupted HOAP recruitment to the telomere, leading to lethal telomere fusions. Reverting six adaptively evolving sites on HipHop’s interaction surface with HOAP, or introducing its conspecific HOAP, restored protein recruitment, telomere protection, and viability.

Although mTOR phosphorylates many substrates in vitro, in cells, mTORC1 and mTORC2 have high specificity: mTORC2 phosphorylates the protein kinases Akt and PKC, but not closely related kinases that are mTORC1 substrates. To understand how mTORC2 recognizes substrates, we created semisynthetic probes to trap the mTORC2-Akt complex and determine its structure. Whereas most protein kinases recognize amino acids adjacent to the phosphorylation site, local sequence contributes little to substrate recognition by mTORC2. Instead, the specificity determinants were secondary and tertiary structural elements of Akt that bound the mTORC2 component mSin1 distal to the mTOR active site and were conserved amongst at least 18 related substrates. These results reveal how mTORC2 recognizes its canonical substrates and may enable the design of mTORC2-specific inhibitors.",

However, promoter-proximal elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action – even across strong CTCF insulators. Finally, transcriptional dynamics and the emergence of embryonic cell types remain largely robust despite disrupted extrusion.

Using single cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of cartilage, we identified the major chondrocyte subpopulations. Inhibition of 15-PGDH decreased hypertrophic-like chondrocytes expressing 15-PGDH and increased extracellular matrix-synthesizing articular chondrocytes.

Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared with Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted Pt from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure.

In sum, our framework enables efficient phenotypic hit identification campaigns, with broad potential to accelerate drug discovery.",

          "abstract": "Forager societies in southwest Texas and northern Mexico painted polychromatic Pecos River style murals in limestone rock shelters containing well-preserved archaeological assemblages. To establish the temporal context of the murals, we obtained 57 direct radiocarbon dates and 25 indirect oxalate dates for pictographs across 12 sites using plasma oxidation and accelerator mass spectrometry. Bayesian modeling estimates that Pecos River style began between 5760 and 5385 calibrated years before the present (cal B.P.) and probably ended in 1370 to 1035 cal B.P. Painting spanned a duration of 4095 to 4780 years (68.3%). Stratigraphic and iconographic analyses revealed that eight of the murals were created as compositions adhering to a set of rules and an established iconographic vocabulary. Results suggest consistent messaging throughout a period marked by changes in material culture, land use, and climate. We propose that Pecos River style paintings, embedded in a cultural keystone landscape, faithfully transmitted a sophisticated metaphysics that later informed the beliefs and symbolic expression of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.",

          "abstract": "Urban environments may alter the landscape of disease transmission with implications for control. Yet, it is unclear whether urban-rural differences exist in the dynamics of childhood respiratory diseases, given specific mixing patterns in younger age groups. Here, we leverage county-level data on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from the United States to reveal an urban-rural gradient in both the intensity and age structure of the RSV epidemic, where urban locations experience more prolonged epidemics with higher burden in infants (under 1 year of age). We develop a mechanistic epidemiological model to show that these differences can be explained by daycare utilization rates in children under 5. Using our model to consider control measures, we find that expanding seasonal immunization access in urban and rural areas may limit the risk of off season RSV epidemics.",

We analyzed mortality data from 11 Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems across sub-Saharan Africa (2005 to 2015) to examine temporal changes in heat-related mortality risk. Contrary to global trends, our findings suggest that heat vulnerability is increasing across African populations. Nighttime heatwave mortality risk increased significantly between 2005 to 2010 and 2011 to 2015 [OR from 1.02 (95% CI: 0.87 to 1.13) to 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13 to 1.23)], while daytime heatwaves showed no significant impact. Compound heatwaves transformed from nonsignificant to significant risk factors [OR = 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.22)]. Males showed increased risks across all heatwave types, females only for nighttime and compound heat. Children under 5 showed universal risk increases, while the elderly showed the highest increases for nighttime and compound heat. These findings suggest that physiological adaptation alone is insufficient to cope with increasingly frequent heatwaves without adequate socioeconomic resources. Heightened nighttime vulnerability underscores the need for context-specific adaptations reflecting Africa’s distinct conditions.",

          "abstract": "Risky behavior disproportionately contributes to death in the working-age (i.e., 15 to 64 years old) population. Men exhibit riskier behavior than do women. As a result, working-age men die more frequently than do working-age women. Despite these circumstances, surprisingly little research has attempted to estimate the gender-specific efficacy of societal restraint of risky behavior. This study provides such estimations by exploiting differences among the Nordic countries in the dose of forced restraint adopted to reduce mortality in the pre-vaccine COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that relatively great restraint reduced the likelihood of death among working-age men but not among working-age women. The findings suggest that debate over the wisdom of forced restraint of behavior as a strategy to reduce deaths should reflect the likely divergent effects of such interventions on working-age men and women.",

          "abstract": "As anthropogenic climate change threatens to destabilize global societies and ecosystems, anticipating likely human responses becomes ever more urgent. A key global initiative is the promotion of peaceful relations. Nonetheless, studies that systematically evaluate factors that promote peace are limited, and research focuses on recent centuries when climate conditions were stable. Here, we couple evolutionary ecology theory with machine learning models to investigate the relative effects of climatological, demographic, and socio-political conditions on the persistence of peace over the 10,000-year Central Andean Holocene sequence. We find that stable climate conditions and low population density have a strong influence on peace, even when average climate conditions are not ideal for farming. Given that climate projection models predict increasing climate volatility in coming decades, our results suggest that future climate instability may weaken peaceful interactions, particularly among subsistence populations in marginal environments.",

Approximately 80% of individuals with FA exhibit metabolic abnormalities, including failure to thrive and increased diabetes risk. Current management relies on physical examinations and glucose tolerance tests, which lack dynamic metabolic assessment. We used stable isotope labeling with 13 C 6 -glucose to track nutrient metabolism in individuals with FA. Unlike controls, persons with FA showed no postprandial increase in energy expenditure, sustained hyperglycemia accompanied by elevated glycolysis, and a markedly higher ketogenic response supporting a shift toward lipid utilization. Hormonal analysis revealed secretion of pancreatic hormones and ghrelin in individuals with FA, while incretins were unaffected. These results reflect a profound alteration in substrate utilization involving glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and β-cell dysfunction. This innovative approach provides unprecedented insights into FA pathophysiology, which will inform more targeted nutritional and therapeutic interventions for this complex disorder.",

          "abstract": "Proteinuric kidney disease substantially affects renal tubules through incompletely understood mechanisms. We identify elongation of primary cilia in distal renal tubules in the context of glomerular nephropathy. In renal biopsies and mouse models, tubular injury correlates with ciliary elongation, tubule dilation, and disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In vitro studies implicate biophysical cues of the glomerular filtrate and subsequent dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton as contributing factors, confirmed by conditional deletion of N-WASP and Arp2/3 in vivo and in vitro. Electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed enlarged ciliary pockets, basal body mislocalization, and intracellular cilia formation in Arp3 knockout conditions. Transcriptome analysis identifies the essential role of cilia in maintaining adaptive tubular cell states, while persistent activation leads to disease progression through extracellular matrix remodeling, exemplified by Tenascin-C. Our findings establish cilia as central mediators of tubular adaptation to injury and identify the Arp2/3-dependent actin cytoskeleton as a critical regulator, providing essential insights into the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.",

Here, we introduce a shear-assisted digital light-processing 4D printing strategy for spatiotemporal programming the mechanical anisotropy of dielectric liquid crystal elastomers (DLCEs). The printed DLCE actuators exhibit reversible multidimensional shape morphing (e.g., bending, twisting, and complex curved surfaces) under electric fields, governed by regional stiffness gradients. An inverse design algorithm is also developed to convert target 3D surfaces into executable printing tasks. Submillimeter-scale fidelity in reconstructing complex geometries, such as a panda face, a biomimetic plant and the Yellow River’s landform, demonstrates capabilities applicable to soft robotics and adaptive systems.",

          "abstract": "Using megahertz x-ray free electron laser imaging with x-ray pulses of ~25 femtoseconds and a machine-learning strategy, we have conducted comprehensive in situ imaging studies on the dynamics of cavitation bubble clouds in ultrasound fields at the SPB/SFX beamline of the European XFEL. The research unambiguously revealed the quasi-simultaneous implosion of multiple bubbles and simultaneous collapse of bubble cloud in nanosecond scale and their dynamic impacts onto two-dimensional (2D) materials for layer exfoliation. We have also performed multiphysics modeling to simulate the shock wave emission, propagation, impact, and stresses produced. We elucidated the critical conditions for producing instant or fatigue exfoliation and the effects of bonding strengths and structural defects on the exfoliation rate. The discoveries have filled the long-standing missing knowledge gaps in the underlying physics of exfoliating 2D materials in ultrasound fields, providing a solid theoretical foundation for optimizing and scaling-up operation to produce 2D materials in a much more cost-effective and sustainable way.",

However, their regulatome and immediate functions remain elusive. Using the FeaSion (Feature-Screening-Function) strategy, we mapped RNAPII phosphorylation site-specific interactors and genomic occupancy, revealing links to preferential gene length, exon number, and transcription factor binding. CRISPR-FACS screens identified different candidate regulators modulating individual phosphorylation sites. Rapid replacement showed site-specific mutations influence different transcriptional processes, histone modifications (H3K36me3 and H2A.Zac), and preferentially affect developmental and signaling genes. Moreover, we demonstrate kinases CLK1/4 and YES1 directly regulate RNAPII transcription—via site-specific CTD phosphorylation—to control developmental, metabolic, and signal transduction programs. Our findings reveal an expanded regulatory network involving &gt;100 kinase and phosphatases that potentially orchestrate CTD phosphorylation beyond their canonical functions, establishing a multilayered phospho-regulatory network with broad implications for gene expression control in development and disease.",

Their changeable nature poses a challenge for reliable signaling, because for signals to be reliable, they should be consistent. Glossy visual effects defy that principle, because the bright, directional pulse of light that dominates their appearance is highly variable across space and time. Here, we investigate how dynamic light reflections influence signal efficacy using bumblebees as a model of insect vision and plant-pollinator interactions. We show that glossy floral signals occur across Angiosperm lineages. Through behavioral experiments with artificial stimuli that mimic the spectral and spatial reflectance properties of glossy and matte floral surfaces, we demonstrate that glossiness enhances long-range detectability but compromises fine-scale color discrimination at close range. Glossiness thus poses an optical property by which organisms can attune their visual appearance independent of pigmentary properties, representing a functional trade-off between conspicuousness and signal reliability.",

In the majority of cases, RNR activity is allosterically regulated by the cellular 2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (dATP)/adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) ratio. To investigate allosteric activity regulation in anaerobic or class III (glycyl radical containing) RNRs, we determine cryo–electron microscopy structures of the class III RNR from Streptococcus thermophilus (StNrdD). We find that StNrdD’s regulatory “cone” domains adopt markedly different conformations depending on whether the activator ATP or the inhibitor dATP is bound and that these different conformations alternatively position an “active site flap” toward the active site (ATP-bound) or away (dATP-bound). In contrast, the position of the glycyl radical domain is unaffected by the cone domain conformations, suggesting that StNrdD activity is regulated through control of substrate binding rather than control of radical transfer. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and mutagenesis support the structural findings. In addition, our structural data provide insight into the molecular basis by which ATP and dATP binding lead to the observed differential cone domain conformations.",

Extracellular vesicles derived from injured brain tissue (TBI-EVs) may mediate brain-kidney interactions. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TBI-EVs causes AKI by promoting pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. TBI-EVs markedly increased AKI markers and proportion of pro-inflammatory-polarized macrophages. Mechanistically, transcriptomics of TBI-EVs revealed high circUsp32 expression. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that circUsp32 competitively binds to the SH2 domain of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (Socs1), affecting interferon regulator factor 7 (IRF7) ubiquitination and promoting pro-inflammatory polarization. CircUsp32 knockdown reduced pro-inflammatory polarization and alleviated AKI in TBI mice. In addition, circUsp32 is homologous to hsa_circ_0044940, which may serve as a predicted biomarker of AKI after TBI. Notably, AKI following TBI may contribute to neuroinflammation via uremic toxins. Collectively, these findings suggest that circUsp32 mediates macrophage polarization through the Socs1/IRF7 axis and could be a potential biomarker for AKI following TBI.",

The correlations suggest a simple yet common mechanism of glass formation for the chain molecules, i.e., fast-relaxing chain ends alleviate the requirements of cooperativity for structural rearrangement, thus facilitating the cooperative motion that reduces T g and m as chain length is shortened. We categorize the role of end groups between soft and rigid by proposing a physical quantifier—index of rigidity. Our results provide a unifying picture of polymer glass formation, regarding the role of chain end, length, and topology, a foundational phenomenon with implications across fields of chemistry, soft-condensed matters, and material science.",

Here, we identify that LMD-3, a LysM domain protein, is a critical regulator of proteostasis and reproductive capacity in C. elegans . Deficiency of lmd-3 leads to notable defects in oxidation resistance and constitutively high cellular stress responses. We demonstrate that LMD-3, localized to the lysosome, interacts with vitellogenin and a proton-pumping V-type ATPase via its TLDc domain to regulate lysosomal function and maintain yolk protein homeostasis. We also found that supplementing with vitamin B12 can restore fertility in lmd-3 mutants by reducing oxidative stress and improving lysosomal function.

We developed a 3D photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS)–ABVS system that integrates a large field-of-view, 768-element transducer to improve diagnostic accuracy. In a clinical study of 61 patients with 36 benign and 30 malignant lesions, multispectral photoacoustic imaging was used to measure blood volume and oxygen saturation within lesions. When combined with standard US BI-RADS (breast imaging reporting and data system) scores, the system achieved a sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 66.7%. This performance matched the best outcomes of 2D PAUS and outperformed conventional US.

However, the origin of this selectivity is not well understood, impeding the strategic optimization for methanol generation. Here, we show potential-modulated orbital interaction mechanisms governing the selectivity in hetero-CoPc based on first-principles calculations with consideration of carbon support and electrochemical interfaces. Specifically, constant-potential orbital-resolved analyses reveal that electrons introduced by applied potentials initially occupy the semi-occupied Co-3d z 2 orbital, thus suppressing CO-5σ → Co-3d z 2 electron donation. This induces gradual weakening of *CO adsorption while establishing high *CO hydrogenation barriers (restricting the product to CO) over the medium potential range. With further decreasing potentials, a progressive electron population occurs in the Co-3d yz /d xz orbitals, promoting the Co-3d xz /d yz → CO-2π* back-donation. This facilitates the activation of the C─O bond of *CO, thereby reducing its hydrogenation barriers and enabling methanol production at more negative potentials. Similar analyses also rationalize experimental observations for other heterogenized metal phthalocyanines, showing the importance of potential-modulated orbital interactions for selectivity engineering.",

Instead, we identify a previously unrecognized link between AWP hydroclimate and the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) operating on millennial to orbital timescales. During intervals of high summer insolation coupled with cooler tropical North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), NASH strengthens and expands westward, reducing rainfall across the AWP. This SST-NASH coupling amplified precessional-scale hydroclimate variability between 130 and 60 ka, when insolation amplitude was nearly twice that of the 60- to 12-ka interval. Our data further show that particularly strong insolation peaks at 105 and 126 ka caused pronounced westward NASH expansion, triggering two extreme dry events, similar to the process observed during modern midsummer dry spells.",

Using a spatial oddball paradigm, we found tuning to stimuli in deviant positions alongside adaptation to standard positions within the visual field. Eye tracking demonstrated that responses remained spatially selective despite gaze shifts altering retinal stimulus position. Thus, the turtle cortex encodes unexpected visual stimuli using computations invariant to retinal position, a property previously observed only in higher mammalian cortices. These results indicate that invariance computations preceded the evolution of local filtering computations in mammalian primary cortices, pointing to a previously unidentified function for ancestral cortices.

By enhancing the cGMP sensitivity and open probability of SthK mutants, we obtained four channel variants suited for different levels of cGMP concentration. CaRhGC’s membrane-bound nature enables localized cGMP production, and the lack of dark activity reduces the risk for off-target effects. Optimized RoCK effectively modulated cellular activity in mouse hippocampal neurons, in acute hippocampal slices, and in rabbit cardiomyocytes. In zebrafish, RoCK silenced motor neurons in vivo, suppressing the characteristic coiling behavior of embryos, thus highlighting its potential for behavioral studies.

While rsEEG revealed global neural slowing and disrupted synchrony, these measures reflected widespread changes in brain neurophysiology without network-specific insights. In contrast, TMS-EEG identified network-specific local hyperexcitability in the parietal DMN and disrupted connectivity with frontal DMN regions, which uniquely predicted distinct cognitive impairments and mediated the link between structural brain integrity and cognition.

Although this process is well studied, when and how blastomeres acquire the competence for lineage specification remains unclear. Here, we describe that CEBPa becomes up-regulated at the transition from the two- to the four-cell stage by NR5A2 and is also selectively expressed in the trophectoderm at the blastocyst stage. Its knockout decreases the proportion of trophectoderm cells and delays the morula to blastocyst transition. Conversely, CEBPa overexpression in mouse embryonic stem cells, used as a proxy, drives their differentiation into trophectoderm-like cells, enabling the identification of CEBPa-regulated trophectoderm-specific enhancers. A subset of these enhancers, associated with key trophectoderm-related transcription factor genes, is primed or activated in four- and eight-cell embryos. Together, our data suggest that CEBPa plays a role in the installment of trophectoderm competence before the first lineage bifurcation and in trophectoderm specification.",

However, designing stable solid electrolytes and interfaces in SSBs remains a formidable challenge. As a disruptive catalyst for paradigm shifts spanning materials discovery and energy system redesign, artificial intelligence (AI) is unleashing unprecedented possibilities—could it be the key breakthrough for SSB innovation? Here, we critically review the progress of AI applications in electrolyte and interface engineering, covering key aspects such as stability, conductivity, mechanical properties, and interface resistance. This work emphasizes the integration of cutting-edge modeling strategies, including the materials’ screening pipelines, machine learning force fields, and generative models. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of persistent challenges and propose a roadmap featuring multiscale modeling and multimodal models with physical constraints to build an intelligent ecosystem for SSB development. This review is expected to inspire interdisciplinary collaborations and drive forward energy materials design, ultimately accelerating the development of sustainable and cutting-edge battery technologies.",

Limb morphogenesis, for instance, requires interactions between the mesoderm and the signaling center apical-ectodermal ridge (AER), whose properties and role in cell fate decisions have remained challenging to dissect. To tackle this, we developed mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)–based heterogeneous cultures and a three-dimensional (3D) organoid model, termed budoids, comprising cells with AER, surface ectoderm, and mesoderm properties. mESCs were first induced into heterogeneous cultures that self-organized into domes in 2D. Aggregating these cultures formed mesodermal organoids with certain limb bud–like features in 3D, exhibiting chondrogenesis-based symmetry breaking and elongation. Using our organoids and quantitative in situ expression profiling, we uncovered that AER-like cells support nearby limb mesoderm and fibroblast identities while enhancing tissue polarization that permits distant cartilage formation. Together, our findings provide a powerful model to study epithelial signaling center-mesoderm interactions during morphogenesis and reveal the ability of signaling center AER cells to concurrently modulate cell fate and spatial organization.",

          "abstract": "During the 21st century, Earth’s energy imbalance (EEI) at the top of atmosphere has markedly increased because of greater absorbed shortwave (SW) rather than reduced outgoing longwave radiation. Previous studies using single-forcing (aerosol-only) experiments attributed approximately half of the positive SW trend to reductions in anthropogenic aerosols, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). In contrast, our analysis using observations and reanalysis indicates that both aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions have made a negligible contribution to recent EEI trends. While NH anthropogenic aerosols have decreased, enhanced emissions from wildfires and volcanic activity in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) have produced comparable increases, yielding little net global impact. This hemispheric compensation also suggests that model-based estimates may overestimate aerosol influence by overlooking SH aerosol contributions. Despite uncertainties in aerosol proxies, the consistent results from two complementary proxies—satellite-derived aerosol index and reanalysis-based sulfate mass concentration—highlight the importance of accounting for natural source aerosols when assessing EEI trends.",

However, its development is greatly hindered by sluggish CO 2 conversion kinetics, resulting in high overpotentials and poor reversibility. Herein, we report a class of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidoxyl (TEMPO) homogeneous catalyst to regulate CO 2 adsorption and optimize reaction pathways through a quantum tunneling effect induced by electron transfer from the TEMPO free radical to CO 2 that classical electron transfer mechanisms cannot overcome. This quantum tunneling effect not only enables CO 2 reduction at lower voltage but also regulates the CO 2 adsorption environment, leading to the alternated reaction pathway for the formation of flower-like MgC 2 O 4 as the discharge product, rather than the dense MgCO 3 typically formed in traditional models. The TEMPO-based Mg-CO 2 batteries achieve an exceptional discharge voltage of 1.1 volts and a charge voltage of 1.3 volts, with stable cycling performance for over 450 hours, representing the best-reported performance among Mg-CO 2 battery systems to date.",

Here, we report smart, compact wearable pressure-strain combo sensors continuously monitoring fetal movements through maternal abdominal skin motions. In the 2D and 3D artificial abdomen systems, our octagonal-shaped gold nanowire–based strain sensor served as an isotropic sensor, enabling omnidirectional simulated “kicking load” detection within an area of ~77 (2D) and ~217 cm 2 (3D), while an interdigitated electrode–based pressure sensor showed highly sensitive localized load detection. Building upon these findings, we designed compact pressure- and strain-sensing integrated Band-Aids and tested on 59 pregnant women.

However, many species’ movements are difficult to reconstruct from available datasets, hampering conservation efforts. This is especially the case for aquatic species that rarely surface, for which data are often limited to observations from acoustic telemetry (detections) and ancillary sensors. Here, we pioneer the use of state-of-the-art particle algorithms to model movements, integrate datasets, and assess MPA design, leveraging a case study of a Critically Endangered elasmobranch. Our algorithms led to 5-fold improvements in space-use maps and 30-fold improvements in residency estimates compared to prevailing methods. By integrating tracking datasets, we were uniquely able to examine movements beyond acoustic receivers, MPA-scale residency, and specific habitats beyond protected areas that warrant protection. This work reveals a modeling framework that enhances the conservation value of acoustic telemetry, supporting analyses of MPA efficacy worldwide.",

However, the extent to which H2AK119ub functions independently of H3K27me3 to repress or potentiate gene expression, and the evolutionary conservation of these roles, remains unclear. Here, we address the interplay among Polycomb-deposited marks and chromatin states in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. We find that H2AK119ub distribution is distinct from and largely dispensable for H3K27me3 patterns. Unexpectedly, H2AK119ub is enriched at predicted enhancers with developmentally dynamic changes in accessibility, including in neurons. More than two-thirds of well-documented axon guidance genes and neuronal identity transcription factors are associated with H2AK119ub. Many of the genes differentially expressed in H2AK119ub-deficient animals are involved in neuronal differentiation and signaling and feature H2AK119ub-enriched promoters and enhancers, including a subset that is H3K27me3 repressed. We uncover a likely conserved yet underappreciated dual role for H2AK119ub at enhancers and H3K27me3-repressed chromatin, with implications for nervous system development.",

Our design uses two-dimensional (2D) half-metals hosting strongly localized spin states (LSSs) at the Fermi level as two ferromagnet layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Multiple memory states emerge from bias-driven alignment/misalignment of LSSs on two sides, generating sudden tunneling pathway changes and distinguishable TMR. First-principles quantum transport simulations on MTJs based on 2D VCl 3 and FeCl 2 reveal unprecedented bias-controlled and widely modulable TMR ratios spanning −194 to 2677% and −130 to 37,424%, respectively, accompanied by rare polarity switch capabilities.

As the maintenance of this JNK-impaired state in the relapse setting is a substantial barrier to the efficacy of many standard-of-care chemotherapy drugs, we combined a mechanistic, mathematical model of JNK activation with a pediatric-focused drug screen and identified approved oncology drugs capable of inducing apoptosis in a JNK-independent manner. Functional genomics further revealed that synergy between these JNK-independent drugs and standard-of-care chemotherapies emerged from differential utilization of apoptotic network components, rather than from their direct mechanistic targets. Efficacy studies with patient-derived xenograft models also confirmed that including a JNK-independent drug within existing chemotherapy backbones significantly improved response in the relapse setting, where new approaches are urgently needed.",

Multiomics integration revealed strong links between IF-induced hippocampal gene expression, gut microbiota, and serum metabolites beneficial for cognition. Indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) emerged as a pivotal microbial metabolite. Blocking its neuronal receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), abolished IF’s effects. Human data paralleled these findings, showing lower IPA levels in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD than in controls. IPA supplementation and IPA-producing Clostridium sporogenes reproduced IF’s cognitive benefits, whereas PXR blockade in neurons or disruption of IPA synthesis abrogated them. IPA crossed the blood-brain barrier, exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity, and suppressed Aβ accumulation, essential for neuroprotection.

As common metrics such as the R 2 score cannot be calculated for a single prediction, predictions are commonly aggregated across folds for performance evaluation. Here, we prove that this creates “distributional bias”: a negative correlation between the average label of each training fold and the label of its corresponding test instance. As machine learning models tend to regress to the mean of their training data, this bias tends to negatively affect performance evaluation and hyperparameter optimization. We demonstrate that distributional bias exists across diverse tasks, models, and evaluation approaches, and can bias against stronger regularization. To address it, we developed a generalizable rebalanced cross-validation that is robust to distributional bias in both classification and regression, and demonstrates improved performance in simulations, machine learning benchmarks, and several published analyses.",

          "abstract": "Human type-II topoisomerases, TOP2A and TOP2B, resolve transcription-associated DNA supercoiling, thereby influencing gene expression programs, and have been recently linked to three-dimensional genome architecture through yet poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we investigate the regulatory roles of TOP2 paralogs using estrogen signaling, which triggers an acute transcriptional induction that involves extensive rewiring of genome organization, as a model system. Unexpectedly, we find that estrogen treatment strongly inhibits TOP2B catalytic activity—although not its binding—specifically at estrogen-responsive enhancers and promoters. This inhibition results in an accumulation of negative DNA supercoiling and promotes the formation of regulatory chromatin contacts. Estrogen-mediated inhibition of TOP2B activity depends on estrogen receptor α, a noncatalytic function of TOP2A, and, most importantly, the action of zinc finger protein associated with tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 and TOP2, an atypical small ubiquitin-like modifier ligase that directly inhibits TOP2 activity. This mechanism of transcriptional control, involving the fine-tuning of DNA supercoiling levels, highlights the role of DNA topoisomerases as central regulators of genome dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The tip stress concentration in linear wounds, a clinically prevalent issue yet overshadowed by circular defect studies, and chronic biotemporal discordance (static biomaterials versus dynamic tissue remodeling) remain largely underexplored, severely impeding wound healing. Here, an adhesive bioconjugate platform, HADEX, composed of two types of micrometer-sized polysaccharide-derived granules, was constructed for precise shaping and manipulation. Combining finite element modeling with a dynamically cross-linking adhesive driven by fluid convection, HADEX achieved both conformal tissue adhesion and modulation of the stress distribution within wet, linear wounds, thereby restoring tissue pretension. Furthermore, HADEX facilitated a seamless load transfer to regenerating tissue through synchronized HADEX degradation and endogenous extracellular matrix deposition. To validate the efficacy of HADEX, we demonstrated successful sutureless in vivo closure and healing of linear wounds in both the normal/diabetic rat and porcine skin incision models. The integration of computational design with biomaterials established a foundation for personalized, mechanics-informed regenerative therapies.",

Here, we capture the 50 S ribosomal precursor–Erm complex by cryo-EM and show that a transient pocket formed in the early steps of ribosome biogenesis, situated 35 angstrom from the methylation site, serves as an anchor for the auxiliary C-terminal domain of Erm, thereby playing a crucial role in achieving specificity in this short-lived substrate with evolving structural features. Cryo-EM reveals that the catalytic Rossman fold of Erm undergoes a swaying motion to facilitate substrate scouting. Corroboratory smFRET studies show that for effective catalysis, Erm transitions between multiple conformations, an effective strategy adopted to orient the dynamic helix where methylation occurs. Unraveling this unique mechanism of targeting adopted by Erm paves the way for selective design of allosteric inhibitors directed toward reversing MLS B resistance.",

CTCF interacts with endogenous RNAs, and deletion of its ZF1 RNA binding region (∆ZF1) disrupts chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the functional significance of CTCF-ZF1 RNA interactions during cell differentiation is unknown. Using an ESC–to–neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation model, we show that CTCF-ZF1 is crucial for maintaining cell type–specific chromatin loops. Expression of CTCF-∆ZF1 leads to disrupted loops and dysregulation of genes within these loops, particularly those involved in neuronal development and function. We identified NPC-specific, CTCF-ZF1 interacting RNAs. Truncation of two such coding RNAs, Podxl and Grb10 , disrupted chromatin loops in cis, similar to the disruption seen in CTCF-∆ZF1–expressing NPCs. These findings underscore the inherent importance of CTCF-ZF1 RNA interactions in preserving cell-specific genome structure and cellular identity.",

While we know that MeCP2 binds to methylated cytosines on DNA, the full breadth of the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 regulates gene expression remains incompletely understood. Here, using a genetic modifier screen, we identify the super elongation complex, a P-TEFb–containing elongation factor that releases promoter-proximally paused RNA polymerase II, as a genetic interactor of MECP2 . MeCP2 physically interacts with SEC subunits and directly binds AFF4, the scaffold of the SEC, via the transcriptional repression domain. Furthermore, MeCP2 facilitates the binding of AFF4 on a subset of genes in the mouse brain regulating synaptic plasticity and concordantly promotes the binding of RNA polymerase II on these genes. Last, while haploinsufficiency of Aff4 does not exhibit any behavioral deficits in mice, it exacerbates the impaired contextual learning behavior of Mecp2 hypomorphic mice. We propose a previously unknown mechanism by which MePC2 regulates gene expression underlying synaptic plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Soft 3D systems capable of dynamic, real-time shape morphing have broad applications in flexible electronics, biomedical devices, and soft robotics. Existing methods typically rely on stress relaxation in prestretched elastomeric substrates to transform 2D precursors into 3D structures. However, these structures lack the ability for further localized programmability after transformation. This work introduces a class of soft, 3D morphable electromagnetic structures that enable fast, reversible shape transformations, with precise local programmability even after the initial 3D transformation. These systems provide access to sophisticated geometries and motions that were previously unattainable. This approach combines controlled compressive buckling of liquid metal microfluidics and Lorentz force actuation to drive the transformation, guided by multiphysics computational modeling. A 4D electronic system serves as an application example, demonstrating the potential of these spatially and temporally programmable soft systems.",

          "abstract": "The ability to adapt previously learned behaviors is crucial for survival in dynamically changing environments. The hippocampus has been implicated in associative learning, but how hippocampus activity along its septotemporal axis contributes to flexible adaptation is unknown. Using in vivo Ca 2+ recordings and functional inhibition of dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and ventral CA1 (vCA1) neurons in mice during complementary cognitive flexibility tasks, we find that dCA1 is engaged and functionally required during consolidation of a learned contingency both before and after a rule change, whereas vCA1 is uniquely recruited during, and necessary for, early adaptation to a new contingency. This vCA1-dependent adaptation relies on a perseverative error signal, which is encoded in vCA1 and required for behavior updating. These results highlight a previously unknown division of labor within the hippocampus, in which vCA1 enables flexible adaptation when mismatches in expected and actual outcomes are detected, whereas dCA1 stabilizes newly learned information.",

While many advances have focused on ore formation at depth, a major challenge remains in understanding how erosion and uplift over millions of years affect deposit preservation. These postmineralization processes determine whether porphyry systems are exposed, buried, or eroded entirely. We present a physically based landscape evolution model that incorporates spatially variable erodibility, dynamic uplift histories, climate and sea level change, and evolving topography over geological timescales. This richer input data, combined with tighter calibration, enables quantification of preservation potential and marks a step beyond prior conceptual and time-static models. We apply the model to New Guinea’s geologically complex mountains and integrate it with machine learning–derived ore formation probabilities. The combined model predicts known porphyry endowment, identifies new targets, and constrains preservation likelihood, validating this open-source method as a flexible and affordable exploration tool in dynamic tectonic settings.",

Here, we leverage a dataset of 64 rivers across the globe to show that higher variability in river discharge and stage promotes higher rates of river migration. To reveal the physical processes behind this relationship, we focused analyses on the lowermost 500 kilometers of the Mississippi River, where a pronounced gradient in water stage variability and migration rate exists. We demonstrate that stage variability affects channel mobility by influencing the sediment size of riverbanks and thereby controlling riverbank erodibility. These results can be used to predict river responses to climate change and decipher past hydroclimates using stratigraphy from Earth and Mars.",

ALM neurons show preparatory activity that predict whether the mouse will produce a left- or right-directed lick. While the neural mechanisms underlying ALM dynamics and their links to behavior are beginning to be elucidated, the sources of this directional activity remain unclear. Here, we examined the role of ALM dopaminergic circuits in mice performing a directional licking task. We report that dopamine (DA) signals and the activity of neurons expressing D1 receptors (D1R + ) tracked the preparation and execution of licking and demonstrated a bias for planning of licks aimed at the direction contralateral to the recording site. Unilateral optogenetic manipulations of D1R + neurons or DA afferents affected lateral licking in a way consistent with their role in planning contralateral movements. Together, these results show that cortical DA modulation plays an important role in the motor preparation of directional movements.",

          "abstract": "Carbon monoxide electroreduction in alkaline membrane electrode assembly represents an effective approach to achieve carbon neutrality. However, its performance is currently limited by the insufficient modulation of local alkalinity at a full cell level. In this work, we reveal that confining the in situ generated hydroxide at cathode and enriching the bulk hydroxide to anode are the key factors for an efficient carbon monoxide–electroreduction full cell. We thereby propose a silica-confined strategy for electrocatalyst design to maintain high local alkalinity at both cathode and anode by the strong Lewis acid–base interaction between highly electrophilic silicon atom and hydroxide. The developed copper/silica cathode and cobalt/silica anode successfully promote cathodic multicarbon formation and anodic oxygen evolution, thereby improving the full cell energy efficiency. Even under high-rate electrolysis at 900 milliamperes per square centimeter, the selectivity and energy efficiency of multicarbon products remain above 80 and 30%. This achievement highlights the significance of modulating the dynamic hydroxide transport at full cell in enhancing carbon monoxide electroreduction performance.",
