          "abstract": "Experiments that track hippocampal place cells in mice navigating the same real environment have found significant changes in neural representations over a period of days1,2. However, whether such ‘representational drift’ serves an intrinsic function, such as distinguishing similar experiences that occur at different times3,4, or is instead observed due to subtle differences in the sensory environment or behaviour5,6,7, remains unresolved. Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability.",

          "abstract": "Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.",

A recent article by Jafferis et al.4 claims to experimentally realize this correspondence by demonstrating gravitational teleportation by means of an emergent traversable wormhole5,6,7,8,9,10. Unfortunately, we find that the Hamiltonian in Jafferis et al.4 does not satisfy two of the stated criteria for gravitational physics: it does not thermalize and the teleportation signal does not resemble traversable wormhole behaviour. Moreover, a third feature of gravitational systems—perfect size winding—appears to be satisfied only because the Hamiltonian implemented in Jafferis et al.4 is fully commuting, which is the exact property that leads to non-thermalizing behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is a pivotal phytohormone for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants have evolved two pathways to produce SA: the isochorismate synthase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways 1 . Whereas the isochorismate synthase pathway has been fully identified 2–4 , the PAL pathway remains incomplete. Here we report the full characterization of the PAL pathway for SA biosynthesis via functional analysis of rice ( Oryza sativa ) SA-DEFICIENT GENE 1 ( OSD1 ) to OSD4 . The cinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase OSD1 catalyses the conversion of trans -cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA, which is subsequently transformed to benzoyl-CoA via the β-oxidative pathway in peroxisomes. The resulting benzoyl-CoA is further converted to benzyl benzoate by the peroxisomal benzoyltransferase OSD2. Benzyl benzoate is subsequently hydroxylated to benzyl salicylate by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-resident cytochrome P450 OSD3, which is ultimately hydrolysed to salicylic acid by the cytoplasmic carboxylesterase OSD4. Evolutionary analyses reveal that the PAL pathway was first assembled before the divergence of gymnosperms and has been conserved in most seed plants. Activation of the PAL pathway in rice significantly enhances salicylic acid levels and plant immunity. Completion of the PAL pathway provides critical insights into the primary salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway across plant species and offers a precise target for modulating crop immunity.",

          "abstract": "Many animals use vision to navigate their environment. The pattern of changes that self-motion induces in the visual scene, referred to as optic flow 1 , is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective neurons 2–4 . However, how arrays of directionally selective neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at specific retinal positions, are organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits is unclear. Understanding this global organization requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across an animal’s field of view 3 . In Drosophila , the asymmetrical dendrites of the T4 and T5 directionally selective neurons establish their preferred direction, which makes it possible to predict directional tuning from anatomy 4,5 . Here we show that the organization of the compound eye shapes the systematic variation in the preferred directions of directionally selective neurons across the entire visual field. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in an electron-microscopy volume of the full adult fly brain 6 , and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations. We then used whole-head micro-computed-tomography scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets, and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the global organization of the directionally selective neurons’ preferred directions is determined mainly by the fly’s compound eye, revealing the intimate connections between eye structure, functional properties of neurons and locomotion control.",

          "abstract": "Since the advent of computing, humans have sought computer input technologies that are expressive, intuitive and universal. While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain–computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body’s electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem1, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals2,3,4. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.",

          "abstract": "Coherent quantum transition spectroscopy is a powerful tool in metrology1, quantum information processing2, magnetometry3 and precision tests of the standard model4. It was applied with great success in proton and deuteron magnetic moment measurements5, which culminated in maser spectroscopy with sub-parts-per-trillion resolution6 and many other experiments at the forefront of physics7. All of these experiments were performed on macroscopic ensembles of particles, whereas the coherent spectroscopy of a ‘free’ single nuclear spin has, to our knowledge, never been reported before. Here we demonstrate coherent quantum transition spectroscopy of the spin of a single antiproton stored in a cryogenic Penning-trap system. We apply a multi-trap technique8, detect the antiproton spin state using the continuous Stern–Gerlach effect9 and transport the particle to the homogeneous magnetic field of a precision trap (PT). Here we induce the coherent dynamics and analyse the result by quantum-projection measurements in the analysis trap (AT)10. We observe, for the first time, Rabi oscillations of an antiproton spin and achieve in time-series measurements spin-inversion probabilities greater than 80% at spin coherence times of about 50 s. Scans of single-particle spin resonances show inversions greater than 70%, at transition linewidths 16 times narrower than in previous measurements8, limited by cyclotron frequency measurement decoherence. This achievement marks a notable step towards at least tenfold improved tests of matter/antimatter symmetry using proton and antiproton magnetic moments.",

Here, inspired by remoras—fish equipped with specialized adhesive discs—we developed the Mechanical Underwater Soft Adhesion System (MUSAS). Through detailed anatomical, behavioural, physical and biomimetic investigations of remora adhesion on soft substrates, we uncovered the key physical principles and evolutionary adaptations underlying their robust attachment. These insights guided the design of MUSAS, which shows extraordinary versatility, adhering securely to a wide range of soft substrates with varying roughness, stiffness and structural integrity. MUSAS achieves an adhesion-force-to-weight ratio of up to 1,391-fold and maintains performance under extreme pH and moisture conditions. We demonstrate its utility across highly translational models, including in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo settings, enabling applications such as ultraminiaturized aquatic kinetic temperature sensors, non-invasive gastroesophageal reflux monitoring, long-acting antiretroviral drug delivery and messenger RNA administration via the gastrointestinal tract.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08939-7 (2025).\n\nIn their Comment, Kobrin et al.1 argue that the model experimentally implemented in our original article2 does not exhibit features consistent with a dual gravitational interpretation of wormhole dynamics. The process in ref. 2 consists of a two-sided system coupled by a precisely timed interaction that teleports two fermions, ψ1 and ψ2. We emphasize that it is meaningful to ask only about the interpretation of particular processes, here the two-sided teleportation; asking whether the Hamiltonian itself is ‘gravitational’ is not a meaningful question. Indeed the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonian, when all possible processes are examined, does not have a useful or weakly coupled gravity description. Only certain low-temperature correlation functions are dominated by the Schwarzian mode; the full theory contains many other interacting light fields and string-like corrections. The dual of the double-scaled SYK may have a discrete space, among many not standard gravitational effects. In understanding the holographic interpretation presented in ref. 2, it is expected that many processes applied to the learned Hamiltonian do not have a gravitational description, despite a traversable wormhole interpretation existing for the two-sided process.",

          "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is the active ingredient in willow bark that has been used for anti-inflammation and pain relief for centuries. Aspirin, a derivative of SA, is the most widely used medication in human history. SA also acts as a key plant defence hormone1,2,3,4. Although SA was known to be produced from chorismate in the model plant Arabidopsis5,6, how it is biosynthesized in plant families outside Brassicaceae remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a conserved pathway for SA biosynthesis in seed plants. Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model, we identified three key steps for the biosynthesis of SA. First, ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and benzyl alcohol by benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) gives rise to benzyl benzoate, which is then hydroxylated by benzyl benzoate oxidase (BBO) to produce benzyl salicylate. Subsequent cleavage of benzyl salicylate by benzyl salicylate hydrolase (BSH) yields SA. Notably, genes encoding these three enzymes are present in a broad range of plants, and the genes from dicots such as willow, poplar and soybean as well as the monocot rice can complement the phenotype of SA-deficient mutants of N. benthamiana. Moreover, knockout analysis of the Oryza sativa OsBEBT, OsBBO and OsBSH genes reveals that they are required for SA biosynthesis in rice. Our findings suggest that the SA biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in plants.",

This point marks the uppermost stability boundary for solids at temperatures typically around three times their melting point. Despite the theoretical prediction of this ultimate stability threshold, its practical exploration has been prevented by numerous intermediate destabilizing events, colloquially known as a hierarchy of catastrophes2,3,4,5, which occur at far lower temperatures. Here we experimentally test this limit under ultrafast heating conditions, directly tracking the lattice temperature by using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering. Our gold samples are heated to temperatures over 14 times their melting point while retaining their crystalline structure, far surpassing the predicted threshold and suggesting a substantially higher or potentially no limit for superheating. We point to the inability of our samples to expand on these very short timescales as an important difference from previous estimates.

To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics 2 are being developed, which make use of the electron’s spin as well as its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study spin-wave propagation at the nanoscale and atomic scale a key challenge 3,4 . The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to investigate spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant length scales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by local features. Here we detect bulk THz magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). By using high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel electron detectors, we overcome the challenges posed by weak signals to map THz magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons and exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks a milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the development of spintronic devices.",

This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. Whereas dPAG activity scales with running speed in P. maniculatus, neural activity in the dPAG of P. polionotus correlates poorly with movement, including during visually triggered escape. Moreover, optogenetic activation of dPAG neurons elicits acceleration in P. maniculatus but not in P. polionotus, and their chemogenetic inhibition during a looming stimulus delays escape onset in P. maniculatus to match that of P. polionotus. Together, we trace species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the mammalian brain.",

          "abstract": "Complex integumentary appendages such as avian feathers and mammalian hair play a principal role in tetrapod evolution, with critical functions in insulation, sensation, display and flight. Although feathers and hair originated in the stem-lineages of birds and mammals, respectively1,2, their underlying gene regulatory network has much deeper amniote roots3. The early evolution of amniote integumentary appendages, however, remains poorly understood because of the absence of fossil evidence. Here we present Mirasaura grauvogeli, a small-sized diapsid from the Middle Triassic epoch (about 247 million years ago) with a distinctive crest formed by elongate integumentary appendages extending serially along its back, similar to those of the poorly understood Triassic reptile Longisquama4,5,6,7. Despite its superficially bird-like skull, Mirasaura is not closely related to avemetatarsalians but instead belongs to the exclusively Triassic reptilian clade Drepanosauromorpha8. Melanosomes preserved in its integumentary appendages are consistent in geometry with melanosomes of feathers but not those of reptilian skin or mammalian hair. Nevertheless, the morphology of the integumentary appendages and phylogenetic placement of Mirasaura indicate that they are not structurally homologous to feathers or other integumentary appendages in living amniotes. Our findings show that complex integumentary appendages are not restricted to avemetatarsalians and mammaliaforms among amniotes and evolved in a lineage basal to all extant reptiles, challenging our understanding of the evolution of the reptilian integument.",

Immunotherapies have proved to be efficient in many medical areas, but have not been considered to treat brain diseases due to the poor brain penetration of immunoglobulins1,2. Here we developed a bivalent biparatopic antibody, made of two camelid heavy-chain antibodies (called nanobodies)3, one binding to, and the other potentiating the activity of, homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2. We show that this bivalent nanobody, given peripherally, reaches the brain and corrects cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction. Notably, these in vivo effects last for at least 7 days after a single intraperitoneal injection and are maintained after subchronic treatment. Our results establish a proof of concept that nanobodies can target brain receptors, and pave the way for nanobody-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain disorders.",

To meet the demands of a growing population, substantial improvements are required in crop yield, quality and production sustainability. However, these goals are constrained by various environmental factors and limited genetic resources. Overcoming these limitations requires a paradigm shift in crop improvement by fully leveraging natural genetic diversity alongside biotechnological approaches such as genome editing and the heterologous expression of designed proteins, coupled with multimodal data integration. In this Review, we provide an in-depth analysis of integrated uses of omics technologies, genome editing, protein design and high-throughput phenotyping, in crop improvement, supported by artificial intelligence-enabled tools. We discuss the emerging applications and current challenges of these technologies in crop improvement. Finally, we present a perspective on how elite alleles generated through these technologies can be incorporated into the genomes of existing and de novo domesticated crops, aided by a proposed artificial intelligence model. We suggest that integrating these technologies with agricultural practices will lead to a new revolution in crop improvement, contributing to global food security in a sustainable manner.",

In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices1,2,3,4,5. However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered. Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla6—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells. This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly. Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota. This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms. We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense7.",

Mechanistically, NNMT-induced H3K27me3 hypomethylation drives complement secretion from CAFs, attracting immunosuppressive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumour. Nnmt knockout in immunocompetent mice impairs tumour growth in syngeneic ovarian, breast and colon tumour models through enhanced CD8+ T cell activation. Using high-throughput screening, we develop a potent and specific NNMT inhibitor that reduces the tumour burden and metastasis in multiple mouse cancer models and restores immune checkpoint blockade efficacy by decreasing CAF-mediated recruitment of MDSCs and reinvigorating CD8+ T cell activation. Our findings establish NNMT as a central CAF regulator and a promising therapeutic target to mitigate immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment.",

We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. By contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the northern Atlantic and, on the opposite side of the globe, southern Australia. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments.",

However, the spatio-functional relationship between pre-rRNA processing and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to changing cellular physiological demands have remained incompletely understood6,7. Here, our spatiotemporal analyses revealed a compartment-specific ribosomal subunit processing in human nucleoli, with SSU processomes maintained in fibrillar center/dense fibrillar component/periphery dense fibrillar component (FC/DFC/PDFC) domains while LSU pre-rRNAs largely transited to PDFC/granular component (GC) regions. Slow proliferating cells exhibited unexpected 5' external transcribed space (5' ETS)-centered SSU processing impairment, accompanied by FC/DFC structural remodeling and retarded SSU outflux. Direct 5' ETS processing perturbation at least partially recapitulated these FC/DFC alterations, supporting the functional interdependence between SSU processing and nucleolar architecture. Notably, anamniote bipartite nucleoli with merged FC/DFC compartments8,9 exhibited distinct 5' ETS distribution and slower pre-rRNA flux compared to multi-layered nucleoli in amniotes. Introducing a FC/DFC interface to bipartite nucleoli enhanced processing efficiency, indicating that evolutionary emergence of nested FC/DFC may have optimized pre-rRNA processing. Collectively, depicting the spatiotemporal distribution of pre-rRNAs revealed an essential role of 5' ETS-centered SSU processing in maintaining nucleolar substructures and suggested a possible evolutionary advantage of the multi-layered structure in amniotes.",

Historians capture these insights by identifying parallels—inscriptions with shared phrasing, function or cultural setting—to enable the contextualization of texts within broader historical frameworks, and perform key tasks such as restoration and geographical or chronological attribution1. However, current digital methods are restricted to literal matches and narrow historical scopes. Here we introduce Aeneas, a generative neural network for contextualizing ancient texts. Aeneas retrieves textual and contextual parallels, leverages visual inputs, handles arbitrary-length text restoration, and advances the state of the art in key tasks. To evaluate its impact, we conduct a large study with historians using outputs from Aeneas as research starting points. The historians find the parallels retrieved by Aeneas to be useful research starting points in 90% of cases, improving their confidence in key tasks by 44%. Restoration and geographical attribution tasks yielded superior results when historians were paired with Aeneas, outperforming both humans and artificial intelligence alone. For dating, Aeneas achieved a 13-year distance from ground-truth ranges. We demonstrate Aeneas’ contribution to historical workflows through analysis of key traits in the renowned Roman inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, showing how integrating science and humanities can create transformative tools to assist historians and advance our understanding of the past.",

Here we used rapid extracellular antigen profiling3 to map the autoantibody reactome within a cohort of 374 patients with cancer treated with CPIs and 131 healthy control participants for autoantibodies to 6,172 extracellular and secreted proteins (the ‘exoproteome’). Globally, patients with cancer treated with CPIs had diverse autoreactivities that were elevated relative to control individuals but changed minimally with treatment. Autoantibody signatures in patients treated with CPI strikingly distinguished them from healthy individuals. Although associations of specific autoantibodies with immune-related adverse events were sparse, we detected numerous individual autoantibodies that were associated with greatly altered odds ratios for response to therapy. These included autoantibodies to immunomodulatory proteins, such as cytokines, growth factors and immunoreceptors, as well as tumour surface proteins. Functional evaluation of several autoantibody responses indicated that they neutralized the activity of their target proteins, which included type I interferons (IFN-I), IL-6, OSM, TL1A, and BMPR1A and BMPR2. Modelling the effects of autoantibodies to IFN-I and TL1A in preclinical mouse tumour models resulted in enhanced CPI efficacy, consistent with their effects in patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that autoantibodies to the exoproteome modify CPI responses and highlight therapeutically actionable pathways that can be exploited to augment immunotherapy.",

We highlight complete sequence continuity of complex loci, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), SMN1 / SMN2 , NBPF8 and AMY1/AMY2 , and fully resolve 1,852 complex structural variants.

We find up to 30-fold variation in α-satellite higher-order repeat array length and characterize the pattern of mobile element insertions into α-satellite higher-order repeat arrays. Although most centromeres predict a single site of kinetochore attachment, epigenetic analysis suggests the presence of two hypomethylated regions for 7% of centromeres. Combining our data with the draft pangenome reference 1 significantly enhances genotyping accuracy from short-read data, enabling whole-genome inference 3 to a median quality value of 45.

Because of the central role of SA in orchestrating plant pathogen defence, understanding SA biosynthesis is fundamental to plant immunity research and crop improvement. Isochorismate-derived SA biosynthesis has been well defined in Arabidopsis. However, increasing evidence suggests a crucial function for phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthesis in many other plant species1. Here we reveal the phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthetic pathway in rice by identifying three dedicated enzymes — peroxisomal benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT), the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytochrome P450 enzyme benzylbenzoate hydroxylase (BBH), and cytosolic benzylsalicylate esterase (BSE) that sequentially convert benzoyl-CoA to benzylbenzoate, benzylsalicylate and SA. The pathogen-induced gene expression pattern and SA biosynthetic functions of this triple-enzyme module are conserved in diverse plants. This work fills a major knowledge gap in the biosynthesis of a key plant defence hormone, establishing a foundation for new strategies to create disease-resistant crops.",

The mosquito fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is required for malaria parasites to infect the midgut epithelium 2 . The naturally occurring FREP1 Q allele has been reported to prevent parasite infection, while supporting essential physiological functions in the mosquito 3 . Here we generate congenic strains of Anopheles stephensi , edited to carry either the parasite-susceptible FREP1 L224 or the putative-refractory FREP1 Q224 alleles. The FREP1 Q224 allele confers robust resistance to infection by both human and rodent malaria parasites, with negligible fitness costs. The protective FREP1 Q224 allele can be efficiently driven into FREP1 L224 mosquito populations using a novel linked allelic-drive system that selectively replaces the L224 codon with the parasite-refractory Q224 allele, thereby rendering populations refractory to parasite infection.

          "abstract": "New methods to revive and preserve donor hearts could increase the number of organs available for transplant.Credit: Lennart Nilsson, TT/Science Photo Library\n\nSurgeons have developed two low-cost techniques to revive the hearts of people who wish to donate their organs after they die. The methods have been tested on only a small number of people, but they avoid ethical issues sometimes associated with current transplantation techniques.\n\nUsing one of the techniques1, surgeons received permission to remove the heart of a child who had been declared dead, restart it and transplant it into another child. The technique, described in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) today, could increase the number of hearts available for organ donation, particularly for children. Roughly 500 children per year in the United States get a new heart, but many will die while waiting for one.\n\nIn the second technique, also reported in the NEJM today2, researchers were able to freeze-preserve adult hearts inside the bodies of their donors, then transplant them successfully. The surgeons involved say this procedure could also be used in children.\n\n“These two techniques represent important new advances” in procuring hearts from some donors because they sidestep the ethical challenges of existing methods, says Robert Montgomery, a transplant surgeon at New York University (NYU) in New York City.\n\nCurrent challenges\n\nMost donated hearts come from people who have been declared brain dead but whose heart is still beating. However, there are not enough such cases to meet the demand for donor hearts.\n\nIn some cases, hearts can be obtained from donors who are declared dead once their heart has stopped beating for five minutes — for example, when a family decides to remove life support for an individual.\n\nFor these hearts to be suitable for transplantation, surgeons must typically either remove the organ from the body and restart it on a machine or get it to beat again while still inside the body. But the former option is expensive and can’t be used for donors weighing less than 40 kilograms, which excludes babies and most children, and the latter is not widely used because of potential ethical issues.\n\nThe main ethical concern raised by physicians is that jump-starting the heart while it is still in the body might require a change to the recorded cause of death, from circulatory death to brain death. Another issue is that the procedure could theoretically restore blood flow to the brain — although clamps are used to block this outcome.\n\nReviving tiny hearts\n\nTo avoid these potential issues, Joseph Turek, a paediatric cardiac surgeon at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues developed a system to revive children’s hearts outside the body1. This involves pumping oxygenated blood into the heart through a tube attached to the aorta. The blood is then drained out of the heart through a vent in the left ventricle, collected in a bag to be re-oxygenated and then pumped back into the heart.\n\nThe team tested the procedure in 12-week-old piglets before the first human trial earlier this year. In that case, surgeons removed the heart of a one-month-old baby who had died, restarted it outside their body then transplanted it into a three-month old baby.\n\nThree months later, the recipient’s heart continued to function normally with no signs of rejection, according to the NEJM report. The procedure could result in 100 more paediatric heart transplants a year in the United States, says Turek. It also offers a cost-effective alternative to out-of-body revival of adult hearts, he adds, because it doesn’t require equipment that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.",

          "abstract": "NASA headquarters in Washington DC. Agency staff from around the United States have added their names to the Voyager Declaration, opposing cuts by the administration of US President Donald Trump.Credit: Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nMore than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration, released on 21 July, also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.\n\n“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA’s workforce,” reads the employees’ letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump’s changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.\n\nOn 22 July, staff members at the US National Science Foundation (NSF) released their own appeal, which asks the US House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology to defend the agency and its employees from political attacks. It was signed by 48 named and 101 anonymous members of the NSF union.\n\nFive key climate and space projects on Trump’s chopping block\n\nThe Voyager Declaration and the NSF petition join similar documents by employees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump’s sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.\n\nThe NASA declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what’s happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA.\n\nKaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.\n\nThe agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, says NASA spokesperson Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what’s working and what’s not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”\n\nThe NSF declined to comment.\n\nStaff exodus\n\nThe Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump’s proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency’s science budget for next year.\n\nCongress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn’t finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration’s signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalized.",

          "authors": "Andrew Robinson",
          "abstract": "Is a River Alive? Robert Macfarlane Hamish Hamilton (2025)\n\nThirst: In Search of Freshwater Wellcome Collection, London 26 June 2025–1 February 2026\n\nThirst: In Search of Freshwater Foreword by Robert Macfarlane. Wellcome Collection (2025)\n\nWhen Robert Macfarlane, a nature writer, was walking with his son to school, the boy asked him the title of his current book project. “Is a River Alive?” Macfarlane replied. “Well, duh, that’s going to be a short book, then, Dad,” said his son, “because the answer is yes!”\n\nHow a vast digital twin of the Yangtze River could prevent flooding in China\n\nAs a boy, Macfarlane felt the same about rivers. But, as an adult, he developed doubts. In the book’s introduction, he describes how hard it was for someone like him, who had been raised on rationalism, to imagine that a river could be alive beyond the life it sustains. “It requires unlearning, a process much harder than learning,” he writes. “We might say that the fate of rivers under rationalism has been to become one-dimensional water. Rivers have been systematically stripped of their spirits and reduced to what Isaac Newton called ‘inanimate brute matter’.”\n\nHis childhood belief returned while he was researching the book. In it, he refers to rivers “who” flow, rather than rivers “that” flow. Macfarlane’s view seems akin to that of the political scientist and anthropologist James Scott: his last book, In Praise of Floods, published in February after his death in his eighties, argues controversially that crucial rivers, such as the Colorado River in the western United States and the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar, should not be damned by being dammed.\n\nIn Scott’s words: “Rivers, on a long view, are alive. They are born; they change; they shift their channels; they forge new routes to the sea; they move both gradually and violently; they teem (usually) with life; they may die a quasi-natural death; they are frequently maimed and even murdered. Each river, though subject to the same hydraulic laws, has its own unique personality and history.”\n\nRivers under threat\n\nMacfarlane ranges, compellingly, further afield than Scott’s relatively academic study — not only geographically, but also intellectually and emotionally. Driven by his concern over human damage to rivers in England, where he lives, he journeys at length alongside and along other rivers, in the company of scientists, environmental activists and diverse adventurers. Sometimes paddling by kayak, even dangerously over rapids, he experiences three, very different, threatened riverine landscapes — in Ecuador, India and Canada.\n\nThe Burning Earth: how conquest and carnage have decimated landscapes worldwide\n\nThe first is a cloud forest in the Andes Mountains: Los Cedros, the ‘Forest of Cedars’, which forms the headwaters of the Rio Los Cedros, which eventually reach the ocean through another river. Los Cedros is threatened by companies eager to pursue copper and gold mining.\n\nThe second includes the rivers, creeks, lagoons and estuaries of the city of Chennai on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. They are deeply polluted by toxic industrial products and exposed to a brutal cycle of droughts and floods caused by monsoons and cyclones.\n\nThe third is Nitassinan, homeland of the Innu people. It is a wild interior through which flows Mutehekau Shipu, the Magpie River, which reaches the sea at the Gulf of St Lawrence, some 1,000 kilometres northeast of Montreal. It is constantly at risk from dam-building.\n\nRivers in time\n\nAs a spin-off from his newly released book, Macfarlane also provides a foreword to a diverse collection of short writings about water. Thirst was commissioned by the Wellcome Collection in London, to accompany its exhibition of the same title.\n\nThe exhibition is divided into sections: Aridity, Rain, Glaciers, Surface Water and Groundwater. Surprisingly, rivers are not given their own space. But they flow through the exhibition, which begins with a Babylonian clay tablet from around 1900—1600 bc, on which the Epic of Gilgamesh is inscribed in cuneiform. It describes the first war waged over water in ancient Mesopotamia, the ‘land between rivers’ — the Tigris and Euphrates. Later comes a section on the Iraqi Marshes, including filmed interviews with their inhabitants. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the swamps were drained to about 10% of their original size by the regime of dictator Saddam Hussein, to evict the people living there — but have since been partially rejuvenated.\n\nVideos feature people across the globe wading speechlessly through their houses after flooding, exploring human experiences of the phenomenon. A satirical cartoon from 1828, entitled ‘Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water’, shows a horrified woman peering through her microscope, studying numerous creatures swimming about in a drop of drinking water from London’s River Thames. Another drawing, made in 1931, shows a cross-section of an artesian tube well drilled beneath the Wellcome Collection building into one of London’s many underground rivers.\n\nKayakers paddle through rapids in the Chehalis River in Canada. Credit: Christopher Kimmel/Getty\n\nOther contributors to the exhibition book, some of whom also feature in the exhibition, include science-minded thinkers — such as environmental activist Vandana Shiva, who founded Navdanya, an Indian non-governmental organization that promotes biodiversity conservation; Native American Robin Wall Kimmerer, a botanist at the State University of New York College in Syracuse; and Anthony Acciavatti, a scholar at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who works at the intersection of landscape and the history of science and technology. Writers and artists, including British-Turkish novelist Elif Shafak, Vietnamese-American poet Ocean Vuong and the Delhi-based Raqs Media Collective, provide vivid snapshots of freshwater and its behaviour. But, oddly, the book contains no photographs or maps of rivers, as crucially displayed in Macfarlane’s book.",

Credit: Getty\n\nMoving to a four-day work week without losing pay leaves employees happier, healthier and higher-performing, according to the largest study of such an intervention so far, encompassing six countries1. The research showed that a six-month trial of working four days a week reduced burnout, increased job satisfaction and improved mental and physical health.\n\nThe study’s authors had wondered whether a condensed working week would add to employees’ stress. “When workers want to deliver the same productivity, they might work very rapidly to get the job done, and their well-being might actually worsen,” says lead author Wen Fan, a sociologist at Boston College in Massachusetts. “But that’s not what we found.” Instead, staff members’ stress levels fell.\n\nThe study was published today in Nature Human Behaviour.\n\nPandemic upheaval\n\nLevels of employee stress and burnout soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading many workers to quit their jobs, the authors note. The result was large numbers of unfilled positions in some labour markets.\n\nTo see whether shorter weeks might be the antidote for poor morale, researchers launched a study of 2,896 individuals at 141 companies in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom.\n\nFed up and burnt out: ‘quiet quitting’ hits academia\n\nBefore making the shift to reduced hours, each company that opted into the overhaul was given roughly eight weeks to restructure its workflow to maintain productivity at 80% of previous workforce hours, purging time-wasting activities such as unnecessary meetings. Two weeks before the trial started, each employee answered a series of questions to evaluate their well-being, including, “Does your work frustrate you?” and “How would you rate your mental health?” After six months on the new schedule, they revisited the same questions.\n\nOverall, workers felt more satisfied with their job performance and reported better mental health after six months of a shortened work week than before it.",

          "abstract": "One morning in 2014, a colleague asked whether I’d seen a new study linking concussion risk to altitude exposure. The work was part of a package of evidence promoting a device to prevent concussion in contact sports. I’m not a concussion researcher, but having trained in sports medicine, I felt that the scientific claims being put forward to justify using this device were implausible.\n\nColleagues agreed with my opinions, but were too busy with their duties to challenge the claims. So, I stepped away from my own research to do so. I collaborated with The New York Times on an investigation, and published papers showing that some of the work cannot be replicated.\n\nMove beyond ‘publish or perish’ by measuring behaviours that benefit academia\n\nSince then, I’ve responded to other issues that I view as being of urgent public interest — ranging from rapidly producing mpox guidance for athletes during a disease outbreak, to promptly writing a detailed analysis countering claims that the collapse, in 2023, of the American-football player Damar Hamlin was related to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nI think it’s crucial that more academics get the chance to take this path, free from a rigid research agenda.\n\nRobust scientific progress requires not only original research, but also rigorous validation of findings, their adoption across disciplines and effective communication. Yet the dominant model of academic science is to secure grant funding, generate results and then get more funding. With promotions and career progression depending on this cycle, it can be hard to justify spending time on extracurricular projects. Instead of expecting agenda-focused laboratory heads to take on these tasks as side projects, as is often the case, universities should employ people who have complete scholarly autonomy to specialize in them.\n\nI’m fortunate that my department has an educational track that supports scholarship outside of conventional research agendas. My position provides dedicated time for scholarly work and the flexibility to pursue interdisciplinary questions as and when needed. Grants are treated as a tool to support projects when required, rather than as the hallmark of success. I can choose which issues to pursue — or stop pursuing — at will. Peer-reviewed publications are central, but the scholarly value of rigorous work disseminated through public communication and research-integrity efforts is also recognized.\n\nWill AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?\n\nI suspect that few other researchers have the same latitude. Yet research institutions would benefit from employing agenda-free scholars. These people are well placed to connect and integrate findings across disciplines, populations and methodologies, revealing connections, contradictions and redundancies between fields and thereby increasing research efficiency — work that is often undervalued in decisions about tenure and promotion. Some might think that principal investigators, as experts in their fields, are better placed to synthesize and contextualize research. But expecting one person to manage many responsibilities risks diluting their effectiveness in each.",

They also have similar personality traits, which suggests that a positive outlook leads to a shared way of interpreting experiences.\n\nYanagisawa and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity in 87 participants while they imagined future events that were categorized as positive, neutral or negative.

          "abstract": "The Scottish Cafe, now in Lviv, Ukraine, housed mathematical discussions in the 1930s.Credit: Сергій via Wikimedia (CC BY 3.0)\n\nOn a Monday afternoon in April, the Szkocka Restaurant and Bar in Lviv, Ukraine, seems empty, except for two waiters, a maintenance worker on a ladder and the ghost of Frank Sinatra, whose song asks us to hold him in our arms. He’s not the only ghost in the place, though.\n\nI’m in Ukraine, researching the history of Stanisław Ulam, a mathematician, physicist and computer scientist who was born in Lviv, then in Poland, in 1909. Ulam went on to work on the US Manhattan Project, designing nuclear weapons. He also developed the Monte Carlo method for solving computational problems and established many proofs in pure and applied mathematics.\n\nBut it was in this restaurant — known in the 1930s as the Scottish Cafe — that Ulam, along with other prominent mathematical figures such as Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, sat for hours, bandying about ideas. Together, the group contributed to many areas of mathematics, including set theory, probability, functional analysis, group theory and topology.\n\nWhy probability probably doesn’t exist (but it is useful to act like it does)\n\nThey would write their calculations in pencil on the marble tabletops. But Banach’s wife, Łucja Braus, dismayed that the work was getting wiped away by waiters, bought them a present: a lined notebook that would eventually be filled with mathematical challenges.\n\nAny cafe patron could propose a solution to a problem for the chance to win a prize —often something small, such as a cup of coffee or a bottle of wine, or sometimes something more opulent or strange, such as, famously, a live goose.\n\nThese oddities helped to spread the book’s fame. And the collection of 200 or so problems became known as The Scottish Book, a version of which can still be purchased today.\n\nIn its pages are workings that led Ulam to later co-author a paper elaborating on the ‘hairy ball theorem’, which shows that, on any sphere in n dimensions, if there is a hair-like substance or current on it that is ‘combed’ in one direction, there will always be a place where the directional combing cannot continue — a cowlick, in other words. Far from being a barbering quirk, the theorem has had applications in fields such as meteorology and fusion energy. The seeds of Banach’s general theory of functional analysis are also in the Scottish Book.\n\nLegendary atmosphere\n\nThus, in the 1930s, the Scottish Cafe became “the centre of [Lviv’s] — and for a while the world’s — mathematical universe”, as writer Chris Zielinski described in Histories of Computing in Eastern Europe (2019). Since then, universities, cities and companies have been trying, with varying success, to replicate this environment of a loose, productive exchange of ideas.\n\nThe spy who flunked it: Kurt Gödel’s forgotten part in the atom-bomb story\n\nWhen I returned to the cafe the next day, Iryna Banakh (no relation), a mathematician at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, a few blocks away, told me a little bit about what went right.\n\nBanach, who mentored Ulam and was the social centre of the group, “liked to work when it was very noisy”, she said, sitting at a table in the Szkocka. There was “a lot of music, a lot of conversations, and sometimes they played chess at the different tables”.\n\nHe “would spend most of his days in cafés, not only in the company of others but also by himself”, said the mathematician Andrzej Turowicz in Roman Kaluza’s book Through a Reporter’s Eyes (1996). “He liked the noise and the music. They did not prevent him from concentrating and thinking. There were cases when, after the cafés closed for the night, he would walk over to the railway station where the cafeteria was open around the clock. There, over a glass of beer, he would think about his problems.”\n\nThe Polish mathematician Stanisław Ulam, who frequented the Scottish Cafe.Credit: American Philosophical Society/Science Photo Library\n\nIf this emphasis on controlled chaos, social interaction and free-wheeling exploration sounds familiar, it’s because it is the basis for everything from child-led learning at Montessori schools to some courses at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, in which unconventional lecture-delivery models have been implemented.\n\nBut this is not necessarily a recipe for success in everyone’s hands. Although Ulam had wonderful things to say about environments full of genial geniuses in his autobiography, Adventures of a Mathematician (1976), he was scathing about the 1930s mathematical community at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He found it full of overdone formality, bloated egos and people performing the act of work, rather than working productively and informally. However, he did find a better environment at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he taught in the 1940s.\n\nThere are some steps to nudge an academic community towards this type of collaboration.\n\nIngredients for innovation\n\nRichard Florida’s 2002 urban-construction manual, Rise of the Creative Class, says that well-built communities — such as the walkable square around the Scottish Cafe — are more likely to provide people with places to exchange ideas than are automotive exurbs that encourage isolation. After traversing eight lanes of suburban traffic to reach a cafe, you’re unlikely to want to discuss Fourier transforms for five hours over coffees or beers.\n\nUniversities are beginning to see the importance of good infrastructure and quality of life for attracting students and faculty members. US college towns are increasingly working to replicate the pedestrian-accessible cafe environments found in Lviv and other European cities, such as Vienna and Prague. And some large institutions in small US cities, such as the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and the University of Maryland, College Park, have been encouraging the construction of tram and light-rail systems, viewing them as providing a competitive advantage.\n\nEven in modern-day Lviv, which is already vibrant, there have been moves — in the middle of war, no less — to enhance that vibrancy with even better urban-rail infrastructure.\n\nBorn secret — the heavy burden of bomb physics\n\nHowever, cities need to be positive, liveable places for everyone, not just those who can afford the latest Macbook. Indeed, the academics I talked with in Lviv made the point that the Scottish Cafe is now too expensive for late-night maths chats. Those have moved to a cheap pizza place elsewhere in the city, among other places, with Szkocka filling a more ceremonial niche for formal dinners in recent years.\n\nIn the 1930s, Banach chose the Scottish Cafe partly because it was cheap and would give him a lenient tab, unlike the cafe across the street, from which he fled when his debts grew too great. He was known to often linger over a single cup of coffee for hours at a time, spending barely any money.",

This type of catastrophic rupture, which also occurs in certain types of infection-associated cell death, is triggered1 by a membrane protein called NINJ1.

Study participants who became infected with the virus lost mental flexibility.Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nThe brains of healthy people aged faster during the COVID-19 pandemic than did the brains of people analysed before the pandemic began, a study of almost 1,000 people suggests1. The accelerated ageing occurred even in people who didn’t become infected.\n\nThe accelerated ageing, recorded as structural changes seen in brain scans, was most noticeable in older people, male participants and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. But cognitive tests revealed that mental agility declined only in participants who picked up a case of COVID-19, suggesting that faster brain ageing doesn’t necessarily translate into impaired thinking and memory.\n\nThe study “really underlines how significant the pandemic environment was for mental and neurological health”, says Mahdi Moqri, a computational biologist who studies ageing at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. It’s unclear whether the pandemic-associated brain ageing is reversible, because the study analysed scans taken at only two time points, adds Moqri.\n\nThe findings were published today in Nature Communications.\n\nPandemic effect\n\nPrevious research has offered clues that SARS-CoV-2 infections can worsen neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in older people. But few studies have explored whether the pandemic period — a tumultuous time marked by social isolation, lifestyle disruptions and stress for many — also affected brain ageing, says study co-author Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad, a neuroimaging researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nCOVID’s toll on the brain: new clues emerge\n\nTo find out, Mohammadi-Nejad and his colleagues analysed brain scans collected from 15,334 healthy adults with an average age of 63 years in the UK Biobank (UKBB) study, a long-term biomedical monitoring scheme. They trained machine-learning models on hundreds of structural features of the participants’ brains, which taught the model how the brain looks at various ages. The team could then use these models to predict the age of a person’s brain. The difference between that value and a participant’s chronological age is the ‘brain age gap’.\n\nThe team then applied the brain-age models to a separate group of 996 healthy UKBB participants who had all had two brain scans at least a couple of years apart. Some of the participants had had one scan before the pandemic and another after the pandemic’s onset. Those who’d had both scans before the pandemic were designated the control group. The models estimated each participant’s brain age at the time of both scans.\n\nNearly six months more\n\nThe models predicted that the brains of people who had lived through the pandemic had aged 5.5 months faster on average than had those of people in the control group, irrespective of whether those scanned during the pandemic had ever contracted COVID-19. “Brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment,” says Mohammadi-Nejad.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "Securing a tenured position is linked with a decline in paper output in some academic fields.Credit: Keith Birmingham/MediaNews Group/Pasadena Star-News/Getty\n\nAcademics’ research-publication patterns shift fundamentally after they attain tenure, a coveted status that provides job security in the United States, according to an analysis1 of more than 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines.\n\nFaculty members in all disciplines tend to publish the most in the year before they’re granted tenure, the analysis found. After achieving it, their output varies by field: it plateaus for biologists and others who tend to work in the laboratory, and dips for those in fields such as mathematics that generally do not require lab research. The analysis was published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Tenure is perhaps the most crucial decision in science,” says co-author Dashun Wang, a computational social scientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He adds that the results show that the research that faculty members take on after receiving tenure is riskier that what they do before tenure, but their post-tenure output yields fewer highly cited papers.\n\nThe ultimate academic prize\n\nTenure is prized among scholars for its promise of job security and research freedom in academia. After attaining tenure, a scientist’s position can be terminated only under extreme circumstances. Most academics serve a fixed probationary period — the ‘tenure track’ — followed by a pivotal decision that either locks in the job or dashes hopes of secure employment.\n\nWang’s team predicted that there might be an uptick in scholarly output in the year before the decision, owing to the immense pressure that researchers face to publish many papers and to publish in prestigious journals.\n\nIs it time for tenure to evolve?\n\nTo find out, the authors analysed seven data sources, including an annual compilation of US universities’ employment records for both tenured and tenure-track faculty members, which allowed them to track job titles from year to year. Whenever a researcher’s title changed from ‘assistant professor’ to ‘associate professor’, a common indicator that they had attained tenure, Wang’s team designated that event as occurring within one year after tenure.\n\nFrom there, the authors used data from several databases to link the researchers’ names with their publication record. This allowed the team to determine faculty members’ publication rates during the five years before and five years after they were granted tenure.\n\nAveraged across all disciplines, in the fifth year before receiving tenure, researchers published 2 papers, compared with nearly 3.5 in the year before tenure and in the years after tenure.\n\nJessica Calarco, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, says this analysis shows why so many researchers “feel completely burnt out by the time they get to tenure”. A focus on metrics, such as number of publications or citation count, doesn’t emphasize quality, innovation or longer projects, she adds. “There’s a great deal of pressure on junior academics to do as much research as possible, to prove you deserve to keep that job.”\n\nBig groups pull ahead",

          "abstract": "Adriana Bankston at Capitol Hill in Washington DC.Credit: Adriana Bankston\n\nIn September 2024, two months before the US presidential election returned Donald Trump to power for a second term, I secured a congressional fellowship to work for Bill Foster, a former physicist who was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat for an Illinois district.\n\nThe year-long science and technology policy fellowship, based at the US Congress in Washington DC, allows scientists and engineers to learn about and contribute to national policymaking. It is sponsored by the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy as part of the Science and Technology Policy Fellowships programme of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nOn a typical day, I work on science and research policy, and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education, among other topics. This includes defending scientific research and the STEM pipeline — through letters, speeches and legislation — attending meetings with Foster’s constituents, collaborating with other congressional offices that share these interests, and contributing to the advancement of US science at a national level.\n\nAction on salaries\n\nMy path into research policy dates back almost a decade, beginning in 2016, when, after a postdoctoral position at the University of Louisville in Kentucky, I joined the non-profit organization Future of Research, based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.\n\nOur research into postdoc salaries revealed that many fell below US$45,000 a year, although a federal labour law mandated a minimum of $47,476. Postdoctoral salaries increased as a result of our work.\n\nMore roles in science advocacy followed, including as a fellow with the Society for Neuroscience, and principal legislative analyst with the University of California’s Office of Federal Governmental Relations, both in Washington DC.\n\nBoth roles involved lobbying Congress to increase federal funding for scientific research. I then moved on to helping universities and scientific organizations engage with Congress on science issues, and enabling graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to discuss their work with members of Congress.\n\nFavourite projects\n\nIn my current role, four favourite projects spring to mind. The first was reintroducing a resolution to designate 14 March as National Pi Day, which is an opportunity to highlight and recognize the need for investments in mathematics and science education, and getting students interested in STEM subjects.\n\nThe second was the Keep STEM Talent Act, which would enable international STEM students to contribute to the workforce and our economy by giving them permanent-resident status.\n\nThe third was drafting a speech by Foster from the floor of the House of Representatives, expressing concern with the Trump administration’s cut to the Graduate Research Fellowship Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). The reduction in funding is preventing outstanding graduate students from pursuing research-based master’s or doctoral degrees in STEM fields.\n\nAnd finally, I enjoyed writing research talking points for the National Lab Research SLAM, which showcases the contributions to the innovation ecosystem of early-career scientists at the national laboratories — defined as any government-operated or sponsored laboratory.\n\nThis year is the 75th anniversary of the NSF. As part of Foster’s team, I contributed to multiple projects defending science funding and federal agencies, and Foster gave a speech from the floor during a Special Order Hour — time set aside for speeches or debates that are not part of the ordinary legislative agenda — which was focused on standing up for science. The speech highlighted how Trump’s proposed budget cuts at the NSF and other science agencies are impairing US competitiveness and the development of the STEM workforce. Along with other members of Congress, Foster introduced a resolution commemorating the NSF’s science and engineering accomplishments over the past 75 years. Our team also initiated and helped to coordinate letters from Congress to the Trump administration expressing concern over the firing of 168 NSF workers, and over the administration’s directive to freeze all NSF grant funding.\n\nGratification and heartbreak\n\nThis has been the most gratifying year of my career so far.\n\nAlthough I sometimes am heartbroken by what is happening to scientific research in this country, I increasingly find myself encouraged by the resilience of this community to continue fighting for what matters. Being part of this cause is extremely rewarding.\n\nI have heard from scientists, including early-career trainees, about the impacts of cuts to federal science funding. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who are just starting out describe feeling uncertain. And those halfway through or close to finishing their degrees are struggling to find the funds to continue their work, and have shared their worries about academic job prospects.\n\nI encourage US scientists to continue talking to Congress, especially to members who care about these issues and have the power to change things. If a scientist is also a constituent of that member of Congress, the connection can go a long way, because members are supposed to listen and work to address the issues. And by participating in national rallies or local demonstrations, researchers can make the case for the importance of science for their communities and the country’s future.",

          "title": "There’s a new acid in our rain — should we be worried?",
          "authors": "XiaoZhi Lim",
          "abstract": "Whenever rain or snow falls from the skies, a human-made chemical called trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) falls with it. Across the world, this chemical has shown up in lakes and rivers; bottled water and beer; cereal crops and animal livers; and even in human blood and urine1. And wherever researchers measure changes in TFA levels, they find that concentrations are rising.\n\nOver the past four decades, TFA levels have risen five- to ten-fold in the leaves and needles of tree species in Germany2,3. Researchers have also documented rising levels of TFA in Canadian Arctic ice cores4 and in groundwater in Denmark5.\n\nTFA accumulates partly because natural processes can’t break its strong carbon–fluorine bonds. By some definitions, TFA is the smallest example of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), which persist for so long that scientists have termed them forever chemicals (see ‘TFA: a controversial molecule’ and ‘Rising levels of TFA’).\n\nSome PFASs are already linked to higher risks of health harms and are banned internationally. Many countries are restricting the levels of certain PFASs in drinking water and embarking on costly clean-up operations.\n\nBut the health impacts of TFA are less clear. The few animal studies that exist suggest that current levels are thousands of times lower than those shown to exert biological effects. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which has been assessing the risks of TFA since 1998, says it considers the chemical to pose minimal risk for now, and at least until 2100 — although UN member states last year asked it to re-evaluate its assessment.\n\nSource: Refs 2,3,5\n\nHowever, some countries have already begun clamping down on TFA. And in June 2024, two German federal agencies petitioned the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to label TFA as a reproductive toxin and a very persistent and very mobile substance. The ECHA has opened this petition for public comment, which closes on 25 July.\n\nIn October 2024, worried European environmental scientists declared that rising levels of TFA could cause irreversible harm, calling the chemical a threat to ‘planetary boundaries’1. They support a widespread ban on all PFASs that the ECHA is considering — which covers TFA.\n\nBut other scientists say that TFA shouldn’t be counted in the definition of PFASs, partly because it doesn’t build up in humans and animals as other PFASs do. The US Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, doesn’t currently consider TFA to be a PFAS.\n\nThe stakes are high, because regulating TFA could have a far-reaching impact on powerful industries, such as the refrigeration, agrochemical and pharmaceutical sectors.\n\nHere, Nature explains the fight that’s brewing over this small but controversial molecule.\n\nSimple molecule, complex origins\n\nTFA enters the environment in many ways. It’s used in academic research, for example, to prepare peptides for biology studies, says Reza Ghadiri, a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. More widely, however, the agrochemical, pharmaceutical and fine-chemicals industries use TFA as an ingredient to make larger fluorine-containing molecules, and it can escape from industrial facilities.\n\nIn Germany, for instance, interest in TFA was sparked in 2016 after researchers at the German Water Centre (TZW) in Karlsruhe found high levels of the chemical in a river and traced it to a chemical plant.\n\nIndustrial discharges are just one source of TFA pollution6. Other chemicals can also break apart to create TFA as they languish in the environment. These precursor chemicals include pesticides, PFASs leaching from discarded or landfilled consumer products and excreted medications that pass through sewage plants (see ‘TFA’s precursors’). This all adds TFA to terrestrial water, but not to rain; when water evaporates, TFA — like a salt — is left behind.\n\nThe TFA in rain comes from different sources — mainly some fluorinated gases (F-gases), including those used as refrigerants and in building insulation. These gases leak from air-conditioner units and insulation foam, mostly when products are in use or being discarded.\n\nScientific interest in TFA began after the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, when the world agreed to restrict gases including the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used as refrigerants and aerosols, because they damaged Earth’s protective ozone layer.\n\nIndustry users launched a massive effort called the Alternative Fluorocarbon Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS) to assess the environmental impact of the F-gases that had been proposed as substitutes7. A few of those — including the widely used HFC-134a — were soon found to break up into TFA in the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nConcerned that the F-gas substitution would introduce a foreign substance to the planet, researchers began studying TFA intensively. Unexpectedly, they discovered that TFA already existed in rain, springs and rivers at appreciable levels, suggesting that there were other sources. Indeed, later analysis of ice cores from the Arctic shows that TFA was deposited with snow there as long ago as 19694.\n\nThe missing TFA\n\nThat kicked off a search in the 1990s for other TFA precursors. Surprisingly, these included anaesthetic gases that have been used since the 1950s, and that are exhaled or vented into the atmosphere.\n\nA twist in the tale emerged in 2002, when AFEAS-funded researchers measured substantial TFA in the Atlantic and Southern oceans8. In 2005, an international team of researchers found similar TFA levels in 22 spots in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. They extrapolated that the oceans held huge quantities of TFA — some 60 million to200 million tonnes9.\n\nThat was far too much TFA to explain with known human-made sources. So, the authors of both studies suggested that TFA might be a naturally occurring salt in the oceans.\n\nSome industrial firms use this theory to argue that any anthropogenic TFA would wash away into oceans and increase the large amounts of natural TFA there by unnoticeable fractions. Panels of scientists convened by UNEP have leant on this argument repeatedly when concluding that TFA poses minimal risks at current environmental levels.\n\nBut many scientists disagree that unexplained large amounts of TFA in the oceans must mean that it’s natural10. Measurements from a few locations should not be extrapolated to entire oceans, says Cora Young, an environmental chemist at York University in Toronto, Canada, whose team has documented TFA’s rising levels in Arctic ice cores (see ‘TFA in ice cores’)4.\n\nSource: Adapted from Ref. 4\n\nAnd no one has reported a plausible mechanism for TFA to form naturally, says Scott Mabury, an environmental chemist at the University of Toronto, who has identified precursors of TFA.\n\nDavid O’Hagan, a fluorine chemist at the University of St Andrews, UK, who studies naturally occurring fluorinated compounds, says that he remains “truly unsure” about whether TFA could occur naturally. A few microorganisms do make fluorinated molecules, but because these have only one fluorine atom — not three — O’Hagan doesn’t think microbial processes would create TFA. Scientists have yet to identify possible geological mechanisms, he adds.\n\nNew data support the decades-old findings that the oceans could harbour large amounts of TFA. Last year11, the German environmental agency published measurements of TFA levels from 31 locations in the Atlantic Ocean that are higher than those reported in 2005 (it is too soon to tell whether ocean TFA is rising, however).\n\nBut in the end, it doesn’t matter whether natural TFA exists in the oceans, says Finnian Freeling, an analytical chemist at TZW who performed both the Atlantic Ocean and German-tree studies. What’s important is the drastic rise in TFA levels on land. “These steep increases, they have to come from anthropogenic activities,” he says.\n\nEven if some TFA turns out to be naturally occurring, that doesn’t make it safe and doesn’t make it OK to add more, says Mark Hanson, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who serves on the current UNEP panel.\n\nResearchers, including Shira Joudan, an environmental chemist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, suggest that TFA emissions from sources other than F-gases have been underestimated.\n\nThese researchers are investigating how much and how quickly precursors such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals break down into TFA. “If we’re going to make any decisions on limiting emissions, we need to know where it’s coming from,” Joudan says.\n\nIs TFA harmful?\n\nIn the 1990s, AFEAS researchers concluded that TFA is not acutely toxic, by referring to earlier studies that had fed or injected TFA into mice and rats7. Huge quantities were needed to kill the animals, and by that metric, TFA was found to be “about as toxic as table salt”, says Thomas Cahill, an environmental toxicologist at Arizona State University in Tempe.\n\nTFA’s molecular structure differs from that of the well-established PFAS pollutants. The typical structure of the molecules linked to health harms has a hydrophilic head and a long hydrophobic tail swaddled in fluorine atoms. TFA has a mere stub of a tail, with just one fluorine-bearing carbon atom.\n\nFor this reason, some scientists think that TFA shouldn’t even count as a PFAS. Because it is so small, TFA is highly water-soluble, allowing mammalian bodies to excrete it easily. In 1976, to check whether TFA is a harmful metabolite of the anaesthetic halothane, researchers injected two volunteers with TFA, and recovered all of it in urine within three days7. Many scientists think that TFA does not build up in organs and tissues, but instead behaves like a salt. “I view it like chloride,” says Mabury.\n\nCould the world go PFAS-free? Proposal to ban ‘forever chemicals’ fuels debate\n\nHowever, TFA levels could still rise in humans because the molecule is constantly consumed through food and water, and levels in those sources are rising, says Freeling. After measuring TFA in human urine samples, he thinks that dietary exposure is higher than many scientists assume. Cahill, who has found TFA in dozens of foodstuffs, agrees.\n\nAnd evidence is mounting that TFA can exert biological effects. In March, Ghadiri’s team reported, in a preprint, the accidental discovery that TFA is a bioactive component that lowers lipid and cholesterol levels in mice12. In a 1999 study, researchers observed that, as a laboratory contaminant, TFA inhibited the proliferation of certain bone cells in Petri dishes13. Ghadiri emphasizes that there is no human data on TFA; his takeaway is simply that it should not be treated as innocuous.\n\nMost significant are the animal data that German agencies are now relying on to convince the ECHA to label TFA as a reproductive toxin.\n\nIn 2017, the ECHA told some firms that were registering TFA as a ‘high production volume’ chemical (to comply with updated European chemicals legislation) to provide more data on safety risks. That included data on reproductive toxicity, which the AFEAS hadn’t assessed. Industry groups commissioned safety studies from a contract lab that fed TFA to rats and rabbits and assessed their offspring; animals given more of the chemical had fetuses with lower weights and more deformities, particularly in the eyes, compared with those on lower doses. (The studies are not published, but the data were made public with the German petition.)\n\nHowever, those animals were given TFA at levels that are hundreds of thousands of times higher than researchers have measured in drinking water.\n\nAlthough these outcomes might not be seen in humans, the studies show that high levels of TFA could harm human health, says Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. DeWitt is planning to start 30-day studies that expose mice to TFA through their skin, looking for effects on the immune system.\n\nSome researchers are more worried about the effects of TFA on plants and ecosystems. Plants take up TFA along with water through their roots, but the TFA doesn’t leave the plant together with transpired water vapour. “It can’t evaporate,” Cahill says. “It’s stuck.”\n\nHow to get rid of toxic ‘forever chemical’ pollution\n\nAFEAS researchers attempted to address these concerns in the 1990s by growing crops, including sunflower, wheat, maize (corn), rice and soya beans, in TFA-contaminated soil and water7. Apart from inhibiting growth at high levels (above 1 milligram per litre), the researchers largely found nothing.",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "China has rapidly increased its interest in Antarctica over the past decade, opening its fifth Antarctic station last year. Scientists hope this will help to ensure that research of global significance continues on the continent, despite the US government’s proposal to slash spending on polar science.\n\nChina’s latest station, Qinling, kicked off its first winter mission in March. Situated on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay, Qinling is China’s first station in southern Antarctica, not far from stations run by Italy and South Korea. In time, the station will run studies on marine and terrestrial ecology, sea ice, geophysics, wildlife and other topics, says Shen Jun, a director at the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration in Beijing.\n\nQinling is “well-placed for research into a huge range of contemporary challenges in Antarctic research”, says Christina Hulbe, a geophysicist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\nOne of them is determining how cold, dense waters form on the continental shelf, Hulbe says. These waters are the precursor to Antarctic bottom water, which has a pivotal role in regulating the ocean’s ability to store heat and capture carbon. The region is also important for studying marine biodiversity, including krill, penguins and whales.\n\nChina does not reveal how much it spends on Antarctic research each year, but researchers say that there has been growing government funding for overall research and development over the past decade. Since 2018, China has also built two new icebreakers, Xue Long 2 and Ji Di, and is planning a new summer station in southwest Antarctica, which is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nUS pulls away\n\nAs China’s interest in the region increases, US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting all funding for polar research from $86 million to $25 million, and Antarctic-specific infrastructure renewal from $60 million to $24 million in 2026. US scientists fear that they might not be able to continue some of their research and fieldwork in Antarctica. There are also concerns that the US polar databases will not be maintained or updated. The United States is seen by many as the global leader in Antarctic research.\n\nDeniz Bozkurt, a climatologist at the University of Valparaíso in Chile, expects “some shift in the scientific leadership” for Antarctica and climate-change studies owing to the question marks surrounding US commitment.\n\nKim Yeadong, the chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research, based in Incheon, South Korea, says that Antarctic study benefits all of humanity. “If the US walks away, somebody should continue on this very important endeavour,” he adds. Kim says that he will be “very happy” if China increases its activity, regardless of what the United States does.\n\nThe need for data\n\nBozkurt thinks that the biggest risk from the US government cuts is the potential loss of continuous data, such as those hosted by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which are crucial for understanding climate trends and extreme weather.\n\nQinling’s global significance will depend partially on how China shares its data. “Sharing data, sharing findings, sharing issues of critical ecosystems, this is absolutely vital,” says Daniel Kammen, an energy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He hopes that the station’s data will be shared with scientists in real time to help them to understand and respond to changes.",

          "abstract": "A cup of distilled water can sometimes be heated in a microwave for a long time without boiling, only to erupt explosively when the water is disturbed. This is an example of a phenomenon called superheating: the water is heated beyond its boiling point but remains a liquid until an input of energy causes it to rapidly change state. Superheating is also exhibited by crystals that are heated above their melting temperature but remain in a solid state. Writing in Nature, White et al.1 explore the limits of superheating in solid gold. The team used lasers to rapidly heat gold films and showed that the metal can reach more than 14 times its melting point without changing state.

          "abstract": "Study finds that some women carry genetic variants that are associated with having children of a particular sex.Credit: Jennie Hart/Alamy\n\nIn families with several children of the same sex, the odds of having another baby of that sex are higher than of having one of the opposite sex, according to a large study1 that investigated the maternal and genetic factors that influence the sex of offspring.\n\nThe results, published in Science Advances today, find that in families with three boys, there is a 61% chance that the next sibling is male. For families with three girls, there was a 58% chance that the next child would be female.\n\nThe findings challenge what people have been told about their baby’s sex, which is that for each pregnancy, there is an equal chance of having either a boy or a girl, says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “Based on these findings, you have to tell couples that their chance of having a different-sex child from what they already have is actually less than 50:50,” he says.\n\nAge influences sex\n\nResearchers at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, looked at the sex of children born to 58,007 female nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015, and the different factors that might explain why some had only boys and others only girls.\n\nThey found that in two-child families, having one child of each sex was more common than two boys or two girls, but in families with three or more children, siblings of the same sex were more common than a mix of both. In their analysis, the researchers excluded the last birth of each woman to reduce the influence of parental choice — for instance, some people choose to stop having children once they have both boys and girls.\n\nThe team also found that women aged 29 or older when they had their first child had a 13% higher chance of giving birth to only male or only female children than did women younger than 23.\n\nThe authors note that changes in vaginal pH as women age could explain this phenomenon. For instance, the changes could influence the sex of the child by affecting whether sperm carrying the X chromosome or the Y chromosome are more successful at fertilizing the egg, says Polyakov.\n\nGenetic influence\n\nA genomic analysis also showed that some women had one of two common genetic variants that were associated with having children of a particular sex. A change in chromosome 10, in a gene called NSUN6, was associated with a higher probability of having only girls, whereas women with a change in a single DNA letter on chromosome 18, near a gene called TSHZ1, were more likely to have only boys.",

Researchers in LMICs often have limited funds, lack trained technicians and have difficulties in recruiting participants.\n\nWhat’s so special about the human brain? A graphical guide\n\nTo address some of these problems, researchers trained non-specialists in each country — 12 people in Tanzania, 12 in India — to record the brain’s electrical activity using portable headsets fitted with 16 electrodes that are placed on the scalp, a technique known as electroencephalography (EEG). Over 30 weeks, the trainees collected data from a wide range of people in their countries with different lifestyles and socio-economic backgrounds, ranging from urban office workers to members of Tanzania’s Hadzabe hunter-gatherer group. Participants also responded to surveys about factors including their medical history, mental health, sleep, diet, lifestyle and use of technology. The study describes recordings from 3,413 people in India and 2,418 people in Tanzania.\n\nEEG recordings “offer the opportunity to look very easily across diverse populations, because it’s a technique that’s portable, it’s cost efficient, it doesn’t take a huge amount of time”, says co-author Tara Thiagarajan, founder and chief scientist at Sapien Labs, a non-profit neuroscience centre based in Arlington, Virginia.

          "abstract": "Gold is usually solid up to 1,064 °C, but thin slivers can be briefly heated to many times that without melting.Credit: Alexis Huguet/AFP/Getty\n\nScientists say that they have heated solid gold for a fleeting moment to a temperature 14 times its melting point before it melts — narrowly skirting the laws of thermodynamics1.\n\nPhysicists have thought for decades that it’s impossible to heat gold and other solid materials to more than about three times their melting point without melting them. If the materials were to exceed that threshold while remaining solid, the result would be an ‘entropy catastrophe’, a theoretical situation in which the solid phase of a material would have more entropy, or disorder, than the liquid phase. This would be a violation of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nBut in a paper published today in Nature, scientists describe using a laser to rapidly heat gold to 14 times its melting point — well above the theoretical limit — for a few trillionths of a second before it melts and explodes. The gold atoms reach that temperature before they have time to expand and become disordered, so the result does not violate any laws of thermodynamics, says Tom White, a physicist at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a co-author of the study.\n\nTaking the temperature\n\nIf they are heated very carefully, extremely pure samples of some solid materials can be ‘superheated’, attaining temperatures beyond their melting points without melting. Silver, for example, normally melts at 961.8 ºC, but under the right conditions it can be heated to 986 ºC and remain solid. Understanding superheating is relevant for subjects such as the study of molten planetary interiors.\n\nA solid more fluid than a fluid\n\nIn 1988, physicists calculated a theoretical limit for superheating, the upshot of which is that no material can be heated to more than about three times its melting point and remain solid2. Beyond that limit, the solid would have higher disorder than the liquid. (To understand why this would be a problem, imagine the smooth, solid ice of a skating rink melting into a pool of liquid water that is somehow even more placid.) Attempts to observe superheated solids have been hindered by the difficulty of measuring temperatures in time intervals shorter than a nanosecond.\n\nThe team managed it by heating a 50-nanometre-thick gold sample with a laser until the gold ions were jiggling with kinetic energy. The researchers then shot X-ray photons at the gold sample and measured the shift in their energy as they bounced off the material, to infer the temperature of the gold to within a few thousand degrees Celsius.\n\nUsing this measurement method, the team observed that the laser could superheat gold, which has a melting point of 1,337 kelvin (1,064 ºC), to about 19,000 kelvin for a few trillionths of a second.\n\nUnreliable narrators",

          "authors": "Oliver P. Hauser, Miriam Light, Lizzie Shelmerdine, Jack Blumenau",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to be a transformative force in science, society and the economy. However, much remains unknown about the broader implications of widespread AI use.\n\nFor instance, AI technologies can enhance as well as impede the performance of knowledge workers. They can boost productivity for routine tasks, such as idea generation and writing, but might introduce bottlenecks and errors in more-complex tasks when AI advice is adopted blindly1. Chatbots can aid individual people’s creativity, yet overreliance on them might reduce the overall diversity of original ideas2.\n\nAI could pose pandemic-scale biosecurity risks. Here’s how to make it safer\n\nUnderstanding how users engage with the technology — and the outcomes that follow — requires careful, systematic study to differentiate between the positive and negative impacts. For instance, in education, it’s crucial to test whether students use AI tools to deepen their understanding of a topic, or whether they simply use the technology as a crutch, hindering real learning.\n\nControlled studies can reveal areas to which AI truly adds value and when its risks outweigh the benefits. Randomized controlled trials — in which a randomly selected group of participants receives an intervention while a control group operates under business-as-usual conditions — might be particularly valuable for assessing AI’s impact in public-sector settings. For example, can a chatbot deliver factual and actionable advice to citizens seeking tax-related information, ultimately promoting accurate and timely tax filing? Will partially automating eligibility assessments for social benefits lead to fair, efficient outcomes at reduced cost? Understanding when, how and for whom AI works is crucial to ensuring positive results and a meaningful return on investment.\n\nHere, we introduce an AI impact-evaluation framework3 developed for the UK public sector, providing a potential blueprint for public organizations as well as the private sector.\n\nThe need to test\n\nWhat do we mean by evaluating AI? Evaluation refers to assessing an intervention’s design, implementation and impact4 — in other words, understanding how and to what extent it changes the outcome of interest.\n\nAI companies currently undertake model evaluations — testing the performance of large language models (LLMs) against benchmarks to assess their capabilities in areas such as language, mathematics, reasoning and problem-solving. Furthermore, over the past 18 months, leading AI-security institutes in the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan have advocated for testing frontier AI models to ensure they are safe to use before public release. However, although model evaluation and safety protocols are necessary, they are not sufficient.\n\nThis is because evaluating a model’s technical performance is not the same as assessing its real-world economic and societal impacts. For instance, many organizations now use customized LLMs as internal chatbots to help employees to access organization-wide materials or summarize large volumes of information — from meeting notes and market research to sector-wide consultations. Others are using AI tools to create slide decks, reports and business plans.\n\nMedical AI can transform medicine — but only if we carefully track the data it touches\n\nConventional AI-model evaluation will ensure that the outputs are reasonably accurate and safe. But such assessments do not tell us whether these tools to improve users’ decision-making, increase their efficiency or redirect their time towards more-useful activities. Or, in the public sector, whether they lead to improved services and better outcomes for citizens.\n\nAlthough some organizations conduct small pilot studies and collect user feedback, such tests rarely have the quality, scale and independence required. Our guidance recommends incorporating evaluation into the design of the AI tool itself.\n\nBecause most AI tools are hosted online, it’s relatively easy to test new features by comparing how various user groups respond5. For example, a government website might randomly show some users a new LLM-powered interactive chatbot, whereas others continue to use a simpler, rules-based one. The new tool’s impact can then be assessed by tracking whether users in the LLM group are less likely to request human assistance or call the help centre — signs that their queries are being resolved more effectively than those of the other group.\n\nPeople can monitor their blood glucose levels continuously using a smartphone app.Credit: Getty\n\nSurveys can provide useful feedback on user experience for both groups, helping evaluators to understand what worked and why. But it’s important to not rely on self-reports alone. Observing actual behaviour — what people do, not just what they say — provides stronger evidence of impact.\n\nMore-complex AI projects require proportionately scaled evaluation designs. Consider a hypothetical scenario in which the UK National Health Service provides people with an AI-powered wearable device to help them to manage a chronic condition. The technology monitors the person’s health and sends automated alerts to their physician if it detects signs that medical attention might be needed. A robust evaluation could randomly assign the AI-enabled wearable to some people, whereas others (serving as a control group) could receive a version without such features.\n\nKey outcomes might include a reduction in the number of hospital admissions through more timely preventative care. But the evaluation should also explore potential unintended consequences — for instance, whether physicians become overly reliant on the AI tool and reduce the frequency of in-person consultations or other standard care practices.\n\nContinuous evaluation\n\nOur AI-evaluation guidance not just builds on the UK government’s Magenta Book4, which outlines its evaluation standards, but calls for updating conventional approaches. Most policies are typically evaluated only once. For AI, however, this needs to change.\n\nAI models are fast-evolving, and their output and performance can change quickly. Many AI systems adapt through user interactions, meaning that their behaviour can change over time — or differ across user groups. Evaluation strategies must therefore be as dynamic and responsive as the technology itself.\n\nOur guidance highlights the need for continuous, iterative evaluation. Instead of relying on a single assessment, setting up regular checkpoints — or better yet, adopting a system that continuously updates the evidence base as data become available — can be much more effective. This kind of flexible approach enables decision makers to adapt quickly and make informed choices as the technology and its impacts evolve.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Getty\n\nScientists overwhelmingly recognize the value of sharing null results, but rarely publish them in the research literature, according to a survey. The findings suggest that there is a need for increased awareness of how and why to share such data, as well as for changes in how research productivity is assessed.\n\nThe survey drew responses from 11,069 researchers in 166 countries and all major scientific disciplines. It found that 98% recognize the value of null results, which the survey defined as “an outcome that does not confirm the desired hypothesis”. Eighty-five per cent of respondents said it was important to share those results. However, just 68% of the 7,057 researchers whose work had produced null results had shared them in some form, and just 30% had tried to publish them in a journal.\n\nThe results were released on 22 July. The survey was conducted by Nature’s publisher, Springer Nature. (Nature is editorially independent of its publisher.)\n\nReluctance to publish\n\nThat only 30% of respondents with null results had attempted to publish them is not surprising to Ritu Dhand, Springer Nature’s chief scientific officer in London.\n\n“Researchers are taught to write research papers referencing positive advances, so null results are rarely cited,” she says. That means that even if null results are published, they won’t have an impact, she adds.\n\nSome 1,489 respondents had generated null results and agreed that they are important to share but had not yet done so. Most of that group expressed concerns about publishing them: 69% didn’t think null results would be accepted for publication; 52% didn’t know which journals would consider publishing research with null results; 19% worried that their institution or funder wouldn’t cover publishing costs; and 21% were concerned that they’d be viewed negatively by their peers.\n\nThis reputational concern reflects a disconnect in science, says Marcus Munafò, a biological psychologist and executive director of the UK Reproducibility Network, which aims to improve the trustworthiness of research.\n\n“The day-to-day life of most scientists is null results. Most of our studies don’t work. Most of our experiments don’t work,” says Munafò. “One of the reasons for publishing null results is to create a more honest denominator in the version of record” — a more accurate picture of the research landscape.\n\nCommunity service\n\nOf the 1,228 respondents who were able to publish their null results, 39% said that the process helped to inspire a new hypothesis or methodology and 28% said it prevented the duplication of unnecessary research.\n\nSuch efforts would have been appreciated by one anonymous respondent, who described how null results that could have changed the trajectory of their work were only “briefly mentioned” in a couple of journal articles that they stumbled on years later, “buried among other information in the articles”.\n\n“If it had been widely disseminated in my field,” they lamented, “it would have saved me 2+ critical research years!”",

          "title": "China’s fossil-fuel challenge — how to build a bridge to renewables",
          "authors": "Yihe Xu",
          "abstract": "As summer arrives in China, the country’s 2023 heatwave springs to mind. A period of extreme heat in June and July that year didn’t just scorch the land — it exposed a hard truth about China’s energy future. Temperatures in Xinjiang province shattered records at 52 °C and nationwide sales of air-conditioning units spiked by about 40% (see go.nature.com/452ckya; in Chinese).\n\nThe illusion of a stable, renewables-led grid collapsed: in Jiangsu, solar farms sputtered at low capacity as sunlight was dimmed by weeks of industrial smog. In Inner Mongolia, wind turbines stood still under a rare, suffocating heat dome. Hydropower generation fell to a historic low, whereas national carbon emissions hit a record high, as surging electricity demand and frequent power outages revived calls to expand fossil-fuel power (J. Dinneen New Scientist 3 April 2025).\n\nFaced with the prospect of power-grid failure, China had no choice but to fall back on the dirtiest tool in its energy arsenal: coal. During peak demand, thermal power plants were shouldering more than two-thirds of national electricity needs (see go.nature.com/4gth7zr; in Chinese). The power sector’s coal consumption grew in 2023 by 9% relative to 2022, to 2.9 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/3gnfk35; in Chinese).\n\nThe heatwave was a stark reminder that, despite its world-beating solar and wind facilities, China is still tethered — almost helplessly — to fossil fuels (see ‘China’s fossil-fuel reliance’). From steel mills to semiconductor plants, the engines of China’s growth are fuelled by coal, oil and gas. Yet clinging to the status quo risks accelerating both environmental degradation and geopolitical vulnerability.\n\nSources: China Petroleum Econ. and Tech. Res. Inst.; CNOOC Energy Econ. Inst.; Natl Bureau of Statistics\n\nAs the world’s largest energy consumer, China cannot simply abandon fossil fuels without jeopardizing the industrial base and social fabric that underpin its economic rise. What’s needed is realism. China’s energy future is not a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables — it is a high-stakes balancing act between economic resilience, environmental responsibility and social stability.\n\nAt the heart of its energy strategy must be carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). If the world is to meet its climate targets, China must lead not only in building green energy, but in cleaning up the energy it cannot yet replace with renewables.\n\nIndustry needs a lot of energy\n\nIn 2024, fossil fuels supplied almost 82% of China’s total energy consumption (59.6 billion tonnes of coal equivalent). Coal accounted for 53%, oil for 17%, and natural gas for 11% (see go.nature.com/3tjpe7r; in Chinese). To understand their centrality, consider three sectors that contribute 25% of national gross domestic product (GDP): steel, chemicals and construction materials . Power generation and coal-to-chemical industries alone consume around 2 billion tonnes of coal annually (see go.nature.com/4kdx9hm; in Chinese). These processes demand extreme heat: blast furnaces cannot run on solar power, and cement kilns need temperatures of 1,450 °C, which today’s renewables cannot yet reliably supply.\n\nTo end coal, adapt to regional realities\n\nEven high-tech industries depend on fossil fuels. In 2022, data centres across China consumed a total of 270 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a 25% increase compared with 2021. This accounted for roughly 3% of the country’s total electricity consumption, much of it generated from coal (see go.nature.com/4kcz99y; in Chinese). According to a report by climate researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the coal industry directly supported 2.6 million jobs in 2023. In Inner Mongolia, a region with a population of 23.8 million, coal contributes about 16% of its GDP and nearly half of its industrial profits, employing more than 180,000 people (see go.nature.com/3tsrfxs; in Chinese).\n\nAbandoning coal without a strategy would trigger social unrest, as Germany discovered during its phase out of coal mining in the Ruhr Valley, starting in 2018. On losing a sector that once employed about 600,000 people, the region saw mass lay-offs and economic decline, sparking waves of protest and discontent (see go.nature.com/3ufk6wd).\n\nAs of 2024, China’s capacity in solar and wind energy (887 and 521 gigawatts, respectively; see go.nature.com/3gjfdwf; in Chinese) is world-leading, yet last year these renewable sources met just 18% of the country’s total electricity demand. The problem isn’t scale — it’s intermittency. For instance, during a 2022 winter cold snap, the generation capacity of Inner Mongolia’s wind farms dropped to nearly zero for 24 hours because there was so little wind. Grid operators learnt the hard way and now require coal plants in major coal-producing areas to maintain 15-day coal stockpiles — not as a fallback to the past, but as a necessity of the present.\n\nOil and gas are equally entrenched. China’s transportation sector alone consumes 177 million tonnes of petrol annually (see go.nature.com/4keewqm; in Chinese). Petrol and diesel still power almost 80% of China’s roughly 450 million vehicles, despite electric vehicles accounting for 41% of new car sales in 2024, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.\n\nOil is also the feedstock of China’s petrochemical empire. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company — one of Asia’s largest integrated refineries, run by the Chinese state firm Sinopec — processes up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Its output feeds China’s vast plastics and chemical industries, which together employ more than 12 million people nationwide.\n\nThree ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky\n\nNatural gas, once peripheral, is now a geopolitical and environmental linchpin. As part of the Blue Sky campaign, tens of millions of rural households have replaced coal stoves with gas boilers — slashing urban smog but driving gas imports up to 43% to cover the increased consumption (see go.nature.com/4nvkkss; in Chinese). China’s gas supply map is also a map of its foreign policy. A pipeline from Siberia delivers 38 billion cubic metres per year from Russia. In Guangdong, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals offload cargo from Qatar to feed factories that help to produce 70% of the world’s air conditioners.\n\nThis dependency isn’t just economic — it’s strategic. China still imports 11 million barrels of oil per day, yet 80% of it is transported by sea through the narrow, US-patrolled Strait of Malacca, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation. Gas pipelines snake through restive regions near Afghanistan, and LNG ships from Australia navigate contested waters in the South China Sea.\n\nIn response, China is doubling down on domestic exploration. In 2024, Sinopec announced it had discovered 140 million tonnes of shale oil in Shandong province, and PetroChina’s Gulong shale-oil field in Daqing is targeting a reserve of 1 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/4kj3g5r; in Chinese). These projects — in three national shale demonstration zones — should help to cut China’s oil import reliance and replicate the US revolution in fracking, or hydraulic fracturing.\n\nThe price of fossil-fuel use is paid in carbon dioxide. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were projected to reach a record 41.6 billion tonnes — most of which came from coal burning (see go.nature.com/4rpu6qq). China contributed a staggering 16 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, according to the UN Environment Programme’s 2024 emissions gap report (see go.nature.com/4gzuyza), with coal alone responsible for more than 60% of CO2 emissions. Without urgent and comprehensive decarbonization, the climate crisis will only accelerate.\n\nUse carbon-capture technologies\n\nChina’s solution cannot be renewables alone. It must include CCUS, not as an afterthought, but as central infrastructure, similar to roads or railways. Currently, CCUS is the only proven technology with the potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and chemicals, if it can be made to work at scale.\n\nChina has backed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, a global pact launched in 2023 at the COP28 UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates to cut emissions from the fossil-fuel sector. In July 2024, PetroChina joined the initiative, aligning with more than 50 oil companies responsible for 44% of global oil output. The charter mandates real action: no routine flaring of gas from fossil-fuel operations by 2030 and the adoption of industry best practices for emissions reductions and transparent emissions reporting.\n\nA nationwide heatwave in China in June 2023 caused a 40% surge in sales of air-conditioning units. Credit: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nBut progress remains slow. China’s national carbon market, the China Emissions Allowance, trades at 68–90 yuan (US$9.50–12.50) per tonne — well below carbon prices in the European Union, which exceed €70 (US$82) per tonne. Such low levels in China offer little incentive for companies to invest in deep decarbonization.\n\nChina emits more than 10 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, yet current CCUS projects, mostly in the Junggar Basin in northwest China, capture just 4 million tonnes and store 2 million tonnes (see go.nature.com/3tfkpye; in Chinese). The disparity is staggering. Without a sweeping scale-up, CCUS is symbolic at best. Closing the gap will require a huge and concerted effort to make carbon capture count.\n\nUrgent actions\n\nFirst, China must drive down CCUS costs through sustained research and development and standardization. Technical standards should cover the entire CCUS life cycle: capture, transport, injection, monitoring and closure. These must include engineering protocols, environmental risk assessments and leakage detection systems.",

          "authors": "Caroline Seydel",
          "abstract": "Synthetic biology is poised to tackle a range of challenges, from cleaning up pollutants with designer bacteria to the creation of bespoke gene therapies. But the transition from the laboratory to commercial use will require advances in DNA-synthesis technology.\n\nFor decades, the only way to make industrial volumes of custom DNA has been phosphoramidite synthesis, an organic-chemistry process that can construct nucleic acids up to 350 nucleotides or so in length. To produce longer fragments, DNA manufacturers build thousands of oligonucleotides, or oligos, in parallel, and then assemble them. This technique can pump out large volumes of DNA at low cost, but it struggles with sequences that are highly repetitive or complex.\n\nThe race for enzymatic DNA synthesis heats up\n\nNow, advances in both enzymatic and chemical synthesis are clearing those hurdles.\n\nEnzymatic synthesis is inspired by the method that living cells use to replicate DNA. Usually, cells copy DNA from a template rather than creating it from scratch. But that works only if the template exists, which is not the case for the custom DNAs that synthetic biologists need. An enzyme called terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) can join nucleotides together without a template, and several companies have begun commercializing enzymatic methods that exploit it.\n\nDNA Script, based in Paris, couples TdT with chemically modified nucleotides that prevent elongation by more than one monomer at a time. After each base is added, the protective cap is removed and washed away, another base is added and the cycle repeats. Ansa Biotechnologies takes a similar approach, but rather than using a blocking group to restrict elongation, the company, in Emeryville, California, tethers the base to TdT so that the enzyme stays bound to the growing oligo. A second enzyme cleaves the linker after elongation, allowing the cycle to continue.\n\nThomas Ybert, chief scientific officer at DNA Script in Paris.Credit: ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty\n\nAccording to Daniel Lin-Arlow, Ansa’s chief scientific officer, the approach can handle sequences with highly complex secondary structures, including repeats, hairpins or high guanine–cytosine content, which are otherwise difficult to produce. In August 2024, the company launched its first commercial product, a 600-base custom service, which can be assembled into constructs of up to 5 kilobases. “We found a lot of interest from people who were working on non-coding sequences, like promoters,” Lin-Arlow says, which cannot be changed to make them easier to manufacture. And the technology continues to advance: early-access customers can now request DNAs as long as 750 bases, and clonal assemblies up to 50 kbp in length.\n\nEnzymatic synthesis is also making benchtop DNA synthesizers more accessible. Phosphoramidite-based DNA synthesizers require specialized training and infrastructure to safely handle toxic organic reagents and waste. By contrast, enzymatic synthesizers require only basic liquid-handling skills. In 2023, DNA Script began selling its SYNTAX system, a device that researchers can use to synthesize 96 oligos in parallel, with up to about 120 nucleotides per oligo, per day. “It’s as easy to use as your office printer,” says Thomas Ybert, the firm’s chief scientific officer.\n\nChemical improvements\n\nNew organic-chemistry methods are also emerging to tackle long-DNA synthesis.",

          "authors": "Rachel Brazil",
          "abstract": "Annie and Ilan Ganot (pictured with their children) tapped into their networks to start a firm focused on Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Credit: Ilan Ganot\n\nFor most parents of children with serious medical conditions, the date of the diagnosis is seared into their memory. For Terry Pirovolakis, it was 2 April 2019. After an 18-month diagnostic odyssey, he was told that his son, Michael, had a progressive neurodevelopmental condition called spastic paraplegia 50 (SPG50), and would probably never walk or talk.\n\nBut, unlike most parents, Pirovolakis began a journey to find a cure, which ultimately led to setting up a biotechnology company. He is not alone. Pirovolakis, chief executive of Elpida Therapeutics in Encino, California, says there is a small but growing number of parents doing the same. Four years ago, he started a channel for them on the online communication platform Slack, which now has more than 400 members.\n\nMajor advances in life-science tools over the past 20 years, and the increasing number of ways to produce therapies mean that finding cures is not just wishful thinking, although the road to clinical success is still daunting. Some of these parents have backgrounds in finance or business, but most have no formal scientific training. However, all share a determination to keep going. They describe what it took to get their firms off the ground, and how they deal with the highs and lows of being both a parent and a company founder.\n\nHow a midwife became a neuroscientist to seek a cure for her son\n\nIn 2012, after their two-year-old son, Eytani, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Ilan and Annie Ganot gave up their previous careers. Realizing that the networks they had developed could help them to raise the necessary capital to start a biotech firm, the family relocated from London to Boston, Massachusetts, in 2013. By the year’s end, they had US$17 million in seed funding for the company, Solid Biosciences. “I didn’t know if it was going to succeed or fail,” says Ilan Ganot, “but it didn’t feel like there were a ton of reasons not to try.”\n\nDaniel Fischer had been an e-commerce entrepreneur and a management consultant before Natasha, one of his twin daughters, was diagnosed in 2009 with Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy caused by a genetic mutation. Unlike his wife, who immediately began to read the literature, Fischer felt there was little he could do, but a series of serendipitous meetings with other parents changed his mind.\n\nAt one, a computational biologist explained his work on drug repurposing — finding new uses for existing medications. Then Fischer received a call from another parent, who was looking to support work towards a cure. The three of them started Intellimedix in Atlanta, Georgia, which uses computational modelling to screen existing drugs for anti-seizure activity. Eventually, they opened a laboratory in Boston to screen the top hits in a zebrafish model of the disease.\n\nDaniel Fischer (with daughter Natasha, left) started companies to work on Dravet syndrome.Credit: Karina Fischer\n\nJill Wood had a career in fashion retail, when. in 2010, her son Jonah was diagnosed with Sanfilippo syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III), a rare genetic disorder that causes damage to the brain and nervous system. “We were told that he had an incurable, ultra-rare disease, no treatment. It was terminal,” says Wood. She “flipped out” and started fundraising as a non-profit foundation, but “quickly realized that wasn’t going to cut it”.\n\nWood immersed herself in the scientific literature and started seeking out the key researchers who work on the disease. She quit her job to go to conferences, sometimes taking Jonah, as well as her sister or husband to help. She recalls waiting for one researcher outside the men’s toilets so she could ask questions. Following the example of another mother of a child with Sanfilippo syndrome, who set up a company called Lysogene in Paris in 2009, Wood transformed her foundation into a biotech company called Phoenix Nest, based in New York City, and won a US National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research grant to pursue therapies for Sanfilippo syndrome. So far, the company has been awarded more than $13 million and has a preclinical pipeline that includes a peptide, an enzyme replacement therapy and a gene therapy.\n\nPromotion pathways: how scientists can chart their industry career trajectory\n\nAt the time of his son’s diagnosis, Pirovolakis, who is based in Toronto, Canada, had spent 25 years in information technology. He knew nothing about genetics and was reluctant to move into biotech, but concluded, “if I don’t do this, who will?” Within a couple of months, he hired a team at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to start work on a gene therapy for his son. “We liquidated our life savings, and we knew that even if we sold everything, we wouldn’t have enough money.” He embarked on an exhausting fundraising campaign of galas and golf tournaments and, over four years, raised US$4.5 million. In December 2021, Health Canada gave the gene therapy, Melpida, the go-ahead for use in a single-patient clinical trial, and Michael was treated in March 2022. Since then, seven other children have been treated. Preliminary results suggest that the therapy can stabilize the disease (J. J. Dowling et al. Nature Med. 30, 1882–1887; 2024).\n\nHe then wanted to hand over the programme to any organization for free and return to his previous career, but found no takers; the market for the treatment was too small, with fewer than 100 people known to be affected worldwide. So he set up the non-profit company Elpida, with the help of two investors.\n\nStart-up company or charity?\n\nFor those with business or finance backgrounds, setting up a company seemed the obvious choice. “I basically went with what I knew how to do,” says Fischer. Wood says the constant need to fundraise for the charity that she and her husband initially set up was harder than running a biotech firm. “It’s like having to plan three weddings a year for 300 people, and it is soul-sucking. After a while, you are hitting up the same people over and over — you wear everybody thin.”\n\nGanot realized that it would take hundreds of millions of dollars to find a cure for DMD, and that raising that amount would need a for-profit company. But creating profit isn’t so easy for rarer diseases. Brad Margus was faced with this problem in 1993, when two of his sons, Jarrett, then aged four, and Quinn, then aged two, were diagnosed with ataxia–telangiectasia (AT). This genetic disease causes loss of muscle control and problems with the lungs and immune system, as well as heightening the risk of cancer, and often leads to death by early adulthood.\n\nHe and his wife poured their energy into a foundation while he continued to run a shrimp-processing business. But he found it increasingly difficult to care about supplying restaurants, and instead focused on how to accelerate research on AT. His knowledge of and focus on drug discovery drew several venture capitalists to him in 2000, looking for executives who knew about genetics. That same year, he co-founded Perlegen Sciences, a company based in Mountain View, California, that sought to identify patterns in genetic differences that underlie disease.\n\nParents who want to start a company to find a cure for their child’s disease should take the plunge, says Brad Margus, who has founded several biotechnology firms.Credit: Brad Margus\n\nAlthough he wasn’t working on an AT cure, “now I could think about science all the time,” he says. He has since founded two more biotech companies, Envoy Therapeutics, which was sold to Takeda Pharmaceuticals, based in Tokyo, in 2012, and Cerevance in Boston, which has a therapy for Parkinson’s disease in a phase III trial. All the while, Margus says, he has been leveraging his experience to benefit the AT mission. “You really can’t work for me at a company and be smart and not expect to have me ask you a lot of questions” about the disease, he says. Cerevance has helped to analyse brain-tissue samples from children who died from AT.\n\nLimited scientific knowledge hasn’t been a barrier for some parents who have founded companies. Arjun Natesan, senior vice-president of translational research and portfolio management at Ultragenyx in Novato, California, which focuses on rare diseases, runs an entrepreneur bootcamp to help them, and says he is impressed by their scientific literacy. “It’s like they have a PhD in their specific indication. They can talk the talk, and they truly understand a lot of the biology.” Fischer took some courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and says, “I’m at a stage where I can talk smartly about the science, but don’t ask me to do it or to work out too many details!” Wood picked up what she needed to know but “a lot of times I just nod my head and go with it”, she says. They both trust the scientists they hired to provide the expertise they lack.\n\nAfrica’s chief diplomat for vaccine manufacturing\n\nHaving a personal stake in the company’s pipeline matters. “Your motivation is going to guide many of the decisions,” says Fischer. But, as a chief executive, he sometimes has to make choices that go against his personal interests. “Sometimes we have to prioritize the programmes where you have a bigger probability of succeeding in the market.” If this helps the company to succeed, he thinks, in the long run it puts him in a better position to find a treatment for Dravet syndrome. Ganot, who now runs Alesta Therapeutics in Boston, another firm with a focus on rare diseases, has a similar ethos. “It was important to me that this would not be about my son. This would be because of him,” he says. The approach has helped him to make decisions in the interests of stakeholders as well as those being treated.\n\nThe personal mission can make you “less patient” and “more blunt and candid”, says Margus, which might not always be easy for colleagues. But, he adds, a large proportion of people in biotech have a personal connection to the field: “They’ve got a mother who’s cognitively declining or they’ve got a kid with something.” At Tevard Biosciences in Boston, which Fischer co-founded in 2017 together with another Dravet parent, the leadership thinks hard about being patient-focused, he says, by bringing families in to talk to the team, for example. “I always tell our employees, ‘I know we’re working with cell lines and mice, but in the end, remember we’re working for kids and I have one at home.’”\n\nHighs and lows\n\nAs with any biotech endeavour, parents who launch companies go through highs and lows, and sometimes a steep learning curve. Wood experienced the departure of a principal investigator (PI), which meant that the $2-million NIH grant that was funding employees, including herself, was frozen. She ended up borrowing money from her brother to keep the company afloat, and did not take a salary for six months until she could find another PI willing to take on the grant. “That was almost a year by the time it all got back on track,” she says. “I cried every day.”\n\nPirovolakis says he learnt to remove his emotions from stressful situations. In 2021, he lost a gene-therapy product worth $800,000 because of snowstorm shipping delays. He felt like screaming at people, but quickly moved on to thinking about fixing the situation. Ganot also experienced severe disappointments, such as unexpected safety challenges during clinical trials of a candidate molecule. “When it’s personal, it hits you much harder,” agrees Fischer.\n\nTerry Pirovolakis with his son, Michael.Credit: Terry Pirovolakis",

          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Data-visualization researcher Lonni Besançon hopes young scientists will get involved in scientific sleuthing.Credit: Julie G.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lonni Besançon was far away from home and, like most of us, spending a lot of time online.\n\nIn September 2020, six months into the pandemic, Besançon moved from southern Sweden to Melbourne, Australia, to start a new postdoc at Monash University. In an unfamiliar place and in need of a new activity, the data-visualization researcher was struck by the outlandish things he was seeing online.\n\nHe also wanted to feel useful during this turbulent time. Besançon, originally from Paris, found a way to make use of his experience in statistics and research methods: by examining controversial and preliminary papers on COVID-19.\n\nIt quickly became a preoccupation. During lockdown, he would post his findings on Twitter (now called X) even in the middle of the night. Besançon was accustomed to seeing a misuse of statistics, which he blamed on structural problems in scholarly publishing and academia, such as the career pressure to publish quickly and frequently.\n\nBut research that he felt was problematic seemed to ramp up during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pace and scale of scientific publishing drastically intensified, with preprints (papers published online before peer review) becoming more prominent than ever. And this speed posed a challenge to quality control. All this galvanized Besançon “As I sat at home watching shoddy science, poor quality control and opaque research being published and discussed, I felt more and more inspired to become a scientific sleuth,” he says.\n\nChain retraction: how to stop bad science propagating through the literature\n\nThe Internet was both harmful and helpful in terms of attacking false information. He put out a call on Twitter for researchers who could help to analyse papers that had been published after short review periods. In June 2021, Besançon and his collaborators, who were working at various institutes and in several areas of health research, analysed the publication metadata of 8,455 papers related to COVID-19, published by 1 July 2020. They found that 699 (8.3%) of the papers had been accepted by a journal the same day or the following day. For 42.5% of those papers, at least one of the authors had an editorial role at the journal they were published in1.\n\n“Look, maybe there’s not a universally agreed definition of what an editorial conflict of interest is,” Besançon says. “But it’s a red flag, and the lack of transparency about peer-review processes when there’s a potential conflict of interest, that’s the problem, plus the very quick peer review.” He stresses that he didn’t consider this fraud, but he did question whether such papers could have been properly peer reviewed; in instances in which reviewers’ comments were published, some were just one sentence long. This made him wonder about both the rigour of the review process, and the implications for busy clinicians relying on such papers. Besançon says he understood the desire to expedite clinically relevant research during the pandemic, but he thinks that if journals had relaxed their peer-review policies, this should have been disclosed. In August 2020, for example, The FASEB Journal, published by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, announced which types of article, at the discretion of the editor, could be fast-tracked without peer review2.\n\nInvestigating a high-profile COVID-19 treatment\n\nAmong the papers that were published unusually quickly was a March 2020 work assessing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment3. This was published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents within days of being posted as a preprint. In this paper, French microbiologist Didier Raoult and his colleagues concluded that hydroxychloroquine was associated with a significant reduction of viral load in a small sample of 20 people (16 further participants formed a control group). The paper immediately attracted a huge amount of interest, including from US President Donald Trump, then in his first term. It would go on to be cited almost 3,400 times, according to the Web of Science database, before being retracted in December 2024. Raoult was lauded by many as a hero of the pandemic.\n\nBesançon saw hydroxychloroquine gain traction and attention in French media and politics. In late March, just a week after the paper was published, the French health minister authorized hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment under supervision in some severe cases. This authorization was withdrawn in May, yet Raoult continued administering hydroxychloroquine to people with COVID-19.\n\nFrench microbiologist Didier Raoult co-authored a 2020 research paper that tested a malaria drug called hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. The paper was later retracted. Credit: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty\n\nPolicymakers weren’t the only ones paying attention. Besançon continued working with other research-integrity sleuths in response to the hydroxychloroquine paper. This was ad hoc, generally in their free time, he says. One collaborator was Alexander Samuel, a secondary-school maths and physics teacher in Nice, France, and an open-science activist with a PhD in molecular biology. Samuel had been disseminating findings through his blog and social media, but Besançon helped to bring their work to an audience of scientists. “He connects people and then makes a paper. He was kind of like a PI for me,” Samuel says. “I think he brings the scholarly level to the activism.”\n\nBesançon and his fellow investigators pointed out major concerns with the hydroxychloroquine study’s design, such as the fact that 6 people treated with the drug (out of 26 participants) dropped out of the study and were disregarded in the analysis. Of those six, one person died and three were moved into intensive care.\n\nThe sleuths’ scrutiny extended past the single paper, to other research published by University Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection (IHU) in Marseille, France, which was at that time led by Raoult. They found what they considered to be significant ethical breaches, including failure to follow research-ethics guidelines regarding human participants. They realized that Raoult had co-authored more than 200 papers with the same ethics-committee approval number, which represented a single application, including studies involving children in African countries. Raoult has justified the lack of individual ethical review by arguing that research involving human faeces, for instance, did not require unique ethical approval in France.\n\nThe IHU did not respond to questions from Nature's journalists about the culture of the institute and the alleged ethical breaches by the time this article went to press.\n\nHowever, Raoult did make concessions. In January 2021, he and the other authors of the original hydroxychloroquine paper confirmed in a letter to the editor of the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents that, in view of the urgency during the COVID-19 pandemic, they had not conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They maintained that “despite its limitations, weaknesses and imperfections, our study provided preliminary evidence that allowed us to treat a large number of patients with HCQ-AZ [hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin] combination that was confirmed to be effective against COVID-19”4.\n\nA separate analysis of 26 trials of hydroxychloroquine, published in April 2021, concluded that this drug was associated with increased mortality in people with COVID-195 .\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic drived huge online attention to science and birthed many vaccine conspiracy theories. Credit: Sylvain Lefevre/Getty\n\nA Nature journalist contacted the authors of the retracted hydroxychloroquine paper to ask about allegations of misconduct and the impact of the paper on people with COVID-19. Most didn’t reply, but Philippe Brouqui, Philippe Parola and Bernard La Scola shared an open letter challenging the retraction, written by Brouqui and Raoult.\n\nElisabeth Bik, a microbiologist based in San Francisco, California, who has become a leading authority on research-integrity issues, shared concerns online about the paper’s data, peer-review timeline and ethical review. Raoult called her a “witch-hunter” and in April 2021, along with one of his co-authors, structural biologist Eric Chabrière, he filed a criminal complaint against Bik, citing moral harassment, attempted blackmail and attempted extortion. The French prosecutor dropped the case in 2024. Chabrière did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRaoult defended himself vigorously. On YouTube in June 2021, he expressed his frustration at the slow pace of ethical clearance during the pandemic and compared criticisms of his research to the persecution faced by many during the Second World War.\n\nAlso in the YouTube video, Raoult speculated about whether Bik and Besançon had been recruited from psychiatric hospitals. Besançon was one of the scientists who wrote an open letter supporting Bik.\n\nIn posts on Twitter, Besançon’s harassers wrongly accused him of Nazism, sexual harassment and responsibility for thousands of deaths from COVID-19 vaccines. He has also received death threats for his science advocacy.\n\nAll this not only affected his sense of safety, but also made him worry about protecting his family and friends. Online trolls speculated about his family’s location. And the stress from the harassment and legal proceedings affected his relationship with his then-partner, he says, because of the strain on his time and mental energy.\n\nPeople around him have suggested that he should not reply to trolls, and Besançon acknowledges, “I’m reading trolling comments, and I’m trolling back, which may not be the best use of my time.” And he notes that some of his colleagues have questioned whether sleuthing could distract him from his academic responsibilities. But as an evening activity, he says, sleuthing isn’t affecting his main research, and he’s kept up a steady stream of publications in his research field, data visualization.\n\nIn August 2021, Besançon brought a case against Raoult for defamation in the French courts in response to the June 2021 YouTube video in which Raoult had made the comment about psychiatric hospitals and also claimed that Besançon suggested sending a ‘suicide car’ to the IHU.\n\nExplaining his decision, Besançon says, “My aim was to prevent direct attacks on my scientific credibility and reputation, both by him and his colleagues.” Raoult’s lawyer told Victor Garcia, a journalist at the French newspaper L'Express, that his client had probably made a mistake while under strain. His legal team also argued that the case exceeded the limitation period, a time limit in which a party can bring a claim, because of a lengthy period between investigative actions. Finally, in April this year, the public prosecutor agreed with Raoult’s team on the limitation period. Thus, the case was dismissed.\n\nMeanwhile, official investigations into Raoult’s research continued. In September 2022, the General Inspectorate of Education, Sport and Research (IGESR), a French public agency that inspects public services, called the IHU’s governance under Raoult “damaging”. It referred to a “contentious and sometimes vindictive atmosphere” at the institute, which included “censorship”. The IGESR also reported that the IHU had a culture of speedy publication of science that put pressure on researchers, and led some to massage their data, sidestep participant consent and disregard regulations. The IGESR stated that in treating people with COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, years after the French ban, the IHU’s “practices are likely to be deemed a criminal offence”. (The IGESR also expressed concern about the institute’s off-protocol use of azithromycin, zinc and ivermectin in people with COVID-19.) The public prosecutor has not announced an investigation.",

          "title": "How your research can survive a US federal grant termination",
          "authors": "Virginia Gewin",
          "abstract": "Seven weeks after being awarded a US$12.9-million grant to assess dementia risks in vulnerable populations, Briana Mezuk received an e-mail informing her that it was being terminated.\n\nMezuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, had honed her federal grant application over two years to take advantage of the National Survey of American Life — a seminal study of 7,000 participants that examined racial, ethnic and cultural influences on mental health1. Started by Mezuk’s mentor, James S. Jackson, a former director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, it is the only nationally representative sample of the mental health of Black Americans, who are twice as likely as their white counterparts to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Mezuk planned to follow up with those participants 25 years after the first interviews took place and examine how their life experiences and mental health had contributed to their dementia risk.\n\nThe five-year grant was awarded on 1 February by the National Institute on Aging, a division of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), based in Bethesda, Maryland. But on 21 March, it fell foul of the disdain that the administration of US President Donald Trump has expressed for projects including the terms diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\n\nHarvard researchers devastated as Trump team cuts nearly 1,000 grants\n\nAccording to Grant Watch, a database tracking terminated grants from the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) — the country’s independent federal science-funding agency — more than 4,500 NIH grants awarded to US institutions have been terminated, representing some $6.1 billion of lost funding. And according to its 27 May account, a total of 1,752 grants, amounting to roughly $1.5 billion, had by then been terminated at the NSF.\n\n“The largest studies on dementia risk only have 800 Black participants. We were going to have 3,000,” says Mezuk, who appealed through the NIH against her grant cancellation. “It is critically important that a diverse set of experiences are represented. If we keep asking the same question in the same populations, we will get the same answer.” Her planned research aimed to glean fresh insights to help ‘baby boomers’, referring to the generation born between 1946 and 1964, to manage dementia risks.\n\nEpidemiologist Briana Mezuk’s grant to study dementia risk in older Black people was reinstated after her appeal. Credit: University of Michigan School of Public Health\n\nBut such terminations don’t just affect the research team involved. Many grant cancellations affect community research partners. Adelia Cooley is a member of the community advisory board for the Healthier Black Elders Center, an outreach programme that includes researchers at three Michigan universities working to improve the health of older Black adults in Detroit and Flint. Cooley says her biggest concern is the impact that the cuts will have on Black Americans, a demographic in which the risk of dementia (in those aged 55 or over) is roughly 45%2. “To say this is irrelevant or not necessary is horrible.”\n\nAgency appeals, however, as well as multi-complaint lawsuits, are getting some terminations reversed. On 16 June, a judge in Maryland ruled that NIH grants in two lawsuits — one filed by 16 state attorneys-general, the other by four researchers and three organizations with scientific members — were terminated unlawfully. The ruling reinstates roughly 800 grants and subawards named in the lawsuits. A follow-up ruling on 2 July suggests that the NIH cannot use discriminatory directives to terminate grants. But the Trump administration is likely to appeal against the decision, extending delays and confusion over terminated grants.\n\nMezuk’s grant was not part of any lawsuit, but she received a 19 June memo from the NIH stating that her appeal “has convinced them that, with revision, the grant is likely allowable”. The vaguely worded correspondence offered her a piece of guidance: remove participant-survey questions about experiences of discrimination. On 10 July, she received notice that her grant had been fully reinstated.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to 20 researchers who have lost grants from the NIH, the NSF, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Defense, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NASA. Mezuk, for one, is lucky in that her institution supported her appeal. Some universities forbid such attempts.\n\n#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers\n\nDuring the reporting of this article, several interviewees had their grants reinstated, offering hope amid the chaos — although only about one-fifth of NIH-terminated grants have been flagged by Grant Watch as possibly reinstated through appeals or court cases so far. Many researchers are spending the bulk of their time frantically applying for grants to secure enough funding just to keep their work going. But the amounts they can hope to gain pale in comparison with the money lost through the federal-government cuts. Others are exploring new fund-raising strategies altogether – including campaigning through GoFundMe, the world’s largest fundraising platform.\n\nCollateral community damage\n\nMara Freilich, an environmental scientist who started her research group at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2023, lost her first federally funded grant from NASA on 21 March because it was considered “radical and wasteful DEI” spending, according to the e-mail she received from the agency. The funding had been helping a multi-institutional team working with community advocates and citizen scientists to analyse air quality around the Salton Sea, a large, landlocked and highly saline lake in southern California. “One of my big concerns is that the trust in science and in scientists is broken,” says Freilich. It weighs on her that scientists might not be able to follow through on the promises they made to community partners, such as sharing the air-quality findings in a timely manner.\n\nThe Salton Sea field site in California, where Mara Freilich’s group studied air-pollution emissions; the project was funded by a now-terminated NASA grant. Credit: Ryan Sinclair, Loma Linda University\n\nIn a study published on 31 May3, Freilich and her collaborators identified hydrogen sulfide emissions from the Salton Sea as an air pollutant of concern. The research was funded, in part, by the terminated NASA grant, which was also intended to develop innovative ways of using satellite data to predict hydrogen sulfide emissions. Freilich’s appeal against the cancellation was unsuccessful.\n\nThe grant terminations for Mezuk, Freilich and others have had a domino effect. Big studies often involve collaborations between several institutions. Freilich’s grant termination compromises funding for research partners at the University of California, Los Angeles; Loma Linda University in southern California; and Alianza Coachella Valley, a community group that aims to improve environmental conditions in the region.\n\nAlida Cantor, a geographer at Portland State University in Oregon, is also trying hard to maintain ties with community partners. Cantor lost two grants, from the NSF and the EPA, because her research included the banned term “environmental justice”, as related to the intersection between energy development and water availability in the western United States. The funding loss affects four academic institutions, as well as community partners. “Out of respect for our research participants, I’m not going to chuck the data,” says Cantor. “My priority is just being ethical in my relationships with research collaborators, participants, community partners and students.” Oregon was one of 16 states that sued the government to get terminated grants reinstated, and although Cantor is hopeful, she hasn’t heard anything more.\n\nAppeals for some\n\nAppealing against a grant termination usually entails assembling a dossier of evidence to submit to the funder. But success rates have been difficult to determine. The University of Utah’s $38 million Clinical and Translational Science Award, a seven-year grant first awarded by the NIH in 2023, was reinstated on 29 March. Grant Watch states on its website that it thinks the government “has restored a limited number of NIH grants that it previously terminated, often without providing public notice”.\n\nCharles DeCarli, director of the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center, is another of the few people known to have succeeded in an appeal. DeCarli was in the fifth year of a $36-million NIH grant programme to study the vascular factors that lead to dementia in a diverse population. Currently, he and his team have around 1,700 participants enrolled out of a hoped-for total of 2,250. (They lost around 100 participants in the weeks after the grant was initially terminated). DeCarli says his wife summarized the recipe for success best: support from university, peers, the NIH, the Alzheimer’s Association and the American Heart Association, and a dash of pixie dust. “We don’t really know why our appeal was successful,” he says.\n\nDeCarli took three weeks to put together a 41-page appeal that contained 16–18 pages of justification, with 50 references; the rest he describes as “legalese”. He emphasized all the ways in which his work furthered NIH priorities to study chronic illness as promoted by Make America Healthy Again, Trump’s populist campaign tailored to promote the aims of the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. DeCarli also pointed out that he had been awarded the grant in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He received a grant-reinstatement notification just a few days after he submitted his appeal.\n\n“If at all possible, push back,” he advises. “Seek the support of your institution. Seek the support of the free press, colleagues, programme officers. Researchers are “a small group”, he adds. “We should organize.”\n\nEarly-career researchers who appeal against the termination of training awards earmarked for diverse candidates are on particularly uncertain terrain – especially if the funding mechanism is terminated. For example, the NIH’s F31 training grants are coveted awards designed to support an individual’s PhD training and research. Since 2002, there have been two options: a standard F31 and a diversity-focused F31, designed to bolster candidates from marginalized or low-income backgrounds. About 30% of the 1,000 or so F31 training grants awarded in 2024 were funded by the diversity mechanism. Patrick Kelly, a third-year PhD candidate at Brown University, was awarded one of them. Kelly’s grant was cancelled in May, along with other diversity-specific F31 awards. Still, he wrote an appeal emphasizing how his dissertation research focused on drug use and drug-related harm from fentanyl, a priority of the HHS.\n\nKelly, a white man, qualified for the award because he is a first-generation student from a low-income background. On 27 June, he was notified that his grant had been reinstated and that funds were available for him to continue the research proposed in the grant. “I remain cautiously optimistic that the remaining years of the fellowship will also be awarded,” he says, but he acknowledges there’s no guarantee of that.\n\nScientists who might be political targets themselves — notably those at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at Columbia University in New York City — also hold out little hope for appeals. Trump has cut federal funding and contracts at both institutions, claiming that student protests in support of Palestinian people are evidence that the establishments “tolerate antisemitism”. On 16 June, a judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty members at Columbia University over Trump-administration funding cuts — because the university itself was not a plaintiff.\n\nNIH grant cuts will axe clinical trials abroad — and could leave thousands without care\n\nColumbia pulmonologist Jeanine D’Armiento had one time point left to collect data related to diagnosing a rare genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. But on 28 March, she lost her NIH funding for the study. Without those final data “everything we’d done for the last four years was wasted”, she says. At the same time, she lost funding for research on another rare lung disease; both grants were terminated weeks after the initial wave of $400 million in grant losses at Columbia in mid-March.\n\nD’Armiento, who chairs the executive committee of Columbia’s university senate, says her grants have none of the “bad” phrases, such as DEI, that are red flags for the Trump administration. Her trial was designed to recruit individuals in often-overlooked rural settings, among others, she says. She thinks she’s been targeted because the senate supported due process for student protesters. “I’m saddened by the loss of so much of my work,” she says. As it stands, she hopes that patient advocacy groups will help to raise money for her to finish the research. In fact, one trial participant asked her wedding guests to donate to D’Armiento’s research — and raised roughly $13,000.\n\nPhilanthropic life support\n\nBeyond federal funding sources, many turned immediately to philanthropic institutes — notably, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) in Princeton, New Jersey, which is the largest such organization focused solely on health in the country. So far, the RWJ has put together several pools of money to keep terminated research “on life support”, says Alonzo Plough, the foundation’s chief science officer and vice-president for research evaluation and learning.\n\n“What philanthropy can do is important, but it is orders of magnitude less than the billions in federal funding,” says Plough. “We fund in the serious millions, but what has been cut has been serious billions,” he adds.",

          "abstract": "Fragment of a military diploma from Sardinia. AI model Aeneas can predict text lost from a damaged inscription (grey text) without needing to know the length of the section that is missing.Credit: Yannis Assael et al./Nature\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) model can predict where ancient Latin texts come from, estimate how old they are and restore missing parts. The model1, called Aeneas and described in Nature today, was developed by some of the members of the team who created a previous AI tool that could decipher ancient Greek inscriptions.\n\nStudying ancient inscriptions, known as epigraphy, is challenging because some texts are missing letters, words or sections, and languages change over time. Historians analyse texts by comparing them with other inscriptions containing similar words or phrases. But finding these other inscriptions is incredibly time consuming, says co-author Thea Sommerschield, an epigrapher at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nAnother challenge is that new inscriptions continue to be discovered, so there is too much information for any single person to know, says Anne Rogerson, who studies Latin texts at the University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nHow AI is unlocking ancient texts — and could rewrite history\n\nTo make it easier to restore, translate and analyse inscriptions, a team including researchers from universities in the United Kingdom and Greece, and from Google’s AI company DeepMind in London, developed a generative AI model trained on inscriptions from the three of the world’s largest databases of Latin epigraphy. The combined data set contained text from 176,861 inscriptions — plus images of 5% of them — with dates ranging from the seventh century bc to the eighth century ad. The model comprises three neural networks, each designed for different tasks: restoring missing text; predicting where the text comes from; and estimating how old it is. Along with the results, Aeneas also provides a list of similar inscriptions from the data set to support its answer, ranked by how relevant they are to the original inscription.\n\n“Aeneas can retrieve relevant parallels from across our entire data set instantly” because each text has a unique identifier in the database, says co-author Yannis Assael, a research scientist at Google DeepMind.\n\nThe team tested the accuracy and usefulness of the model by asking 23 epigraphers to restore text that had been removed from inscriptions. The specialists were also asked to date and identify the origins of inscriptions, both alone and with the help of the model. On their own, the experts dated inscriptions to within around 31 years of the correct answer. Dates predicted by Aeneas were correct to within 13 years.\n\nWhen it came to identifying the geographical origin of the inscriptions and restoring parts of a text, the specialists who had access to the model’s list of similar inscriptions and its predictions were more accurate than specialists working alone or the model alone. The specialists also dated the inscriptions to within around 14 years of the right answer when they had the model’s list and predictions.\n\nHistorian helper",

Now it is time to examine the likely effects on public health.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion about the economic merits and risks of moving from a five-day to a four-day working week1. Proponents argue that employers can maintain or even improve service delivery by changing work processes, empowering workers to be more efficient and manage their time better, improving teamwork and workflows, and assisting the adoption of new technologies. When successfully implemented, employees are better off (with the same salary and more leisure time) and there is no reduction in employers’ output1. However, a progressive implementation and constant monitoring are crucial for such success. Additionally, there are risks of lower output if such economic benefits are not generalizable to all sectors of the economy1.",

          "abstract": "Human adaptation depends on individuals strategically choosing whom to learn from. A mosaic of social learning strategies—such as copying majorities or successful others—has been identified. Influential theories conceive of these strategies as fixed heuristics, independent of experience. However, such accounts cannot explain the flexibility and individual variability prevalent in social learning. Here we advance a domain-general reward learning framework that provides a unifying mechanistic account of pivotal social learning strategies. We first formalize how individuals learn to associate social features (for example, others’ behaviour or success) with reward. Across six experiments ( n = 1,941), we show that people flexibly adjust their social learning in response to experienced rewards. Agent-based simulations further demonstrate how this learning process gives rise to key social learning strategies across a range of environments. Our findings suggest that people learn how to learn from others, enabling adaptive knowledge to spread dynamically throughout societies.",

Here we introduce BEAST gradient boosting (BEAST-GB), a hybrid model integrating behavioural theory (BEAST) with machine learning. We first present CPC18, a competition for predicting risky choice, in which BEAST-GB won. Then, using two large datasets, we demonstrate that BEAST-GB predicts more accurately than neural networks trained on extensive data and dozens of existing behavioural models. BEAST-GB also generalizes robustly across unseen experimental contexts, surpassing direct empirical generalization, and helps to refine and improve the behavioural theory itself. Our analyses highlight the potential of anchoring predictions on behavioural theory even in data-rich settings and even when the theory alone falters. Our results underscore how integrating machine learning with theoretical frameworks, especially those—like BEAST—designed for prediction, can improve our ability to predict and understand human behaviour.",

Analysis of pre- and post-trial data from 2,896 employees across 141 organizations in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA shows improvements in burnout, job satisfaction, mental health and physical health—a pattern not observed in 12 control companies. Both company-level and individual-level reductions in hours are correlated with well-being gains, with larger individual-level (but not company-level) reductions associated with greater improvements in well-being. Three key factors mediate the relationship: improved self-reported work ability, reduced sleep problems and decreased fatigue.

Classifications of ‘male’ or ‘female’ occupations are shaped by required skills, whereas distinctions between ‘White’ and ‘Black’ occupations reflect socio-economic status and historical inequalities. Women and men are segmented by gender-associated skill sets, such as engineering versus caregiving skills. Within these skill sets, strong hierarchical segregation persists, with Black individuals disproportionately concentrated in positions of lower socio-economic status. Despite recent socio-economic changes, occupational specialization patterns have remained stable. Our findings highlight that the strong association between race and lower-status occupations must be addressed for a more inclusive society.",

Human brain regions develop at different rates, with many regions developing into the third and fourth decades of life. Here, in this preregistered study (https://osf.io/gsru7), we analysed intracranial electroencephalography recordings from widespread brain regions in a large developmental cohort. Using task-based (that is, attention to to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93–54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5,691), we mapped aperiodic (1/ƒ-like) activity, a proxy of neural noise, where steeper slopes indicate less noise and flatter slopes indicate more noise. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in grey matter volume are similarly associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices. Our findings establish developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity in localized brain regions and illuminate the development of PFC control during adolescence in the development of attention and memory.",

          "abstract": "Access to safely managed drinking water is a fundamental human right, essential for human health and well-being. However, 2.2 billion people around the world still lack this access, with significant geographical disparities. In this study, we leveraged the implementation of gender quota laws—specifically reserved parliamentary seats for women across African countries—to examine its impact on improved water availability. Our findings reveal that the implementation of gender quotas is associated with a 4.71 percentage point increase, on average, in the likelihood of people accessing safely managed water infrastructure. This effect becomes even more pronounced, rising to a 12.25 percentage point increase, when the quotas mandate reserving more than 20% of seats for women. Households with lower wealth, female-headed households, those living in rural areas, and households with lower levels of women’s empowerment and education benefit most from this policy. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms, and anecdotal evidence, reveals that gender-reserved seat quotas lead to an increase in the proportion of women in parliaments and an expansion of women’s political and social rights, although these effects do not extend to economic status.",

          "abstract": "Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at a remarkable scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: In lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual’s tenure year. Overall, these findings provide an empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.",

Predicting the structural transformation of crystals during solid–solid phase transitions, however, is challenging, as the transition can proceed through multiple pathways that are difficult to probe experimentally. Using minimal computational models, we show that distinct kinetic pathways between body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structures can be encoded into a system by specific particle interactions. By investigating the dynamics of these transitions, we resolve three different pathways at a particle-by-particle level: a direct bcc-to-fcc transition, a transition involving an intermediate, long-lived body-centered tetragonal (bct) phase, and a microstructure-dependent transition pathway with a competing hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase. These kinetic pathways are intrinsically linked to the shape of the underlying particle–particle interactions, suggesting routes for controlling the transformation pathways of soft matter systems. Furthermore, our investigations provide fundamental insights into solid–solid phase transition mechanisms generalizable across length scales.",

The intrinsically disordered tails of the histones serve as scaffolds for binding an array of proteins that regulate the fidelity of the genome and gene expression. A variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on the tails have been characterized, including some that alter their overall charge; however, per-residue changes in tail electrostatic potentials for different PTMs have not been reported. Here, using a solution NMR approach in which enhancements of transverse relaxation rates of tail amide and methyl group protons are quantified through the addition of paramagnetic cosolutes, we examine how acetylation and PARylation modulate histone tail electrostatic potentials. Notably, even though both PTMs decrease the net positive charge carried by each tail, their electrostatic potentials either increase or decrease in a tail-specific manner relative to an unmodified NCP. A simple model of tail–DNA interactions is presented to explain these results.",

          "abstract": "As a key passivation film that governs battery operation, the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) has long been credited for enabling high-performance batteries or blamed for their eventual death. However, qualitative descriptions of the SEI often found in the literature (e.g., “conductive,” “passivating”) highlight our incomplete understanding of this layer, where even the most basic properties foundational to SEI function remain difficult to measure. Here, we quantify SEI conductivities and SEI transference numbers using a separator-free Cu|SEI|Li architecture that treats the SEI as a functional solid-state electrolyte (SSE). We find that while any SEI property alone (e.g., electronic conductivity) is weakly correlated (R 2 &lt; 0.67) with battery performance (e.g., Coulombic efficiency), a strong correlation (R 2 &gt; 0.99) can be achieved by defining the “SEI cT number” as a product between the SEI transference number ( T ) and the ratio of SEI conductivities ( c ). Analogous to the thermoelectric figure of merit (i.e., zT ), SEI cT quantitatively benchmarks the holistic impact of SEI properties on battery performance and underscores the pitfalls of citing such properties in isolation. Perhaps most strikingly, we demonstrate that Li metal deposition and stripping at room temperature is possible in our separator-free Cu|SEI|Li cell, confirming that the SEI can function precisely as an SSE. Together, these results enrich our understanding of the SEI, not just as a passivation layer but as a functional structure that can potentially have important implications for solid-state batteries.",

          "abstract": "Barrier tissues such as the intestine are constantly challenged by environmental stressors and must adapt to maintain integrity and prevent excessive inflammation. Although traditionally viewed as a proinflammatory effector of interferon (IFN) signaling, STAT1 is shown here to play a protective role in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) by promoting resilience to damage and restraining IFN-induced cytotoxicity. We identify phosphorylation of threonine 748 (Thr748) on STAT1 as an evolutionarily selected adaptation—highly conserved between humans and mice—that reciprocally regulates IEC integrity and IFN responsiveness. Mice expressing a phospho-deficient T748A Stat1 mutant exhibit severe colitis-induced tissue damage comparable to Stat1-deficient littermates, underscoring the critical role of Thr748 phosphorylation in mediating Stat1-driven protection during intestinal inflammation. Bone marrow transfer experiments further demonstrate that this protective effect is nonhematopoietic. Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that Thr748 phosphorylation modulates STAT1 DNA binding, directly activates the Itgb4 promoter, and enhances integrin β4 expression in IEC following inflammation. In intestinal organoid models, gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that Thr748 phosphorylation drives integrin β4 expression and epithelial resilience independently of IFN-induced Tyrosine 701 (Tyr701) phosphorylation. In contrast, IFN stimulation via Tyr701 induces Zbp1—a cytotoxic nucleic acid sensor—while repressing integrin β4, resulting in epithelial injury that is mitigated by Thr748 phosphorylation. Together, these findings reveal a modular architecture of STAT1 signaling in which Thr748 phosphorylation functions as a molecular rheostat that safeguards epithelial integrity while tempering IFN-driven cytotoxic responses.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the drivers of spatial patterns in fossil communities is fundamental to paleoecology, yet direct evidence for biological mechanisms regulating interindividual spacing remains elusive. Brachiopod setae, hypothesized to function in feeding or defense, are exceedingly rare in the fossil record, especially among post-Cambrian taxa. Here, we present the report of exquisitely preserved setae from an exceptional in situ fossil assemblage of the early Silurian rhynchonelliform brachiopod Nucleospira calypta . Multiproxy analyses (scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and microcomputed tomography) revealed intricate ultrastructural details and diverse taphonomic pathways, leading to a reinterpretation of apparent calcitic preservation as primarily iron oxides with subsequent coating. Critically, the undisturbed nature of this aggregation allowed rigorous spatial point pattern analysis (Nearest-Neighbor Analysis, Thiessen polygons). This revealed a statistically significant, nonrandom, checkerboard-like distribution among individuals within the studied fossil deposit, indicative of active spacing regulation. Strikingly, the measured average interindividual spacing quantitatively relates to the length of the preserved setae. This provides the direct paleontological evidence demonstrating that these subtle morphological structures could have actively mediated spatial organization within a dense benthic community. Our findings illustrate a biological mechanism capable of shaping community structure, operating beyond passive environmental constraints or initial larval settlement preferences, and highlight the potential for subtle anatomical features to exert significant ecological influence in deep time.",

The causative gene TMEM63A encodes a mechanosensitive ion channel whose role in myelination is largely unexplored. Our study shows that TMEM63A is a major regulator of oligodendrocyte (OL)-dependent myelination in the CNS. In mouse and zebrafish, Tmem63a inactivation led to early deficits in myelination, recapitulating the HLD19 phenotype. OL-specific conditional mouse knockouts of Tmem63a exhibited transient reductions in myelin, indicating that TMEM63A regulates myelination cell-autonomously. We show that TMEM63A is present at the plasma membrane and on lysosomes and modulates myelin production in the presence of mechanical cues. Intriguingly, HLD19-associated TMEM63A variants from patients blocked trafficking to cell membrane. Together, our results reveal an ancient role for TMEM63A in fundamental aspects of myelination in vivo and highlight two exciting models for the development of treatments for devastating hypomyelinating leukodystrophies.",

          "abstract": "Most breast cancers depend on hormone-stimulated estrogen receptor alpha (ER) activity and are sensitive to ER inhibition. Resistance can arise from activating mutations in the gene encoding ER ( ESR1 ) or from reactivation of downstream targets. Newer ER antagonists occasionally show efficacy but are largely ineffective as single agents in the long term. Here, we show that ER translation is eIF4E/cap-independent yet sensitive to inhibitors of the translation initiation factor eIF4A. EIF4A inhibition reduces the expression of ER and cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1. This leads to growth suppression in ligand-independent breast cancer models, including those driven by ER mutants and fusion proteins. Efficacy is enhanced by adding the ER degrader, fulvestrant. The combination further lowers ER expression and blocks tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. In an early clinical trial (NCT04092673), the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin was combined with either fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus CDK4 inhibitor, abemaciclib, in patients with acquired resistance to these agents. Multiple clinical responses including a handful of durable regressions were observed, with little toxicity. Thus, eIF4A inhibition could be useful for treating ER+ breast cancer resistant to other modalities.",

          "abstract": "Emerging infectious diseases increasingly threaten many wildlife populations, yet the impacts of pathogens vary considerably both within and among host species. The environmental tolerance mismatch hypothesis (ETMH) suggests that this variability stems in part from differences in the relative performance of hosts and pathogens under varying environmental conditions. According to the ETMH, pathogen impacts should be more severe in environments where pathogen performance is high and host performance is low, and vice versa. However, testing the ETMH with field data is challenging due to the difficulty of measuring host and pathogen performance among locations and quantifying performance mismatches. Here, we demonstrate that a measure of thermal mismatch, based on species realized thermal niches derived from species occurrence data, can reliably predict variation in the prevalence of the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd—chytrid fungus) within and among 42 frog host species in Australia. Specifically, we show that 1) within species, more warm-adapted host species show a steeper decline in Bd prevalence with increasing mean annual temperature, potentially reflecting greater host advantage at warmer temperatures; and 2) among host species, mean pathogen prevalence declines as the thermal affinity of hosts diverges from that of the pathogen. Our findings strongly support the ETMH and, importantly, offer a promising approach to predicting pathogen outcomes both spatially and temporally using species occurrence data. This approach enhances our understanding of variability in pathogen impacts and could inform management actions to mitigate these effects.",

          "abstract": "Biota could be ecosystem engineers in generating an intrinsic heterogeneous landscape through scale-dependent feedbacks. Thereby, they can form resource-enriched patchiness or islands of fertility, comprising self-organizing spatial patterns. Research so far has largely focused on the self-organized spatial patterns of plant communities in drylands. It, however, remains unclear whether and how biocrusts having distinct morphology and life history from plant communities could self-organize themselves and form unique spatial patterns. Here, we conducted field observations of biocrusts across successional stages and employed a probabilistic cellular automaton model to investigate the distinct self-organized spatial patterns exhibited by mosaic patches of mosses and lichens with different patch size distributions (PSDs). Our study demonstrates that short-range positive feedbacks initially promote the development of patches, featured with a heavy-tailed PSD, while long-range negative feedbacks subsequently curtail further expansion of big patches, thereby establishing a characteristic patch scale with regular PSDs. Strikingly, only lichens reverted back to the heavy-tailed PSD in the late succession stage, presumably implying self-organized critical fragmentation of lichen patches. Field measurements of biocrust performance at the center and edge of patches of varying sizes along succession stages further support the classic scale-dependent feedback mechanism for Turing pattern formation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate the capability of the biocrust communities to self-organize themselves to form distinct spatial patterns governed by the spatial and temporal scale–dependent feedbacks, potentially impacting dryland ecosystem functions and resilience.",

How does the brain represent idiosyncratic differences in episodic future thinking that are modulated by optimism? In two functional MRI (fMRI) studies, participants were scanned during an episodic future thinking task in which they were presented with a series of episodic scenarios with different emotional valence and prompted to imagine themself (or their partner) in the situation. Intersubject representational similarity analysis revealed that more optimistic individuals had similar neural representations in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while less optimistic individuals exhibited more idiosyncratic neural representations in the MPFC. Additionally, individual difference multidimensional scaling of MPFC activity revealed that the referential target and emotional valence of imagined events were clearly mapped onto different dimensions. Notably, the weights along the emotional dimension were closely linked to the optimism scores of participants, suggesting that optimistic individuals imagine positive events as more distinct from negative events. These results suggest that shared neural processing of the MPFC among optimistic individuals supports episodic future thinking that facilitates psychological differentiation between positive and negative future events.",

          "abstract": "The self-assembly of intrinsically disordered proteins into biomolecular condensates depends on their primary sequence, leading to sequence-dependent phase separation. Computational methods to study this behavior often rely on residue-level interaction potentials that estimate the propensity of amino acids to partition between the dilute and dense phases. While distribution coefficients would provide the most direct measure of these potentials, their unavailability has led to the use of proxies, most notably, hydropathy. However, recent studies have highlighted limitations in hydropathy-based models. Here, we address this fundamental gap by calculating the transfer free energies for amino acid side chain analogs moving from the dilute phase to the dense phase of biomolecular condensates. We find that, net transfer free energies arise from a balance between favorable protein-mediated and unfavorable water-mediated interactions, with a striking asymmetry between the contributions of positive and negatively charged residues. This asymmetry originates from the stronger solvation of negatively charged species, and extends to modified amino acids. We further demonstrate that the sequence features of the condensate-forming protein modulate these transfer free energies in a context-dependent, but qualitatively similar manner. These findings help explain nontrivial experimental trends and provide a foundation for interpreting the sequence-dependent driving forces underlying condensate formation.",

However, the impact of land-use changes on the distribution of soil organisms remains poorly understood. In particular, we lack a mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors reshaping the distribution of soil microbiota in response to global biological homogenization. Here, we used metabarcoding to investigate the biogeography of protists and their relationships with prey and hosts in three human-dominated ecosystem types, i.e., farmlands, residential areas, and parks, along with natural forests, in subtropical and temperate climatic regions across China. We found that human land-use systems extended the distribution range of habitat-generalist protists compared to forests. This human-facilitated spread of protists was highly directional and mainly driven by temperate to subtropical range expansion of soil taxa. Put simply, increases in soil pH associated with human land uses mitigate the natural acidity barrier typically found in subtropical ecosystems, facilitating the temperate to subtropical range expansion of protist species. However, in temperate regions, the northward expansion of subtropical species is likely restricted by a more arid climate with even higher soil pH. The cross-region spread of soil protists was more pronounced in phagotrophs than phototrophs and parasites, reflecting codispersal of phagotroph protists and microbial prey (especially bacteria) related to tight predator–prey specialization and/or similar responses to environmental changes. Our findings indicate that land-use changes create hotspots of potential microbial invasions, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions, highlighting that understudied regions are likely to be strongly affected by biological homogenization related to introduction of exotic species.",

          "abstract": "The link between form and function of an organism’s morphology is usually apparent or intuitive. However, some clades of organisms show remarkable diversity in their form, often exhibiting extreme morphologies, but with no obvious functional explanation. Treehoppers (Membracidae) are a family of insects that exemplify this, displaying an astounding morphological diversity, resulting in a plethora of extreme forms. The function of these morphological extremities and the reasons for their evolution have thus far remained largely enigmatic. However, this mystery can be considered in light of the capacity of many animals to detect electric fields in air via electrostatic actuation of mechanosensory structures on their body. Importantly, the strength of the electric field experienced by these mechanosensory structures is expected by physics to depend on the animal’s geometry, with sharp and elongated features producing the highest electric fields. Therefore, we hypothesize that the extreme morphologies of treehoppers increase their electrical sensitivity. Here, we show that treehoppers, along with their predators and mutualists, produce electric fields and that the treehopper Poppea capricornis can detect electric fields, responding behaviorally. We also demonstrate that predatory wasps and mutualist bees differ significantly in their electrostatic profiles, pointing to the sophistication of electrical information potentially available to treehoppers. Biophysical, computational, and mathematical techniques are then utilized to provide evidence that the pronotum of treehoppers is the site of electroreception and that its extreme shapes may enhance its sensitivity to electricity.",

Much less is known about the extent to which these novel crops were consumed and incorporated into everyday culinary practices. In Japan, agriculturalists moving from Korea would have encountered large, sedentary Final Jomon populations who had well-established hunting, foraging, and cultivation strategies for exploiting indigenous fauna and flora. The degree to which these encounters hindered or enhanced the emergence of agriculture is a key question. To investigate potential changes in food exploitation, we analyzed the contents of pottery through lipid residue analysis of 260 vessels from Bronze Age (Mumun) Korea and contemporary Jomon and Yayoi pottery from Northern Kyushu. A lipid biomarker for broomcorn millet was only found in samples from Korea, suggesting that this crop was not routinely prepared in early agricultural pottery from Japan, despite some botanical evidence for its cultivation. Instead, aquatic products continued to be used in early agricultural pottery, pointing to continuity from the Jomon period despite the arrival of new “continental” ceramic forms. Rice remains difficult to identify conclusively, but by modeling carbon isotope values, we were able to determine the maximum extent that rice may have contributed. Overall, we show that there was a change in culinary practices as agriculture dispersed from Korea to Japan, most likely influenced by different long-standing traditions of preparing and cooking foods in each locality.",

          "abstract": "Aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), exhibits enhanced mechanical properties due to crystal defects such as twins, which are particularly prevalent in biogenic aragonite and can inhibit crack propagation. Despite the importance, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of aragonite {110} twins in marine organisms have remained poorly understood. Identifying a key inducer for {110} twins could help us understand how crystal defects are controlled in biomineralization. In this study, we explore the role of a protein, twip1, in inducing a high density of {110} twins within the aragonite layers of the limpet Cellana rota shell. Through a combination of layer-specific protein profiling and in vitro aragonite binding assays, twip1 is identified as a potential protein preferentially binding to the aragonite (110) plane. Gene expression analysis via quantitative PCR (qPCR) confirmed that twip1 is specifically expressed in the mantle tissue. To further investigate its function, recombinant twip1 (rtwip1) is produced using an Escherichia coli expression system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy observations reveal that rtwip1 significantly increases {110} twin density during in vitro aragonite synthesis. Moreover, in vivo knockdown shows that reducing twip1 expression results in abnormal shell growth and {110} twin boundary reduction. Enhancing the formation of {110} twins in aragonite can improve its toughness and elasticity. This research highlights the crucial role of specific proteins in regulating crystal defect formation, offering a promising direction for future biomineralization studies and advanced material design.",

          "abstract": "Removal of dead and damaged cells is critical for organismal health. Under stress conditions such as nutritional deprivation, infection, or temperature shift, the clearance of nonessential cells becomes a universal strategy to conserve energy and maintain tissue homeostasis. Typically, this task is performed by professional phagocytes such as macrophages. However, nonprofessional phagocytes (NPPs) can also adopt a phagocytic fate under specific circumstances. Similar to professional phagocytes, NPPs undergo transitions from immature to mature states and activation, but the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms governing their maturation, induction, and phagocytic execution remain largely unknown. A notable example of stress-induced phagocytosis is the removal of germline cells by follicle cell–derived NPPs during oogenesis in Drosophila . In this study, we report that the transformation of follicle cells (FCs) into NPPs is dependent on Notch signaling activation during mid-oogenesis. Moreover, Notch overactivation is sufficient to trigger germline cell death and clearance (GDAC). We further show that polyploidy, driven by Notch signaling-induced endoreplication, is essential for the transformation of FCs into NPPs. Polyploidy facilitates the activation of JNK signaling, which is crucial for the phagocytic behavior of these cells. Additionally, we show that polyploidy in epidermal cells, another type of NPPs, is important for their engulfment of dendrites during induced degeneration. Together, these findings suggest that polyploidy is a critical factor in the transformation of epithelial cells into NPPs, enabling their phagocytic functions, which are essential for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis during stress conditions.",

Analyses of human EEG data revealed forward- and backward-propagating traveling waves linking visual and motor brain areas around the time of a memory-guided behavior. These waves predicted intra- and interindividual differences in task performance, could not be explained by eye movements or passive volume conduction, and were absent when participants planned but could not execute a memory-guided behavior.

          "abstract": "Since their discoveries in the 1960s as a family of proteins produced by cells in response to stress, molecular chaperones are increasingly recognized as major regulators of cellular homeostasis in health and disease. Among the heat shock protein 70 family, the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), also referred to as BiP and encoded by the HSPA5 gene, contains a signal peptide targeting it into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Through its interaction with the transmembrane ER stress sensors, GRP78 acts as a master regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) which allows cells to adapt to stress observed in many human diseases. The discovery that ER stress not only upregulates GRP78 to cope with ER protein quality control but also actively promotes its relocation to other cellular compartments where they vastly expand its functional repertoire beyond the ER represents a paradigm shift. This Perspective describes the origin and linkage of GRP78 to the UPR and the mechanisms whereby ER stress actively promotes export of GRP78 from the ER, as exemplified by its translocation to the cell surface where it acts as a multifaceted receptor and a conduit for drug and viral entry, as well as its translocation into the nucleus, where it assumes the surprising role of a transcriptional regulator whereby reprogramming the cell’s transcriptome. Furthermore, this Perspective addresses how these and other atypical localizations of GRP78 impact human disease, with emphasis on cancer and COVID-19, and the exciting prospect that drugs targeting GRP78 could dually suppress tumorigenesis and viral infections.",

          "abstract": "Guard cells, which regulate stomatal apertures in plants, possess a sophisticated mechanism for regulating turgor pressure. The outward-rectifying “K + out ” channel GORK, expressed in guard cells of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana , is a central component that promotes stomatal closure by releasing K + to the extracellular space, thereby lowering turgor pressure. To date, the structural basis underlying the regulation of the K + transport activity of GORK is unclear. Using cryo-EM, we determined the structures of the GORK outward-rectifying K + channel with a resolution of 3.16 to 3.27 Å in five distinct conformations that differ significantly in their C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) and ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain. The C-linker connects the transmembrane domains to the C-terminal domains, i.e., CNBD, CNBD–Ankyrin bridge, and ANK. The structural changes and interactions in the C-linker determine whether the closed state of GORK is closer to the preopen state or in a more removed state from the open state of the channel. In particular, interconversion in the short sequence within the CNBD–Ankyrin bridge plays a decisive role in this determination. This region forms an α-helix in the preopened state, while it adopts a nonhelical structure in further distant closed states. The dynamics of the cytosolic region strongly suggest that the K + channel activity of GORK is regulated by cytosolic signaling factors during stomatal closure.",

          "abstract": "Ras has traditionally been regarded as a positive regulator and therapeutic target due to its role in cell proliferation, but recent findings indicate a more nuanced role in cell migration, where suppressed Ras activity can unexpectedly promote migration. To clarify this complexity, we systematically modulate Ras activity using various RasGEF and RasGAP proteins and assess their effects on migration dynamics. Leveraging optogenetics, we assess the immediate, nontranscriptional effects of Ras signaling on migration. Local RasGEF recruitment to the plasma membrane induces protrusions and new fronts to effectively guide migration, even in the absence of GPCR/G-protein signaling, whereas global recruitment causes immediate cell spreading halting cell migration. Local RasGAP recruitment suppresses protrusions, generates new backs, and repels cells, whereas global relocation either eliminates all protrusions to inhibit migration or preserves a single protrusion to maintain polarity. Consistent local and global increases or decreases in signal transduction and cytoskeletal activities accompany these morphological changes. Additionally, we performed cortical tension measurements and found that Ras activity is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors generally increase cortical tension while Ras activity is regulated by GTPase-activating proteins decrease it. Our results reveal a biphasic relationship between Ras activity and cellular dynamics, reinforcing our previous findings that optimal Ras activity and cortical tension are critical for efficient migration.",

Using electroencephalography (EEG), we characterized the brain’s response to critical in-game events, focusing on the response magnitude and adaptation. Data from a large participant cohort (n = 140 for game tasks, n = 200 for nongame tasks) revealed a clear, definite, and consistent temporospatial structure of brain response patterns triggered by critical in-game events. Most notably, this response displayed unusually large magnitudes and a lack of adaptation over repeated exposures—markedly different from the observed neural responses to typical events in lab-based tasks (e.g., regarding novelty, unexpected events or errors). The identification of this distinctive response component in gaming contexts may inspire further research into fundamental cognitive systems, such as motivation, reward, emotional engagement, and their dynamic interplay in gaming environments.",

          "authors": "James B. Dewey",
          "abstract": "Mammalian hearing sensitivity depends on the amplification of sound-induced cochlear vibrations by outer hair cells (OHCs). OHCs transduce deflections of their stereociliary bundles into receptor potentials that drive changes in cell length. While fast, phasic OHC length changes are thought to generate the forces that underlie cochlear amplification, OHCs also exhibit large tonic length changes in response to sound. These tonic length changes could theoretically arise from asymmetries in the mechanotransduction process that lead to tonic changes in membrane potential, though their exact origins and functional significance are uncertain. Here, in vivo cochlear vibration measurements reveal that sound can elicit tonic OHC motility in mice with stereociliary defects that eliminate cochlear amplification and presumably impair mechanotransduction. Tonic OHC motility in impaired mice was physiologically vulnerable but only weakly correlated with any residual phasic motility, suggesting a possible dissociation between the underlying mechanisms. Nevertheless, a simple model demonstrates how realistic changes to the OHC mechanotransducer function in impaired mice can lead to small but strongly asymmetric receptor potentials, producing sizable tonic length changes in the absence of any detectable phasic motility. Tonic OHC motility is therefore not a unique feature of sensitive ears and is the dominant active mechanical response in ears with certain types of deafness. Whether such tonic responses play a functional role in the normal or impaired cochlea remains to be determined.",

Theoretical models of such “chemically driven fluids” typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction–diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here, we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, enzymatic sensors have been vital in healthcare and environmental monitoring due to their high selectivity. Traditionally, their performance is interpreted using the Michaelis–Menten (MM) equation, which assumes idealized, homogeneous, well-mixed laboratory conditions. However, integrating these sensors with microneedle (MN) patches for wearable applications introduces challenges such as spatial and temporal variations and limited reactant availability. Applying the MM model in such scenarios can lead to dramatic errors in enzyme kinetics and biomarker estimates, risking inaccurate substrate measurements and potentially life-threatening decisions. Here, we generalize the reaction–diffusion framework for enzymatic sensors and integrate it with analytical models for MN sensors. Our approach captures time-dependent MM variables, quantifies the rate of product formation, accounts for mass transport limitations, and provides expressions for response time and active substrate levels. This physics-based framework enables a) quantification of otherwise inaccessible parameters such as active substrate levels, b) accurate response-time predictions to reach steady-state conditions, c) improved data interpretation, and d) projection of enzymatic responses across various conditions. The study highlights the need for careful application of MM model in wearable microneedle sensors, where key assumptions may not hold. Our model can also extend to sensor degradation, inactivation, and hypoxia, making it broadly applicable to enzymatic sensors in diverse environments.",

          "abstract": "Polyphenic traits in animals often exhibit nonlinear scaling with body size. Static allometries (i.e., scaling relationships) themselves can exhibit plasticity, such that individuals of the same size and genotype differ in body proportions across different environments. In ants, both larval environment and genotype regulate the expression of caste-associated traits, including body size and ovariole number. However, it remains untested whether caste-associated traits are independently regulated by environmental variables or whether they covary due to coupled developmental mechanisms. If caste traits are regulated independently, developmental plasticity should affect both trait expression and the scaling relationships between traits. Using the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi , we tested this by manipulating the rearing environment of genetically identical larvae. We found that caregiver genotype, temperature, and food quantity influenced caste morphology strictly in tandem with body size, producing similar static allometries across rearing conditions (i.e., no allometric plasticity was detected). In contrast, clonal genotypes differed in average body size and their static allometries. Thus, size-matched individuals of the same genotype from different rearing environments exhibited no differences in mean caste trait expression, while those of different genotypes did. This absence of plasticity in the static allometries of different caste traits suggests that they are developmentally coupled due to systemic regulatory factors. Our findings contrast with reports of allometric plasticity in other insects, suggesting that ant caste traits are exceptionally integrated and therefore constrained in their independent responses to environmental variation. We discuss how these results inform contemporary hypotheses for ant caste development and evolution.",

Beyond its role in DNA repair, OGG1 has been shown to promote transcriptional activation of proinflammatory mediators and contribute to both acute and chronic lung inflammation. However, pioneering studies have shown an anti-inflammation role for OGG1 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but its underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we unveiled that OGG1 plays an important role in the differentiation of inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs). Binding of OGG1 to 8-oxoG facilitated the recruitment of Smad3 to the Foxp3 promoter, leading to the transcriptional activation. Moreover, OGG1 binding promoted demethylation of CpG sites in the conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2) region of Foxp3 by decreasing Dnmt1 occupancy and enhancing recruitment of Tet1/2. Notably, the S326C variant—a naturally occurring polymorphism in humans—was more effective than the wild-type protein in promoting iTreg differentiation and showed a negative correlation with IBD incidence. Furthermore, treatment with O8, a selective OGG1 inhibitor that blocks base excision activity without affecting substrate binding, significantly alleviated IBD in a mouse model, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy. Together, these findings extend the understanding of OGG1’s epigenetic role in transcriptional regulation and highlight its protective function in inflammatory diseases, potentially shaped by aerobic evolution.",

Here, we report the growth of spontaneously bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals induced by the keto–enol tautomerism of the urate molecule. The major tautomer is native to biogenic crystals, whereas the minor tautomer functions as an effective crystal growth modifier to induce naturally bent and twisted ammonium urate crystals. We show that the degree of curvature can be tailored based on the judicious selection of growth conditions. A combination of state-of-the-art microscopy and spectroscopy techniques are used to characterize the origin of bending. Spatially resolved nano-electron diffraction and high-resolution electron microscopy of naturally bent crystals show nearly single crystallinity with local lattice deformations generated by a combination of screw and edge dislocations. These observations are consistent with photoinduced force microscopy and contact resonance atomic force microscopy, which confirmed spatially resolved changes in the intermolecular interactions and the mechanical properties throughout the cross-sectional and axial regions of bent crystals. A mechanism of bending involving the generation of regionally specific dislocations is proposed as an alternative to more commonly reported models.

Within these communities, polymer degraders facilitate the growth of nondegraders by breaking down polymers through extracellular enzymes. However, the contributions of nondegraders to community dynamics, as well as the mechanisms that limit their access to degradation products, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate EMSD5, a lignocellulose-degrading microbial community that efficiently converts corncob into isopropanol. We demonstrate that nondegraders, such as Escherichia coli , enable the growth of degraders (e.g., Lachnoclostridium sp. and Clostridium beijerinckii ) by creating anaerobic conditions and supplying biotin. Within such expanded niches, lignocellulose degradation proceeds sequentially, and the availability of breakdown products to E . coli is constrained by two interlinked processes. Specifically, Lachnoclostridium sp. produces oligosaccharides that are largely inaccessible to E . coli . A subset of these oligosaccharides is utilized by C . beijerinckii to produce monosaccharides that support E . coli growth, while glycosidase secretion by C . beijerinckii is reduced under coculture conditions. Building on these findings, we designed a synthetic consortium by coculturing C. beijerinckii with an engineered E . coli strain that expresses xylanase genes from an unculturable Lachnoclostridium . This consortium achieved isopropanol production from hemicellulose without requiring anaerobic conditions. Our findings reveal the niche-expanding role of nondegraders and the processes that constrain their access to degradation products, offering insights into maintaining stable cooperation in biopolymer-degrading communities and designing efficient consortia for biopolymer conversion.",

Loss of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 during dentate gyrus development leads to increased astrocyte production at the expense of aNSCs and ultimately constraining neurogenesis. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals a specific metabolic alteration following Setdb1 loss, notably implicating the cytochrome c oxidase, subunit 6b2 ( Cox6b2 )—a component of the mitochondrial complex—as a key target of SETDB1. COX6B2 modulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to control aNSC fate over astrocyte differentiation. Elevated Cox6b2 levels promote astrocyte fate during dentate gyrus development.

These enzymes oxidize aldehydes to the corresponding acids while reducing the redox protein ferredoxin. They have been structurally characterized mainly using WORs from hyperthermophilic archaea. The WORs of some bacteria contain three additional subunits of the BfuABC family and these chimeric WorABCSL enzymes catalyze an electron-bifurcating reaction in which aldehyde oxidation is coupled to the simultaneous reduction of ferredoxin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. In human gut microbes, electron bifurcation by WorABSL is proposed to enable the detoxification of aldehydes generated from cooked foods and in the tungstocentric production of beneficial short chain fatty acids from lactate, potentially impacting health.

          "abstract": "Plant bodies are built from immobile cells, making the regulation of cell expansion essential for growth, development, and adaptation. In roots, cell elongation executes the movement of the root tips through the soil. This process is tightly controlled by numerous signaling pathways. Among these, gibberellin and auxin signaling stand out for their contrasting effects on root growth, interacting through complex cross talk at multiple regulatory levels. Here, we reveal the molecular basis of the auxin–gibberellin cross talk in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . We show that the auxin signaling pathway steers the expression of GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASES (GA2OXs) , key gibberellin-deactivating enzymes in the root elongation zone (EZ). GA2OXs are negative regulators of root cell elongation; GA2OX8 overexpression decreases gibberellin levels and inhibits root cell elongation; in contrast, the ga2ox heptuple mutant roots show elevated gibberellin levels in the EZ and grow longer roots. Intriguingly, shoot-derived auxin can regulate GA2OX6 and GA2OX8 expression in roots, linking systemic auxin signaling to local gibberellin level modulation. Together, our findings identify GA2OX6 and GA2OX8 enzymes as key mediators of auxin–gibberellin cross talk, providing insights into their roles in root elongation. These results expand our understanding of how auxin integrates with gibberellin signaling to coordinate root development and growth dynamics.",

By mixing these components at cryogenic temperatures, we can observe distinct shifts in vibrational modes using Raman spectroscopy. Our computational predictions confirm that cocrystal structures of HCN and ethane, which match our experimental vibrational shifts closely, are thermodynamically and kinetically stable. Given that methane, ethane, and HCN are major components of the atmosphere and surface of Saturn’s moon Titan—where they play key roles in shaping chemistry, weather, and landscape—our findings may prove instrumental for explaining Titan’s chemical and geological evolution.",

Rodent models of Angelman syndrome do not fully recapitulate all the symptoms associated with the condition and are limited as a preclinical model for therapeutic development. Here, we show that pigs ( Sus scrofa ) with a maternally inherited deletion of UBE3A ( UBE3A -/+ ) have altered postnatal behaviors, impaired vocalizations, reduced brain growth, motor incoordination, and ataxia. Neonatal UBE3A -/+ pigs exhibited several symptoms observed in infants with Angelman syndrome, including hypotonia, suckling deficits, and failure to thrive.

          "abstract": "Global forests provide key ecosystem services, from climate regulation to biodiversity habitat, but are under increasing pressure from the combined impacts of climate and land use change. Here, we show that forest disturbance due to fire is growing globally, with the most dramatic increases in intact forest landscapes, highlighting an existential threat to remaining high biomass, high biodiversity forests. The global annual area of forest disturbance due to fire for 2023 and 2024 was highest since the beginning of monitoring in 2001. Compared to 2002–2022 average annual forest disturbance due to fire, the 2023–2024 average was 2.2 times higher globally and 3 times higher in the Tropics. More than ¼ of all 2024 forest disturbance from fire occurred in tropical forests. We found a statistically significant increasing trend of forest disturbance due to fire from 2002 to 2024 in all climate domains except Subtropical. High forest, low deforestation tropical countries were not exempt, with Guyana and the Republic of the Congo experiencing record forest disturbance due to fire. Our results agree with recently estimated increases in global forest fire emissions and active fire detections. The unprecedented scale of fires in the world’s most remote forests is a potential harbinger of ecosystem tipping points. Protecting these remaining unfragmented high conservation value forests from this threat poses a daunting and as yet undeveloped policy and capacity challenge.",

We analyzed T cm CD8 + T cells specific for HLA-A*02:01-M1 58–66 (A2/M1 58 ; a prominent influenza epitope) in newborns, children, adults, and older adults directly ex vivo. Our data provide evidence that epitope-specific T cm CD8 + pools dominate influenza-specific memory A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cell responses from the early childhood until old age. T cm gene signatures were largely maintained across the age groups, although self-renewal genes defined T cm pools in children, while older adult T cm A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cells displayed detoxication and stress profiles. TCRαβ diversity within T cm A2/M1 58 + CD8 + T cell pools was greater in children and older adults, when compared to adults. The key public-associated TCRαβ clonotypes largely persisted across the human lifespan, although their highest frequency was detected in adults, reflecting lower TCRαβ diversity in this group. Older adults displayed increased TCRαβ heterogeneity, underpinned by large TCRαβ clonotype expansions of private TCRαβ clonotypes. Our study highlights the importance of largely preserved virus-specific T cm pools across the human lifespan and advocates for boosting persistent TCRαβ clonotypes within this key peripheral blood subset.",

However, these studies rarely include cartilaginous fishes, which diverged from the other vertebrates 450 Mya, hindering the comprehensive view of vertebrate sex determination. Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerated Y chromosome harboring no detectable male-specific genes. Orthologs of documented sex-determining genes were identified, but not on these sex chromosomes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expression of X-linked genes—including those implicated in the TGF-β and IGF signaling pathways—attributed to incomplete dosage compensation. Our findings indicate that sharks and rays share the oldest sex chromosomes among vertebrates that originated around 300 Mya and the dosage-dependent sex determination mechanism composed of distinct molecules from other vertebrates. This study highlights the antiquity of sex chromosomes and the uniqueness of sex determination mechanisms in sharks and rays, which advances our understanding of evolutionary plasticity in vertebrate sex determination.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit a remarkable resilience to cytotoxic stress, often adapting through transcriptional changes linked to alterations in chromatin structure. In several types of cancer, these adaptations involve epigenetic modifications and restructuring of topologically associating domains. However, the underlying principles by which chromatin architecture facilitates such adaptability across different cancers remain poorly understood. To investigate the role of chromatin in this process, we developed a physics-based model that connects chromatin organization to cell fate decisions, such as survival following chemotherapy. Our model builds on the observation that chromatin forms packing domains, which influence transcriptional activity through macromolecular crowding. The model accurately predicts chemoevasion in vitro, suggesting that changes in packing domains affect the likelihood of survival. Consistent results across diverse cancer types indicate that the model captures fundamental principles of chromatin-mediated adaptation, independent of the specific cancer or chemotherapy mechanisms involved. Based on these insights, we hypothesized that compounds capable of modulating packing domains, termed Transcriptional Plasticity Regulators (TPRs), could prevent cellular adaptation to chemotherapy. We conducted a proof-of-concept compound screen using live-cell chromatin imaging to identify several TPRs that synergistically enhanced chemotherapy-induced cell death. The most effective TPR significantly improved therapeutic outcomes in a patient-derived xenograft model of ovarian cancer. These findings underscore the central role of chromatin in cellular adaptation to cytotoxic stress and present a framework for enhancing cancer therapies, with broad potential across multiple cancer types.",

          "abstract": "Online political debate is frequently lamented for being toxic, partisan, and counterproductive. However, we know little about how core elements of political debate (justification, tone, willingness to compromise, and partisanship) affect its quality. Using text-based treatments experimentally manipulated with a large language model, we test how these elements causally affect the quality of open-text responses about issues important to the US and UK public. We find substantial evidence that differences in justification, tone, and willingness to compromise, but not partisanship, affect the quality of subsequent discourse. Combined, these elements increase the probability of high-quality responses by roughly 1.6 to 2 times and substantially increase openness to alternative viewpoints. Despite the ability to bring about substantial changes in discourse quality, we find no evidence of changes in political attitudes themselves. Our findings demonstrate how adapting approaches to online debate can foster healthy democratic interactions but have less influence on changing minds.",

Here, we demonstrate that vibrant plumage in the tanager genus Tangara is substantially intensified by a “hidden” layer of achromatic (white or black) plumage concealed beneath the outermost colorful layer. Using hyperspectral imaging, multispectral photography, microspectrophotometry, reflectance spectrophotometry, and optical modeling, we show that hidden white and black feather layers are systematically distributed on the body to enhance the brightness and saturation of carotenoid-pigmented and structurally colored plumage, respectively, by increasing or decreasing the amount of backscattered light that interacts with pigments or nanostructures. We compare male and female coloration and show that sexual dichromatism in some Tangara carotenoid plumage stems primarily from white layers in males and black layers in females rather than from differences in carotenoid pigmentation. Last, we find that white and black hidden feather layers are widespread in colorful passerines. Hidden feather layers likely play a previously overlooked but critical role in colorful plumage evolution in birds.",

Biotreatment depolymerizes the lignin and softens the cell wall. Then, Bio-Strong-Wood components are linked via a strong network of hydrogen and covalent bonds through the mechanochemical treatment.

Unlike rigid, fused sulfone moieties, our flexible SS improves interfacial water contact and charge transport. P-2SO 2 , with sulfone-functionalized SS, represents a 237% improvement over the control polymer, PBDTTSO. In addition, P-2SO 2 demonstrated an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate of 1060.1 micromoles per hour and an apparent quantum yield of 32.4% (460 nanometers). Molecular dynamics simulations indicate SS improves hydrophilicity and water/polymer interface while promoting a hairpin-like conformation that increases intrachain π-π stacking for better charge hopping. Transient absorption spectroscopy shows sulfone-functionalized SS enhances electron transfer to platinum cocatalysts, increases active site density, and reduces exciton migration lengths through stronger polymer/platinum interactions.",

Here, we developed a targeted biomimetic drug delivery system, TP-siRC@tHyNPs, by fusing exosomes derived from engineered cells overexpressing DR5 single-chain variable fragments (DR5-Exo) with liposomes coencapsulating triptolide (TP) and CYP3A4-siRNA (TP-siRC@Lip). DR5-Exo facilitated the targeted delivery of drug to tumor cells through DR5 receptor recognition and simultaneously activated apoptotic pathways. Moreover, CYP3A4-siRNA effectively prolonged the half-life of TP, thereby enhancing its antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that TP-siRC@tHyNPs induced immunogenic cell death, reprogrammed macrophage polarization, arrested cell cycle progression, and triggered apoptotic pathways. In vivo experiments demonstrated that TP-siRC@tHyNPs specifically accumulated in lung tissue, notably inhibiting the growth of PMM while exhibiting negligible toxicity in tumor-bearing mice. Overall, this study provides a promising strategy for targeting PMM treatment, improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity.",

In solid-state NMR (SSNMR), resolution is primarily constrained by instrumentation rather than molecular tumbling, making it well suited for studying large and complex systems. To fully leverage UHF magnets for SSNMR, it is essential to eliminate line broadening arising from magnetic field drift and couplings among the nuclear spins. We address these challenges using external 2 H lock to compensate for the field drift and long-observation-window band-selective homonuclear decoupling to suppress 13 C homonuclear couplings. We achieve better than 0.2–parts per million resolution in proteins up to 144 kilodalton, enabling unique site resolution for more than 500 amide backbone pairs in two-dimensional experiments.

          "abstract": "Multienergy x-ray imaging can provide additional substance information beyond morphology in conventional energy-integration imaging. The predominant approach, single photon counting, sets stringent requirements on low x-ray flux and signal discrimination and prolongs imaging time. Here, we report on the design of unipolar n-i-n perovskite detectors for multienergy x-ray imaging. Systematic characterization validates electrons dominating carrier dynamics in detectors, and the distribution of generated electrons varies as x-ray energy along its penetrating direction, whereas working voltage can manipulate electron drift length, ensuring their selective collection for x-ray energy discrimination. Our multienergy imaging array adopts high-flux x-ray in a normal imaging system and realizes fast 4-energy-bins x-ray images. By introducing the σ( E i )/σ( E j )-related multienergy digital subtraction algorithm, the images successfully distinguish the substance of targets side by side or by stacking, representing a notable advancement over conventional energy-integration imaging technique.",

Here, we investigated the extent to which individual neurophysiological properties are genetically determined and how these adult traits align with cortical gene expression patterns across development. Using task-free magnetoencephalography in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, as well as unrelated individuals, we found that neurophysiological traits were significantly more similar between monozygotic twins, indicating a genetic influence, although individual-specific variability remained predominant. These heritable brain dynamics were mainly associated with genes involved in neurotransmission, expressed along a topographical gradient that mirrors psychological functions, including attention, planning, and emotional processes. Furthermore, the cortical expression patterns of genes associated with individual differentiation aligned most strongly with gene expression profiles observed during adulthood in previously published longitudinal datasets.

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising therapy for PDAC; however, its clinical efficacy is limited by a high recurrence rate. Here, using a preclinical PDAC model, we characterized the tumor immune microenvironment following insufficient IRE (iIRE) through single-cell RNA sequencing. We found that iIRE induces a CCR2 + tumor-associated macrophage (CCR2 + TAM)–mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment in residual tumors. Consequently, we developed a macrophage-based proteolipid vesicle (mPLV) coencapsulating the CCR2 antagonist PF-4136309 (PF) and gemcitabine (GEM), named PF/GEM@mPLV. Our findings suggest that PF/GEM@mPLV achieves high drug accumulation within tumors through iIRE-induced inflammation. Reduction of CCR2 + TAMs enhances antitumor immunity and improves chemotherapeutic response. PF/GEM@mPLV markedly inhibits tumor recurrence following iIRE, diminishes hepatic metastases, and prolongs survival in preclinical PDAC models. These findings uncover the role of CCR2 + TAMs in iIRE-induced immunosuppression, offering a promising strategy to enhance the clinical potential of IRE in PDAC.",

          "abstract": "Human-induced global change may cause the sixth mass extinction of species. The moderate success of patch-scale biodiversity conservation measures has led to the concept of creating biodiversity-friendly landscapes. However, these landscapes potentially present a paradox: They may increase local biodiversity and thereby strengthen biotic resistance of native communities to global change winners, i.e., species that thrive under global change, such as invasive alien species or temperature- or nutrient-tolerant species. However, they may also improve landscape-scale habitat conditions, such as habitat connectivity, which facilitates the dispersal of global change winners, thereby accelerating biodiversity loss. Despite increasing investment in biodiversity-friendly landscapes, this paradox and underlying processes remain largely unquantified. We analyzed 2050 repeated, systematic vegetation surveys across the Swiss farmland and found the hypothesized facilitating and inhibitory effects on global change winners, but, overall, the inhibitory effects were stronger. This supports the call for a shift from patch-scale conservation to landscape-wide strategies to stop the ongoing decline of farmland biodiversity.",

The Q factor exhibits an inverse-square dependence on perturbation strength, consistent with the behavior of quasi-bound states in the continuum. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate chiral modes with high circular dichroism, large separation angles, and high- Q factors. We further couple 2D excitons to these resonant modes, achieving spatially separated chiral emission.

Upon swelling, the initially straight hydrogel cylinder undergoes a selective shape transformation into a soft, cupped pad that deforms to stretch and spread upon contact, enabling effective adhesion to target surfaces. During detachment, a vacuum is formed within the tube, leading to strong underwater adhesion. The artificial tube feet show high adhesion hysteresis, autonomous release by external stimuli, and immediate detachment by pneumatic actuation with integrated system.

The ventral pallidum (VP) is central to drug addiction, and its glutamatergic neurons (VP Glu ), whose activation drives aversion, inhibit drug seeking. However, it remains unknown whether these neurons encode the abstinence from and relapse to drugs. We show here that VP Glu projections specifically to the aversion-related lateral habenula (LHb) and ventral tegmental area gabaergic (VTA GABA ) neurons show plasticity induced by abstinence from and reexposure to cocaine or cocaine cues. Both these pathways potentiate during abstinence and restore baseline values upon drug reexposure but with different plasticity mechanisms. Last, inhibiting the VP Glu → LHb pathway enhances cocaine preference after abstinence, while inhibiting the VP Glu → VTA pathway shows variable effects. These findings establish an aversive circuit orchestrated by VP Glu neurons encoding long-term abstinence-driven changes that may contribute to drug relapse.",

Using hybridization-proximity labeling proteomics, we show that the FUSint6&amp;7-RNA condensates are enriched for splicing factors and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader YTHDC1. These ribonucleoprotein structures facilitate posttranscriptional FUS splicing and depend on m6A/YTHDC1 for integrity. In cells expressing mutant FUS, FUSint6&amp;7-RNAs become hypermethylated, which in turn stimulates their condensation and splicing. We further show that FUS protein is repelled by m6A. Thus, ALS-FUS mutations may cause abnormal activation of FUS posttranscriptional splicing through altered RNA methylation. Notably, ectopic expression of FUS intron 7 sequences dissolves endogenous FUSint6&amp;7-RNA condensates, down-regulating FUS mRNA and protein.

In particular, we characterize a population of neuropeptide Y (NPY)–expressing neurons surrounding LC noradrenergic cells. We show that this peri-LC NPY population exerts neuromodulatory inhibitory control over the LC via NPY-Y1R signaling. Under naïve conditions, this results in bidirectional control of anxiety-like behaviors. Stressful experiences recruit peri-LC NPY neurons, leading to local NPY release in vivo, whereas enhanced peri-LC NPY neuronal activity curbs anxiety after stress.

However, these assemblages do not typically capture the well-oxygenated, resource-rich environments sustaining most metazoan diversity in modern marine systems. We describe exceptionally preserved and articulated carbonaceous mesofossils from the middle Cambrian (~507 to 502 million years) Bright Angel Formation of the Grand Canyon (Arizona, USA). This biota preserves probable algal and cyanobacterial photosynthesizers together with a range of functionally sophisticated metazoan consumers: suspension-feeding crustaceans, substrate-scraping molluscs, and morphologically exotic priapulids with complex filament-bearing teeth, convergent on modern microphagous forms. The Grand Canyon’s extensive ichnofossil and sedimentological records show that these phylogenetically and functionally derived taxa occupied highly habitable shallow-marine environments, sustaining higher levels of benthic activity than broadly coeval macrofossil Konservat-Lagerstätten. These data suggest that evolutionary escalation in resource-rich Cambrian shelf settings was an important driver of the assembly of later Phanerozoic ecologies.",

          "abstract": "To gain insights into neural mechanisms enabling behavioral adaptations to complex and multidimensional environmental dynamics, we examined roles of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)–expressing neurons in mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in probabilistic reversal learning. Behaviorally, manipulating VIP neuronal activity left probabilistic classical conditioning unaffected but severely impaired reversal learning. Physiologically, conditioned cue-associated VIP neuronal responses changed abruptly after encountering an unexpected reward. They also conveyed strong reward prediction error signals during behavioral reversal, but not before or after, unlike pyramidal neurons that consistently conveyed error signals throughout all phases. Furthermore, the signal’s persistence across trials correlated with reversal learning duration. These results suggest that mPFC VIP neurons play crucial roles in rapid reversal learning, but not in gradual value updating under stable probabilistic contingencies, by monitoring salient deviations from ongoing environmental contingencies and imposing error-correction signals during behavioral adjustments. These findings shed light on the intricate cortical circuit dynamics underpinning behavioral flexibility in complex, multifaceted environments.",

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that increased solvent uptake elongates the spheres, raising interfacial energy and causing sphere splitting. The additional layers generated from the sphere splitting present a nonconventional lattice, typically not observed in thin films. Using these structures, we fabricate bimetallic nanodot arrays, where two different metal components are positioned alternatingly.

Our findings uncovered significant heterogeneity in glioma invasiveness, vasculature, and compensatory angiogenesis while precisely delineating NP distribution throughout the tumor.

This splitting rapidly transports surface waters to depth, with sustained vertical velocities of 60 meters per day, primarily from the center of the eddy where carbon concentrations are largest, facilitating efficient transfer of phytoplankton carbon to depth, below the well-mixed, sunlit surface layer. We reproduce the splitting process in an idealized ocean model and find that splitting is controlled by the initial elliptical eddy shape, size, and intensity.

Our analysis revealed extensive transcriptional alterations across retinal cell types with aging. HP experiments demonstrated that systemic factors from young mice rejuvenated aged retinas and alleviated senescent phenotypes, while aged blood accelerated aging in young mice. Integrative analysis pinpointed adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and the downstream adenosine 5′-monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway as central to the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal rejuvenation. Treatment with the AdipoR1 agonist AdipoRon reversed retinal aging. Mechanistically, AdipoR1-AMPK activation promoted mitochondrial function, contributing to the restoration of youthful cellular phenotypes. Together, our study identifies AdipoR1 as a therapeutic target for retinal aging and provides insights into the molecular programs driving retinal rejuvenation.",

Our findings suggest strong genetic influence on several traits, particularly B cell abundance. In contrast, cytokine responses from in vitro stimulations appeared mainly shaped by environmental exposures. Regarding associations with atopy, greater abundance of both B cells and basophils were observed in atopic individuals as well as increased expression of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor. Genetic influence appeared central to regulating IgE receptor expression on basophils, whereas expression on dendritic cells instead appeared sensitive to environmental exposures.

We find that within a range of anchor stiffnesses around 1 micronewton per micrometer, the homeostatic tension in muscle is insensitive to stiffness, offering greater design flexibility. The proximity of motor neurons results in a fourfold improvement in muscle contractility. Improved contractility and nonlinear design allow for a peak swimming speed about two orders of magnitude higher than previous biohybrid flagellate swimmers, reaching 0.58 body lengths per minute (86.8 micrometers per second), by a mechanism involving inertia that we verify through flow field imaging.

This screen revealed a notable synthetic lethality when MYC inhibition was paired with disruption of mitochondrial complex I components, but not other complexes. Mechanistically, MYC inhibition reduced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, triggering a compensatory up-regulation of complex I genes. Consequently, genetic or pharmacological targeting of complex I sensitized tumors to MYCi975 treatment, leading to increased purine catabolism and infiltration of CD8 + T cells and macrophages into tumors. Additionally, a wide range of tumor cells with lower complex I expression showed increased MYC dependency.

We demonstrated that a Notch signaling center is required for the formation of this novelty and identified enhancers of the ligand Delta , which allowed us to track the evolutionary history of this signaling center. Unexpectedly, we found that the posterior lobe signaling center emerged from a preexisting role in genital disc eversion. We provide a likely mechanism by which Delta contributes to genital eversion through a network of apical extracellular matrix, which also became integrated into the posterior lobe program.

NRBP1 pseudokinase is closely related to WNK isoforms and contains a RΦ-motif–binding conserved C-terminal (CCT) domain, like the CCT domains in WNKs, SPAK, and OXSR1. Knockdown or knockout of NRBP1 markedly inhibited basal as well as sorbitol-induced activation of WNK1 and downstream components.

Ti-mitoEVs that contain abundant functional mitochondria can be highly efficiently isolated from muscles via an optimized method. In vitro, Ti-mitoEV treatment increased mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced mitochondrial damage in recipient cells, and these effects occurred at least partly via mitochondrial genome transfer. In vivo, Ti-mitoEV treatment attenuated diverse types of tissue injury (e.g., muscle and kidney) by rescuing mitochondrial injury and its associated inflammation. As natural nanovesicles, the therapeutic potency of mitoEVs can be further improved by integrating them with other engineering methods.

Nanobubbles may offer advantages in terms of circulatory stability and potential for therapeutic delivery compared with microbubbles, but these advantages must be weighed against the need to use higher bubble concentrations, higher ultrasound frequencies, and/or higher intensities to achieve equivalent imaging and/or therapeutic effects.",

          "abstract": "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has become the essence of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. While enabling smaller feature sizes, EUV lithography imposes increasingly stringent requirements on the comprehensive performance and stochastic defect suppression of photoresist. The widely recognized strategy to minimize these defects is a material that integrates high EUV absorption and energy utilization into a homogeneous system based on molecular building blocks—the ideal formulation for EUV photoresist. However, achieving these integrated characteristics within a single molecule has remained an unresolved challenge. Here, we address all these requirements by polytelluoxane using an organic telluride monomer polymerized via Te─O bonds. This polymeric photoresist, operating through a main chain scission mechanism, demonstrates high-performance positive-tone lithography. Attributed to this ideal formulation, our photoresist achieves a comprehensive 18-nm line width at a dose of 13.1 mJ/cm 2 with a line edge roughness of 1.97 nm. We believe that this strategy establishes a framework for the design of next-generation EUV photoresists.",

The peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae is a generalist, feeding on many plant species and capable of transmitting numerous pathogens. This study reveals how host-responsive cathepsin B (CathB) proteins in the oral secretions of M. persicae facilitate aphid survival by modulating plant immune responses. Host-responsive CathB proteins localize to plant processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in messenger RNA storage or decay. Upon localization, these CathB proteins recruit key immune regulators EDS1, PAD4, and ADR1 to these bodies, suppressing plant defenses. A plant protein, Acd28.9 (Hsp20 family), counteracts this CathB activity and contributes to plant resistance to aphids. These findings highlight an unexpected role for p-bodies in plant immunity and uncover a plant resistance mechanism to aphid infestation.",

These designs enable the creation of three-dimensional structures with spatially varying mechanical properties, ranging from tissue-like compliance to rigid, bone-like load-bearing capabilities.

Here, we demonstrate that topological bubble domains (BDs) can be induced in Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT)–based thin films via lattice distortions. We establish a positive correlation between the density of BDs, macroscopic polarization, and strain response. The BDs in BNT-based thin films leads to a remarkable enhancement in the strain response, reaching ~400% of the virgin state. This enhancement arises from the lower energy barriers for dipole flipping and domain switching associated with BDs, in comparison to conventional domain structures. Under an applied electric field, the rotation of polarized BDs, combined with a reduction in dipole flux due to the articulated rotation between BDs and surrounding domains, further amplifies the strain response. These findings advance our understanding of BDs in electromechanical materials and provide theoretical guidance for designing high-performance piezoelectrics with polar topologies.",

Their sol-gel transition during curing enables mold casting and layer-by-layer manufacturing, allowing the fabrication of fully elastomeric and hybrid soft-rigid devices.

This study introduces a framework that relates adhesion strength to a dimensionless reaction coordinate coupling time and temperature. This reaction coordinate can be used to predict the transition from bulk fracture to adhesive failure, which is crucial to create robust devices with strong interfaces. Using this framework, we fabricated elastomeric robotic actuators and demonstrated 3D printing with direct ink writing. The actuators achieved 50% higher curvature with the same design, and the 3D-printed parts exhibited over 200% improvement in interlayer adhesion.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents reward attributes, such as delay and magnitude, alongside expected uncertainties about upcoming rewards, serving its established role in both value- and risk-based behaviors. However, the cellular basis of how reward and uncertainty interact remains unclear. To investigate, we trained rats on a task where odor cues predicted sucrose rewards with varying uncertainties in delay or magnitude. Single-unit recordings revealed that many OFC neurons encoded expected uncertainties related to reward delay or magnitude. Population-level analysis showed distinct neural codes for delay and magnitude uncertainties, separate from those for reward delay and magnitude. Signals for each reward attribute and associated uncertainty converged onto the same neurons, reducing the sensitivity of delay and magnitude encoding as uncertainty increased. These findings suggest a cellular-level computation in OFC neurons, whereby uncertainty signals are integrated into attribute-specific reward representations, potentially supporting flexible learning and risk control.",

Here, we explored the effect of NRBP1 and TSC22Ds on WNK signaling in vitro and in the DCT. TSC22D1.1, TSC22D2, and NRBP1 are localized in DCT WNK bodies, which are cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates associated with WNK activation. In HEK293 cells, long TSC22D isoforms and NRBP1 increase WNK4 activity. DCT-specific NRBP1-knockout mice have reduced NCC phosphorylation and activate a compensatory response. Thus, NRBP1 and long TSC22D proteins are positive modulators of WNK signaling and modulate Na + reabsorption in the kidney.

This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform.

          "abstract": "Engineered skeletal muscle holds potential for tissue engineering and biohybrid robotics applications. However, current strategies face challenges in enhancing force generation while maintaining stability and scalability of the muscle, largely due to insufficient oxygenation and limited nutrient delivery. In this study, we present an engineering approach to address these limitations by coculturing Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii ), a photosynthetic unicellular green microalga, with C2C12 myoblasts in a hydrogel matrix. Leveraging the photosynthetic activity of C. reinhardtii , our microalgae-empowered muscle (MAM) constructs exhibited superior contractility and almost three times higher active force generation compared to conventional muscle constructs. MAM showed higher cellular viability and reduced tissue damage, attributed to in situ oxygenation and nutrient supply provided by microalgal photosynthesis. In addition, improved myotube alignment was observed in MAM, which contributed to enhanced force generation. Our findings showcase the potential of photosynthetic microalgae as a functional component in engineered skeletal muscle, offering a solution to longstanding challenges in muscle engineering.",

          "abstract": "Atmospheric methane concentration (AMC) surged by ~50% during the last deglaciation, with northern (&gt;30°N) sources accounting for ~40% of the rise. However, hypothesized sources including expanding lakes, peatlands, and destabilized permafrost or hydrates fail to explain this rapid increase. We use biomarkers, isotopes, and radiocarbon data to reconstruct temperature change, methane cycling, and permafrost thaw from a Tibetan thermokarst lake. Radiocarbon evidence and ultradepleted δ 13 C values (−80.3 per mil) of methane-diagnostic lipids indicate intense cycling of ancient (~2500-year-old) methane during the Younger Dryas–Preboreal transition, coeval with the AMC surge and the most rapid warming. By contrast, methane cycling was weak during the Holocene Climatic Optimum despite peak temperatures. These findings imply that anomalously high rates of warming, rather than absolute temperature alone, may play an important role in triggering enhanced paleo-methane cycling. Rapid warming likely intensified emissions from existing northern lakes, fueling the elusive yet clearly amplified northern methane source that contributed to the deglacial abrupt rise in AMC.",

          "abstract": "Biohybrid actuators leveraging living muscle tissue offer the potential to replicate natural motion for biomedical and robotic applications. However, challenges such as limited force output and inefficient force transfer at tissue interfaces persist. The myotendinous junction, a specialized interface connecting muscle to the tendon, plays a critical role in efficient force transmission for movement. Engineering muscle-tendon units in vitro is essential for replicating native musculoskeletal functions in biohybrid actuators. Here, we present a three-dimensionally bioprinted system integrating skeletal muscle tissue with tendon-mimicking anchors containing fibroblasts, forming a biomimetic interdigitated myotendinous junction. Using computational models, we optimized muscle geometries to enhance deformation and force generation. The engineered system improved mechanical stability, myofiber maturation, and force transmission, generating contractile forces of up to 350 micronewtons over a 3-month period. This work highlights how biomimetic designs and mechanical optimization can advance bioactuator technologies for applications in medicine and robotics.",
