          "abstract": "α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 is a promising absorber material for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs)1,2. However, the most efficient α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs require the inclusion of methylammonium chloride (MACl) additive3,4, which generates volatile organic residues (i.e., MA) that limit device stability at elevated temperatures5. To date, the highest certified power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs without MACl was only ~24% (ref.6,7), and has yet to exhibit any stability advantages. Here, we identify interfacial contact loss caused by the Cs+ accumulation for the conventional α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs, which deteriorates the device performance and stability. Through in-situ GIWAXS analysis and DFT calculations, we demonstrate an intermediate phase-assisted crystallization pathway enabled by acetate surface coordination to fabricate high-quality α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 film, without using MA-additive. We herein report a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 25.94% and a reverse-scanning PCE of 26.64% for α-FA1-xCsxPbI3 PSCs, exhibiting negligible contact losses and enhanced operational stability. The devices retain >95% of their initial PCEs after over 2,000 hours operating at maximum power point under 1 sun, 85 °C, and 60% relative humidity (ISOS-L-3).",

          "abstract": "Back contact silicon solar cells, valued for their aesthetic appeal by removing grid lines on the sunny side, find applications in buildings, vehicles and aircrafts, enabling self-power generation without compromising appearance1-3. Patterning techniques arrange contacts on the shaded side of the silicon wafer, offering benefits for light incidence as well. However, the patterning process complicates production and causes power loss. Here we employ lasers to streamline back contact solar cell fabrication and enhance power conversion efficiency. Our approach produces the first silicon solar cell to exceed 27% efficiency. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon layers are deposited on the wafer for surface passivation and collection of light-generated carriers. A dense passivating contact, diverging from conventional technology practice, is developed. Pulsed picosecond lasers at different wavelengths are used to create back contact patterns. The developed approach is a streamlined process for producing high-performance back contact silicon solar cells, with a total effective processing time of about one-third that of emerging mainstream technology. To meet terawatt demand, we develop rare indium-less cells at 26.5% efficiency and precious silver-free cells at 26.2% efficiency. The integration of solar solutions in buildings and transportation is poised to expand with these technological advancements.",

          "abstract": "One issue that always strands the scaling-up development of perovskite photovoltaics is the significant efficiency drop when enlarging the device area, which is caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of defected sites1-3. In the narrow band gap formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), the native impurities of PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 non-perovskite could induce unfavored non-radiative recombination, as well as inferior charge transport and extraction 4,5.Here, we develop an impurity-healing interface engineering strategy to well address the issue both in small-area solar cell and large-scale submodule. With the introduction of a functional cation, 2-(1-cyclohexenyl)ethyl ammonium, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite with high mobility is rationally constructed on FAPbI3 to horizontally cover the film surface and vertically penetrate to the grain boundaries of 3D perovskites. Such unique configuration not only comprehensively transforms the PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 impurities into stable 2D perovskite and realize a uniform defect passivation, but also provides interconnecting channels for efficient carrier transport. As a result, the FAPbI3-based small-area (0.085 cm2) solar cells achieve a champion efficiency over 25.86% with a notably high fill factor (FF) of 86.16%. More encouragingly, the fabricated submodules with the aperture area of 715.1 cm2 obtain a certified record efficiency of 22.46% with a good FF of 81.21%, showcasing the feasibility and effectualness of the impurity-healing interface engineering for scaling-up promotion with well-preserved photovoltaic performance.",

Writing in Nature Cities, Bruno et al. built an online platform to analyse how close the world’s cities come to this ideal — and how they could be redesigned to realize it (M. Bruno et al. Nature Cities 1, 633–641; 2024). The authors found that the fraction of residents who have 15-minute access to essential services in a city is closely related to the average time it takes to reach these points, suggesting that cities with poor average accessibility are also those with the highest inequality. They also devised an algorithm to assess what proportion of amenities would need to be relocated to make them accessible to everyone.",

In this study, we estimated the causal impact of state-level anti-transgender laws on suicide risk among transgender and non-binary (TGNB) young people aged 13–17 (n = 35,196) and aged 13–24 (n = 61,240) using a difference-in-differences research design. We found minimal evidence of an anticipatory effect in the time periods leading up to the enactment of the laws. However, starting in the first year after anti-transgender laws were enacted, there were statistically significant increases in rates of past-year suicide attempts among TGNB young people ages 13–17 in states that enacted anti-transgender laws, relative to states that did not, and for all TGNB young people beginning in the second year. Enacting state-level anti-transgender laws increased incidents of past-year suicide attempts among TGNB young people by 7–72%. Our findings highlight the need to consider the mental health impact of recent anti-transgender laws and to advance protective policies.",

To generate driver cancellation rate disparities consistent with controlled experiments (up to twice as large for Black riders as for White riders), we estimate that more than 3% of drivers discriminate by race. We find that the capabilities of ride-hailing technology to rapidly rematch after a cancellation and prioritize long-waiting customers heavily mitigates the effects of driver discrimination on rider wait times, reducing average discrimination-induced disparities to less than 1 min—an order of magnitude less than traditional taxis. However, our results suggest that even in the absence of direct driver discrimination, Black riders in Chicago wait about 50% longer, on average, than White riders because of historically informed geographic residential patterns. We estimate that if Black riders in the city had the same wait times as White riders, the collective travel time saved would be worth $4.2 million to $7.0 million per year.",

          "abstract": "Major initiatives attempt to prevent dementia by targeting modifiable risk factors. Low education is frequently pointed to, due to its relationship with dementia. Impact of education is difficult to assess, however, because of associations with multiple other factors, requiring large population-representative samples to tease the relationships apart. We studied 207,814 Norwegian men born between 1950 and 1959 who underwent compulsory cognitive testing during military conscription as young adults, to systematically test associations of education, cognition, and other important factors. Participants were grouped into five education levels and seven cognitive levels. A total of 1,521 were diagnosed with dementia between ages 60 and 69 y. While having compulsory education only was associated with increased risk (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, CI: 1.17 to 1.60), this association was markedly attenuated when controlling for cognitive test scores (HR = 1.08, CI: 0.91 to 1.28). In contrast, low cognitive score was associated with double risk of later diagnosis, even when controlling for education (HR = 2.00, CI: 1.65 to 2.42). This relationship survived controlling for early-life socioeconomic status and replicated within pairs of brothers. This suggests that genetic and environmental factors shared within families, e.g., common genetics, parental education, socioeconomic status, or other shared experiences, cannot account for the association. Rather, independent, nonfamilial factors are more important. In contrast, within-family factors accounted for the relationship between low education and diagnosis risk. In conclusion, implementing measures to increase cognitive function in childhood and adolescence appears to be a more promising strategy for reducing dementia burden.",

Identifying risk factors for methamphetamine use is crucial to inform preventive interventions.

In 826 participants with a prior HIV diagnosis or previous inflammatory measurements, Cox proportional-hazards models examined risk factors for incident, first-time methamphetamine use.

          "abstract": "Scientific datasets play a crucial role in contemporary data-driven research, as they allow for the progress of science by facilitating the discovery of new patterns and phenomena. This mounting demand for empirical research raises important questions on how strategic data utilization in research projects can stimulate scientific advancement. In this study, we examine the hypothesis inspired by the recombination theory, which suggests that innovative combinations of existing knowledge, including the use of unusual combinations of datasets, can lead to high-impact discoveries. Focusing on social science, we investigate the scientific outcomes of such atypical data combinations in more than 30,000 publications that leverage over 5,000 datasets curated within one of the largest social science databases, Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. This study offers four important insights. First, combining datasets, particularly those infrequently paired, significantly contributes to both scientific and broader impacts (e.g., dissemination to the general public). Second, infrequently paired datasets maintain a strong association with citation even after controlling for the atypicality of dataset topics. In contrast, the atypicality of dataset topics has a much smaller positive impact on citation counts. Third, smaller and less experienced research teams tend to use atypical combinations of datasets in research more frequently than their larger and more experienced counterparts. Last, despite the benefits of data combination, papers that amalgamate data remain infrequent. This finding suggests that the unconventional combination of datasets is an underutilized but powerful strategy correlated with the scientific impact and broader dissemination of scientific discoveries.",

          "abstract": "Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate several physiological and pathological processes and represent the target of approximately 30% of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. GPCR-mediated signaling was thought to occur exclusively at the plasma membrane. However, recent studies have unveiled their presence and function at subcellular membrane compartments. There is a growing interest in studying compartmentalized signaling of GPCRs. This requires development of tools to separate GPCR signaling at the plasma membrane from the ones initiated at intracellular compartments. We leveraged the structural and pharmacological information available for β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) and focused on β1AR as exemplary GPCR that functions at subcellular compartments, and rationally designed spatially restricted antagonists. We generated a cell-impermeable βAR antagonist by conjugating a suitable pharmacophore to a sulfonate-containing fluorophore. This cell-impermeable antagonist only inhibited β1AR on the plasma membrane. In contrast, a cell-permeable βAR antagonist containing a nonsulfonated fluorophore efficiently inhibited both the plasma membrane and Golgi pools of β1ARs. Furthermore, the cell-impermeable antagonist selectively inhibited the phosphorylation of PKA downstream effectors near the plasma membrane, which regulate sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ release in adult cardiomyocytes, while the β1AR Golgi pool remained active. Our tools offer promising avenues for investigating compartmentalized βAR signaling in various contexts, potentially advancing our understanding of βAR-mediated cellular responses in health and disease. They also offer a general strategy to study compartmentalized signaling for other GPCRs in various biological systems.",

          "abstract": "Deployable tubular structures, designed for functional expansion, serve a wide range of applications, from flexible pipes to stiff structural elements. These structures, which transform from compact states, are crucial for creating adaptive solutions across engineering and scientific fields. A significant barrier to advancing their performance is balancing expandability with stiffness. Using compliant materials, these structures achieve more flexible transformations than those possible with rigid mechanisms. However, they typically exhibit reduced stiffness when subjected to external pressures (e.g., tube wall loading). Here, we utilize origami-inspired techniques and internal stiffeners to meet conflicting performance requirements. A self-locking mechanism is proposed, which combines the folding behavior observed in curved-crease origami and elastic shell buckling. This mechanism employs simple shell components, including internal diaphragms that undergo pseudofolding in a confined boundary condition to enable a snap-through transition. We reveal that the deployed tube is self-locked through geometrical interference, creating a braced tubular arrangement. This arrangement gives a direction-dependent structural performance, ranging from elastic response to crushing, thereby offering the potential for programmable structures. We demonstrate that our approach can advance existing deployment mechanisms (e.g., coiled and inflatable systems) and create diverse structural designs (e.g., metamaterials, adaptive structures, cantilevers, and lightweight panels).Weanticipate our design to be a starting point to drive technological advancement in real-world deployable tubular structures.",

          "abstract": "Trophoblast stem (TS) cells have the unique capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types, including extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. EVT cells invade into and transform the uterus where they act to remodel the vasculature facilitating the redirection of maternal nutrients to the developing fetus. Disruptions in EVT cell development and function are at the core of pregnancy-related disease. WNT-activated signal transduction is a conserved regulator of morphogenesis of many organ systems, including the placenta. In human TS cells, activation of canonical WNT signaling is critical for maintenance of the TS cell stem state and its downregulation accompanies EVT cell differentiation. We show that aberrant WNT signaling undermines EVT cell differentiation. Notum, palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase (NOTUM), a negative regulator of canonical WNT signaling, was prominently expressed in first-trimester EVT cells developing in situ and up-regulated in EVT cells derived from human TS cells. Furthermore, NOTUM was required for optimal human TS cell differentiation to EVT cells. Activation of NOTUM in EVT cells is driven, at least in part, by endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain 1 (also called hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha). Collectively, our findings indicate that canonical Wingless-related integration site (WNT) signaling is essential for maintenance of human trophoblast cell stemness and regulation of human TS cell differentiation. Downregulation of canonical WNT signaling via the actions of NOTUM is required for optimal EVT cell differentiation.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces epistatic phenomena such as contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and functions, allows one to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of research documenting the consequences of naturalized and invasive plant species on ecosystem functions, our understanding of the functional underpinnings of these changes remains rudimentary. This is partially due to ineffective scaling of trait differences between native and naturalized species to whole plant communities. Working with data from over 75,000 plots and over 5,500 species from across the United States, we show that changes in the functional composition of communities associated with increasing abundance of naturalized species mirror the differences in traits between native and naturalized plants. We find that communities with greater abundance of naturalized species are more resource acquisitive aboveground and belowground, shorter, more shallowly rooted, and increasingly aligned with an independent strategy for belowground resource acquisition via thin fine roots with high specific root length. We observe shifts toward herbaceous-dominated communities but shifts within both woody and herbaceous functional groups follow community-level patterns for most traits. Patterns are remarkably similar across desert, grassland, and forest ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that the establishment and spread of naturalized species, likely in combination with underlying environmental shifts, leads to predictable and consistent changes in community-level traits that can alter ecosystem functions.",

Here, by combining medical imaging, biomechanical data, live behavioral experiments, and numerical simulations, an octopus-inspired arm made of ∼ 200 continuous muscle groups is synthesized, exposing “mechanically intelligent” design and control principles broadly pertinent to dynamics and robotics. Such principles are mathematically understood in terms of storage, transport, and conversion of topological quantities, effected into complex 3D motions via simple muscle activation templates. These are in turn composed into higher-level control strategies that, compounded by the arm’s compliance, are demonstrated across challenging manipulation tasks, revealing surprising simplicity and robustness.",

          "abstract": "The propeller-shaped blades of the PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 ion channels partition into the plasma membrane and respond to indentation or stretching of the lipid bilayer, thus converting mechanical forces into signals that can be interpreted by cells, in the form of calcium flux and changes in membrane potential. While PIEZO channels participate in diverse physiological processes, from sensing the shear stress of blood flow in the vasculature to detecting touch through mechanoreceptors in the skin, the molecular details that enable these mechanosensors to tune their responses over a vast dynamic range of forces remain largely uncharacterized. To survey the molecular landscape surrounding PIEZO channels at the cell surface, we employed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach to capture and identify extracellularly exposed proteins in the vicinity of PIEZO1. This PIEZO1-proximal interactome was enriched in surface proteins localized to cell junctions and signaling hubs within the plasma membrane. Functional screening of these interaction candidates by calcium imaging and electrophysiology in an overexpression system identified the adhesion molecule CADM1/SynCAM that slows the inactivation kinetics of PIEZO1 with little effect on PIEZO2. Conversely, we found that CADM1 knockdown accelerates inactivation of endogenous PIEZO1 in Neuro-2a cells. Systematic deletion of CADM1 domains indicates that the transmembrane region is critical for the observed effects on PIEZO1, suggesting that modulation of inactivation is mediated by interactions in or near the lipid bilayer.",

          "abstract": "The ultrafast photochemical reaction mechanism, transient spectra, and transition kinetics of the human blue cone visual pigment have been recorded at room temperature. Ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy revealed the progressive formation and decay of several metastable photo-intermediates, corresponding to the Batho to Meta-II photo-intermediates previously observed with bovine rhodopsin and human green cone opsin, on the picosecond to millisecond timescales following pulsed excitation. The experimental data reveal several interesting similarities and differences between the photobleaching sequences of bovine rhodopsin, human green cone opsin, and human blue cone opsin. While Meta-II formation kinetics are comparable between bovine rhodopsin and blue cone opsin, the transition kinetics of earlier photo-intermediates and qualitative characteristics of the Meta-I to Meta-II transition are more similar for blue cone opsin and green cone opsin. Additionally, the blue cone photo-intermediate spectra exhibit a high degree of overlap with uniquely small spectral shifts. The observed variation in Meta-II formation kinetics between rod and cone visual pigments is explained based on key structural differences.",

          "abstract": "Discrepancy is a well-known measure for the irregularity of the distribution of a point set. Point sets with small discrepancy are called low discrepancy and are known to efficiently fill the space in a uniform manner. Low-discrepancy points play a central role in many problems in science and engineering, including numerical integration, computer vision, machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to generate a new class of low-discrepancy point sets named Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) points. Motivated by the geometric nature of generating low-discrepancy point sets, we leverage tools from Geometric Deep Learning and base our model on graph neural networks. We further provide an extension of our framework to higher dimensions, which flexibly allows the generation of custom-made points that emphasize the uniformity in specific dimensions that are primarily important for the particular problem at hand. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance superior to previous methods by a significant margin. In fact, MPMC points are empirically shown to be either optimal or near-optimal with respect to the discrepancy for low dimension and small number of points, i.e., for which the optimal discrepancy can be determined.",

          "abstract": "Randomized experiments are a powerful methodology for data-driven evaluation of decisions or interventions. Yet, their validity may be undermined by network interference. This occurs when the treatment of one unit impacts not only its outcome but also that of connected units, biasing traditional treatment effect estimations. Our study introduces a framework to accommodate complex and unknown network interference, moving beyond specialized models in the existing literature. Our framework, termed causal message-passing, is grounded in high-dimensional approximate message-passing methodology. It is tailored for multiperiod experiments and is particularly effective in settings with many units and prevalent network interference. The framework models causal effects as a dynamic process where a treated unit’s impact propagates through the network via neighboring units until equilibrium is reached. This approach allows us to approximate the dynamics of potential outcomes over time, enabling the extraction of valuable information before treatment effects reach equilibrium. Utilizing causal message-passing, we introduce a practical algorithm to estimate the total treatment effect, defined as the impact observed when all units are treated compared to the scenario where no unit receives treatment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across five numerical scenarios, each characterized by a distinct interference structure.",

          "abstract": "Convergent extension of epithelial tissue is a key motif of animal morphogenesis. On a coarse scale, cell motion resembles laminar fluid flow; yet in contrast to a fluid, epithelial cells adhere to each other and maintain the tissue layer under actively generated internal tension. To resolve this apparent paradox, we formulate a model in which tissue flow in the tension-dominated regime occurs through adiabatic remodeling of force balance in the network of adherens junctions. We propose that the slow dynamics within the manifold of force-balanced configurations is driven by positive feedback on myosin-generated cytoskeletal tension. Shifting force balance within a tension network causes active cell rearrangements (T1 transitions) resulting in net tissue deformation oriented by initial tension anisotropy. Strikingly, we find that the total extent of tissue deformation depends on the initial cellular packing order. T1s degrade this order so that tissue flow is self-limiting. We explain these findings by showing that coordination of T1s depends on coherence in local tension configurations, quantified by a geometric order parameter in tension space. Our model reproduces the salient tissue- and cell-scale features of germ band elongation during Drosophila gastrulation, in particular the slowdown of tissue flow after approximately twofold elongation concomitant with a loss of order in tension configurations. This suggests local cell geometry contains morphogenetic information and yields experimentally testable predictions. Defining biologically controlled active tension dynamics on the manifold of force-balanced states may provide a general approach to the description of morphogenetic flow.",

Our analysis indicates that changes in ice discharge have played a dominant role in ongoing ice mass trends and their accelerations, especially in glaciers near the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas in West Antarctica. In particular, mass losses of the Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers have been mostly (&gt;90%) controlled by ice discharge, while the contribution of SMB has been relatively minor. In East Antarctica, SMB accounts for significant portions (&gt;50%) of ice mass imbalances of glaciers in e.g., Dronning Maud Land and Wilkes Land. Ice discharge has also played a notable role in overall mass gain in the region. While our ice discharge estimates agree well with previous estimates from satellite imagery in West Antarctica, notable differences are found in glaciers of East Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula. This highlights the need for more observations and improved numerical models to refine these estimates.",

          "abstract": "Precise control at the colloidal scale is one of the most promising bottom–up approaches to fabricating new materials and devices with tunable and precisely engineered properties. Magnetically driven colloidal assembly offers great versatility because of the ability to externally tune particle–particle interactions and to construct a host of particle arrangements. However, despite previous efforts to probe the parameter space, global orientational control in conjunction with two-dimensional microstructural control has remained out of reach. Furthermore, the magnetic relaxation time of superparamagnetic beads has been largely overlooked despite being a key feature of the magnetic response. Here, we take advantage of the magnetic relaxation time of superparamagnetic beads in an alternating rotating magnetic field and show how harnessing this feature facilitates the formation of oriented clusters. The orientation of these clusters can be controlled by field parameters. Using experiments, simulations, and theory, we probe a two-particle system (dimer) under this alternating rotating magnetic field and use its dynamics to provide insights into the collective response that forms clusters. We find that the type of field has significant implications for the dipolar interactions between the colloids because of the nonnegligible magnetic relaxation. Moreover, we find that the competing time scales of the magnetic relaxation and the alternating field generate an anisotropic interaction potential that drives cluster alignment. By exploiting the magnetic relaxation time of magnetic systems, we can tailor new types of interparticle interactions, thereby expanding the capabilities of colloidal assembly in engineering unique materials and devices.",

          "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes characterized by vascular pathology and neuroinflammation. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition molecule that functions at the crossroads between innate immunity, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. DR is known to involve inflammatory pathways, although the potential relevance of PTX3 has not been explored. We found that PTX3 protein levels increased in the retina of diabetic mice. Similarly, evaluation of a publicly available transcriptomic human dataset revealed increased PTX3 expression in DR with diabetic macular edema and proliferative retinopathy, when compared to nondiabetic retinas or diabetic retinas without complications. To further understand the role of PTX3 within DR, we employed the streptozotocin-induced diabetes model in PTX3 knockout mice (PTX3 KO ), which were followed up for 9 mo to evaluate hallmarks of disease progression. In diabetic PTX3 KO mice, we observed decreased reactive gliosis, diminished microglia activation, and reduced vasodegeneration, when compared to diabetic PTX3 wild-type littermates. The decrease in DR–associated pathological features in PTX3 KO retinas translated into preserved visual function, as evidenced by improved optokinetic response, restored b-wave amplitude in electroretinograms, and attenuated neurodegeneration. We showed that PTX3 induced an inflammatory phenotype in human retinal macroglia, characterized by GFAP upregulation and increased secretion of IL6 and PAI-1. We confirmed that PTX3 was required for TNF-α-induced reactive gliosis, as PTX3 KO retinal explants did not up-regulate GFAP in response to TNF-α. This study reveals a unique role for PTX3 as an enhancer of sterile inflammation in DR, which drives pathogenesis and ultimately visual impairment.",

To address these concerns, we have developed zanDR, a bispecific small molecule that binds and inhibits viral neuraminidase expressed on both free virus and virus-infected cells and recruits naturally occurring anti-rhamnose and anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies with rhamnose and DNP haptens. Because the neuraminidase inhibition replicates the chemotherapeutic mechanism of zanamivir and oseltamivir, while rhamnose and DNP recruit endogenous antibodies much like an anti-influenza vaccine, zanDR reproduces most of the functions of current methods of protection against influenza virus infections. Importantly, studies on cells in culture demonstrate that both of the above protective mechanisms remain highly functional in the zanDR conjugate, while studies in lethally infected mice with advanced-stage disease establish that a single intranasal dose of zanDR not only yields 100% protection but also reduces lung viral loads faster and ~1,000× more thoroughly than current antiviral therapies. Since zanDR also lowers secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and protects against virus-induced damage to the lungs better than current therapies, we suggest that combining an immunotherapy with a chemotherapy in single pharmacological agent constitutes a promising approach for treating the more challenging forms of influenza.",

Flagellar motility is an energy-demanding process, where the sum of its production (biosynthesis) and operation (rotation) costs has been estimated to total ~10% of the entire energy budget of an Escherichia coli cell. The acquisition of such a costly adaptation process is expected to secure short-term benefits by increasing competitiveness and survival, as well as long-term evolutionary fitness gains. While the role of flagellar motility in bacterial survival has been widely reported, its direct influence on the rate of evolution remains unclear. We show here that both production and operation costs contribute to elevated mutation rates.

Here, we conduct a long-term hypoxia acclimation experiment to assess the relative roles of local adaptation and plasticity in enabling highland and lowland deer mice ( Peromyscus maniculatus ) to sustain aerobic thermogenesis at progressively increasing elevations. We assessed the relative physiological performance capacities of highland and lowland natives as they were exposed to progressive, stepwise increases in hypoxia, simulating the gradual ascent from sea level to an elevation of 6,000 m. The final elevation of 6,000 m far exceeds the highest attainable elevations within the species’ range, and therefore tests the animals’ ability to tolerate levels of hypoxia that surpass the prevailing conditions within their current distributional limits. Our results demonstrate that highland natives exhibit superior thermogenic capacities at the most severe levels of hypoxia, suggesting that the species’ broad fundamental niche and its ability to inhabit such a broad range of elevational zones is attributable to genetically based local adaptation, including evolved changes in plasticity. Transcriptomic and physiological measurements identify evolved changes in the acclimation response to hypoxia that contribute to the enhanced thermogenic capacity of highland natives.",

          "abstract": "As ambush-hunting predators that consume large prey after long intervals of fasting, Burmese pythons evolved with unique adaptations for modulating organ structure and function. Among these is cardiac hypertrophy that develops within three days following a meal (Andersen et al., 2005, Secor, 2008), which we previously showed was initiated by circulating growth factors (Riquelme et al., 2011). Postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in pythons also rapidly regresses with subsequent fasting (Secor, 2008); however, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the dynamic cardiac remodeling in pythons during digestion are largely unknown. In this study, we employed a multiomics approach coupled with targeted molecular analyses to examine remodeling of the python ventricular transcriptome and proteome throughout digestion. We found that forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) signaling was suppressed prior to hypertrophy development and then activated during regression, which coincided with decreased and then increased expression, respectively, of FoxO1 transcriptional targets involved in proteolysis. To define the molecular mechanistic role of FoxO1 in hypertrophy regression, we used cultured mammalian cardiomyocytes treated with postfed python plasma. Hypertrophy regression both in pythons and in vitro coincided with activation of FoxO1-dependent autophagy; however, the introduction of a FoxO1-specific inhibitor prevented both regression of cell size and autophagy activation. Finally, to determine whether FoxO1 activation could induce regression, we generated an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active FoxO1. FoxO1 activation was sufficient to prevent and reverse postfed plasma-induced hypertrophy, which was partially prevented by autophagy inhibition. Our results indicate that modulation of FoxO1 activity contributes to the dynamic ventricular remodeling in postprandial Burmese pythons.",

With this research, we propose a rational strategy to develop robust mechanosensitive fluorescence lifetime probes which can facilitate simultaneous fluorescence lifetime imaging of the plasma membrane and nuclear envelope. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy using the unique mechanosensitive probes reveal a dynamic mechanism for ferroptosis: The membrane tension of both the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope decreases during ferroptosis, and the nuclear envelope exhibits budding during the advanced stage of ferroptosis. Significantly, the membrane tension of the plasma membrane is always larger than that of the nuclear envelope, and the membrane tension of the nuclear envelope is slightly larger than that of the nuclear membrane bubble. Meanwhile, the membrane lesions are repaired in the low-tension regions through exocytosis.",

Common bioluminescence imaging methods often require the addition of an external chemical substrate (luciferin), which can result in a decrease in luminescence intensity over time and limit prolonged observations. Since the bacterial bioluminescence system is genetically encoded for luciferase-luciferin production, it enables autonomous bioluminescence (auto-bioluminescence) imaging. However, its application to multiple reporters is restricted due to a limited range of color variants. Here, we report five-color auto-bioluminescence system named Nano-lanternX (NLX), which can be expressed in bacterial, mammalian, and plant hosts, thereby enabling auto-bioluminescence in various living organisms. Utilizing spectral unmixing, we achieved the successful observation of multicolor auto-bioluminescence, enabling detailed single-cell imaging across both bacterial and mammalian cells.

Here, we elucidate the glass transition of water by analyzing the calorimetric behavior of nano-confined water across various pore topologies (diameters: 0.3 to 2.5 nm). Our approach involves subjecting confined water to annealing protocols to identify the temperature and time evolution of nonequilibrium glass kinetics. Furthermore, we complement this calorimetric approach with the dynamics of confined water, as seen by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and linear calorimetric measurements, including the fast scanning technique. This study demonstrated that confined water undergoes a glass transition in the temperature range of 170 to 200 K, depending on the confinement size and the interaction with the confinement walls. Moreover, we also show that the thermal event observed at ~136 K must be interpreted as an annealing prepeak, also referred to as the “shadow glass transition.” Calorimetric measurements also allow the detection of a specific heat step above 200 K, which is insensitive to annealing and, thereby, interpreted as a true thermodynamic transition. Finally, by connecting our results to bulk water behavior, we offer a comprehensive understanding of confined water vitrification with potential implications for numerous applications.",

Although recent studies have characterized many acetyltransferases in diverse bacterial species, only a few protein deacetylases have been identified in prokaryotes, perhaps in part due to their limited sequence homology. In this study, we identified YkuR, encoded by smu_318 , as a unique protein deacetylase in Streptococcus mutans . Through protein acetylome analysis, we demonstrated that the deletion of ykuR significantly upregulated protein acetylation levels, affecting key enzymes in translation processes and metabolic pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and biofilm formation. In particular, YkuR modulated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis and biofilm formation through the direct deacetylation of glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) in the presence of NAD + . Intriguingly, YkuR can be acetylated in a nonenzymatic manner, which then negatively regulated its deacetylase activity, suggesting the presence of a self-regulatory mechanism. Moreover, in vivo studies further demonstrated that the deletion of ykuR attenuated the cariogenicity of S. mutans in the rat caries model, substantiating its involvement in the pathogenesis of dental caries. Therefore, our study revealed a unique regulatory mechanism mediated by YkuR through protein deacetylation that regulates the physiology and pathogenicity of S. mutans .",

          "abstract": "The terminal cells of the Drosophila larval tracheal system are perhaps the simplest delivery networks, providing an analogue for mammalian vascular growth and function in a system with many fewer components. These cells are a prime example of single-cell morphogenesis, branching significantly over time to adapt to the needs of the growing tissue they supply. While the genetic mechanisms governing local branching decisions have been studied extensively, an understanding of the emergence of a global network architecture is still lacking. Mapping out the full network architecture of populations of terminal cells at different developmental times of Drosophila larvae, we find that cell growth follows scaling laws relating the total edge length, supply area, and branch density. Using time-lapse imaging of individual terminal cells, we identify that the cells grow in three ways: by extending branches, by the side budding of new branches, and by internally growing existing branches. A generative model based on these modes of growth recapitulates statistical properties of the terminal cell network data. These results suggest that the scaling laws arise from the coupled contributions of branching and internal growth. This study establishes the terminal cell as a uniquely tractable model system for further studies of transportation and distribution networks.",

Leveraging the temperature-triggered soft-rigid phase transition and shape memory characteristic of SMP, this probe design enables direct insertion into brain tissue with minimal footprint in a folded configuration while automatically softening to reduce mechanical mismatches with brain tissue and deploying electrodes to a broader recording span under physiological conditions. Experimental and numerical studies on the material softening and structural folding-deploying behaviors provide insights into the design, fabrication, and operation of the intracortical probes. The chronically implanted neural probe in the rat cortex demonstrates that the proposed neural probe can reliably detect and track individual units for months with stable impedance and signal amplitude during long-term implantation.

For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a 30 ° ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near- 0 ° , not 30 ° , relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy of the graphene/hBN moiré on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, nonaligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moiré heterostructures.",

Here, we provide evidence linking nuclear envelope (NE) budding and accelerated aging. Mechanistically, progerin disrupts nuclear lamina to induce NE budding in concert with lamin A/C, resulting in transport of chromatin into the cytoplasm where it is removed via autophagy, whereas emerin antagonizes this process. Primary cells from both HGPS patients and mouse models express progerin and display NE budding and chromatin loss, and ectopically expressing progerin in cells can mimic this process. More excitingly, we screen a NE budding inhibitor chaetocin by high-throughput screening, which can dramatically sequester progerin from the NE and prevent this NE budding through sustaining ERK1/2 activation. Chaetocin alleviates NE budding-induced chromatin loss and ameliorates HGPS defects in cells and mice and significantly extends lifespan of HGPS mice. Collectively, we propose that progerin-induced NE budding participates in the induction of progeria, highlight the roles of chaetocin and sustained ERK1/2 activation in anti-aging, and provide a distinct avenue for treating HGPS.",

DotO, a distant homolog of the T4ASS ATPase VirB4, associates with the bacterial inner membrane despite lacking hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Employing a genetic approach, we found DotO’s membrane association is mediated by three inner-membrane Dot/Icm components, IcmT, and a combined DotJ–DotI complex (referred to as DotJI). Although deletion of icmT or dotJI individually does not affect DotO’s membrane association, the simultaneous inactivation of all three genes results in increased amounts of soluble DotO. Nevertheless, deleting each receptor separately profoundly affects positioning of DotO, disrupting its link with the Dot/Icm complex at the bacterial poles, rendering the receptors nonredundant. Furthermore, a collection of dotO point mutants that we isolated established that DotO’s N-terminal domain interacts with the membrane receptors and is involved in dimerization, whereas DotO’s C-terminal ATPase domain primarily contributes to the protein’s formation of oligomers. Modeling data revealed the complex interaction between DotO and its receptors is responsible for formation of DotO’s unique “hexamer of dimers” configuration, which is a defining characteristic of VirB4 family members.",

Bacillus subtilis , a soil-dwelling bacterium that is commonly found in association with plants and their rhizosphere, has garnered interest for its potential to enhance plant growth, suppress pathogens, and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices. However, research on the dynamic distribution of B. subtilis within the rhizosphere and its interaction mechanisms with plant roots remains insufficient due to limitations in existing in situ detection methodologies. To achieve dynamic in situ detection of the rhizosphere environment, we established iRhizo-Chip, a microfluidics-based platform. Using this device to investigate microbial behavior within the rhizosphere, we found obvious diurnal fluctuations in the growth of B. subtilis in the rhizosphere. Temporal dynamic analysis of rhizosphere dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, dissolved organic carbon, and reactive oxygen species showed that diurnal fluctuations in the growth of B. subtilis are potentially related to a variety of environmental factors. Spatial dynamic analysis also showed that the spatial distribution changes of B. subtilis and DO and pH were similar. Subsequently, through in vitro control experiments, we proved that rhizosphere DO and pH are the main driving forces for diurnal fluctuations in the growth of B. subtilis . Our results show that the growth of B. subtilis is driven by rhizosphere DO and pH, resulting in diurnal fluctuations, and iRhizo-Chip is a valuable tool for studying plant rhizosphere dynamics.",

Along with a companion paper by Livraghi et al., we argue that ivory , not cortex , is the color pattern gene of interest at this locus. In J. coenia , a cluster of cis -regulatory elements (CREs) in the first intron of ivory are genetically associated with natural variation in seasonal color pattern plasticity, and targeted deletions of these CREs phenocopy seasonal phenotypes. Deletions of different ivory CREs produce other distinct phenotypes as well, including loss of melanic eyespot rings, and positive and negative changes in overall wing pigmentation. We show that the color pattern transcription factors Spineless, Bric-a-brac, and Ftz-f1 bind to the ivory promoter during wing pattern development, suggesting that they directly regulate ivory . This case study demonstrates how cis -regulation of a single noncoding RNA can exert diverse and nuanced effects on the evolution and development of color patterns, including modulating seasonally plastic color patterns.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the motion of particles with multivalent ligand-receptors is important for biomedical applications and material design. Yet, even among a single design, the prototypical DNA-coated colloids, seemingly similar micrometric particles hop or roll, depending on the study. We shed light on this problem by observing DNA-coated colloids diffusing near surfaces coated with complementary strands for a wide array of coating designs. We find colloids rapidly switch between 2 modes: They hop—with long and fast steps—and crawl—with short and slow steps. Both modes occur at all temperatures around the melting point and over various designs. The particles become increasingly subdiffusive as temperature decreases, in line with subsequent velocity steps becoming increasingly anticorrelated, corresponding to switchbacks in the trajectories. Overall, crawling (or hopping) phases are more predominant at low (or high) temperatures; crawling is also more efficient at low temperatures than hopping to cover large distances. We rationalize this behavior within a simple model: At lower temperatures, the number of bound strands increases, and detachment of all bonds is unlikely, hence, hopping is prevented and crawling favored. We thus reveal the mechanism behind a common design rule relying on increased strand density for long-range self-assembly: Dense strands on surfaces are required to enable crawling, possibly facilitating particle rearrangements.",

Real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding calculations indicate that optically generated electric fields promote transient-hole-transfer-driven dissociation of the O─H bond of water preferentially over transient-electron-driven dissociation of the C─O bond of CO 2 .

Following the striking success of artificial networks, a major debate has emerged concerning their usefulness in explaining neuronal properties. Here we propose that finding parallels between artificial and neuronal networks is informative precisely because these systems are so different from each other. Our argument is based on an extension of the concept of convergent evolution—well established in biology—to the domain of artificial systems. Applying this concept to different areas and levels of the cortical hierarchy can be a powerful tool for elucidating the functional role of well-known cortical selectivities. Importantly, we further demonstrate that such parallels can uncover novel functionalities by showing that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex can be modeled to function as a set of basis functions in a lossy representation such as the well-known JPEG compression. Thus, contrary to common intuition, here we illustrate that finding parallels with artificial systems provides novel and informative insights, particularly in those cases that are far removed from realistic brain biology.",

Stable miR-96-5p overexpression led to genome-wide changes in heterochromatin followed by epigenetic activation of p16 Ink4a , p21 Cip1 , and SASP expression, induction of a marker of DNA damage, and induction of a transcriptional signature similar to other senescent lung and endothelial cell types. Expression of miR-96-5p significantly increased following senescence induction in culture cells and with aging in tissues from naturally aged and Ercc1 −/Δ progeroid mice. Mechanistically, miR-96-5p directly suppressed expression of SIN3B and SIN3 corepressor complex constituents KDM5A and MORF4L2, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of these transcriptional regulators recapitulated the senescent phenotype. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of the SIN3 complex suppressed senescence and SASP markers.

The key idea was that, in the finite element implementation, the displacement vector and its gradient should be treated as independent fields with the lowest ( C 0 ) continuity, constrained by a second-order Lagrange multiplier tensor. Coupled with a realistic constitutive law for triaxial softening damage, such as microplane model M7, the known limitations of the classical Crack Band Model were eliminated. Here, we show that the slCBM closely reproduces the size effect revealed by the gap test at various crack-parallel stresses. To describe it, we present an approximate corrective formula, although a strong loading-path dependence limits its applicability. Except for the rare case of zero crack-parallel stresses, the fracture predictions of the line crack models (linear elastic fracture mechanics, phase-field, extended finite element method (XFEM), cohesive crack models) can be as much as 100% in error. We argue that the localization limiter concept must be extended by including the resistance to material rotation gradients. We also show that, without this resistance, the existing strain-gradient damage theories may predict a wrong fracture pattern and have, for Mode II and III fractures, a load capacity error as much as 55%. Finally, we argue that the crack-parallel stress effect must occur in all materials, ranging from concrete to atomistically sharp cracks in crystals.",

This heterogeneous catalytic reaction not only holds considerable practical significance but also serves as a classical model for investigating fundamental mechanisms, including adsorption and reactions between adsorbates. Nonetheless, the governing mechanisms and kinetics of its intermediate reaction stages under varying gas conditions remain elusive. This is attributed to the intricate interplay between adsorption, atomic diffusion, and concurrent phase transformation of catalyst. Herein, the Pd-catalyzed, water-forming hydrogen oxidation is studied in situ, to investigate intermediate reaction stages via gas cell transmission electron microscopy. The dynamic behaviors of water generation, associated with reversible palladium hydride formation, are captured in real time with a nanoscale spatial resolution. Our findings suggest that the hydrogen oxidation rate catalyzed by Pd is significantly affected by the sequence in which gases are introduced. Through direct evidence of electron diffraction and density functional theory calculation, we demonstrate that the hydrogen oxidation rate is limited by precursors’ adsorption. These nanoscale insights help identify the optimal reaction conditions for Pd-catalyzed hydrogen oxidation, which has substantial implications for water production technologies. The developed understanding also advocates a broader exploration of analogous mechanisms in other metal-catalyzed reactions.",

          "abstract": "Severe and chronic infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and tuberculosis (TB), induce long-lasting epigenetic changes that are associated with an increase in all-cause postinfectious morbidity and mortality. Oncology studies identified metabolic drivers of the epigenetic landscape, with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle acting as a central hub. It is unknown if the TCA cycle also regulates epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, after infection-induced immune tolerance. The following studies demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide and Mycobacterium tuberculosis induce changes in DNA methylation that are mediated by the TCA cycle. Infection-induced DNA hypermethylation is mitigated by inhibitors of cellular metabolism (rapamycin, everolimus, metformin) and the TCA cycle (isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors). Conversely, exogenous supplementation with TCA metabolites (succinate and itaconate) induces DNA hypermethylation and immune tolerance. Finally, TB patients who received everolimus have less DNA hypermethylation demonstrating proof of concept that metabolic manipulation can mitigate epigenetic scars.",

          "abstract": "Hippocampal neurons can be the first to be impaired with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most drug candidates for causal therapy of AD cannot either enter the brain or accumulate around hippocampal neurons. Here, we genetically engineered insulin-fusion proteins, called hippocampal neuron–targeting (Ht) proteins, for targeting protein drugs to hippocampal neurons because insulin tends to accumulate in the neuronal cell layers of the hippocampus. In vitro examinations clarified that insulin and Ht proteins were internalized into the cultured hippocampal neurons through insulin receptor–mediated macropinocytosis. Cysteines were key determinants of the delivery of Ht proteins to hippocampal neurons, and insulin B chain mutant was most potent in delivering cargo proteins. In vivo accumulation of Ht proteins to hippocampal neuronal layers occurred after intracerebroventricular administration. Thus, hippocampal neuron–targeting technology can provide great help for developing protein drugs against neurodegenerative disorders.",

In this study, we investigated the spatial form and timing of a population collapse from 2018 to 2022 in Canada lynx ( Lynx canadensis ) across the northwest boreal forest. We analyzed survival, reproduction, and dispersal data from 143 individual global positioning system (GPS) collared lynx from populations across five study sites spanning interior Alaska to determine whether lynx displayed characteristics of a population wave following a concurrent wave in snowshoe hare ( Lepus americanus ) abundance. Reproductive rates declined across the study sites; however, site-level reproduction declined first in our easternmost study sites, supporting the idea of a population wave. Despite a clear increase in percent of dispersing lynx, there was no evidence of directional bias in dispersal following a hare population wave. Analysis did show increasingly poor survival for lynx dispersing to the east compared to combined resident and westward dispersal. This pattern is consistent with a survival-mediated population wave in lynx as the driver of the theorized population wave. The combination of these factors supports the idea of a hierarchical response to snowshoe hare population declines with a drop in lynx reproduction followed by increased dispersal, and finally reduced survival. All of this evidence is consistent with the expected characteristics of a population undergoing a traveling wave and supports the hypothesis that lynx presence may facilitate and mirror the underlying wave patterns in snowshoe hare.",

          "abstract": "The critical brain hypothesis states that the brain can benefit from operating close to a second-order phase transition. While it has been shown that several computational aspects of sensory processing (e.g., sensitivity to input) can be optimal in this regime, it is still unclear whether these computational benefits of criticality can be leveraged by neural systems performing behaviorally relevant computations. To address this question, we investigate signatures of criticality in networks optimized to perform efficient coding. We consider a spike-coding network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic transmission delays. Previously, it was shown that the performance of such networks varies nonmonotonically with the noise amplitude. Interestingly, we find that in the vicinity of the optimal noise level for efficient coding, the network dynamics exhibit some signatures of criticality, namely, scale-free dynamics of the spiking and the presence of crackling noise relation. Our work suggests that two influential, and previously disparate theories of neural processing optimization (efficient coding and criticality) may be intimately related.",

Interaction between charge carriers with the heterojunction plays a crucial role in determining device performance, while its spatial-temporal mapping remains lacking. In this study, we employ scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM), an emerging technique that combines high spatial-temporal resolution and surface sensitivity, to investigate photocarrier dynamics across a Si/Ge heterojunction. Charge dynamics are selectively examined across the junction and compared to far bulk areas, through which the impact of the built-in potential, band offsets, and surface effects is directly visualized. In particular, we find that the heterojunction drastically modifies the hot photocarrier diffusivities in both Si and Ge regions due to charge trapping. These findings are further elucidated with insights from the band structure and surface potential measured by complementary techniques. This work demonstrates the tremendous effect of heterointerfaces on hot photocarrier dynamics and showcases the potential of SUEM in characterizing realistic optoelectronic devices.",

We show that the muscle reversibly contracts by 47.3% when driven by an oscillating input air pressure of 120 kilopascals at 10 Hz. It generates a maximum power density of 3.0 W/g and demonstrates a mechanical contractile efficiency of 74%. The muscle’s low-pressure operation allowed for portable, thermal pneumatical actuation. Moreover, the muscle demonstrated bipolar actuation, wherein internal pressure leads to muscle length expansion if the initial muscle length is compressed and contraction if the muscle is not compressed. Modeling indicates that muscle expansion significantly alters its stiffness, which causes muscle actuation. We demonstrate the utility of BCMs for fast running and climbing robots.",

          "abstract": "Casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ) controls essential biological processes including circadian rhythms and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) signaling, but how its activity is regulated is not well understood. CK1δ is inhibited by autophosphorylation of its intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail. Two CK1 splice variants, δ1 and δ2, are known to have very different effects on circadian rhythms. These variants differ only in the last 16 residues of the tail, referred to as the extreme C termini (XCT), but with marked changes in potential phosphorylation sites. Here, we test whether the XCT of these variants have different effects in autoinhibition of the kinase. Using NMR and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that the δ1 XCT is preferentially phosphorylated by the kinase and the δ1 tail makes more extensive interactions across the kinase domain. Mutation of δ1-specific XCT phosphorylation sites increases kinase activity both in vitro and in cells and leads to changes in the circadian period, similar to what is reported in vivo. Mechanistically, loss of the phosphorylation sites in XCT disrupts tail interaction with the kinase domain. δ1 autoinhibition relies on conserved anion-binding sites around the CK1 active site, demonstrating a common mode of product inhibition of CK1δ. These findings demonstrate how a phosphorylation cycle controls the activity of this essential kinase.",

This often implicates the nucleation of bubbles at the interface, with the concomitant blockage of the electroactive area leading to overpotentials and Ohmic drop. Nanoelectrodes have been envisioned as assets to revert this effect, by inhibiting bubble formation. Experiments show, however, that nanobubbles nucleate and attach to nanoscale electrodes, imposing a limit to the current, which turns out to be independent of size and applied potential in a wide range from 3 nm to tenths of microns. Here we investigate the potential-current response for disk electrodes of diameters down to a single-atom, employing molecular simulations including electrochemical generation of gas. Our analysis reveals that nanoelectrodes of 1 nm can offer twice as much current as that delivered by electrodes with areas four orders of magnitude larger at the same bias. This boost in the extracted current is a consequence of the destabilization of the gas phase. The grand potential of surface nanobubbles shows they can not reach a thermodynamically stable state on supports below 2 nm. As a result, the electroactive area becomes accessible to the solution and the current turns out to be sensitive to the electrode radius. In this way, our simulations establish that there is an optimal size for the nanoelectrodes, in between the single-atom and ∼3 nm, that optimizes the gas production.",

This study estimates the potential impact of interpretations of the ruling on federal wetlands protections, using a qualitative measure of wetland “wetness” as a proxy for the new requirement. An estimated area ranging from ~17 million acres (19%) to nearly all 90 million acres of nontidal wetlands in the conterminous United States could be without federal protections, and variability in state protections creates hotspots of risk.

We discovered that items at each ordinal rank in WM were encoded in separate rank-WM subspaces and then, depending on cues, were maintained or reordered between the subspaces, accompanied by two extra temporary subspaces in two operation steps. Furthermore, the cue activity served as an indexical signal to trigger sorting processes.

The mathematical model predicted that increased synaptic strength promotes the neuronal “down state” and raises the delta power. Our molecular tool (synapse-targeted chemically induced translocation of Kalirin-7, SYNCit-K), which induces dendritic spine enlargement and synaptic potentiation through chemically induced translocation of protein Kalirin-7, demonstrated that synaptic potentiation of excitatory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) increases nonrapid eye movement sleep amounts and delta power.

Genetic analyses revealed that a mutation in PfSec13 , which encodes a component of the parasite secretory machinery, reduced susceptibility to the drug. Its high potency, excellent therapeutic profile, and distinctive mode of action make MED6-189 an excellent addition to the antimalarial drug pipeline.",

Optogenetics and calcium sensors have paved the way for these types of studies, allowing for the perturbation and readout of spiking activity within genetically defined cell types. However, these methods lack the ability to further disentangle the roles of individual neuromodulator and neuropeptides on circuits and behavior. We review recent advances in chemical biology tools that enable precise spatiotemporal monitoring and control over individual neuroeffectors and their receptors in vivo. We also highlight discoveries enabled by such tools, revealing how these molecules signal across different timescales to drive learning, orchestrate behavioral changes, and modulate circuit activity.",

To mitigate the destruction wrought by this ocean plastic debris, various cleanup programs have been established, though to our knowledge the benefits of such efforts to marine species and ecosystems have not yet been empirically demonstrated. We examined more than 40 years of Hawaiian monk seal marine debris entanglement records before and after large-scale marine debris removal efforts were initiated in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, demonstrating a substantial reduction in entanglement rates where debris removal effort was most concentrated. Large-scale and sustained removal of abandoned, lost, or otherwise discarded fishing gear meaningfully benefits marine ecosystems and has the potential to be transformational in restoration efforts.",

The mechanism of Pi efflux, activated by inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs), has remained unclear. This study presents cryo-electron microscopy structures of XPR1 in multiple conformations, revealing a transmembrane pathway for Pi export and a dual-binding activation pattern by PP-IPs. A canonical binding site is located at the dimeric interface of SPX domains, and a second site, biased toward PP-IPs, is found between the transmembrane and SPX domains. By integrating structural studies with electrophysiological analyses, we characterize XPR1 as an IPs/PP-IPs-activated phosphate channel. The interplay among its TMDs, SPX domains, and IPs/PP-IPs orchestrates the conformational transition between its closed and open states.",

A successful activation strategy would necessitate a bathochromic shift in the absorbance profile, an increase in triplet diradical lifetime, and ease of further functionalization. We present a single-flask transformation of carboxylic acids to acyl phosphonates that can access synthetically useful triplet diradicals under visible light or near-ultraviolet irradiation. The use of phosphorus circumvents unproductive Norrish type I processes, promoting selectivity that enables hydrogen-atom transfer reactivity. Use of this strategy promotes the efficient scaffold remodeling of carboxylic acids through various annulation, contraction, and expansion manifolds.",

The 2023 to 2024 eruptions at Sundhnúksgígar in the Svartsengi volcanic system, Iceland, provide an opportunity to observe the behavior of a mid-crustal magma domain at high spatial and temporal resolution by detailed sampling and geochemical characterization. We observed substantial mantle-derived geochemical variability in the products erupted in the first hours of the December 2023, January, February, and March-May 2024 eruptions, indicating the eruptions derived from multiple magma reservoirs, which mineral-melt equilibration pressures place in the mid-crust. The unusual presence of geochemical heterogeneity in the mid-crustal magma domain provides an insight into how dynamic and complex mid-crustal magma domains can be.",

In this work, we show that the Ser 23/24 -encoding exon 3 of TNNI3 was pseudoexonized multiple times in shrews and moles to mimic Ser 23/24 phosphorylation without adrenergic stimulation, facilitating the evolution of exceptionally high resting heart rates (~1000 beats per minute). We further reveal alternative exon 3 splicing in distantly related bat families and confirm that both cTnI splice variants are incorporated into cardiac myofibrils. Because exon 3 of human TNNI3 exhibits a relatively low splice strength score, our findings offer an evolutionarily informed strategy to excise this exon to improve diastolic function during heart failure.",

However, the carbon is mostly returned to the atmosphere by decomposition. We found a 3775-year-old ancient wood log buried 2 meters belowground that was preserved far beyond its expected lifetime. The wood had near-perfect preservation, with carbon loss less than 5% compared to a modern sample. The lack of decay is likely due to the low permeability of the compact clay soil at the burial site. Our observation suggests a hybrid nature-engineering approach for carbon removal by burying woody biomass in similar anoxic environments. We estimate a global sequestration potential of up to 10 gigatonnes CO 2 per year with existing technology at a low cost of $30 to $100 per tonne after optimization.",

Inspired by nature’s ability to selectively extract species in transpiration, we report a solar transpiration–powered lithium extraction and storage (STLES) device that can extract and store lithium from brines using natural sunlight. Specifically, the device uses a hierarchically structured solar transpirational evaporator to create a pressure gradient, which allows for the extraction of lithium from brines through a membrane and its storage in a vascular storage layer. Long-term experiments, various membrane tests, and different size assessments demonstrate the stability, compatibility, and scalability of STLES. This solar-powered mining technology provides an alternative developing pathway toward the sustainable extraction of critical resources.",

We and others have shown that disruption of the circadian clock drives the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). While certain bacterial species have been suggested to play driver roles in CRC, it is unknown whether the intestinal clock impinges on the microbiome to accelerate CRC pathogenesis. To address this, genetic disruption of the circadian clock, in an Apc- driven mouse model of CRC, was used to define the impact on the gut microbiome. When clock disruption is combined with CRC, metagenomic sequencing identified dysregulation of many bacterial genera including Bacteroides , Helicobacter , and Megasphaera. We identify functional changes to microbial pathways including dysregulated nucleic acid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as disruption of intestinal barrier function. Our findings suggest that clock disruption impinges on microbiota composition and intestinal permeability that may contribute to CRC pathogenesis.",

We present a data-driven synthesis of GHG emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters considering water body types, cryosphere zones, and seasonality. We find that annual GHG emissions are dominated by carbon dioxide ( 1149.2 1004.8 1307.5 teragrams of CO 2 ; median Q 1 Q 3 ) and methane ( 14.2 10.1 18.5 teragrams of CH 4 ), while the nitrous oxide emission ( 5.4 − 1.4 12.2 gigagrams of N 2 O) is minor. The annual CO 2 –equivalent (CO 2 e) GHG emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters total 1.5 1.3 1.8 or 2.3 1.8 2.8 petagrams of CO 2 e using the 100- or 20-year global warming potentials, respectively. Rivers emit 64% more CO 2 e GHGs than lakes, despite having only one-fifth of their surface area. The continuous permafrost zone contributed half of the inland water GHG emissions. Annual CO 2 e emissions from northern cryosphere inland waters exceed the region’s terrestrial net ecosystem exchange, highlighting the important role of inland waters in the cryospheric land-aquatic continuum under a warming climate.",

However, pregnancy-related respiratory immune adaptations in response to influenza infection and their impact on disease severity remain unclear. Here, we describe, in a preclinical model of mid-gestation pregnancy, a mechanism of enhanced host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) localized to the nasal cavity that limits viral replication and reduces the magnitude of intrapulmonary immune responses. Consequently, the pregnant mice show reduced pulmonary pathology and preserved airway function after IAV infection. The early restriction of viral replication is independent of type I interferon (IFN) but dependent on increased antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) driven by interleukin-17 + (IL-17 + ) γδ + T cells within the nasal passages. This pathway of host defense against IAV infection in the upper airways during pregnancy restricts early viral infection and prevents virus dissemination into the lung supporting maternal fitness.",

We used published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data to train a random forest machine-learning model using geologic, geochemical, and temperature explanatory variables and create a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas. Using these predicted lithium maps with reservoir parameters and geologic information, we calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas, which represents 35 to 136% of the current US lithium resource estimate.

Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, the 21URNAs, are implicated in regulating coding sequences; the messenger RNA targets and biological processes they control during spermatogenesis are largely unknown. We demonstrate that loss of 21URNAs compromises homolog pairing and makes it permissive for nonhomologous synapsis resulting in defects in crossover formation and chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis. We identify Polo-like kinase 3 (PLK-3), among others, as a 21URNA target. 21URNA activity restricts PLK-3 protein to proliferative cells, and expansion of PLK-3 in pachytene overlaps with the meiotic defects. Removal of plk-3 results in quantitative genetic suppression of the meiotic defects. One discrete 21URNA inhibits PLK-3 expression in late pachytene cells. Together, these results suggest that the 21URNAs function as pachytene piRNAs during C. elegans spermatogenesis.

(U-Th)/He dating of the ferricrete nodules revealed an age of 102.8 + 10.6/−11.4 thousand years, corresponding to marine isotope stage 5c. The (U-Th)/He age thus directly dates the wettest interglacial period in the region over the last 500 thousand years, which was responsible for the dissolution that formed the pinnacles. The reliability of the ferricrete (U-Th)/He age is supported by bounding optically stimulated luminescence and U-Th dates on associated aeolianites and carbonate precipitates, respectively. A (U-Th)/He approach is globally applicable to aeolianites with associated ferricretes, allowing more accurate dating of the environmental changes affecting these lithologies, and temporally constraining rapid Pleistocene climatic oscillations to better contextualize the associated evolution of the biosphere.",

Through topic modeling, SpaTopic stratifies the TME into spatial domains with coherent cellular organization, facilitating refined annotation of the spatial architecture with improved performance. We assess SpaTopic across various tumor types and show accurate prediction of tertiary lymphoid structures and tumor boundaries. Moreover, marker genes derived from SpaTopic are transferrable and can be applied to mark spatial domains in other datasets. In addition, SpaTopic enables quantitative comparison and functional characterization of spatial domains across SRT datasets.

We show that, like for Fe, Ryugu and CI chondrites also have indistinguishable Ni isotope anomalies, which differ from those of other carbonaceous chondrites. We propose that this unique Fe and Ni isotopic composition reflects different accretion efficiencies of small FeNi metal grains among the carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. The CI chondrites incorporated these grains more efficiently, possibly because they formed at the end of the disk’s lifetime, when planetesimal formation was also triggered by photoevaporation of the disk. Isotopic variations among carbonaceous chondrites may thus reflect fractionation of distinct dust components from a common reservoir, implying CI chondrites/Ryugu may have formed in the same region of the accretion disk as other carbonaceous chondrites.",

We use high-resolution genomic sourcing methods to track walrus artifacts back to specific hunting grounds, demonstrating that Greenland Norse obtained ivory from High Arctic waters, especially the North Water Polynya, and possibly from the interior Canadian Arctic. These results substantially expand the assumed range of Greenland Norse ivory harvesting activities and support intriguing archaeological evidence for substantive interactions with Thule Inuit, plus possible encounters with Tuniit (Late Dorset Pre-Inuit).",

However, traditional synthesis methods for cg-N predominantly rely on high-pressure techniques or the utilization of nanoconfined effects using highly toxic and sensitive sodium azide as precursor, which substantially restrict its practical application. On the basis of the first-principles simulations, we found that adsorption of potassium on the cg-N surface exhibits superior stabilization compared to sodium. Then, we chose safer potassium azide as precursor for synthesizing cg-N. Through plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition treatment, the free-standing cg-N was successfully synthesized without the need for high-pressure and nanoconfined effects. It demonstrated excellent thermal stability up to 760 K, and then rapid and intense thermal decomposition occurred, exhibiting typical thermal decomposition behaviors of high-energy-density materials. The explosion parameters were also measured using laser-induced plasma spectroscopy. Our work has substantially promoted the practical application of cg-N as HEDMs.",

Here, we shed light on this issue by analyzing the rich patterns supported by identical Kuramoto oscillators on hypergraphs. We show that higher-order interactions can have opposite effects on linear stability and basin stability: They stabilize twisted states (including full synchrony) by improving their linear stability, but also make them hard to find by markedly reducing their basin size.

Inducible deletion of Mettl3 in murine keratinocytes results in spontaneous skin inflammation and increases susceptibility to cutaneous inflammation with activation of neutrophil recruitment. Therapeutically, restoration of m 6 A alleviates the disease phenotypes in mice and suppresses inflammation in human biopsy specimens. We support a model in which m 6 A modification stabilizes the mRNA of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme ELOVL6 via the m 6 A reader IGF2BP3, leading to a rewiring of fatty acid metabolism with a reduction in palmitic acid accumulation and, consequently, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis in cutaneous inflammation.

Differences in the inflammatory microenvironment emerged as an explanation for such stage dependency. Functional analyses revealed that enhancing neuroinflammation is sufficient to trigger Müller cell proliferation, not only in young tadpoles but also in mice. In addition, we showed that microglia are absolutely required for the response of mouse Müller cells to mitogenic factors while negatively affecting their neurogenic potential. However, both cell cycle reentry and neurogenic gene expression are allowed when applying sequential pro- and anti-inflammatory treatments. This reveals that inflammation benefits Müller glia proliferation in both regenerative and nonregenerative vertebrates and highlights the importance of sequential inflammatory modulation to create a regenerative permissive microenvironment.",

In contrast, generation of the ADO knockout mouse revealed high tolerance for ADO depletion in adult tissues. To understand the mechanism underlying ADO’s essentiality in cancer cells, we characterized the cell proteome and metabolome following depletion of ADO. This revealed that ADO depletion leads to toxic levels of polyamines which can be driven by ADO’s substrate cysteamine. Polyamine accumulation in turn stimulated expression of proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) which resulted in mitochondrial hyperactivity and ROS production, culminating in cell toxicity. This work identifies ADO as a unique vulnerability in cancer cells, due to its essential role in maintenance of redox homeostasis through restraining polyamine levels and proline catabolism.",

However, in metal-free systems, the spin orbitals are largely delocalized, and weak coupling between the spins in the lattice hampers long-range ordering. Metal-free magnetism is of fundamental interest to physical sciences, unlocking unprecedented dimensions for strongly correlated materials and biocompatible magnets. Here, we present a strategy to achieve strong coupling between spin centers of planar radical monomers in π-conjugated two-dimensional (2D) polymers and rationally control the orderings. If the π-states in these triangulene-based 2D polymers are half-occupied, then we predict that they are antiferromagnetic Mott-Hubbard insulators. Incorporating a boron or nitrogen heteroatom per monomer results in Stoner ferromagnetism and half-metallicity, with the Fermi level located at spin-polarized Dirac points. An unprecedented antiferromagnetic half-semiconductor is observed in a binary boron-nitrogen–centered 2D polymer.

Further, peripheral eosinophilia and tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia (TATE) predicts a better response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in breast cancer. However, how and if estrogens affect eosinophil biology in tumors and how this influences ICB efficacy has not been determined. Here, we report that estrogens decrease the number of peripheral eosinophils and TATE, and this contributes to increased tumor growth in validated murine models of breast cancer and melanoma. Moreover, estrogen signaling in healthy female mice also suppressed peripheral eosinophil prevalence by decreasing the proliferation and survival of maturing eosinophils. Inhibiting estrogen receptor (ER) signaling decreased tumor growth in an eosinophil-dependent manner. Further, the efficacy of ICBs was increased when administered in combination with anti-estrogens. These findings highlight the importance of ER signaling as a regulator of eosinophil biology and TATE and highlight the potential near-term clinical application of ER modulators to increase ICB efficacy in multiple tumor types.",

However, oxidative stabilization of Sn(II) has remained an unresolved challenge as its reactivity with water and dioxygen results in loss of functionality, limiting technological advancement. Approaches to slow Sn(II) oxidation with chelating ligands or sacrificial electron donors have yielded only moderate improvements. We demonstrate here that the addition of nitrate to pyrophosphate-chelated Sn(II) (aq) suppresses Sn(II) oxidation in water across a broad pH range. Evidence of hydroxyl radical concentration reduction and detection of a radical nitrogen species that only forms in the presence of chelated Sn(II) point to a radical-based reaction mechanism. While this chemistry can be broadly applied, we present that this approach maintains Sn(II)’s antibacterial and anti-inflammatory efficacies as an example of sustained oral chemotherapeutic functionality.",

Large expansions of plasma Anelloviridae , Parvoviridae , Circoviridae and other commensal viruses, and elevated levels of inflammation and D-dimer were observed since the chronic phase of SIV infection. Anelloviridae abundance appears to correlate positively with the CD4 + T cell count but negatively with SIV load especially at the acute phase, whereas other commensal viruses’ abundances show opposite correlations with the two disease markers. Antiretroviral therapy slightly reduces but does not substantially reverse the expansion of commensal viruses.

We demonstrate that a regular sequence structure facilitated the formation of big nanofibers with a high degree of aggregation, providing the loose and porous thin film with simultaneously improved charge transport, stretchability, and self-healability. The mobility of damaged devices can be recovered to 81% after a healing treatment.

Limited perfusion coupled with the high metabolic demand of growing tumors has led to the hypothesis that many tumors experience metabolic stress driven by limited availability of nutrients such as glucose, oxygen, and amino acids in the tumor. Such metabolic stress has important implications for the biology of cells in the microenvironment, affecting both disease progression and response to therapies. Recently, techniques have been developed to identify limiting nutrients and resulting metabolic stresses in solid tumors. These techniques have greatly expanded our understanding of the metabolic limitations in tumors.

Comprehensive analyses of SRSF6 alterations (copy number/mRNA/protein) were conducted across eight well-characterized PCa cohorts and the Hi-MYC transgenic model. SRSF6 was up-regulated in PCa samples, correlating with adverse clinical parameters. Functional assays, both in vitro (cell proliferation, migration, colony, and tumorsphere formation) and in vivo (xenograft tumors), demonstrated the impact of SRSF6 modulation on critical cancer hallmarks. Mechanistically, SRSF6 regulates the splicing pattern of the histone-chaperone HIRA , consequently affecting the activity of H3.3 in PCa and breast cancer cell models and disrupting pivotal oncogenic pathways (AR and E2F) in PCa cells.

However, in real systems with the finite thickness of the device material being larger than the magnetic exchange length, the skyrmion spin texture extends into the third dimension and cannot be assumed as homogeneous. Using soft x-ray laminography, we reconstruct with about 20-nanometer spatial (voxel) size the full three-dimensional spin texture of a skyrmion in an 800-nanometer-diameter and 95-nanometer-thin disk patterned into a 30× [iridium/cobalt/platinum] multilayered film. A quantitative analysis finds that the evolution of the radial profile of the topological skyrmion number is nonuniform across the thickness of the disk. Estimates of the micromagnetic energy densities suggest that the changes in topological profile are related to nonuniform competing energetic interactions.

Here, we observed single Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomal scanning complexes in real time, finding that they scan diverse mRNA leaders at a rate of 10 to 20 nt s −1 . We show that specific binding of a protein to its mRNA leader sequence substantially arrests scanning. Conversely, impairing scanning-complex guanosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis results in native start-site bypass. Our results illustrate an mRNA-centric, kinetically controlled regulatory model where the ribosomal pre-initiation complex amplifies a nuanced energetic landscape to regulate scanning and start-site selection fidelity.",

Depending on the organism, multiple PmtAs may be required for producing monomethyl- and dimethyl-PE derivatives along with PC, whereas in organisms such as Rubellimicrobium thermophilum , a single enzyme is sufficient to direct all three methylation steps. In this study, we present the x-ray crystal structures of PmtA from R. thermophilum in complex with dimethyl-PE and S -adenosyl- l -homocysteine, as well as in its lipid-free form. Moreover, we demonstrate that the enzyme associates with the cellular membrane via electrostatic interactions facilitated by a group of critical basic residues and can successively methylate PE and its methylated derivatives, culminating in the production of PC.",

Here, we demonstrate a continuous-wave laser threshold as a function of the pump intensity on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers. To achieve this, we constructed a laser cavity with both an NV diamond medium and an intracavity antireflection-coated diode laser. This dual-medium approach compensates intrinsic losses of the cavity by providing a fixed additional gain below threshold of the diode laser. We observe a continuous-wave laser threshold of the laser system and linewidth narrowing with increasing green pump power on the NV centers.

ATR inhibition in SCLC activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING)–mediated interferon signaling, recruits T cells, and augments the antitumor immune response of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade in mouse models. We demonstrate that combined ATR and PD-L1 inhibition causes improved antitumor response than PD-L1 alone as the second-line treatment in SCLC. This study shows that targeting ATR up-regulates major histocompatibility class I expression in preclinical models and SCLC clinical samples collected from a first-in-class clinical trial of ATR inhibitor, berzosertib, with topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC.

However, the chain transfer reaction impedes the formation of polymers from many common α-olefins such as propene and 1-butene using this method. Consequently, poly(α-olefins) are predominantly produced via coordination polymerization. To address this limitation, we have devised a strategy involving group transfer radical polymerization (GTRP) to facilitate the radical homopolymerization to access carbon-chain poly(α-olefins). This approach enables the precise construction of a diverse array of carbon-chain poly(α-olefins) with high molecular weights. Furthermore, by using nonconventional monomers, we extend the applicability of this technique to the copolymerization of α-olefins with acrylonitrile, paving the way for the synthesis of copolymers with different monomers. To investigate the properties of the polymers obtained by this method, one of the poly(α-olefins) is studied as an interphase layer material in anode-free Li metal batteries, and the results indicate the potential of the polymer in energy storage applications.",

Four distinct stages of infection were identified on the basis of viral load, with a peak in capsid-encoding RNA2 coinciding with the first signs of viral egression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed temporal changes in gene expression and functions induced by the infection. A specific set of up-regulated genes remained active throughout the infection, and genes correlated and anticorrelated with virus accumulation were identified.

The area of the thickened transition zone exhibits faster-than-average velocities according to recent tomographic images, suggesting perturbed postolivine phase boundaries shifting in response to lowered temperatures.

Activation of NOD1 in vivo augments antitumor immunity and enhances the effectiveness of anti–PD-1 therapy. Mechanistically, NOD1 activation resulted in diminished expression of perilipin 5, thereby hindering fatty acid oxidation and inducing free fatty acid accumulation in TAMs. This metabolic alteration promoted membrane localization of the costimulatory molecule OX40L in a lipid modification–dependent manner, thereby activating CD8 + T cells.

Unexpectedly, the tendons’ collagen molecules were not mechanically unfolded by running but denatured through proteolysis during physiological post-run remodeling. We further revealed that running induces inflammatory gene expressions in Achilles tendons and that long-term running causes prolonged, elevated collagen degradation, leading to the accumulation of denatured collagen and tendinopathy development. For applications, we demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging of collagenase-induced Achilles tendon injury in vivo using a denatured collagen targeting contrast agent.

Although this concept was introduced over two decades ago, its observation was previously limited to electromagnetic waves. In this study, we demonstrate this quantum interference effect using massive particles that tunnel between three micro-optical traps (“optical tweezers”). We begin by preparing ultracold fermionic atoms in low vibrational eigenstates of one trap, followed by manipulating the distance between the traps to execute the SAP protocol. We observe a smooth and high-efficiency transfer of atoms between the two outer traps, with a very low population remaining in the central trap. These findings open possibilities for advanced control schemes in optical tweezer array platforms.",

By integrating AlphaFold modeling with comprehensive high-resolution mutational scanning, we show that α helices in substrates bind B55 through an evolutionary conserved mechanism. Despite a large diversity in sequence and composition, these α helices share key amino acid determinants that engage discrete hydrophobic and electrostatic patches. Using deep learning protein design, we generate a specific and potent competitive peptide inhibitor of PP2A-B55 substrate interactions. With this inhibitor, we uncover that PP2A-B55 regulates the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex by binding to an α-helical recruitment module in the RNA binding protein 7 (RBM7), a component of the NEXT complex. Collectively, our findings provide a framework for the understanding and interrogation of PP2A-B55 function in health and disease.",

Transcriptome analysis was performed on livers from mice engineered for deletion of the flow-sensing PIEZO1 channel in endothelium. This revealed unique up-regulation of Cyp7a1 , which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for bile synthesis from cholesterol in hepatocytes. Consistent with this effect were increased gallbladder and plasma bile acids and lowered hepatic and plasma cholesterol. Elevated portal fluid flow acting via endothelial PIEZO1 and genetically enhanced PIEZO1 conversely suppressed Cyp7a1 . Activation of hepatic endothelial PIEZO1 channels promoted phosphorylation of nitric oxide synthase 3, and portal flow-mediated suppression of Cyp7a1 depended on nitric oxide synthesis, suggesting endothelium-to-hepatocyte coupling via nitric oxide. PIEZO1 variants in people were associated with hepatobiliary disease and dyslipidemia. The data suggest an endothelial force sensing mechanism that controls lipid regulation in parenchymal cells to modulate whole-body lipid homeostasis.",

The prr5 toc1 double mutant has a shortened period at higher temperatures, resulting in weak temperature compensation. Low ambient temperature reduces amounts of PRR5 and TOC1. In low-temperature conditions, PRR5 and TOC1 interact with LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2), a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) complex. The lkp2 mutations attenuate low temperature–induced decrease of PRR5 and TOC1, and the mutants display longer period only at lower temperatures.

Therefore, the prepared perovskite film and the final film actually working in devices are not exactly the same, and the contribution of film optimization to the device improvement was weakened. We designed a bilayer structure composed of graphene oxide and graphite flakes to eliminate the unwanted film inconsistencies and thus save the film optimization loss.

Here, we show that a membrane channel protein, chloride intracellular channel protein-1 (Clic1), can physically interact with ERα with a preference to the membrane-bound ERα. Clic1-mediated currents can be enhanced by E 2 and reduced by its depletion. In addition, Clic1 currents are required to mediate the E 2 -induced rapid excitations in multiple brain ERα populations. Further, genetic disruption of Clic1 in hypothalamic ERα neurons blunts the regulations of E 2 on female body weight balance. In conclusion, we identified the Clic1 chloride channel as a key mediator for E 2 -induced rapid neuronal excitation, which may have a broad impact on multiple neurobiological processes regulated by E 2 .",

We identify a convergent population of spinal interneurons recruited by diverse itch-causing stimuli that represents a subset of neurons that express the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). Moreover, we find that itch is conveyed to the brain via GRPR-expressing spinal output neurons that target the lateral parabrachial nuclei. We then show that the kappa opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine relieves itch by selectively inhibiting GRPR spinoparabrachial neurons.

          "abstract": "Humans and birds use very different running styles. Unlike humans, birds adopt “grounded running” at intermediate speeds—a running gait where at least one foot always maintains ground contact. Avian grounded running is a paradox: Animals usually minimize locomotor energy expenditure, but birds prefer grounded running despite incurring higher energy costs. Using predictive gait simulations of the emu ( Dromaius novaehollandiae ), we resolve this paradox by demonstrating that grounded running represents an optimal gait for birds, from both energetics and muscle excitations perspectives. Our virtual experiments decoupled effects of posture and tendon elasticity, biomechanically relevant anatomical features that cannot be isolated in real birds. The avian body plan prevents (near) vertical leg postures, making the running style used by humans impossible. Under this anatomical constraint, grounded running is optimal if the muscles produce the highest forces in crouched postures, as is true in most birds. Shared anatomical features suggest that, as a behavior, avian grounded running first evolved within non-avian dinosaurs.",

In our case, these internal Oersted fields have an orders of magnitude higher spin-wave excitation efficiency than commonly used stripline antennas.

While a general decreasing trend in legacy POP concentrations is evident across various maritime regions, highlighting the success of source control measures, the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas have experienced a rise in POP levels. This increase suggests the northward migration of pollutants via ocean currents from mid-latitude regions to polar areas. Despite global efforts to reduce emissions, the continued transport and accumulation of pollutants to the Arctic regions may have substantial ecological impacts. Addressing these environmental challenges demands a thorough understanding of POP dynamics, including response times, multiphase transport, and biogeochemical cycling.

The hydrothermal alteration of ultramafic rocks, rich in Fe(II) and Mg, forms both abiotic methane, serpentine, and high-surface-area smectite clays. Given the abundance of ultramafic rocks and smectite in the Martian upper crust and the growing evidence of organic carbon in Martian sedimentary rocks, we quantify the effects of ultramafic alteration on the carbon cycle of early Mars. We calculate the capacity of Noachian-age clays to store organic carbon. Up to 1.7 bar of CO 2 can plausibly be adsorbed on clay surfaces. Coupling abiotic methanogenesis with best estimates of Mars’ δ 13 C history predicts a reservoir of 0.6 to 1.3 bar of CO 2 equivalent. Such a reservoir could be used as an energy source for long-term missions. Our results further illustrate the control of water-rock reactions on the atmospheric evolution of planets.",

Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the presence of a CD40-expressing CD206 + CD163 + macrophage population dominating the inflamed RA synovium, associated with disease activity and treatment response. In-depth RNA sequencing and metabolic analysis demonstrated that this macrophage population is transcriptionally distinct, displaying unique inflammatory and tissue-resident gene signatures, has a stable bioenergetic profile, and regulates stromal cell responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling of 67,908 RA and HC synovial tissue cells identified nine transcriptionally distinct macrophage clusters. IL-1B + CCL20 + and SPP1 + MT2A + are the principal macrophage clusters in RA synovium, displaying heightened CD40 gene expression, capable of shaping stromal cell responses, and are importantly enriched before disease onset. Combined, these findings identify the presence of an early pathogenic myeloid signature that shapes the RA joint microenvironment and represents a unique opportunity for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.",

AD1b exhibited effective activity against drug-resistant bacterial infections in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that AD1b targeted the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), leading to the disruption of the bacterial membrane and proton motive force, metabolic disturbance, leakage of cellular components, and, ultimately, cell death.

Macro x-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF), a well-established tool in this domain, generates complex and voluminous datasets that pose analytical challenges. To address this, we have incorporated machine learning strategies specifically designed for the analysis as they allow for identification of nontrivial dependencies and classification within these high-dimensional data, thereby promising comprehensive interrogation. We introduce a deep learning algorithm trained on a synthetic dataset that allows for fast and accurate analysis of the XRF spectra in MA-XRF datasets.

Drawing inspiration from the unparalleled selectivity of biological systems, which benefit from the sophisticated spatial organization of functionalities, we posit that manipulating the arrangement of the membrane’s building blocks, an aspect previously given limited attention, can address this challenge. We demonstrate that optimizing the face-to-face orientation of building blocks during the assembly of covalent-organic-framework (COF) membranes improves ion-π interactions with multivalent ions. This optimization leads to extraordinary selectivity in differentiating between monovalent cations and anions from their multivalent counterparts, achieving selectivity factors of 214 for K + /Al 3+ and 451 for NO 3 − /PO 4 3− . Leveraging this attribute, the COF membrane facilitates the direct extraction of NaCl from seawater with a purity of 99.57%.

Here, we present a reconciling framework—contrastive coding—based on a series of analyses relating category selectivity within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, category-selective tuning naturally emerges for faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits, highlighting their distinct functional roles in information processing. Finally, these pre-identified units can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of human visual cortex, under a highly constrained sparse positive encoding procedure. The success of this single model indicates that brain-like functional specialization can emerge without category-specific learning pressures, as the system learns to untangle rich image content. Contrastive coding, therefore, provides a unifying account of object category emergence and representation in the human brain.",

However, the deployment of strain-engineered nanocatalysts faces challenges, in particular in maintaining highly strained nanocrystals under reaction conditions. Here, we introduce a morphology-dependent effect that stabilizes surface strain even under harsh reaction conditions. Using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM), we found that cube-shaped core-shell Au@Pd nanoparticles with sharp-edged morphologies sustain coherent heteroepitaxial interfaces with larger critical thicknesses than morphologies with rounded edges. This configuration inhibits dislocation nucleation due to reduced shear stress at corners, as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations. A Suzuki-type cross-coupling reaction shows that our approach achieves a fourfold increase in activity over conventional nanocatalysts, owing to the enhanced stability of surface strain. These findings contribute to advancing the development of advanced nanocatalysts and indicate broader applications for strain engineering in various fields.",

During this time, marine biota was affected by global climate cooling and the restriction of the Mediterranean’s connection to the Atlantic Ocean that peaked with the Messinian salinity crisis. Although the net change in species richness from the Tortonian to the Zanclean varies by group, species turnover is greater than 30% in all cases, reflecting a high degree of reorganization of the marine ecosystem after the crisis.

To investigate this, we conducted laboratory experiments to replicate how the signature of the organic-rich regions would degrade due to radiation. Our findings indicate a fast degradation rate, implying the exposure of buried organics within the past few million years. This degradation rate, coupled with observed quantities, implies that the aliphatics must be present in substantial quantities within the shallow subsurface.

However, γ T has declined since then. Understanding whether these variations in γ T reflect forced changes or internal climate variability in the carbon cycle is crucial for future climate projections. We show that doubling sensitivity events can arise in simulations by Earth system models with perturbed initial conditions but are likely explained by internal climate variability. We show that the doubling sensitivity event is associated with the occurrence of a few, but very strong, El Niño events, such as 1982/83 and 1997/98. Such extreme events result in concurrent carbon release by tropical and extratropical ecosystems, increasing the variance of the global land carbon sink and its apparent sensitivity to tropical temperature.

By contrast, little is known about forces perpendicular to the spindle axis, which determine the metaphase plate configuration and thus the location of chromosomes in the subsequent nucleus. Using live-cell microscopy, we find that metaphase chromosomes are spatially anti-correlated in mouse oocyte spindles, evidence of previously unknown long-range forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis. We explain this observation by showing that the spindle’s microtubule network behaves as a nematic liquid crystal and that deformation of the nematic field around embedded chromosomes causes long-range repulsion between them.",

Plasmonic picocavities, i.e., cavities with mode volumes below 1 nm 3 , could act as enhanced antennas due to their extreme field confinement, but the directionality on their emission is difficult to control. In this work, we show that the plasmonic picocavity formed between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a metal surface with a monoatomic step shows directional emission profiles and, thus, can be considered as a realization of a picoantenna. Electromagnetic calculations demonstrate that the observed directionality arises from the reshaping and tilting of the surface charges induced at the scanning tip due to the atomic step.

Here, we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. Moreover, complementation with tissue-specific promoters requires the genuine BRI1 gene body sequence, which confers ubiquitous expression of trace receptor amounts that are sufficient to promote brassinosteroid-dependent root growth.

Here, we present a rectification mechanism for magnetism that we call magnonic rectification, where a spin precession is converted into a quasi-static magnetization through the force exerted by a coupled chiral phonon mode.
