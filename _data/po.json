          "title": "Decomposing Residential Resale House Prices into Structure and Land Components",
          "authors": "Erwin Diewert, Ning Huang",
          "abstract": "The use of hedonic regression models on the sales of detached housing units is widespread in the real estate literature. However, these models do not address the need to decompose the sale price into structure and land components. For many purposes, it is necessary to obtain separate estimates for the price and quantity of housing structures and the land that these structures sit on. The builder’s model accomplishes this decomposition but it takes a producer’s perspective and requires an exogeneous structure price index. In the present paper, a consumer approach to the decomposition problem is taken and this “new” approach to the decomposition problem does not require the use of an exogenous building price index. The paper uses data on sales of detached houses in Richmond, British Columbia in order to implement the new approach. The property price indexes generated by the new approach are compared to the corresponding indexes generated by a traditional time dummy hedonic regression model. The traditional hedonic regression approach does generate reasonable overall property price indexes, but the two approaches do not generate similar land and structure subindexes.",

          "title": "Digital Surveillance and Relational Uncertainty: The Role of Geolocation Tracking in Romantic Relationships",
          "authors": "Shaojung Sharon Wang, Shiuan-Tung Chen",
          "abstract": "As geolocation tracking apps become increasingly embedded in everyday digital interactions, their role in romantic relationships remains underexplored. This study examines the use of geolocation tracking apps in romantic relationships, addressing gaps in understanding their implications for relational uncertainty while identifying key psychological antecedents of app use. Findings from users ( N = 333) challenge the assumption that geolocation tracking inherently reduces relational uncertainty, revealing no significant association with increased clarity. Instead, intensive tracking correlates with heightened definition uncertainty, suggesting that rather than reinforcing relationship security, tracking may introduce ambiguity about the relationship’s status. However, it is not associated with diminished intimacy, as couples may use it consensually for safety and reassurance. Moreover, attachment styles and jealousy predict tracking behaviors, mirroring patterns observed in social media surveillance. These findings highlight the limitations of geolocation tracking as an uncertainty-reducing tool and emphasize the psychological and relational factors that drive its use. By reframing geolocation tracking as a socially accepted yet relationally complex form of monitoring, this study advances theoretical discussions on digital surveillance and the evolving role of technology in intimate relationships.",
