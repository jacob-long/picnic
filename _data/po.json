          "authors": "Fabio Ricciato",
          "abstract": "In this note, we present a plausible structural mechanism by which over-parameterized deep learning models trained on real data may produce pseudo-synthetic data that constitute merely a diﬀerent representation (or re-encoding) of the training data. We conjecture that, in principle, similar mechanisms may be learned by large-scale AI models even if they are not intentionally designed to do so. From there, we derive some cautionary warnings for potential adopters of pseudo-synthetic data generation tools based on deep learning. We claim that the burden of proof that no data re-encoding mechanism is at play in AI-based generation models rests with their proponents.",

          "authors": "Deji Suolang, Jiazhi Yang, Lauren Miller, Joseph B Rodhouse, Elina T Page, Yajuan Si, Brady T West",
          "abstract": "In multi-day diary surveys, participants decide daily whether to continue. The day-level nonresponse can introduce nonresponse errors, and underreporting tends to increase over the data collection period. To address these problems, we propose an adjustment by either the construction of person-day level survey weights or multiple imputation (MI). This study used data from the US National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey (FoodAPS) and focused on four key outcomes in this survey: the occurrence and expenditure of daily food-at-home (FAH) and food-away-from-home (FAFH) events reported by individuals. We employed logistic regression models and conditional inference trees to predict daily response propensities and used the inverse of predicted response propensity as an adjustment factor for the existing FoodAPS household weights. As an alternative, we conducted MI for the key outcome variables using chained equations and fit zero-inflated imputation models for counts and semi-continuous variables to allow bounds and subset restrictions. The results show that raw estimates for the key variables are consistently smaller than those produced by any weighting or imputation techniques, indicating that some form of adjustment is necessary. Person-day level weights and MI show varying impacts across outcome variables, with MI offering a modest efficiency gain. We also performed a sensitivity analysis that employs an alternative definition of missingness, which yielded different MI estimates. This study offers valuable insights into addressing nonresponse errors in multi-day diary surveys and contributes to methodological approaches for conducting innovative weighting and imputation with complex data structures.",

          "abstract": "This article presents a Bayesian multiple-output quantile regression for complex survey data under informative sampling. Our approach relies on the asymmetric Laplace distributional assumption. From the location-scale mixture representation of this distribution, we introduce an Expectation–Maximization algorithm that provides a less computationally intensive alternative to the commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. Our developments are mainly motivated by the joint analysis of growth indexes for Brazilian children under five.",

          "title": "Measuring Party Identification in Public Opinion Surveys of Americans",
          "authors": "Joshua J Dyck, Jack Santucci",
          "abstract": "How should we measure “pure” or “true” independents? For years, the respective item required a respondent to volunteer that answer. Recent surveys have moved toward presenting it explicitly. Those that do produce estimates of pure independents that are much larger than in past surveys. We present evidence of this phenomenon across multiple surveys and ask: Are self-administered surveys overcounting independents, or are traditional live-interviewer surveys undercounting independents? We answer that question by comparing live-interview and self-administered samples from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, by undertaking tests to rule out mode effects (including an experiment), and by seeing which question wording correlates more strongly with measures of latent ideology, vote choice, and ratings of the parties. Our findings suggest that surveys that include an explicit response option, allowing Americans to self-identify easily as “(pure) independent,” offer a more precise measurement of the concept of party identification. This has implications for the study of independents, as well as for discussions about polarization and party-system dealignment.",

          "abstract": "Electoral democracy rests on the conferral of Loser’s Consent. The Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021—and the widespread sympathy for it that endures among Republican citizens and elected officials—can be understood as an unprecedented denial of that Consent. We hypothesize that insurrectionist sympathies among 2020 election losers are structured in part by hypercompetitiveness—a psychological need to win at all costs. Using original survey data collected in the spring of 2022, we find strong suggestive support for our hypothesis. Many of the Americans who fail to condemn the Capitol riot may not be simply knee-jerk partisans, well-intentioned victims of propaganda, or sycophants in thrall to a would-be authoritarian leader. Substantiating the anxieties of many observers, those people may instead be unwilling to abide by democratic rules if it means they have to lose.",

          "title": "Unmasking Coordination: How Inauthentic Behavior Emerged and Diffusion During the Russia–Ukraine War on Twitter",
          "authors": "Yanhong Wu, Jianqiang Yu",
          "abstract": "This study aims to explain the diffusion pathways of coordinated inauthentic behavior during the Russia–Ukraine conflict. A dataset of 685,491 tweets containing the hashtag #russia on Twitter was used to construct a coordination network based on textual similarity and time synchronicity. By identifying leader-follower relationships, analyzing hourly time slices, and analyzing evolution metrics, four key insights were revealed. First, leaders constitute a stable core with an average of about 1741 nodes while peripheral followers fluctuate substantially, indicating a resilient core-peripheral structure. Second, diffusion advances across multiple fronts rather than remaining within single communities, with 67.05% of leader-follower ties crossing content clusters and the top 30 leaders posting across an average of 7.1 clusters and up to 9. Third, apparent synchronization is not driven by posting density alone but arises from rhythmic coupling between leaders and followers, as followers respond after an average delay of about 30 min and cluster peaks typically occur within less than 1 hour of each other. Fourth, diffusion capacity is not released once and for all but regenerates along a trajectory that moves from concentration to multiploidization and then to restructuring. Based on the results, we conceptualize coordinated inauthentic behavior as a strategically adaptive system with regenerative properties and provide governance implications.",

          "abstract": "This study analyzes 15,000 user comments from ideologically distinct news platforms—Fox News (right-leaning), ABC News (left-leaning), and BBC News (centrist)—to investigate how political ideology shapes emotional expression and engagement following the July 2024 assassination attempt on President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. We examine whether right-leaning comments exhibit elevated anger and hate speech, whether left-leaning comments show greater empathy and positive affect, and how emotional intensity influences engagement metrics such as likes and shares. Using computational science methods, we trace the evolution of emotional tone and toxicity over time, focusing on affective polarization triggered by a high-salience violent event. Our findings reveal that ideological alignment amplifies engagement with congruent emotional content, reinforcing echo chambers and intensifying online hostility. We address gaps in understanding how ideological echo chambers amplify polarized emotions and online hostility following a high-profile violent event, emphasizing the place of emotions in contemporary political communication and digital news consumption.",

          "authors": "Mehdi Reza Sarafraz, Nasim Nazari, Aida Peyvandi",
          "abstract": "Recently, social media addiction (SMA) has increased globally. Like other addictions, it can have detrimental effects on individuals. Despite growing concerns, limited research has explored the relationship between SMA and critical thinking (CT) and the mechanisms underlying this connection. Therefore, this study investigated this relationship by focusing on executive function (EF) as a potential mediator. A survey using the Internet Addiction Test-Social Networking Sites (IAT–SNS) version, Critical Thinking Disposition, and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function—Adult Version (BRIEF-A) was conducted with 307 Iranian young adults aged 18 to 40 years (M = 23.35, SD = 4.45; 72.6% female). The findings revealed a significant positive association between executive dysfunction and SMA and a significant negative association between executive dysfunction and CT. Structural equation modeling indicated no direct correlation between SMA and CT; rather, the relationship was mediated by EF, with only the indirect effects via EF being statistically significant. These results suggest that executive dysfunction acts as a risk-enhancing mediator in the relationship between SMA and CT. Further experimental studies are required to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these associations. Interventions should be developed to mitigate the negative effects of SMA on EF and CT.",
