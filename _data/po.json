          "authors": "Benjamin J Newman",
          "abstract": "Past research demonstrates that the working poor are politically relevant, yet little is known about public opinion toward this group. This research note explores public beliefs about working poverty in the United States. The results suggest that most Americans are aware of the working poor and view working poverty as problematic and due to structural factors. Like many political attitudes, beliefs about the working poor are linked to Americans’ personal experiences—namely, their level of local exposure to low-income people. However, consistent with research on the role of race in shaping the politics of poverty and inequality, the linkage between local low-income populations and beliefs about the working poor is conditioned by the race of the local poor. Finally, the political relevance of beliefs about the working poor is illustrated by their substantively large relationships to preferences over spending on the poor and taxing the rich.",

          "title": "Reducing Racial Asymmetries in the Survey Overestimation of Voter Turnout",
          "authors": "David C Barker, Ray Block, Marcus Johnson, Jan Leighley",
          "abstract": "Research has consistently demonstrated that Black respondents are more likely than their White counterparts to overstate their plans or previous decisions to vote. We propose that by using a single question regarding turnout intention and candidate preference (rather than the typical approach of using two separate questions), survey researchers can reduce these racial asymmetries. The reason, we suggest, is that doing so encourages Black respondents to consider the turnout question through the lens of candidates and parties, rather than as a civic responsibility they have toward other Black Americans, which therefore mitigates the social desirability bias that leads to overestimation. We evaluate this argument using a survey experiment that randomly asks a control group of survey respondents to answer two voting questions—one about turnout and one about vote choice—and asks the other half of the sample, the treatment group, a single question that combines the two. Using original data from a nationally representative survey, we find that using the single turnout/preference question reduces the racial asymmetry in turnout overestimation substantially. We further observe that the decrease is concentrated among respondents with relatively high levels of campaign indifference and especially racial civic consciousness, a condition that is much more common among Black respondents than among White respondents. We believe these findings are particularly relevant to election scholars and campaign professionals, given their focus on understanding the thought processes of survey respondents and prospective voters, as well as improving the validity of self-reports in survey research.",

          "authors": "Francesco Colombo, Alessandro Ferrara, Elias Dinas, Foteini-Maria Vassou, Fabrizio Bernardi",
          "abstract": "Is anti-far-right grassroots mobilization effective? Scholars studying the far right have focused extensively on the causes and consequences of far-right success but have paid little attention to what citizens and civil society can do to tackle this phenomenon. Focusing on the surge of Sardine (the Sardines), an anti-far-right social movement, during the 2020 Italian regional elections, we test whether grassroots mobilization is an effective tool to curb far-right parties’ electoral performance. Employing municipality-level data on electoral results, Sardines rallies, and far-right events, we exploit a difference-in-differences design to identify the effect of local exposure to Sardine mobilization on the municipal electoral performance of far-right parties. The results suggest that local exposure to a Sardines event has a strong negative effect on far-right electoral results.",
