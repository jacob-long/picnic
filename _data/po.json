          "title": "The Direction and Meaning of Left-Right in Postcommunist Societies",
          "authors": "Ruth Dassonneville, Ian McAllister",
          "abstract": "Positioning on the left-right scale is often regarded as a heuristic that enables citizens to reduce the information costs involved in navigating the political world. Questions arise as to how citizens acquire it in former communist countries and what shapes their position on the left-right continuum. We address these questions using aggregate-level data from the 1990s to 2022 and survey data from 2002 to 2022. From the aggregate data, we find that citizens in postcommunist countries are consistently less likely than those in established democracies to adopt a left-right identification and this has not changed over time. From the survey data, we find no evidence that postcommunist citizens are coming to use left-right—socially, attitudinally, or via partisanship—in the same way as their counterparts in the established democracies.",

          "title": "The Impact of Increased Learning Opportunities on Political Knowledge: Evidence From Repeated Cross-Sectional Surveys in Finland in 2008 and 2020",
          "authors": "Lauri Rapeli",
          "abstract": "In the last 15 years, opportunities for political learning have increased in a way that lacks comparison in recent history. Technological advances have made political content constantly accessible online to most people in Western societies. What effect has this had on political knowledge? This study uses a repeated cross-sectional survey design from Finland, with surveys from 2008 (n = 1,020) and 2020 (n = 1,097). This interval captures the most intense growth period in online news content. By using the same sampling procedures to ensure similar representation of the Finnish adult population at the 2 time points, interviewing methods, and survey, the 2 surveys provide a rare opportunity to compare knowledge scores measured in face-to-face interviews while ensuring that the findings are not driven by methodological choices. The findings show a small increase in knowledge between 2008 and 2020. Young, low-educated and low-income respondents demonstrate relatively higher knowledge in 2020 compared with 2008, suggesting that increased political learning opportunities have contributed to a slight equalization between high-and low-knowledge groups. Political interest has become a stronger predictor of knowledge. Overall, the results offer a more encouraging interpretation of the development of political knowledge among democratic publics than many recent studies.",

          "authors": "Daniel Silverman, Caitlan Fealing",
          "abstract": "What shapes public support for withdrawal from an ongoing military intervention? While there is a vast literature on the public’s support for new military interventions and its approval of interventions that are underway, there is very little research on public opinion around the explicit question of ending a military campaign on foreign soil and “going home.” This is surprising, given the salience of questions about terminating military interventions in contemporary world politics, from Afghanistan to Ukraine and beyond. In this research note, we argue that the public’s expressed appetite for exiting from an intervention is influenced in crucial ways by framing choices made by public opinion pollsters. In particular, we contend that whether pollsters frame withdrawal as an enemy victory or not and the alternate response options they provide around it can strongly impact its appeal. To test these ideas, we pair an observational analysis of public opinion polls over time on American support for military withdrawals from 1946 to 2021 with an original survey experiment conducted about the 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan. The results reveal that both the enemy victory frame and what we call the middle ground frame exert a powerful influence on public support for withdrawal, and do so across people with different partisan and foreign policy predispositions. These results help provide insight into when people support going home in war, while also extending the considerable literature on framing choices in opinion polling in new ways.",

          "title": "In-Party Love, Out-Party Hate, and Affective Polarization in Twelve Established Democracies",
          "authors": "Diego Garzia, Frederico Ferreira da Silva",
          "abstract": "Recent research has mapped levels of affective polarization worldwide. However, our current knowledge of the longitudinal patterns of in- and out-party affect, the two constitutive terms of affective polarization, remains limited. This manuscript expands the comparative and longitudinal scope of existing studies using national election study data from 143 elections across 12 Western democracies collected since the 1960s. The analysis expands previous descriptive accounts of levels of in- and out-party affect, reports levels of in-party love and out-party hate, and inspects longitudinal changes in the polarity of affect with a composite measure tapping the relative weight of in- and out-party feelings. The findings show a generalized decline of out-party evaluations and a growing prevalence of out-party hate versus in-party love over time. While citizens may not be more polarized than before in most Western democracies, contemporary affective polarization is more heavily characterized by a disproportionate weight of out-group dislike.",

          "authors": "Matthew H Graham",
          "abstract": "Surveys commonly use “catch” or “trap” questions to identify subjects who are likely to look up the answers to knowledge questions. This note shows that catch questions can backfire, causing an increase in the proportion of respondents who look up the answers to subsequent questions. In two preregistered survey experiments in online convenience samples, a catch question was randomly assigned to appear before or after a knowledge battery. When the catch question appeared first, window switching on the knowledge questions was about 25 percent more common. This suggests that when they are used, catch questions should be placed at the end of knowledge batteries, and should also not precede later items that could be affected by lookups. More generally, the results highlight the importance of pre-testing catch and trap questions for unintended consequences.",

          "title": "Partisan Influence on Policy Preferences in Retrenching the Welfare State",
          "authors": "Miroslav Nemčok, Hanna Wass, Juho Vesa",
          "abstract": "While citizens typically favor welfare policies, the electoral consequences of retrenching the welfare state are often minimal for parties implementing the reforms. Using two structural reforms in Finland as a natural quasi-experiment, we show that voters’ policy preferences shift in response to welfare reform measures initiated by their preferred parties. In December 2020, the Finnish center-left government enacted two reforms: one reducing social protection by removing entitlements for laid-off older workers to receive income-based unemployment benefits, and the other increasing social spending by extending the compulsory education age from 16 to 18. Using a two-wave panel survey conducted before and after the government actions, the results indicate that government voters became considerably more supportive of both reforms, despite their initial low support for welfare retrenchment and its contradiction with the established ideological profile of their parties. Moreover, the shift in voters’ policy preferences was substantively greater compared to their opposition counterparts and not affected by ideology and economic self-interest. Hence, voters’ policy preferences show dynamic adaptability to match the party line, thereby reducing grounds for holding the parties accountable.",

          "authors": "Laurence-Olivier M. Foisy, Étienne Proulx, Hubert Cadieux, Jérémy Gilbert, Jozef Rivest, Alexandre Bouillon, Yannick Dufresne",
          "abstract": "This research note addresses a methodological gap in the study of large language models (LLMs) in social sciences: the absence of standardized data extraction procedures. While existing research has examined biases and the reliability of LLM-generated content, the establishment of transparent extraction protocols necessarily precedes substantive analysis. The paper introduces a replicable procedural framework for extracting structured political data from LLMs via API, designed to enhance transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility. Canadian federal and Quebec provincial politicians serve as an illustrative case to demonstrate the extraction methodology, encompassing prompt engineering, output processing, and error handling mechanisms. The procedure facilitates systematic data collection across multiple LLM versions, enabling inter-model comparisons while addressing extraction challenges such as response variability and malformed outputs. The contribution is primarily methodological—providing researchers with a foundational extraction protocol adaptable to diverse research contexts. This standardized approach constitutes an essential preliminary step for subsequent evaluation of LLM-generated content, establishing procedural clarity in this methodologically developing research domain.",
