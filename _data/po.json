          "authors": "Jungsub Shin, Brandon Beomseob Park",
          "abstract": "This paper investigates how COVID-19 anxiety and public evaluations of government crisis management relate to executive approval rates and trust in government in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Contrary to expectations from previous studies, we find no significant relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and changes in trust or executive approval. However, there is a consistent positive association between citizens’ evaluations of their government’s crisis management and increased levels of public support across all three countries. This study broadens the geographical scope of COVID-19-related research by exploring public attitudes in East Asia, contributing to the understanding of how government responses to crises relate to public trust and evaluations of political leaders.",
