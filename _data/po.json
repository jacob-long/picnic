          "abstract": "Subnational Population Estimates (SPE) in Latin America are useful to implement new public policies in subnational areas with internal armed conflicts or difficult to access. In this work, we propose to combine a Population Base Statistical Register (PBSR) and the Official Population Projections (OPP) using a Bayesian approach to produce SPE. Our proposed procedures are useful for computing SPE of the population size or the SPE of the population size in percentage SPE (%). However, we focused on SPE (%) due to some data restrictions and to ensure data confidentiality. In this article, the PBSR is constructed using multiple administrative sources with registers from the health, education, vital statistics systems, tax registration, and, more importantly, the registers of the victims of the current internal armed conflict in Colombia. We also propose new fast Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to produce SPE (%) using data augmentation procedures to address the complications caused by the resulting joint posterior containing gamma functions. We implement our proposal to compute SPE (%) by age and sex groups in the municipality of Jamundí in Colombia which is currently affected by poverty, forced displacement, and the internal armed conflict and evaluate the accuracy with a Population Census.",

          "abstract": "We present methodology for creating synthetic data and an application to create a publicly releasable synthetic version of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI). The LASI, a health and retirement survey, is used for research and educational purposes, but it can only be shared under restricted access due to privacy considerations. We present novel methods to synthesize the survey, maintaining three nested levels of observation—individuals, couples, and households—with both continuous and categorical variables and survey weights. We show that the synthetic data maintains the distributional patterns of the confidential data and largely mitigates identification and attribute disclosure risk. We also present a novel method for controlling the risk and utility tradeoff for the synthetic data that take into account the survey sampling rates. Specifically, we down-weight records that have a high likelihood of being uniquely identifiable in the population due to unique demographic information and oversampling. We show this approach reduces both identification and attribute risk for records while preserving better utility over another common approach of coarsening records. Our methods and evaluations provide a foundation for creating a synthetic version of surveys with multiple units of observation, such as the LASI.",
