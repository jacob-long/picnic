          "title": "Improving Trust in Science Through Communication? The Role of Mediating and Moderating Factors",
          "authors": "Florian Wintterlin",
          "abstract": "Several attempts have been made to increase people's trust in science through being exposed to scientific information. Yet, I argue that not only mere exposure but peoples' predispositions and how people perceive the credibility of the information matters for whether they develop trust in that information. Using a moderated mediation model based on a weighted quota sample in Germany (N = 1,007), I showed that the degree to which being exposed to scientific information influences trust in science is mediated by people's credibility perceptions and moderated by their predispositions toward science. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

          "title": "Dialogues Towards Sociologies of Generative AI",
          "authors": "Patrick Baert, Robert Dorschel, Meredith Hall, Isabelle Higgins, Ella McPherson, Shannon Philip",
          "abstract": "This article presents a sociological dialogue between six researchers who specialise in different sociological subfields. Each researcher explores the possible consequences of generative AI within their specific area of expertise. More concretely, the article develops insights around directions in social theory, the political economy of intellectual property, matters of identities and intimacies, evidence and evidentiary power, racial and reproductive inequalities, as well as work and social class. This is followed by a collective discussion on six interconnected themes across these areas: agency, authorship, identity, visibility, inequality, and hype. We also consider our role as cultural producers, understanding our reactions to generative AI as part of the empirical, theoretical, and methodological shifts this knowledge controversy engenders, as well as highlighting our duty as critical sociologists to keep the knowledge controversy about generative AI open.",

          "authors": "Homero Gil de Zúñiga, Ryan Yang Wang, Zicheng Cheng",
          "abstract": "This study employs an agent-based model (ABM) simulation grounded in polarization theory to explore how social and media influences shape affective polarization, social diversity, and media diversity within a hostile partisan information environment. We examine four scenarios: minimal, strong, social-dominated effect, and media-dominated effect, by iterating 16 combinations of parameters, including influence strength, homogeneous discussion, and selective exposure rates. Calibrated with a real-world U.S. population dataset, results show that while social and media influences accelerate sorting, selectivity structure is the primary driver of affective polarization. Notably, low homogeneous discussion and low selective exposure produce the highest polarization levels across four scenarios due to a probabilistic backfire effect that reflects identity-protective cognition. Strong, locally concentrated social influence sharply reduces social diversity, whereas media influence alone cannot produce convergence without social reinforcement. Media diversity proves more resilient due to global exposure, though it declines under high selective exposure and strong media influence. Despite initial partisan gaps, final-stage outcomes reveal minimal differences between Democrats and Republicans across all conditions.",

          "title": "Does AI Usage Diminish Human Creativity?: How Goal Orientation Theory Moderates the Negative Effects Between AI Usage and Creative Output",
          "authors": "Letty Y. Y. Kwan, Yu Sheng Hung",
          "abstract": "This study investigates a critical and previously unexplored question: Does habitual AI adoption diminish individual creativity? If so, what are the boundary conditions that may amplify or mitigate this negative effect? A total of 77 participants were recruited to complete a creativity task, with their self-reported lay creativity, goal orientation, and habitual AI adoption assessed 1 week prior. Using a combination of self-report measures and ecologically valid creative evaluations, the findings reveal that habitual AI adoption significantly reduces creativity, even after controlling for self-reported creativity, and emotional attachment towards AI. Furthermore, goal orientation moderates this relationship: individuals with a higher learning/mastery orientation experience a greater negative impact, while those with a higher performance orientation show an attenuated negative effect. These findings apply to both the novelty and usefulness dimensions of creativity. This study makes a novel contribution by being the first to demonstrate the detrimental effects of habitual AI adoption on human creativity, contributing to the theoretical understanding of how motivational goals moderate this effect. In practice, training programs that prioritize creativity could leverage current results to design teaching materials that account for individuals’ motivational goals when AI-human interaction is present.",
