          "title": "Nostalgia in Politics",
          "authors": "Spencer Goidel, Kirby Goidel, Paul M Kellstedt",
          "abstract": "Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to voters that, if elected, he would “make America great again.” Trump’s explicitly nostalgic appeal was rooted in the collective perception, shared by at least some voters, that life was better (and simpler) in the past. Nostalgic appeals have a long history in American politics. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) slogan was co-opted from Reagan’s “let’s make America great again.” Despite their long history, we suspect that, as nostalgic appeals have become central to the Republican Party’s messaging, nostalgia-susceptible voters have sorted into the Republican Party. Recently, scholars have attempted to better understand the political consequences of nostalgia on voting for populist parties, both in general and specifically for Donald Trump. We make three contributions to the literature. First, using an open-ended prompt, we consider more carefully what people mean when they say they long for the “good old days.” Second, we use these open-ended responses to inform our measurement of nostalgia and whether it reflects a longing for the past or pessimism about the future. In doing so, we show the importance of religiosity and media consumption (i.e., Fox News) as predictors of individual-level nostalgia. Third, we connect our measure of nostalgia to vote choice during the 2022 midterm election—demonstrating that the effects are broader than support for Donald Trump. Overall, we contend that if one is to fully understand contemporary politics, one needs to know how nostalgia influences political attitudes and behaviors.",

          "authors": "Austin Horng-En Wang, Charles K S Wu, Fang-Yu Chen, Yao-Yuan Yeh",
          "abstract": "The literature highlights the conflicting trends between rising nationalism and stable preferences for status quo on cross-strait relations in Taiwan. This article provides new insights from the Taiwan National Security Survey (2002–2022, 14 waves, n = 16, 494) to help explain this apparent inconsistency. The surveys employed “conditional preference” items to capture how the cross-strait attitudes of Taiwanese people are shaped. Since 2002, Taiwanese identifiers have increased steadily, while dual identifiers have decreased. Most respondents still prefer the status quo, but there is a gradual rise in support for independence. Hypothetical scenarios reveal that a majority support independence if China will not attack and oppose unification if China and Taiwan differ economically and politically. Furthermore, the percentage supporting independence given China will attack is increasing, while the percentage supporting unification if China and Taiwan are similar has considerably decreased. Conditional preferences are influenced by perceived economic benefits from China and the military strength of China, Taiwan, and the United States.",

          "authors": "Nolan M Kavanagh, Anil Menon",
          "abstract": "Health shocks may drive the public to support policies and candidates that protect health and well-being. Did the COVID-19 pandemic, as one such shock, shift preferences for health reform in the United States? Using nationally representative surveys of over 70,000 US adults between 2019 and 2020, we find that experiences with COVID-19—measured at both the individual and community levels—increased support for Medicare for All by multiple percentage points. Consistent with partisan entrenchment on health issues, independents and weak partisans drove the association at the individual level; these subgroup differences were not observed for community-level experiences. To reduce concerns about confounding, we use data from multiple points in time to establish the expected temporal relationship between experiences with COVID-19 and support for health reform. Finally, consistent with the importance of health issues in the 2020 presidential race, we find that changes in support for health reform were mirrored by a comparable shift in support away from the incumbent, President Trump, in the weeks leading up to the election. Even if short lived, these shifts may have influenced both the discourse and outcome of the election.",

          "title": "Affective Polarization towards Parties and Leaders, and Electoral Participation in 13 Parliamentary Democracies, 1980–2019",
          "authors": "Frederico Ferreira da Silva, Diego Garzia",
          "abstract": "Comparative research on affective polarization provides evidence that this phenomenon is present also in parliamentary democracies. Although it has been typically understood as the difference in levels of affect toward in- and out-parties, more recent research has established the relevance of polarized feelings toward party leaders as objects of affective polarization also in parliamentary systems. While several studies have cross-sectionally examined the effect of affective polarization on turnout, recent research has taken an innovative approach by systematically comparing the impact of polarized feelings toward parties and candidates in the probability of turning out in US presidential elections, showing the primacy of the latter in predicting patterns of electoral participation. We expand the contribution of those studies by providing the first longitudinal account of the relationship between affective polarization and turnout in multi-party systems, as well as the first systematic comparison of the effects of party and leader affective polarization on turnout beyond the United States. Using post-electoral survey data covering 87 elections from 13 Western parliamentary democracies collected between 1980 and 2019, our results confirm that polarized feelings toward both parties and leaders are positively associated with turnout in parliamentary democracies. More importantly, our findings highlight the growing relevance of leader affective polarization in accounting for patterns of electoral participation. These results are robust to the use of self-reported and validated measures of turnout in selected countries, as well as different model specifications. Our conclusions contribute both theoretically and methodologically to the literature on affective polarization.",

          "title": "Blame Attribution, Partisanship, and Federalism: Evidence from a Panel Survey",
          "authors": "Matthew J Uttermark, Jack Mewhirter, Rebecca Sanders, Danielle M McLaughlin",
          "abstract": "When disaster strikes in federal systems, who do citizens blame and why? Partisan blame attribution (PBA) suggests that Republicans and Democrats hold consistent ideological preferences on which level of government should respond and receive blame for policy failures in times of crisis. Conversely, partisan federalism (PF) suggests that partisans will opportunistically assign blame to the level of government controlled by their disfavored party. Research on blame attribution has yet to assess which mechanism better explains patterns of blame attribution among individuals. We test each mechanism to evaluate patterns of blame attribution related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging panel survey data collected before the 2020 election and after the 2021 presidential transition, we find that Democrats uniformly follow PF expectations, whereas Republicans follow both PBA and PF expectations. We conclude that scholars should revisit blame attribution and more carefully consider the role of federalism in determining citizen preferences.",

          "abstract": "As the application of artificial intelligence in various domains and sectors grows, politics—especially political communication—is no exception. However, academic considerations on the topic remain limited, partly due to its novelty. To contribute to the ongoing discussions at the intersection of AI and political campaigns, this research report presents the development and use of an AI chatbot employed by an Italian candidate during the 2024 European Parliament elections. The aim of this work is to engage with the technical aspects of the tool’s development and implementation by outlining the challenges and strategies involved in creating an AI chatbot that supports a political campaign using OpenAI APIs. Furthermore, this report offers reflections on the role of AI in politics and communication, focusing on the concepts of intermediation and participation, also addressing issues of compliance and trustworthiness of these new AI tools.",
