          "authors": "Shelley Boulianne, Christian P Hoffmann",
          "abstract": "Across the globe, people are concerned about misinformation despite evidence suggesting actual exposure is limited and specific to subgroups. We examine the extent to which concerns about misinformation on Facebook are related to perceived exposure to misinformation on the platform (misinformation perceptions), political experiences on Facebook, and country context. Using survey data gathered in February 2021 in four countries (Canada, France, UK, and the US), we find a strong positive correlation between perceptions of and concerns about misinformation on Facebook. We explain that this concern about misinformation is rational in that it is rooted in personal experience of perceived exposure. Seeing political content and observing uncivil political discussions on Facebook also relate to concerns about misinformation. We explain heightened concerns about misinformation in terms of views about the virality of misinformation on Facebook as well as the presumed influence of misinformation on others (third-person effects), which makes misinformation a perceived threat to democracy and society. The observed relationships are supported in three of the four countries, but France tends to be an exception. Understanding citizens’ concerns about misinformation is important for understanding support for interventions, including platform regulation.",

          "title": "In Likert Scale, Is Ticking Options Consecutively at Two Ends Equally Problematic as Ticking in the Middle?",
          "authors": "Melissa Dan Wang, Kit-Tai Hau",
          "abstract": "The popularity of self-report surveys brings to light the issue of insufficient effort responding (IER), where participants lack motivation to respond thoughtfully, thereby compromising data quality. A prevalent form of IER, known as straightlining, occurs when participants consistently select the same response for multiple items, leading to potentially biased outcomes. Typically, researchers apply a uniform threshold criterion across all response options (e.g., nine consecutive identical answers in any option are considered problematic). Considering the diverse or near-normal distribution patterns in questionnaire responses, employing varied thresholds for different options may be more appropriate. This study utilized both simulated data and real, large-scale international survey data to examine the likelihood of straightlining as IER across various options. The findings revealed that legitimate straightlining (non-IER) was more common at the extremes than in the middle options. Moreover, the study highlights the significant risks of incorrectly categorizing non-IER straightlining as IER without corroborating evidence. In conclusion, our results question the conventional approaches to eliminating straightlining, including (a) the application of a uniform cutoff value across different options or adopting stricter criteria for middle options and (b) the direct removal of straightlining as IER without additional verification.",

          "authors": "Paul A. Smith, Jan van den Brakel, Giles Horsfield",
          "abstract": "The International Passenger Survey (IPS) is undertaken by the Office for National Statistics to measure tourism flows and tourist expenditure, and international migration. It is interviewer-administered, and the questionnaire instrument was changed in 2017 to 2018 from a paper questionnaire (completed by the interviewer) to an electronic questionnaire administered with a tablet. For operational reasons no parallel run was possible, but the new questionnaire was rolled out progressively to sampling locations. This phased introduction supported the estimation of the effects of the new questionnaire on the main outputs from the survey. We describe initial simulations designed to estimate the power of the phased introduction approach to detect important difference in the IPS outputs, and analyses of the survey estimates at different stages up to the end of 2019 using state-space models, to estimate the discontinuities in the survey outputs. We make an assessment of the effectiveness of the overall approach.",

          "authors": "Mengmeng Wang, Tao Zhou",
          "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between smart city implementation (SCI) and industrial structure change is necessary for improving SCI and achieving high-quality development of the urban economy. This study aims to comprehensively investigate how the two core SCI investments—information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and human capital—influence industrial structure. To this end, both SCI investments are measured using composite indexes calculated by the vertical and horizontal scatter degree method, and spatial panel models are applied using data from 156 smart cities in China from 2013 to 2019, classified according to their economic development level and population density. The results show that industrial structure upgrading produces positive spatial spillover effects and that the impacts of SCI investments on industrial structure change vary in different city classifications. Overall, ICT infrastructure promotes the upgrading of industrial structure, while human capital hinders industrial development due to human capital mismatch. Mechanism analysis shows that SCI investments can influence industrial structure through technological innovation and consumption upgrading. Moreover, policy implications are proposed to promote industrial structure upgrading for effective future SCI.",
