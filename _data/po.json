          "title": "Applicability of Need for Orientation Scales in Network Agenda-Setting: A Methodological Exploration",
          "authors": "Gizem Melek",
          "abstract": "This study explores the applicability of both traditional and contemporary Need for Orientation (NFO) scales within the framework of Third-level (Network) Agenda-Setting (NAS), focusing on Syrian refugees in Türkiye. It delves into the concept of NFO, which revolves around individuals’ propensity to engage with news content, particularly in the context of NAS. Although the underlying concept remains consistent, there exists a technical challenge in analyzing the NFO scales within the NAS model. This challenge arises from the need to amalgamate the public’s mind maps into matrices, as required by the NAS model, while their NFO scale responses remain distinct entities. Thus, this study offers a distinctive perspective by proposing a strategy for integrating individual NFO scale responses into the matrix-based NAS model. This involves establishing a cohesive analytical framework that ensures the seamless alignment of NFO and NAS, representing an innovative approach not previously explored in the literature. The analysis includes a wide array of media outlets and nationally representative public opinion data. While the strategy employed in this research yielded some significant outcomes, further testing in diverse contexts is essential to validate its efficacy. Implications and the challenges inherent in integrating NFO into the NAS context are discussed.",

          "title": "Unraveling the Relationships Among Individual Tendencies, Media Consumption, and Network Characteristics in the Self-Selective Dynamics of Online Political Discussions",
          "authors": "Chingching Chang",
          "abstract": "Unlike face-to-face political discussions, which can be unavoidable, online political discussions are largely self-selected. This paper identifies an individual attribute (diversity in information-seeking value) that fosters online political discussions and an individual tendency (opinion expression inhibition) that inhibits them. The association between such factors and online political discussions depends on voters’ media consumption and the characteristics of their online social networks. Drawing on research linking political discussions to political participation, this article predicts a relationship between individual differences and political participation, through the mediation of online political discussion frequency. With data gathered in a two-wave online survey among a representative sample, conducted before and after Taiwan’s 2022 local election, the authors test the self-selective dynamics of online political discussions. As the findings show, greater exposure to political information on new media, network heterogeneity, and size all magnify the positive relationship of diversity-seeking value with online political discussions. Greater exposure to political information on new media also intensifies the negative relationship between expression inhibition tendencies and online political discussions. Online political discussions are positively associated with subsequent political participation; specifically, they directly relate to voting and indirectly relate to offline political engagement, through their association with online political engagement.",

          "title": "Decomposing Residential Resale House Prices into Structure and Land Components",
          "authors": "Erwin Diewert, Ning Huang",
          "abstract": "The use of hedonic regression models on the sales of detached housing units is widespread in the real estate literature. However, these models do not address the need to decompose the sale price into structure and land components. For many purposes, it is necessary to obtain separate estimates for the price and quantity of housing structures and the land that these structures sit on. The builder’s model accomplishes this decomposition but it takes a producer’s perspective and requires an exogeneous structure price index. In the present paper, a consumer approach to the decomposition problem is taken and this “new” approach to the decomposition problem does not require the use of an exogenous building price index. The paper uses data on sales of detached houses in Richmond, British Columbia in order to implement the new approach. The property price indexes generated by the new approach are compared to the corresponding indexes generated by a traditional time dummy hedonic regression model. The traditional hedonic regression approach does generate reasonable overall property price indexes, but the two approaches do not generate similar land and structure subindexes.",

          "authors": "Minxuan Lan, Lin Liu, Jon D. Elhai, Hanlin Zhou, Xin Gu, Zihan Su, Debao Chen",
          "abstract": "Crime is not randomly distributed but tends to occur in specific spatial clusters. The literature has published many theories to explain its underlying causes. In recent years, scholars have increasingly leveraged social media big data to enrich our understanding of crime. Among these efforts is the Broken Emotion Conjecture, which offers a novel perspective on the connection between crime and emotion. However, how this connection varies among crime types and across the geographic space remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the spatial variations of the Broken Emotion Conjecture by analyzing emotion of residents and visitors, and their associations with assaults, burglaries, robberies, and thefts in Cincinnati, OH. Through spatial statistical analyses, we find that emotional states of residents and visitors have distinct effects on crime. Specifically, after controlling for key socioeconomic and land-use factors, we observed that collective negative emotion among residents is associated with a higher likelihood of burglaries; while collective negative emotion among visitors correlated with increased risk of assault, burglary, and robbery. Notably, we found no statistically significant impact of either residents’ or visitors' negative emotion on thefts. These findings align with established criminological and psychological theories, but provide a more nuanced interpretation of the connection between emotion and crime. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on the crime-emotion relationship, supports the development of an ambient population based emotion research within criminology, and provides practical policy implications.",
