          "authors": "Hyungjin Gill, Heysung Lee, Soo Yun Kim, Xining Liao, Hernando Rojas",
          "abstract": "This study examines how perceived political party divide may foster affective polarization during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on nationally representative sample surveys of U.S. and South Korean adults, we investigate the relationship between attitude strength toward COVID-19 vaccines, perceived polarization, and affective polarization. Results suggest that individuals with stronger attitudes toward vaccines are more likely to perceive a greater ideological divide between political parties, which in turn, is associated with increased animosity toward the opposing party. Applying the mediation model to the South Korean sample yielded consistent findings, suggesting that the mechanism by which strong attitudes relate to negative emotions through perceived polarization may be generalizable across countries with a competitive two-party system, particularly in the context of COVID-19 vaccination attitudes. Our findings highlight perceived polarization as an important intermediary in the process of affective polarization, shedding light on the mechanisms driving partisan hostility in contemporary democracies.",

          "abstract": "Comparing the degree of urbanity in different countries is not a straightforward task. This research note discusses various statistical agencies’ measures of urbanity and shows how comparisons of Nordic countries depend on the measure used. The multitude of measures and urbanity definitions makes it difficult to draw clear-cut conclusions about urbanity differences between countries, and hence about the effects of, for instance, different regional policies in the Nordic countries.",

          "authors": "Guilherme Anthony Pinheiro Jacob, Nikos Tzavidis, Angela Luna Hernandez, Pedro Luis Do Nascimento Silva",
          "abstract": "The Brazilian National Statistical Office (IBGE) uses its main household survey, PNADC, to produce annual estimates of the extreme poverty rate at the country level, as well as for each of its 27 Federative Units (26 states and the Federal District). Although poverty monitoring could benefit from more frequent and spatially disaggregated estimates, those obtained via direct estimation from the PNADC are considered too unreliable for informing public policy due to their large uncertainty. In this article, we illustrate the use of transformed Fay-Herriot models to combine PNADC data with covariate information obtained from an administrative register of beneficiaries of social programs in Brazil (CadUnico). Our results show that, while the CadUnico alone cannot be a substitute for official estimates of extreme poverty, it can be used as a covariate source to produce more frequent and disaggregated estimates of extreme poverty. More precisely, we use CadUnico data to produce quarterly model-based estimates for each of the Geographic Strata, an IBGE geography that partitions Brazil into 146 domains. Use of small area estimation leads to model-based estimates that are more precise, as quantified by the estimated MSEs, than their direct counterparts. Due to their increased frequency, the model-based estimates also provide a more detailed description of the evolution of extreme poverty rates. The article focuses on those elements that ensure an appropriate implementation of Fay-Herriot models, including the choice of transformations, use of administrative data, and variance smoothing. The article contributes by proposing improvements to the estimation strategy used by IBGE to derive spatially disaggregated and timely small area estimates.",

          "authors": "Hansol Kwak",
          "abstract": "How does repression reshape the way online activists engage with target audiences? While prior research has primarily examined changes in overall online participation, it has paid less attention to how activists adjust their strategies in response to repression. Addressing this gap, this article argues that repression incentivizes online activists to broaden their support base by promoting inter-group engagement and signaling inclusivity. Focusing on the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, the study analyzes Twitter interactions using network measures of assortativity and cross-group tie proportions. It applies permutation tests and ARIMA-based Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to compare network patterns across key phases, delineated by the Brooklyn Bridge mass arrests on October 1 and the eviction threat of Zuccotti Park on October 13. The results show that repression triggers a significant decrease in assortativity, indicating increased inter-group engagement, while cross-group tie proportions remain stable, suggesting structural rather than isolated behavioral changes.",
