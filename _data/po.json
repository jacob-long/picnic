          "title": "Improving Trust in Science Through Communication? The Role of Mediating and Moderating Factors",
          "authors": "Florian Wintterlin",
          "abstract": "Several attempts have been made to increase people's trust in science through being exposed to scientific information. Yet, I argue that not only mere exposure but peoples' predispositions and how people perceive the credibility of the information matters for whether they develop trust in that information. Using a moderated mediation model based on a weighted quota sample in Germany (N = 1,007), I showed that the degree to which being exposed to scientific information influences trust in science is mediated by people's credibility perceptions and moderated by their predispositions toward science. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",

          "authors": "Silvia Scarpa, Maria Rosaria Ferrante, Stefan Sperlich",
          "abstract": "There exist many statistical indicators for measuring economic inequality. Most of them rely on distribution moments or focus on a few selected percentiles at the tails of the distribution. Recently, a so-called quantile ratio index has been introduced. It considers the entire distribution and measures the distance between the (economic) equi-distribution scenario and the average ratio of quantiles below the median to their symmetric counterparts above it. We present a finite population framework for estimating this index and its standard error under some complex sampling designs. Our estimator demonstrates high accuracy and precision, even with relatively small samples. Being solely based on quantiles, this index exhibits remarkable robustness, having limited sensitivity to anomalous values and highly skewed distributions. This is also shown by an analysis of its influence function.",

          "title": "Dialogues Towards Sociologies of Generative AI",
          "authors": "Patrick Baert, Robert Dorschel, Meredith Hall, Isabelle Higgins, Ella McPherson, Shannon Philip",
          "abstract": "This article presents a sociological dialogue between six researchers who specialise in different sociological subfields. Each researcher explores the possible consequences of generative AI within their specific area of expertise. More concretely, the article develops insights around directions in social theory, the political economy of intellectual property, matters of identities and intimacies, evidence and evidentiary power, racial and reproductive inequalities, as well as work and social class. This is followed by a collective discussion on six interconnected themes across these areas: agency, authorship, identity, visibility, inequality, and hype. We also consider our role as cultural producers, understanding our reactions to generative AI as part of the empirical, theoretical, and methodological shifts this knowledge controversy engenders, as well as highlighting our duty as critical sociologists to keep the knowledge controversy about generative AI open.",
