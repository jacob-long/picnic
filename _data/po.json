          "authors": "Joshua Claassen, Jan Karem HÖhne, Jessica Kuhlmann",
          "abstract": "Web surveys frequently include so-called “final comment questions” (FCQs) to provide respondents the opportunity to express their experiences with the survey in general and its questions in particular. A comprehensive analysis of FCQs to enhance survey and question design is often impeded by high item nonresponse and low answer quality in the form of short and uninterpretable answers. In this article, we therefore investigate what respondent and FCQ characteristics influence the provision and quality of answers to FCQs. For this purpose, we conducted two web survey studies in two German online panels. The first study (N = 874) experimentally varied the visual design of the FCQ (“one multi-line answer box” vs. “ten single-line answer boxes”). The second study (N = 1,001) experimentally varied the answer format of the FCQ (“request for a text answer” vs. “request for a voice answer”). The results reveal that answer provision is influenced by respondent characteristics (e.g. age and survey interest), while answer quality is mostly influenced by FCQ characteristics (e.g. request for a voice answer). Overall, this article provides both survey researchers and practitioners with empirically informed FCQ design recommendations to improve the quality of future web surveys.",

          "title": "Is Consent to Further Panel Participation Selective? The Case of a Self-Administered Family Panel Survey Announcing Organizational Change",
          "authors": "Almut Schumann, Claudia Schmiedeberg",
          "abstract": "Changes in study design or procedures bear the risk of affecting survey participation and sample composition. Changing the organization responsible for data collection during a running panel may be a risk factor for increased selectivity, as respondents’ explicit consent to transfer data and contact information to the new organization may be required for continued participation. Based on data from wave 14 of the German Family Panel (pairfam), we investigate which respondent characteristics and characteristics related to their panel participation are associated with providing consent to data transfer when a change in organizational structure is announced. We focus on respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics, factors related to the survey topic, such as respondents’ relationship status, and panel experience, such as the length and continuity of panel participation. While we find that some socio-demographic groups are less likely to provide panel consent, topic-related characteristics do not impact the decision to consent. Moreover, respondents who joined the panel only recently and those who have skipped previous waves (temporary drop-outs) are less likely to provide panel consent. As respondent consent is required in many cases of organizational change, panel surveys should be aware that this step might be a vulnerable point for respondents who are generally less likely to participate.",

          "authors": "Hang Qi",
          "abstract": "Existing scholarship suggests that Americans generally support progressive redistribution. However, whether ideological differences exist in views on the progressivity of social programs’ policy designs remains ambiguous. Using a conjoint experiment, I investigate how the progressivity of social programs’ distributional outcomes and tax sources impacts Americans’ social policy support. I find differences and similarities in the effects of progressive social policy designs on different ideological subgroups. Compared to conservatives, liberals are more supportive of social programs having progressive distributional results or tax sources and less supportive of social policies featuring regressive distributional consequences or tax sources. However, both liberals and conservatives prefer progressive social programs over those with regressive designs. This study helps explain the public’s preferences for social policies with progressive designs.",

          "authors": "Ian G Anson, Carolyn Forestiere",
          "abstract": "The rise of the “religious nones” has garnered significant interest among journalists and scholars. Whereas very few people reported that they were not affiliated with an established religious tradition just 20 years ago, currently as many as 30 percent of Americans claim no religion when asked their religious preference on public opinion surveys. This seismic shift in the religious composition of the country precipitates important questions about the attitudes, group identity, and political participation of religious nones in response to contemporary issues. In this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment (N = 1,013) designed to determine if issue and identity cues increase religious nones’ sense of group identification, group consciousness, linked fate, and willingness to engage in political behavior. We leverage a unique large-scale sample of nonreligious Americans to facilitate these tests. Our results suggest that relevant political messaging does little to activate collective identification or political engagement among the nonreligious. Our findings have important implications for the future of American politics, even as the number of religiously unaffiliated people continues to grow.",

          "title": "Fleeing for Their Lives: Reconsidering How Americans View Immigrants’ Reasons for Migrating",
          "authors": "Nicholas Pangakis",
          "abstract": "Politicians and media outlets often emphasize a distinction between migrants fleeing their home country for reasons linked to violence and migrants leaving to pursue economic opportunity. Americans are expected to be less welcoming towards immigrants who are perceived to be seeking economic opportunity relative to immigrants escaping violence. Using a national survey experiment, I test the hypothesis that violence and economic threats equally increase support for immigration when migrants face risks that force them to leave their home country. When harsh economic conditions are made clear, I find that Americans are more open to accepting immigrants fleeing economic deprivation than previously anticipated. While my results show that Americans are willing to prioritize immigrants facing poverty, I find minimal evidence that these favorable attitudes extend toward other protective immigration policies.",

          "authors": "Wanli Liu, Xuequn Wang, Yibai Li",
          "abstract": "With generative artificial intelligence’s (GenAI) growing popularity, individuals are increasingly using it when searching for election-related information. This scenario raises concerns that GenAI usage may result in widespread dissemination of misinformation, given its ability to generate seemingly authentic information. Nevertheless, despite the importance of Gen AI, few researchers have examined how individuals use this tool to search for election-related information. This study aims to assess how GenAI’s perceived system (i.e., accessibility and integration) and information quality (i.e., completeness, accuracy, and neutrality) impact its usage. Focusing on the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we conducted a two-wave survey and data was collected from 364 Americans. Participants were found to have a favorable attitude overall toward GenAI. Further, accuracy and neutrality were positively associated with GenAI usage. A fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was also conducted to identify different configurations of perceived system and information quality that led to high GenAI usage. Analyzing the qualitative responses further confirmed the results. This study contributes to the literature on the role of GenAI during elections, providing a nuanced understanding of how dimensions of GenAI’s perceived system and information quality impact individuals’ GenAI usage. The findings have significant practical implications for dealing with the (mis)information generated by GenAI.",

          "authors": "Muhammad Talal Khalid, Ann-Perry Witmer",
          "abstract": "The potential of large language models (LLMs) to mitigate the time- and cost-related challenges associated with inductive thematic analysis (ITA) is being increasingly explored in the literature. However, the use of LLMs to support ITA has often been opportunistic, relying on ad hoc prompt engineering (PE) approaches, thereby undermining the reliability, transparency, and replicability of the analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a structured approach to PE in LLM-assisted ITA. To this end, a comprehensive review of the existing literature is conducted to examine how researchers applying ITA integrate LLMs into their workflows and, in particular, how PE is utilized to support the analytical process. Built on the insights generated from this review, four key steps for effective PE in LLM-assisted ITA are identified and proposed. Furthermore, the study explores advanced PE techniques that can enhance the execution of these steps, providing researchers with practical strategies to improve their analyses. In conclusion, the main contributions of this paper include: (i) mapping the existing research on LLM-assisted ITA to enable a better understanding of the rapidly developing field, (ii) proposing a structured four-step PE process to enhance methodological rigor, (iii) discussing the application of advanced PE techniques to support the execution of these steps, and (iv) highlighting key directions for future research.",

          "title": "Take Action Now! A Longitudinal Study of Political Party Calls to Action Across Social Media Platforms",
          "authors": "Anders Olof Larsson",
          "abstract": "Online political campaigning takes place on several platforms, suggesting the need for those seeking voter support—such as political parties—to adapt to the characteristics of each platform. Getting voters to take action—be it online (such as asking them to engage with posts) or offline (such as asking them to attend rallies or to vote)—is a key element of campaigning efforts. Here, we focus on the use of what is referred to as calls to action as employed by Norwegian political parties on three different social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) between 2013 and 2024. Using a combination of automated and manual content analysis, the results indicate that while Facebook is the preferred platform for providing calls to action during roughly the first half of our time period, Instagram takes the lead in this regard for the latter half. Overall, though, we see a clear decrease of calls to action across all three platforms, indicating the changing priorities of parties. Using likes as a common measurement of engagement across all three studied platforms, posts containing calls to action emerged as less popular towards the end of the time period for Facebook and Twitter, while users of Instagram appear to be more interested in engaging with such posts also during these latter stages. The study ends with a discussion of the main findings, also suggesting some ways forward for future research efforts.",
