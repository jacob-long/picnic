          "authors": "Stan Hok-Wui Wong, Jiachen Liang",
          "abstract": "While the Internet in China is subjected to heavy state regulations, Chinese netizens can still access online comments that deviate from official discourse on many issues. To prevent online discussions from getting out of hand, the Chinese government uses soft propaganda such as online comments to channel public opinions. Which type of online comments appeal to Chinese netizens? Using a survey experimental design, we examine the appeal of 4 distinct types of online comments on certain policies. We find that our survey respondents spend significantly more time in consuming emotional comments that deviate from official discourse. When it comes to the effect on attitude, however, we find that deviating-emotional comments are no more persuasive than deviating-informational comments. Our results call into question the effectiveness of China’s state propaganda in channeling online public opinions while highlighting the importance of alternative information in shaping public opinions in an authoritarian context.",

          "authors": "Lorenzo Mori, Maria Rosaria Ferrante",
          "abstract": "We propose a small area estimation model based on Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (SAE-GAMLSS) for the estimation of household economic indicators. SAE-GAMLSS relax the exponential family distributional assumption and allow each distributional parameter to depend on covariates. A bootstrap approach to estimate the MSE is proposed. The SAE-GAMLSS estimator shows a largely better performance than the well-known Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (EBLUP) under various simulated scenarios. Per-capita consumption of Italian and foreign households in Italian regions, in urban and rural areas, is estimated using SAE-GAMLSS. Results show that the well-known Italian North–South divide does not hold for foreigners.",

          "authors": "Silke Adam, Mykola Makhortykh, Michaela Maier, Viktor Aigenseer, Aleksandra Urman, Teresa Gil Lopez, Clara Christner, Ernesto de León, Roberto Ulloa",
          "abstract": "This article evaluates the quality of data collection in individual-level desktop web tracking used in the social sciences and shows that the existing approaches face sampling issues, validity issues due to the lack of content-level data and their disregard for the variety of devices and long-tail consumption patterns as well as transparency and privacy issues. To overcome some of these problems, the article introduces a new academic web tracking solution, WebTrack, an open-source tracking tool maintained by a major European research institution, GESIS. The design logic, the interfaces, and the backend requirements for WebTrack are discussed, followed by a detailed examination of the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Finally, using data from 1,185 participants, the article empirically illustrates how an improvement in data collection through WebTrack leads to innovative shifts in the use of tracking data. As WebTrack allows for collecting the content people are exposed to beyond the classical news platforms, it can greatly improve the detection of politics-related information consumption in tracking data through automated content analysis compared to traditional approaches that rely on the source-level analysis.",

          "title": "Can AI Lie? Chabot Technologies, the Subject, and the Importance of Lying",
          "authors": "Jack Black",
          "abstract": "This article poses a simple question: can AI lie? In response to this question, the article examines, as its point of inquiry, popular AI chatbots, such as, ChatGPT. In doing so, an examination of the psychoanalytic, philosophical, and technological significance of AI and its complexities are located in relation to the dynamics of truth, falsity, and deception. That is, by critically considering the chatbot’s ability to engage in natural language conversations and provide contextually relevant responses, it is argued that what separates the AI chatbot from anthropocentric debates, which allude to some form of conscious recognition on behalf of AI, is the importance of the lie – an importance which a psychoanalytic approach can reveal. Indeed, while AI technologies can undoubtedly blur the line between lies and truth-speaking, in the case of the AI chatbot, it is detailed how such technology remains unable to lie authentically or, in other words, is unable to lie like a human. For psychoanalysis, the capacity to lie bears witness to the unconscious and, thus, plays an important role in determining the subject. It is for this reason that rather than uncritically accepting the chatbot’s authority – an authority that is easily reflected in its honest responses and frank admissions – a psychoanalytic (Lacanian) perspective can highlight the significance of the unconscious as a distorting factor in determining the subject. To help elucidate this argument, specific attention is given to introducing and applying Lacan’s subject of enunciation and subject of the enunciated. This is used to assert that what continues (for now) to set us apart from AI technology is not necessarily our ‘better knowledge’ but our capability to consciously engage in acts of falsehood that function to reveal the social nuances and significances of the lie.",
