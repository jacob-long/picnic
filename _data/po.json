          "title": "Applicability of Need for Orientation Scales in Network Agenda-Setting: A Methodological Exploration",
          "authors": "Gizem Melek",
          "abstract": "This study explores the applicability of both traditional and contemporary Need for Orientation (NFO) scales within the framework of Third-level (Network) Agenda-Setting (NAS), focusing on Syrian refugees in Türkiye. It delves into the concept of NFO, which revolves around individuals’ propensity to engage with news content, particularly in the context of NAS. Although the underlying concept remains consistent, there exists a technical challenge in analyzing the NFO scales within the NAS model. This challenge arises from the need to amalgamate the public’s mind maps into matrices, as required by the NAS model, while their NFO scale responses remain distinct entities. Thus, this study offers a distinctive perspective by proposing a strategy for integrating individual NFO scale responses into the matrix-based NAS model. This involves establishing a cohesive analytical framework that ensures the seamless alignment of NFO and NAS, representing an innovative approach not previously explored in the literature. The analysis includes a wide array of media outlets and nationally representative public opinion data. While the strategy employed in this research yielded some significant outcomes, further testing in diverse contexts is essential to validate its efficacy. Implications and the challenges inherent in integrating NFO into the NAS context are discussed.",

          "title": "Decomposing Residential Resale House Prices into Structure and Land Components",
          "authors": "Erwin Diewert, Ning Huang",
          "abstract": "The use of hedonic regression models on the sales of detached housing units is widespread in the real estate literature. However, these models do not address the need to decompose the sale price into structure and land components. For many purposes, it is necessary to obtain separate estimates for the price and quantity of housing structures and the land that these structures sit on. The builder’s model accomplishes this decomposition but it takes a producer’s perspective and requires an exogeneous structure price index. In the present paper, a consumer approach to the decomposition problem is taken and this “new” approach to the decomposition problem does not require the use of an exogenous building price index. The paper uses data on sales of detached houses in Richmond, British Columbia in order to implement the new approach. The property price indexes generated by the new approach are compared to the corresponding indexes generated by a traditional time dummy hedonic regression model. The traditional hedonic regression approach does generate reasonable overall property price indexes, but the two approaches do not generate similar land and structure subindexes.",

          "title": "Digital Surveillance and Relational Uncertainty: The Role of Geolocation Tracking in Romantic Relationships",
          "authors": "Shaojung Sharon Wang, Shiuan-Tung Chen",
          "abstract": "As geolocation tracking apps become increasingly embedded in everyday digital interactions, their role in romantic relationships remains underexplored. This study examines the use of geolocation tracking apps in romantic relationships, addressing gaps in understanding their implications for relational uncertainty while identifying key psychological antecedents of app use. Findings from users ( N = 333) challenge the assumption that geolocation tracking inherently reduces relational uncertainty, revealing no significant association with increased clarity. Instead, intensive tracking correlates with heightened definition uncertainty, suggesting that rather than reinforcing relationship security, tracking may introduce ambiguity about the relationship’s status. However, it is not associated with diminished intimacy, as couples may use it consensually for safety and reassurance. Moreover, attachment styles and jealousy predict tracking behaviors, mirroring patterns observed in social media surveillance. These findings highlight the limitations of geolocation tracking as an uncertainty-reducing tool and emphasize the psychological and relational factors that drive its use. By reframing geolocation tracking as a socially accepted yet relationally complex form of monitoring, this study advances theoretical discussions on digital surveillance and the evolving role of technology in intimate relationships.",

          "title": "Spatial Variations of the Broken Emotion Conjecture",
          "authors": "Minxuan Lan, Lin Liu, Jon D. Elhai, Hanlin Zhou, Xin Gu, Zihan Su, Debao Chen",
          "abstract": "Crime is not randomly distributed but tends to occur in specific spatial clusters. The literature has published many theories to explain its underlying causes. In recent years, scholars have increasingly leveraged social media big data to enrich our understanding of crime. Among these efforts is the Broken Emotion Conjecture, which offers a novel perspective on the connection between crime and emotion. However, how this connection varies among crime types and across the geographic space remains unclear. In this study, we investigate the spatial variations of the Broken Emotion Conjecture by analyzing emotion of residents and visitors, and their associations with assaults, burglaries, robberies, and thefts in Cincinnati, OH. Through spatial statistical analyses, we find that emotional states of residents and visitors have distinct effects on crime. Specifically, after controlling for key socioeconomic and land-use factors, we observed that collective negative emotion among residents is associated with a higher likelihood of burglaries; while collective negative emotion among visitors correlated with increased risk of assault, burglary, and robbery. Notably, we found no statistically significant impact of either residents’ or visitors' negative emotion on thefts. These findings align with established criminological and psychological theories, but provide a more nuanced interpretation of the connection between emotion and crime. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on the crime-emotion relationship, supports the development of an ambient population based emotion research within criminology, and provides practical policy implications.",
