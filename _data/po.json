          "authors": "Abel Dasylva, Massimo De Cubellis, Fabrizio De Fausti, Loe Franssen",
          "abstract": "National Statistical Offices (NSOs) collect extensive data on the international activities of firms within their borders. However, they typically lack information about the foreign partners with whom these firms trade. Linking import data from one NSO to corresponding export data from a partner NSO could significantly enhance statistics on firms’ international operations. While technically feasible, such linkage is legally constrained by strict privacy laws. Private set intersection (PSI) protocols may help address privacy concerns but require unique identifiers to avoid linkage errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a PSI protocol with three innovations. First, we estimate the rates of linkage error by modeling the number of links from a given record. Second, we adjust an estimated population mean according to the estimated linkage accuracy. Lastly, our adjustment explicitly accounts for this accuracy without assuming a particular relationship among the target variables.",

          "title": "Can Smart Surveys Have a Positive Business Case? An Evaluation Based on Three Case Studies",
          "authors": "Barry Schouten, Peter Lugtig, Annemieke Luiten",
          "abstract": "The emergence of smart devices, in particular mobile devices, has widened the potential types of data that can be collected in the social sciences. Given the fact that traditional surveys require more and more effort, new data sources collected via smart devices can potentially improve measurement of variables of interest and representation of the target population. New data sources also bring new challenges. New data sources, such as smartphone sensor data offer less control and coherence than traditional data such as administrative and survey data do, and are therefore often integrated either during, or after data collection. Respondents remain in control and help to resolve inconsistencies, missing data, or provide context. We discuss the consequences of hybrid data collection and methodology needed to reduce errors in smart surveys. Since quantification of the various types of errors is costly and time-consuming, we present a number of practical criteria. These criteria help evaluate whether hybrid data collection may have a positive business case and justify further investments in systems for data collection, data processing, and integration. We apply the criteria to three case studies: the measurement of mobility, consumption, and physical activities. Large-scale field experiments have been conducted for each of the case studies that allow us to evaluate the criteria.",

          "title": "Exploring Gender Disparities in Experiences of Being Hacked Using Twitter Data: A Focus on the Third-Level Digital Divide",
          "authors": "Ern Chern Khor, Moon Choi",
          "abstract": "Despite millions of hacked accounts fueling cybercrime, research on the hacking experience, particularly sociodemographic aspects, remains sparse. This study examines the experience of being hacked with a focus on gender disparities from the perspective of the third-level digital divide—socially constructed gaps of digital use outcomes even among users with similar digital access and skills. Analyzing 13,731 Twitter mentions of accounts being hacked, using topic modeling and classifying the gender of 12,586 users, we showed that women reported more experiences of being hacked across all types of online services except gaming. Women were more likely to experience negative consequences of being hacked, including reputational harm, money loss, and having personalized content modified. Gender differences were also found in coping strategies. Men were more likely to use active strategies like warning others, rebuilding accounts, and deducing hackers’ origins, while women were more likely to seek help from others to recover or report experiencing hacked accounts. The findings of this study imply the need for further research into the gendered experiences of being hacked from the third-level digital divide perspective, alongside the development of interventions to mitigate harm and empower users with diverse needs to cope with being hacked.",

          "title": "The Efficacy of Large Language Models and Crowd Annotation for Accurate Content Analysis of Political Social Media Messages",
          "authors": "Jennifer Stromer-Galley, Brian McKernan, Saklain Zaman, Chinmay Maganur, Sampada Regmi",
          "abstract": "Systematic content analysis of messaging has been a staple method in the study of communication. While computer-assisted content analysis has been used in the field for three decades, advances in machine learning and crowd-based annotation combined with the ease of collecting volumes of text-based communication via social media have made the opportunities for classification of messages easier and faster. The greatest advancement yet might be in the form of general intelligence large language models (LLMs), which are ostensibly able to accurately and reliably classify messages by leveraging context to disambiguate meaning. It is unclear, however, how effective LLMs are in deploying the method of content analysis. In this study, we compare the classification of political candidate social media messages between trained annotators, crowd annotators, and large language models from Open AI accessed through the free Web (ChatGPT) and the paid API (GPT API) on five different categories of political communication commonly used in the literature. We find that crowd annotation generally had higher F1 scores than ChatGPT and an earlier version of the GPT API, although the newest version, GPT-4 API, demonstrated good performance as compared with the crowd and with ground truth data derived from trained student annotators. This study suggests the application of any LLM to an annotation task requires validation, and that freely available and older LLM models may not be effective for studying human communication.",

          "authors": "Xingyu Ken Chen, Jin-Cheon Na",
          "abstract": "Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion–stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO’s persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse.",
