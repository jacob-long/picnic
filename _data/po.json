          "title": "STATISTICAL INFERENCE UNDER NONIGNORABLE SAMPLING AND NONRESPONSE—AN EMPIRICAL LIKELIHOOD APPROACH",
          "authors": "Danny Pfeffermann, Arie Preminger, Anna Sikov",
          "abstract": "Statistical models are often based on sample surveys. When the sample selection probabilities and/or the response probabilities are related to a model outcome variable, even after conditioning on the model covariates, the model holding for the observed data is different from the model holding in the population, resulting in biased inference if not accounted for properly. Accounting for sample selection bias is relatively simple because the sample selection probabilities are usually known. Accounting for nonignorable nonresponse is much harder since the response probabilities are, in practice, unknown. In this article, we develop a new approach for modelling complex survey data, which accounts simultaneously for nonignorable sampling and nonresponse. Our proposed approach combines the nonparametric empirical likelihood with a parametric model for the response probabilities, which contains the outcome variable as one of the covariates. Combining the model holding for the responding units with the model for the response probabilities enables extracting the model holding for the missing data and imputing them. We propose ways of testing the underlying model holding for the respondents’ data. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the approach in terms of parameter estimation and imputation. We conclude with an application to the household expenditure survey in Israel, carried out by Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics. The survey collects information on the socio-demographic characteristics of each member of the sampled households (HH), as well as detailed information on the HH income and expenditure. The total sample size was n = 12,136 with 7,827 responding HHs. The target estimated parameter in this application is the population mean of the gross HH income.",

          "title": "Prompt Engineering for Large Language Model-Assisted Inductive Thematic Analysis",
          "authors": "Muhammad Talal Khalid, Ann-Perry Witmer",
          "abstract": "The potential of large language models (LLMs) to mitigate the time- and cost-related challenges associated with inductive thematic analysis (ITA) is being increasingly explored in the literature. However, the use of LLMs to support ITA has often been opportunistic, relying on ad hoc prompt engineering (PE) approaches, thereby undermining the reliability, transparency, and replicability of the analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a structured approach to PE in LLM-assisted ITA. To this end, a comprehensive review of the existing literature is conducted to examine how researchers applying ITA integrate LLMs into their workflows and, in particular, how PE is utilized to support the analytical process. Built on the insights generated from this review, four key steps for effective PE in LLM-assisted ITA are identified and proposed. Furthermore, the study explores advanced PE techniques that can enhance the execution of these steps, providing researchers with practical strategies to improve their analyses. In conclusion, the main contributions of this paper include: (i) mapping the existing research on LLM-assisted ITA to enable a better understanding of the rapidly developing field, (ii) proposing a structured four-step PE process to enhance methodological rigor, (iii) discussing the application of advanced PE techniques to support the execution of these steps, and (iv) highlighting key directions for future research.",

          "title": "Take Action Now! A Longitudinal Study of Political Party Calls to Action Across Social Media Platforms",
          "authors": "Anders Olof Larsson",
          "abstract": "Online political campaigning takes place on several platforms, suggesting the need for those seeking voter support—such as political parties—to adapt to the characteristics of each platform. Getting voters to take action—be it online (such as asking them to engage with posts) or offline (such as asking them to attend rallies or to vote)—is a key element of campaigning efforts. Here, we focus on the use of what is referred to as calls to action as employed by Norwegian political parties on three different social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter) between 2013 and 2024. Using a combination of automated and manual content analysis, the results indicate that while Facebook is the preferred platform for providing calls to action during roughly the first half of our time period, Instagram takes the lead in this regard for the latter half. Overall, though, we see a clear decrease of calls to action across all three platforms, indicating the changing priorities of parties. Using likes as a common measurement of engagement across all three studied platforms, posts containing calls to action emerged as less popular towards the end of the time period for Facebook and Twitter, while users of Instagram appear to be more interested in engaging with such posts also during these latter stages. The study ends with a discussion of the main findings, also suggesting some ways forward for future research efforts.",
