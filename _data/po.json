          "authors": "Aaron Erlich, Andrew McCormack",
          "abstract": "Age-group differences play an essential role in social interaction across sub-Saharan Africa. However, the social effects of these differences remain understudied. We hypothesize that age-group differences will affect response patterns and use Afrobarometer data to test this hypothesis. We also explore three mechanisms through which age-group differences may induce response-pattern variation: in-group loyalty, social acquiescence, and social distance. As hypothesized, we find relatively large and statistically significant effects for age-group differences across a variety of questions. Our findings support in-group loyalty and social acquiescence rather than social distance when questions do not address age-related issues directly. However, social distance may play a more important role when questions address age-specific issues. Additionally, we show preliminary evidence that age-group differences induce larger response-pattern variation than coethnicity. Our findings speak to the importance of age in social interaction in Africa and provide important lessons for the survey research community.",

          "authors": "Søren Damsbo-Svendsen, Tobias Heide-Jørgensen",
          "abstract": "We study whether communication that attributes extreme weather to climate change along with individuals’ personal weather experiences can increase support for climate change action and policies. Using a preregistered representative survey experiment from Denmark, we randomly assign respondents to two treatments: (a) a hot weather prime that asks them to recall the extreme Danish summer of 2018; and (b) contextualizing information that links extreme weather events to climate change. We find that priming past heat experience does not foster increased climate awareness, opinions, or willingness to act or pay. We also fail to find that climate communication strengthens the effect of heat experience on climate attitudes or matters on its own. We argue, and provide tentative evidence, that this is because people in northern regions often recall heat spells as something pleasant rather than perceiving them as a risk. Similar results were obtained using quasi-experimental data on recent local temperature deviations instead of past heat experiences. Overall, the results suggest that what is objectively and meteorologically extreme may subjectively evoke positive feelings and therefore not increase support for climate action. We discuss the implications for climate communication and opinion formation.",

          "authors": "Mar Castillo-Campos, David Becerra-Alonso, Hajo G. Boomgaarden",
          "abstract": "Media bias has long been a subject of scholarly interest due to its potential to shape public perceptions and behaviors. This systematic review leverages advances in natural language processing (NLP) to explore automated methods to detect media bias, addressing five core questions: it examines the definitions and operationalization of media bias, explores the NLP tasks addressed for its detection, the technologies used, and their respective outcomes and applied findings. This review also examines the practical applications of these methodologies and assesses the patterns, implications, and limitations associated with using artificial intelligence for media bias detection. Analyzing peer-reviewed articles from 2019 to 2023, the review initially identified 519 articles, which ultimately included 28 relevant ones. Significant heterogeneity is observed in bias definitions, affecting the analysis and detection approaches. The review highlights the predominant use of some methods and identifies challenges such as inconsistencies in problem definition, outcome measurement, and comparative method evaluation. Regardless of the conceptualizations of bias and the methods used, studies consistently identify bias in media outlets. Thus, studying media bias remains necessary for raising awareness and detection, and NLP methods are significant allies in this endeavor. This research aims to consolidate the foundations of recent advances in NLP for bias detection, encouraging researchers to focus on developing transparent, task-specific tools and work toward a consensus on a technical definition of bias and standardized metrics for its evaluation.",
