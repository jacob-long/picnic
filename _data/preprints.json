          "title": "Aladdin Syndrome: Conceptualizing the Desire for Rapid Success without Work or Effort",
          "authors": "Saeed Hedayati",
          "abstract": "Aladdin Syndrome is a novel cultural-psychological concept referring to a mindset characterized by fantasies of sudden wealth, status, or success without sustained effort. Drawing upon the myth of Aladdin as a narrative of external salvation and effortless ascent, this paper conceptualizes Aladdin Syndrome within a cultural framework, exploring its psychological mechanisms, socioeconomic roots, and digital accelerators. It argues that this syndrome reflects generational responses to economic inequality, media portrayals of luxury lifestyles, and the valorization of spectacle over productive labor. Implications for labor ethics, vulnerability to scams, and societal productivity are discussed, suggesting the need for further interdisciplinary investigation",

          "abstract": "Murphy’s discussion (2025) of his recent ROSE model includes explicit linking hypotheses connecting computational, algorithmic, and implementational levels in the study of language and its neurobiological basis. Here, I argue that establishing the neural basis of the abstract principles underlying natural language syntax will require new data from sign languages, tactile sign languages, as well as typologically diverse spoken languages. The assumption of modality-independent processes for structure building lies at the heart of ROSE, but the proposed correlates for hierarchical and sequential operations must be subjected to empirical test across languages and modalities in the future.",

          "abstract": "Social interaction involves coordination between individuals across multiple domains, including neural activity, behaviour and physiology.  An increasing number of studies shows that interpersonal synchrony can be detected in each of these modalities, but the functional significance of these different types of synchrony remains unclear.  This paper examines the challenge of understanding synchrony in terms of the timescales of interaction.  We provide a novel mapping of interaction types and measurement methods across timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes.   We review candidate mechanisms of synchrony in both neural systems and behaviour, and consider how synchrony measures relate to real world outcomes such as learning and development.   Overall, we provide an integrative approach that, by taking timescales into account, aims to offer a better understanding of the origins and interpretation of interpersonal synchrony.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Although the benefits of in-person religious service attendance are well-documented, the well-being and biopsychosocial effects of virtual worship – more frequent since the COVID-\n19 pandemic - remain largely unexplored. This study examines the impact of attending virtual versus in-person worship.\nMethods: In a preregistered experiment, 43 adult Christians attended both virtual and in-person church services in a randomized order. Participants wore Fitbits to measure heart rate and calories burned and completed post-service surveys assessing social, affective, and well-being outcomes.\nResults: Virtual services resulted in lower transcendent experiences and emotions, shared identity with the congregation, and closeness with God compared to in-person attendance. Physiologically, virtual worship led to lower heart rates and fewer calories burned, indicating reduced embodied engagement. However, well-being scores remained similar.\nConclusions: Virtual worship may not fully replicate in-person experiences. Further research is needed to assess long-term well-being effects and implications for religious engagement.",

          "abstract": "Understanding scientific practices is fundamental to our modern society and to science education. Concepts such as Scientific Reasoning (SR) and Nature of Science (NOS) are important to operationalize different aspects of these practices. Educational policy organizations and international standards emphasize the importance of insights into the activities and thought processes of scientists to improve science learning. As the implementation of these requirements in the classroom is a challenging goal, videos are effective tools for making aspects of scientific practices visible that often remain hidden for students. Current approaches in science education tend to adopt either an affective-volitional focus by authentic insights into scientific practices or a cognitive focus by promoting student skills in the context of SR or NOS. In this theoretical contribution, we argue for a synergistic integration of these foci. Following this argument, we derive a systematic framework for video development by combining insights from science education with the contextual analysis of science and technology studies and philosophy, which aims to open the black box of scientific practices while developing videos that systematically address students' skills and provide authentic insights into scientific research processes. In this paper, we present a new systematic framework for video development and provide examples of videos created using this framework for discussion within the scientific community.",

          "abstract": "Skilled interpersonal support and safety monitoring can enhance the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds and reduce the potential for harm. In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "authors": "Ke Zhang",
          "abstract": "Abstract. Semantic information in images—such as meaningful, recognizable regions or objects that are incongruent with the overall scene—can effectively capture attention. The meaning map is currently the primary method for mapping the distribution of semantic information across visual stimuli. However, this approach relies on subjective human ratings of semantic meaningfulness and requires extensive manual annotation for each image prior to analysis. To address these limitations and enable rapid, efficient, and reproducible generation of semantic distribution maps for any given image, this paper proposes an automated method for constructing semantic information maps using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach generates two types of semantic maps: local semantic information maps, which quantify the semantic content at each spatial location within an image, and global semantic maps, which assess the contextual relevance of local regions to the overall scene. Additionally, the method can generate distribution maps of visual information associated with specific concepts. We argue that this method significantly enhances the precision and flexibility in controlling, measuring, and manipulating semantic information in visual stimuli, thereby advancing research in visual attention and visual language processing. The method is currently under further refinement.",

          "abstract": "Life is proposed as being more expansive in terms of reach and capability than currently understood. Aspects of life are presented suggesting it should be considered as a distributed intelligence that has established structures and designs in the realms of computation/information, memory/quantum mechanics, and even consciousness, before these realms were discovered by modern intelligent humans.  The nature of consciousness is discussed in depth, referencing specific research including advances in renormalization techniques that imply consciousness exists at a fractal critical point in the brain and that consciousness is most likely fractal and holographic and exists on a space-time boundary where consciousness and memories are stored and operate external to the human mind, analogous to cloud computing. A “grande vista” of life conceptual framework is proposed noting life’s progression of “existential leaps.”",

          "abstract": "Muchos individuos con alto cociente intelectual asumen que la emoción es un estorbo de la razón. Sin embargo, múltiples disciplinas científicas coinciden en que la no integración emocional puede limitar severamente la disponibilidad funcional de las áreas ejecutivas del cerebro, afectando la creatividad, la toma de decisiones complejas y la flexibilidad cognitiva. Este artículo explora, desde un enfoque transdisciplinar (neurociencia, psicología clínica, epigenética, neuroeconomía e inteligencia artificial), cómo los bloqueos emocionales no procesados actúan como loops proyectivos internos que secuestran la corteza prefrontal a través de activaciones límbicas crónicas. Estos patrones reducen la expresión real de genialidad, afectando incluso a líderes de alto rendimiento intelectual. A través del modelo de integración emocional IEAD y la lógica simbólica cuántica, se propone una vía operativa para restaurar el acceso funcional completo al potencial cognitivo. La verdadera libertad cognitiva no surge del control emocional, sino de su integración consciente y regulada.",

          "abstract": "Progressive tests are a popular tailored test format where items are administered in increasing order of difficulty level and discontinued according to a rule system that should counter excessive response burden for test participants and guarantee efficient use of resources for test administrators. To facilitate evidence-based decision-making for setting appropriate discontinue rules, we propose a transparent approach that charts the impact of varied alternative discontinue rules on accuracy and efficiency. These A-E charts are based on retroactively applying discontinue rules to normative item response data. We show that a universal discontinue rule likely does not exist and that the optimal rule varies as a function of the desired efficiency-accuracy trade-off suitable for the intended test use and target population. The proposed approach provides a pragmatic solution for practitioners, researchers, test developers, and test publishers to rethink the existing discontinue rules, systematically evaluate the alternatives, and set appropriate rules.",

          "abstract": "Two-stage models of grammatical encoding posit that sentence production unfolds in two sequential steps: the construction of a hierarchical syntactic structure, followed by its linearization into a sequence suitable for articulation. While widely accepted in psycho- and neurolinguistics, such models lack formal computational implementations. Here, we introduce a novel Multinomial Processing Tree (MPT) model that operationalizes this two-stage framework to explain syntactic error patterns in individuals with aphasia. Drawing on discourse samples annotated for distinct error types, we fit an MPT model to estimate individual abilities at each processing stage. These ability estimates correlated with observed error rates and localized to distinct neural substrates: hierarchical encoding ability was linked to the posterior superior temporal sulcus and parietal cortex, linearization to posterior frontal and anterior parietal regions, and omission-related processes to the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between hierarchical and linear stages of grammatical encoding, aligning with prior lesion-symptom mapping and theoretical accounts of expressive agrammatism and paragrammatism. This work represents the first computational instantiation of a two-stage model of syntactic production, bridging formal modeling and lesion analysis to advance our understanding of the architecture and breakdown of grammatical encoding.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring flexible updating of internal representations. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study also incorporated an online target detection during exposure, to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality-specific differences. The online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, our offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. These learning effects were only present in the auditory modality, with no evidence of visual statistical learning. Our results corroborate earlier findings and underscore the importance of online measures in capturing flexible learning that is not captured by offline measures.",

How such brain-heart communication mechanisms emerge across development and in naturalistic settings is unclear. In a pediatric sample with and without anxiety disorders, we calculated measures of brain-heart ‘coherence’ during an anxiety-inducing movie clip and at rest. Our primary analysis did not indicate anxiety-potentiated effects of coherence between heart rate and amygdala-prefrontal dynamic connectivity. However, exploratory analyses indicated that pediatric patients with anxiety disorders might exhibit relatively greater coherence between heart rate and sgACC activity. This provides preliminary evidence for a role of the sgACC in the development of somatic symptoms of anxiety.",

For example, characters who imitate the actions of a specific social partner are more likely, compared to a non-imitator, to help that social partner in the future. Infants’ expectations appear to be based on inferences of specific relationships, as they do not generalize to new social targets. Here we ask, however, if infants will extend expectations of support to the friend of a friend. We investigated whether infants could use their observations of two social agents’ positive social imitation interactions with the same target to make a transitive inference that the mutual affiliates were likely to be affiliated themselves. We did not find any evidence that infants used these observations to infer that mutual affiliates were more likely to be affiliated themselves.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

Neglecting one’s interests, desires, and duties in favor of others arguably goes along with a manifold of psychological consequences for individuals high in people pleasing. In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 794), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. This report will be updated once the target sample size (n2 = 1,293) for Study 2 is achieved.",

          "authors": "Franziska Magdalene Leipold; Arndt Bröder; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The G parameter of the lens model equation is a widely used measure of cue-based judgment accuracy, capturing how well individuals align their cue use with ecological validities in probabilistic environments. Despite its popularity across various research domains, the psychological interpretability of G may be severely limited when estimated in the conventional way, that is, based on separate, participant-level regression models. In this paper, we identify core statistical limitations of the conventional approach and demonstrate how these may lead to severely biased conclusions about judgment accuracy across a range of plausible scenarios. To remedy these limitations and increase the meaningfulness of G estimates, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the hierarchical approach yields markedly more accurate and robust G estimates, especially under realistic forms of model misspecification, such as omitted cues, omitted interactions, and misspecified nonlinear relationships. Two empirical illustrations—in the domains of healthiness judgments and metamemory—demonstrate the practical impact of modeling choice, further highlighting the bias in the conventional G parameter when misspecifying model equations. These findings challenge long-held beliefs about human judgment accuracy that were based on the conventional lens model approach. To avoid misleading conclusions due to biased estimates, we advocate for adopting the hierarchical approach as a more valid and reliable tool for measuring cue-based judgment accuracy, thereby strengthening the methodological rigor of judgment and decision-making research.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis use is widely on the rise for recreational and medicinal purposes, with the latter often aimed at improving mental health and cognition. Simultaneously, the prevalence of cannabis-related health harms, such as cannabis use disorder (CUD), is increasing. Product potency, route of administration, and preexisting mental health symptoms play a role in the effects of cannabis; however, there is limited research on how broader factors, such as local cannabis legislation and perceptions of use, may influence these outcomes. Moreover, knowledge remains sparse regarding the growing population of medicinal users, predominantly using without medical supervision. Altogether, this illustrates the need for ecologically valid ways to investigate individuals and their cannabis usage within real-world settings. \nTherefore, this longitudinal, cross-cultural online study examines an international sample of regular recreational and medicinal users (aged 18-65) from different cannabis jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil, Canada, and regions in Asia and Africa) in their natural environment via their mobile phone. By using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), alongside a comprehensive battery of cognition and mental health related assessments over a 2-year period, we aim to gain insight into the short- and long-term mental health and cognitive determinants and consequences of cannabis use, and how these interact with broader, contextual factors, such as legislation. This is one of the first cross-cultural studies assessing both positive and negative effects of cannabis longitudinally, examining the full range of effects that cannabis may have on the individual.",

          "authors": "Tzu-Yao Lin; Yung Fong Hsu",
          "abstract": "Cultural consensus theory (CCT), developed by Batchelder and colleagues in the mid-1980s, is a cognitively driven methodology to assess informants’ consensus in which the culturally correct answers are unknown to researchers a priori. The primary goal of CCT is to uncover the cultural knowledge, preferences or beliefs shared by group members. One of the CCT models, called\nthe general Condorcet model (GCM), deals with dichotomous (e.g., true/false) response data which are collected from a group of informants who share the same cultural knowledge. We propose a new model, called the general Condorcet-Luce-Krantz (GCLK) model, which incorporates the GCM\nwith the Luce-Krantz threshold theory. The GCLK accounts for ordinal categorical data (including Likert-type questionnaires) in which informants can express confidence levels when answering the items/questions. In addition to finding out the consensus truth to the items, the GCLK also estimates other response characteristics, including the item-difficulty levels, informants’ competency levels, and guessing biases. We introduce the multicultural version of the GCLK that can help researchers detect the number of cultures for a given dataset. We use the hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach and\nthe Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method for estimation. A posterior predictive check is established to test the central assumptions of the model. Through a series of simulations, we evaluate the model’s applicability and find that the GCLK performs well on parameter recovery.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based on single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature for its application in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, 1) suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and 2) validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology and conclude by offering suggestions for how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the emerging cognitive and moral risks posed by artificial intelligence chatbots and digital media platforms such as facebook, Instagram and youtube; particularly their potential to contribute to the decline of human attention, thinking, reasoning, and emotional depth. As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines. The paper outlines core zones within the Cognitive Gym, suggests generalized exercise types, and highlights its potential to counteract cognitive and moral decline in the AI era. The model remains open-ended, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration and contextual customization for future development.",

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

While many have positive experiences of EIP, there have also been reports of perceived harm. This scoping review synthesised qualitative evidence on service user perspectives of potential harm in EIP services in the UK, to consider how services may continue to improve practice to meet the needs of their patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following a pre-registered protocol. Systematic searches were performed in PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Medline on 9th October 2024. We included peer-reviewed qualitative studies exploring service user experiences in EIP services in the UK. Data on reported harms from eligible studies were thematically analysed.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. We identified four main themes: (1) Intersection of stigma and lack of cultural awareness; (2) Inappropriate or inadequate support; (3) Poor relationships and communication; and (4) Challenges in the discharge process.\n\nConclusions: While EIP services offer the current gold standard of care for first episode psychosis, our review highlighted some areas where harm was perceived to have arisen. Such information presents potential targets for service improvement. Strengthening communication, enhancing information sharing, and expanding access to advocacy may help mitigate potential harms and optimise service user experiences. Further research to quantify the prevalence of harms within EIP services is needed to inform best practices and ensure equitable, person-centred care.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes, and people need to limit how much information they search for. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. In the model, the search process is governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information and on the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many established empirical findings on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of top-down effects of attention, we present results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. Our theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants of it and another extant theory that assume other search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. The proposed framework provides a general approach to understanding the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decisions.",

          "abstract": "When confronted with alternative possibilities, we experience different kinds of uncertainty: with physical uncertainty the outcome has yet to happen, while with epistemic uncertainty the outcome has happened, but is unknown. Previous work suggests an asymmetry in acquisition: children prepare for physically uncertainty prior to epistemic uncertainty (Robinson et al., 2006). The present studies tested the robustness of this developmental asymmetry with minimal contrast pairs of uncertainty conditions. Across two studies (N = 204, 3- to 6-year-old German-speaking children), we found no differences between the conditions: Children did not prepare differently for multiple incompatible outcomes of physically and epistemically uncertain events. Our findings stand in tension with previous findings and recent theoretical work on the development of modal cognition.",

          "abstract": "Enduring Mental Health (EMH) has been defined as maintaining good psychological functioning without developing mental health problems. Estimates of the proportion of individuals who have EMH vary widely. We investigated EMH across the lifespan, defined not only as absence of mental health problems, but also as consistent presence of high wellbeing. To explore how defining EMH affects prevalence, we included both stricter and broader lenient thresholds for mental health problems and low wellbeing.\n\nData came from 16,030 participants (35.2% male; average birth year 1970) from the longitudinal Netherlands Twin Register, who completed ≥4 assessments of mental health and/or wellbeing over 8–20 years. For each EMH definition, preregistered analyses included computation of prevalence, genetic and environmental influences using twin modeling, and phenotypic and genetic correlates including education, personality, social factors, and genetic predispositions for mental health outcomes.\n\nAs expected, the choice of threshold had a substantial impact on EMH prevalence estimates, 71% for absence of problems and 93% for high wellbeing when applying stricter thresholds for mental health compared to lenient thresholds, 42% and 82%, respectively. Heritability estimates (46-61%) and patterns of associations for EMH were similar across the different mental health thresholds. Protective factors included optimism, social support, and good self-rated health (OR= 1.50-2.86), while neuroticism, loneliness, and perceived stress were risk factors (OR=0.31-0.84).\n\nWe show the importance of defining EMH as both the absence of problems and the presence of wellbeing. While prevalence varied depending on threshold and definition used, the consistent genetic and psychosocial correlates for different definitions of EMH suggest stable underlying mechanisms that can inform prevention to help individuals maintain mental health.",

          "abstract": "The development of word reading skills fundamentally depends on children's interactions with printed words. A significant amount of research in the psychological and educational sciences has been conducted on the learning processes that contribute to skilled word recognition in children and adults. However, little is known about how ensembles of words encountered during early learning affect learning outcomes over timescales larger than what can be accomplished in a controlled experimental setting. In order to move past this limitation, using an established connectionist learning architecture (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989) we examined how variation in word ensembles influence learning and generalization during early reading acquisition. We simulated learners (N = 30,000) exposed to different sets of monosyllabic printed words drawn randomly from children’s literature at a large scale. In order to examine how different ensembles might impact learning depending on the learner's ability to represent the relationship between letters and sounds, we also manipulated the representational capacity of models by systematically changing the number of hidden units, holding the ensemble of words constant. Across levels of representational capacity each model had \"twins\" which differed only in terms of the number of hidden units they possessed. Results demonstrate significant variation in learning outcomes in a set of generalization words as a function of the word, ensemble and representational capacity. These findings inform educational practices by highlighting the importance of deliberate word selection to support early development.",

Using data from the Africa Long Life Study, which sampled young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa (N = 2,770), we tested how personality traits are linked to seven important life outcomes. The Big Two personality traits, agency and communion, were assessed 2 to 3 years prior to the assessment of outcomes, including self-reported health, employment status, and anxiety. We used specification-curve analysis to examine the robustness of personality-outcome associations. Higher levels of agency and communion robustly predicted higher levels of self-rated health, and lower levels of anxiety and depression over 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, higher levels of communion predicted being employed 2 to 3 years later. However, personality-outcome associations were smaller than expected based on findings from Western countries (.02 ≤ |r| ≤ .11). Our findings provide novel insights into the cross-cultural replicability of personality-outcome associations, and we discuss the implications of our findings for personality research.",

Participants (N = 41) were classified into four groups based on the degree of smoking (≤ 14 or ≥ 15 cigarettes per day) and the median total score on resilience scales (low-resilience low-smoking, low-resilience high-smoking, high-resilience low-smoking, and high-resilience high-smoking). Participants completed the TSST-OL, measuring subjective stress and salivary cortisol, at eight time points. A two-piece multilevel growth curve model with landmark registration (GCM-LR) examined the effects of smoking habits and resilience scores on cortisol concentrations. Blunted cortisol responses were similarly present in all four groups; thus, my hypothesis was unsupported. All groups showed similarly elevated subjective stress responses. GCM-LR results showed no significant cortisol increase, but the fixed effect of cortisol recovery was significant. The likelihood ratio test showed that the random effect of resilience scores was significant. Habitual smokers do not have an elevated cortisol response, even in stressful situations. Substantial individual differences were suggested in the effect of resilience scale scores on cortisol concentration.",

Humans, like all life, are sensitive to their environment.  Mentally ill or unstable individuals can be triggered into impulsive and violent activities from spikes in serum serotonin.  Human serum histamine level is directly proportional to environmental allergen or pollen levels, but serum serotonin level is inversely proportional to serum histamine levels with human males having 52% more serotonin than females.  Data show an association between the dates of violent acts, especially male single shooter mass shootings in the United States, and the dates of dramatic decreases in pollen levels thus indicating pollen and serum histamine level drops as a possible precursor or triggering relationship.  This knowledge can be used as a potential predictor for law enforcement and medical agencies for a given city or region.  Mental health professionals would be advised to lower serotonin boosting meds and even supplement antihistamine and sedative medications to male patients in the timeframes of March through June, for spring tree pollens especially juniper tree pollen, and from September through November, for fall ragweed weed pollen.",

          "authors": "Vaishnavi B Mohan; Ezgi Irmak Yucel; Ione Fine; Geoffrey M. Boynton",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Optogenetics is a promising technology to restore vision in individuals with blindness due to retinal disorders. Light-sensitive proteins (opsins) are introduced intravitreally and bind to surviving non-photosensitive retinal cells to elicit a neural response to visual stimuli. Much of this research is done with mouse models, where it is not obvious how a given opsin would translate to human visual perception. Our goal was to provide estimates of potential patients’ spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity and perceptual experiences. We created ‘virtual patients’ consisting of neurotypical subjects viewing stimuli modified to match the temporal properties of two state-of-the-art opsins 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 and ChRmine. Methods: A non-linear model based on single cell electrophysiological data describing the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of each opsin was used to spatiotemporally modulate a counterphase modulated Gabor stimulus to replicate the predicted retinal stimulus of optogenetic patients. Contrast detection thresholds for optogenetic and control stimuli were obtained using a 2AFC quick CSF Bayesian adaptive procedure across a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Results: Contrast sensitivity for 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 declined rapidly with increasing temporal frequency compared to the control stimulus, consistent with this opsin’s slow temporal dynamics. Sensitivity to opsin ChRmine was lower overall, but there was little decline in sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies. Conclusion: Using this virtual patient paradigm, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and temporal resolution for two example opsins. 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 would be expected to outperform ChRmine under many laboratory tests, such as a Snellen eye chart for a patient capable of maintaining stable fixation. However ChRmine would be predicted to outperform 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 during outdoor navigation in daylight. Ultimately, our goal is to predict patients’ performance across a wide range of clinically relevant tasks directly from an opsin’s temporal dynamics, paving the way for informed optimization of sight-restoration therapies before clinical application.",

The model posits that in managing intercultural relations, individuals are driven by the needs for growth and development as well as the needs for security and safety. Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature. Finally, the contributions of the ALPs model to theoretical advancement are evaluated.",

          "abstract": "Around 60% of young people worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity, such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty. These stressful experiences can have long-lasting effects and significantly increase the risk of mental health problems. To aid future intervention and prevention efforts, my doctoral research examined how childhood adversity contributes to mental health difficulties, and whether and how friendships can help protect against these effects.\n\nUsing a combination of literature reviews, behavioral studies, and brain imaging research, my colleagues and I found that young people with more severe childhood adversity were at greater risk of social isolation, being harmed or harming others, and developing mental health problems. This was partly due to differences in how they process and perceive stress. In addition, we found that those with strong, high-quality friendships reported lower stress perceptions and fewer mental health difficulties.\n\nThese findings matter for two key reasons. First, they detail how childhood adversity increases vulnerability to mental health problems. Second, they demonstrate that high-quality friendships play a critical protective role in mental health – and help explain how, by reducing stress perceptions. Hence, helping young people build and maintain supportive friendships could be an important way to promote mental health, especially for those who have faced childhood adversity.",

This paper introduces the FOCUS method—Find, Organize, Condense, Understand, and Synthesize—a framework for integrating AI into research workflows while preserving intellectual rigor. The approach uses AI-powered search to cast wider nets across formal and informal knowledge sources, converts ephemeral audio content into searchable text, employs structured prompts to extract insights from dense papers, leverages dialogue for deeper comprehension, and maintains human synthesis of disparate findings. Privacy concerns can be addressed through local models or platforms that don't train on user data. When implemented thoughtfully, these tools enable researchers to read more widely and think more deeply without sacrificing the critical thinking that defines good science. As research volume continues growing beyond individual capacity, the FOCUS method offers a path to expand intellectual reach while maintaining scholarly depth.",

          "abstract": "Images vary in how likely they are to be remembered, a characteristic referred to as memorability. While previous work has identified perceptual and semantic features that predict image memorability, less is known about how those features engage the cognitive systems that support memory. One open question is whether attention plays a role. Although some findings suggest that memorability operates independently of attention, these experiments have only tested a limited set of attentional mechanisms. The present research examines whether temporal attention contributes to image memorability using the attentional blink (AB), a phenomenon in which detection of a second target (T2) is impaired when it appears shortly after the first (T1). Two experiments used a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task with streams of images containing two intact targets among scrambled distractors. In Experiment 1, T1 memorability was manipulated, while in Experiment 2, T2 memorability was manipulated. In both experiments, the temporal gap between targets was also manipulated to assess how target memorability influences AB dynamics. Results showed that highly memorable T1s exacerbated the AB, suggesting they engage attention for longer. In contrast, highly memorable T2s attenuated the AB, indicating that they may more effectively trigger the attentional processes required for encoding. These findings suggest that memorability does not operate independently of attention but instead reflects how effectively an image engages the cognitive processes needed for encoding.",

          "abstract": "Persistence and perseverance, even in the face of great adversity, are admirable qualities. However, knowing when to stop pursuing something is as important as exerting effort toward attaining a goal. How do people decide when to persist and when to quit? Here, we design a novel task to study this question, in which people were given a finite number of opportunities to pursue stochastic rewards by selecting among a set of options that provide a reward each trial. At any time, if people were not satisfied with the option they had selected they could choose to abandon it and instead try a new option. However, if they did so they could never return to the previous option. Mathematical analysis of this task shows that the optimal strategy explores a relatively small number of options before settling on a sufficiently good option. Further, we find that the optimal strategy is to abandon an option if the total number of remaining trials exceeds a threshold specified by the observed option’s performance. A large-scale, pre-registered experiment (N = 3, 632) reveals that people largely behave in accordance with the optimal strategy. People also make decisions to persist with an option based on its performance and they typically explore relatively few options before settling on a sufficiently good one. However, compared to the optimal strategy, people are less sensitive to the number of remaining trials and are more likely to persist with sub-optimal options.",

          "abstract": "Human experience varies across contexts and individuals. Yet, psychological studies typically constrain rather than discover this structured variation. We demonstrate an alternative approach that samples deeply and broadly to discover reliable person-specific, multimodal patterns of daily life experience. Ninety-seven healthy adults wore cardiac monitors for 8 hours/day for 14 days and reported current valence, arousal, primary activity, social context, and emotions (via free report) when prompted following a substantial cardiac interbeat interval change (and twice randomly each day). From each event (10,755 total, M=110.9 events/person), we extracted cardiovascular, postural, affective, and contextual features. Integrative clustering of these features identified 313 multimodal patterns (M=3.2 patterns/person), which were largely person-specific, with 81.7% of patterns being unique to one person. The pattern-distinguishing features also varied by person. Finally, self-generated emotion labels had many-to-many mappings with multimodal patterns. Our approach has broad utility and provides further evidence that emotions are diverse populations of instances.",

          "abstract": "In the digital era, human cooperation is increasingly mediated by indirect social cues such as ratings, reviews, and other digital traces left in online environments. These traces often guide collective behavior via stigmergy, a coordination mechanism whereby individuals interact through modifications of a shared environment. In this study, we explore how simple model-driven bots can influence human cooperation or defection in a competitive rating game inspired by online marketplaces. Participants, unaware of the bots' presence, interacted with either four human partners or four bots exhibiting predefined behaviors—cooperative, neutral, deceptive, or optimized for group performance. We show that the presence and behavior of bots significantly affect human strategies and performance. Higher levels of cooperation among bots improve human outcomes but also increase the frequency of deceptive human strategies, suggesting exploitation of reliable social information. Conversely, in less cooperative environments, participants adopt more collaborative or neutral behaviors to preserve informational value. By classifying individuals into three behavioral profiles—collaborators, neutrals, and defectors—we develop a linear regression model using three cues: the average value of rated cells, the diversity of rated cells, and the player's rank. These cues allow accurate prediction of behavioral profile distributions across experimental conditions. An adaptive agent-based model further reproduces the empirical results. Our findings demonstrate that even simple bots can strongly influence collective dynamics in human groups. These insights have implications for the design of recommendation systems, the regulation of automated agents, and the understanding of cooperation and deception in digital societies.",

We conducted a 6-week, digital intervention with multiple treatment groups and a randomized control design (N = 426) to examine the efficacy of theory-based strategies that varied in scope, intensity, and content. Across groups, participants decreased on self-report and implicit neuroticism measures (d = -0.18 to -0.38). Intervention effects exceeded normative change and demand effects, were specific to neuroticism, and persisted at 2-month follow-up (d = -0.14 to -0.43). Efficacy was proportional to treatment intensity and specificity (d = -0.16 to -0.60), and there was some evidence that state-based strategies have stronger immediate effects whereas habit-based strategies have more enduring effects.

Across nine simulation studies, we varied the task complexity and prompt design to examine conditions under which previously reported model-based RL signatures could be replicated. We found that GPT-3.5 showed model-based RL signatures in simplified task settings, but that these effects disappeared under de-simplified task versions. Crucially, model-based reasoning signatures could be re-established when incorporating an inner speech-analog prompt, requiring the LLM agent to reflect on previous trials and anticipate consequences of future actions.

          "authors": "Jenny Zhen-Duan; Alexandre Lussier; Anna E. Wilson; Sarah M. Merrill; Kristin Valentino; Erin C. Dunn; Alejandra D. Chavez",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Parental adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), or adversities parents experience when they are children, significantly impact their children's biobehavioral outcomes. Maternal ACEs are associated with epigenetic age acceleration (EAA; faster biological aging) in infants (Sosnowski et al., 2024) and young children (Nwanaji-Enwerem et al., 2021). While the effects of paternal ACEs and EAA have not been directly examined, emerging studies indicate that paternal ACEs correlate with DNA methylation in their infants, and these methylated CpG (genetic) were associated with externalizing outcomes three years later (Merrill et al., 2021). Family factors (e.g., positive parenting practices) can buffer the association between maternal ACEs and EAA (Sullivan et al., 2023). However, it is unclear if family factors buffer the effects of both maternal and paternal ACEs and EAA; and whether the associations between parental ACEs and EAA are observed later in development, like adolescence.  \n\n \n\nHypotheses: To examine whether parental ACEs and youth’s EAA are moderated by family factors (i.e., family cohesion, parent-child relationship quality). We hypothesized that both fathers’ and mothers’ family-level (e.g., maltreatment, family dysfunction) and community-level (e.g., discrimination, community violence) ACEs would be associated with EAA, but that family factors would mitigate this effect.  \n\n \n\nSample: Participants were from the ENLACEs study. Participating families had to be of Mexican descent, and youth had to be between the ages of 12 and 15 at baseline. Our study included family triads recruited from northern Indiana: youth (n = 120), mothers (n = 120), and fathers (n = 120).  \n\n \n\nStudy Methods: Participants were recruited with the help of community-based partners. Bilingual and bicultural assistants administered surveys to parents in English or Spanish, while youth surveys were self-administered on tablets. Surveys assessing parental ACEs were collected during Wave 1, youth-reported questionnaires of parent-child relationships and family cohesion were collected in Wave 2, and salivary DNA for epigenetic analysis was collected in Wave 2. Epigenetic age acceleration was estimated from two clocks: the Pediatric Buccal Epigenetic (PedBE) and Horvarth. We employed path analysis and maximum likelihood estimations with robust standard errors in R.  \n\n \n\nResults  \n\nConsistent with our hypothesis, the association between fathers' family-level ACEs and youth EAA was moderated by parent-child relationship in both clocks: PedBE (beta=-0.03; p=0.086) and Horvath (beta=-0.173; p=0.004). Similarly, the association between mothers’ community-level ACEs and EAA was moderated by family cohesion: PedBE (beta=-0.009; p=0.041) and Horvath (beta=-0.045; p=0.001). In contrast to hypothesized directions, family cohesion moderated the association between fathers and mothers’ family-level ACEs and EAA: PedBE (beta=0.021; p=0.008) and Horvath (beta=0.018; p=0.036), respectively.   \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nConsistent with previous mother-child dyadic studies, fathers’ ACEs can similarly impact their children’s EAA, and these observations can also be noted during adolescence. While seemingly counterintuitive, this finding points to family cohesion as an element by which family factors can strongly affect their children's biology, whether positively or negatively. Future research will be necessary to elucidate the nuanced impact of family factors on the potential intergenerational biological consequences of parental ACEs, but these findings lay a foundation for future family-based interventions.",

Though alignment of one’s values in one’s work facilitates a persistence in motivation, it is not well understood if STEM faculty researchers are aware of the communal values their student researchers often hold. Here we focus on a key engine of the university research enterprise – graduate students – and ask if faculty mentors are cognizant of and make explicit their attunement to the communal values of their graduate student researchers. We found that when describing the values of graduate students, faculty underestimate the communal values that members of RMM groups are more likely to hold. When faculty communicated communal values, this correlated positively with a more diverse research lab and several measures of faculty success.",

          "abstract": "Climate change represents an unprecedented threat, with rising levels of climate anxiety widely reported. Most psychological research has primarily examined relationships between climate anxiety and mitigation behaviors while largely neglecting adaptation behaviors, which involve preparing for inevitable climate impacts. Yet, ethological and foundational anxiety theories emphasize anxiety's adaptive role in fostering preparedness and proactive coping with threats, particularly in uncertain, future-oriented situations. Based on this framework, we examined whether intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and future anticipation influence the association between climate anxiety and adaptation versus mitigation behaviors. In a preregistered fashion, we analyzed data from 968 French-speaking adults using two complementary computational network modeling approaches: (1) a graphical Gaussian model to examine conditional associations among climate anxiety, IU components (prospective and inhibitory), future anticipation, experience of climate change, and adaptation and mitigation behaviors; and (2) a directed acyclic graph to generate a data-driven model of the directional probabilistic dependencies among these variables. Results consistently highlighted prospective IU—characterized by proactive information-seeking and planning in the face of uncertainty—as central within the network, and positively linked to adaptation behaviors and climate anxiety. Conversely, inhibitory IU (characterized by paralysis in uncertainty) appeared to be peripheral. This study, which relies on new computational methods, emphasizes the essential yet overlooked role of adaptation and offers fresh, data-driven insights into its relationship with climate anxiety, future anticipations, and intolerance of uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Arie Todd Greenleaf",
          "abstract": "Modern science, from physics to biology, rests on a foundational assumption: entities are primary, and the relations between them are secondary. This paper argues that this substance-first ontology is the principal barrier to a scientific theory of consciousness and proposes its inversion: relations are fundamental.\nFrom this new paradigm, termed Dynergeia, a specific, falsifiable theory of consciousness naturally emerges. It posits that experience is instantiated whenever five universal relational patterns (self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness, and flux) achieve dynamic coherence within a system’s native temporal window (τ). This state is quantified by a substrate-agnostic metric, Pattern-Temporal Synergy (PTS), which makes high-risk predictions, including a precise collapse under anesthesia and a strong correlation with cross-species behavioral flexibility.\nThis relational framework does not merely offer a new solution; it dissolves the old problems. The \"hard problem\" is revealed as a category error. Time is reframed as an emergent architecture constructed by coordinated events. The result is a proposed unification of the physical and phenomenological worlds, grounded not in a shared substance, but in a shared universal grammar. This work presents a direct, empirical test of a new foundation for science itself.",

However, the causal impact of ruminative\nstates on cognitive performance and subjective difficulties remains untested.\n\nMethods:\nIn a preregistered online study, 282 participants were randomly assigned to a rumination\nor neutral group. Both groups recalled an upsetting event, followed by a rumination\ninduction or neutral condition for either group. WM was assessed using an n-back task,\nwhile subjective difficulties were assessed through effort rating. These were administered\nbefore and after induction. Mixed ANOVAs were employed to assess the induction effects.\n\nResults:\nThere was a significant group × time interaction for performance and effort perception\n(independently from performance).

We conducted two pre-registered studies (N=408 and N=906) examining how Americans perceive support for political violence within their own and opposing political parties. In Study 1, Democrats estimated that 29.60% of Republicans report supporting political violence, but only 1.83% of Republicans actually report support, representing a 1,517% overestimation. In contrast, Republicans estimated that 19.48% of Democrats report supporting political violence, but only 3.54 % of Democrats actually did—a 450% overestimation. Thus, while both groups overestimated the prevalence of outparty members’ political violence support, we find that Democrats are significantly more pessimistic. In Study 2, we replicated this finding with a larger, nationally representative sample. We also explored the limits of this asymmetry and found no evidence of asymmetric perceptions for non-political crime support or ingroup members’ political violence support, suggesting a unique asymmetry in perceived outgroup political violence support.",

Official practice is not available, leading candidates to practice with unofficial re-creations and with or without access to the stick-and-throttle used on the PBM. \n\nMethod: Our between-subjects study with 152 cadets from the U.S. Military Academy evaluated the impact of mouse/keyboard or stick/throttle practice on the psychomotor portions of the PBM compared to a control group that was only presented with an informational video.\n\nResults: The results showed that practice with either input device resulted in improved performance relative to control on the PBM’s two-dimensional airplane tracking task (ATT). For the simpler vertical tracking task (VTT), the mouse/keyboard group showed significantly worse performance than either stick/throttle practice or control groups, indicating a transfer cost from practicing with an alternative input device.\n\nConclusion: The results suggest that becoming familiar with the unique dynamics of the ATT may be more important than practicing with the appropriate input device. Conversely, device-specific motor learning appears to be a more impactful determinant of performance for the simpler VTT. This shows that transfer effects from alternative input devices depends in part on properties of the task.\n\nApplication: This research can inform practice policies for psychomotor test selection.",

          "abstract": "Why do people feel curious about some questions but not others? Recent accounts of curiosity argue that curiosity should be highest when learning is likely to occur and likely to be rapid. This implies that variation in “information accessibility”—the ease and speed with which information can be acquired—might affect curiosity. Specifically, learning is less likely to occur and less likely to be rapid when information is less accessible, which might decrease curiosity. We tested this prediction in three preregistered experiments with a total of 419 participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, we prompted adult participants to rate their curiosity about the answers to trivia questions. For each question, they were informed that information accessibility would be high—they would receive the answer with minimal time and effort—or low—they would receive the answer with substantial time and effort. In Experiment 3, we additionally varied the probability that information search would be successful. Across studies, we found that information accessibility affected decisions to seek information, but not self-reported curiosity. This suggests that curiosity is unhindered by the practical costs of information search—and perhaps, sensitive to “idealized” expectations about the learning process, rather than “practical” expectations that incorporate current barriers to learning.",

          "authors": "Marco Facchin",
          "abstract": "When we perceive, there is something we perceive. When we think, there is something we think\nof. When we dream, something is dreamt. These seem all platitudes: obvious and unproblematic\ntruths. And, given that the things perceived, thought of, or dreamed are what philosophers call the\nmental contents of our states, few things should seem as obvious and unproblematic as the\nexistence of mental contents. And yet, I shall here argue that, when closely examined, mental\ncontents appear to be illusions. Just like the proverbial sawn-in-half assistant on the magician\nstage, they merely appear to exist, without actually existing. To substantiate this view I will first fix\nthe reference of “mental content” and “illusion” in an innocent, theory neutral manner - that is, by\nrelying on paradigmatic positive and negative examples of them (sections 2 and 3). I will also show\nthat such paradigmatic examples allow us to extract a list of features that such examples allow us\nto identify features that paradigmatically identify contents and illusions as such, enabling us to\nrecognize them. With these features at hand, I will thus argue that mental contents bear all the\nfeatures that paradigmatically identify illusions. Otherwise put, I will argue that mental contents\nare anomalous, causally insulated, systematic, persistent and bound to a single mode of access in\nthe same way paradigmatic examples of illusions are (Section 4). Having argued for my main claim,\nI will defend it from a couple of intuitive objections; namely that it is to silly to be taken seriously,\ngiven that mental content is given in a way that does not permit to seriously doubt of its existence\n(section 5), and that my claim is incoherent (section 6). I’ll show that, intuitive as they are, the\nobjections are not compelling, and indeed they can be easily answered. Lastly, I will conclude the\npaper sketching the possible developments of an illusionistic view of content (section 7).",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology, and conclude by offering suggestions of how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "There is a growing realization that experimental tasks that produce reliable effects in group comparisons can simultaneously provide unreliable assessments of individual differences. Proposed solutions to this “reliability paradox” range from collecting more test trials to modifying the tasks and/or the way in which effects are measured from these tasks. Here we systematically compare two proposed modeling solutions in a cognitive conflict task. Using the ratio of individual variability of the conflict effect (i.e., signal) and the trial-by-trial variation in the data (i.e., noise) obtained from Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we examine whether improving statistical modeling may improve the reliability of individual differences assessment in four Stroop datasets. The proposed improvements are 1) increasing the descriptive adequacy of the statistical models from which conflict effects are derived, and 2) using psychologically-motivated measures from cognitive measurement models. Our results show that the type of model does not have a consistent effect on the signal-to-noise ratio: the proposed solutions improved reliability in only one of the four datasets. We provide analytical and simulation-based approaches to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for a range of models of varying sophistication and discuss their potential to aid in developing and comparing new measurement solutions to the reliability paradox.",

          "abstract": "Many of today’s pressing societal challenges, such as organ shortages, low vaccination rates, and climate change, require significant changes in individual behavior. One promising intervention to encourage such behavioral change is the opt-out default, which presumes consent for a desirable action rather than requiring active opt in. While past research focused on the impact of opt-out defaults on the targeted behavior, potential crowding out of related behaviors has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigate whether adopting opt-out policies for deceased organ donation reduces living donations, a related prosocial behavior serving the same public good. Analyzing epidemiological panel data from countries that adopted an opt-out default between 2000 and 2023, we find that the policy switch, on average, leads to a non-significant increase in annual deceased donor rates of +1.21 people per million population (+7%, P = .213) but to a significant decrease in living donor rates of -4.59 people per million population (–29%, P = .026). Across four additional studies, we demonstrate that this crowding out effect is reflected in a reduced willingness for living altruistic (vs. familial) donations and is attributable to a stronger belief that the organ supply is sufficiently met with deceased donations under opt-out (vs. opt-in). Our research advances insights into the unintended consequences of default nudges and suggests ways to mitigate them.",

In three independent studies in two countries (total N of participants = 4,700), we applied network analyses and structural equation modelling to investigate the network of personality (Dark Triad and Big Five), resilience and anxiety. The results confirmed, for the first time with longitudinal evidence, the pattern of indirect associations between the Dark Triad and anxiety through resilience/mental toughness. The findings also emphasized the importance of differentiating the three ‘dark traits’, as they showed different relations with other traits in the network. For example, narcissism was unique among the Dark Triad in that it predicted better mental health, whereas Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to poorer resilience and mental health.  Narcissism was also the most influential node in the network of personality, resilience and anxiety. Considering the consistency of the effects across the samples, the results provide a promising avenue for research into malleability of personality networks and for developing educational and workplace interventions.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action), offering a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. Moving beyond purely mechanistic descriptions, the model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is realized through the constant dynamic interplay between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptive and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I\"s. The HS is responsible for the awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and the awareness of interactions and relationships. \n\nA unifying and central principle orchestrating the mind's dynamism and facilitating fluid transitions between these functional spheres is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. But how these predictions and knowledge itself take shape is guided by a fundamental process called Cognitive Morphogenesis. This process describes how knowledge is generated and organized at all levels, from the simplest to the most complex, operating through the dynamic interaction of the HS and QS. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies a sensory/cognitive anticipation (\"the then\" of \"if...then\"), and execution performs an action to verify a motor/intentional anticipation. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates into the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). It also touches upon the related systems of mnemonic encoding and representation (holistic and quantum encoding). The integrated and dynamic nature of the mind is emphasized, laying the groundwork for future, more in-depth discussions of each functional sphere and their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, such as the crucial role of gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention and perceptual anticipation, as well as their manifestation in higher-level cognitive processes like language, specifically explored through Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). \n\nThe article further discusses the model's validity at a high level of generalization, highlighting its coherence and the possibility of descending to more detailed levels of analysis for a deeper understanding of mental and neural phenomena, including the articulation of the HS and QS across different interoceptive and exteroceptive sensory modalities.",

In response, this article introduces Computational Thinking (CT) as a novel, non-pharmacological framework to support cognitive organization in older adults experiencing cognitive frailty. Though CT has gained traction in fields like PK-16 education, including special education, for enhancing executive function and problem-solving, it has not yet been applied to geriatric- or memory-care contexts. This perspective proposes that CT’s core components (i.e., decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking) may align with residual cognitive strengths in mild-to-moderate dementia, offering a strengths-based, meta-cognitive scaffold for processing routines, instructions, and transitions. We provide theoretical rationale, interdisciplinary support, and concrete implementation examples to illustrate how CT can augment existing care models. By emphasizing cognitive structuring over costly service expansion, CT has the potential to complement current interventions and inform more efficient, person-centered dementia care strategies.",

Using Bayesian statistics, we found cumulative evidence that when support givers used higher pitch in delivering these reappraisals, targets of support experienced less negative affect. Targets of support also reported greater relationship satisfaction with support givers who used higher pitch during reappraisal.

          "abstract": "How we recognise objects and people despite their physical appearance can change dramatically across encounters is a central yet unresolved question in vision science. In particular, the visual information that supports the human ability to recognize face identity across views is unknown. Past research suggests horizontally oriented face information plays a key role. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the orientation of the visual information physically available in the face stimulus to support view-tolerant face recognition and how human observers make use of it.\nHuman observers performed an old/new identity recognition task with face stimuli presented under different viewpoints, achieved by rotating the faces in yaw (from full-frontal to profile) and filtered to preserve contrast in selective orientation ranges. Human performance remained tuned to the horizontal range of face information irrespective of yaw. \nWe used a model observer approach to define the information physically available in the stimulus for matching face identity within a single viewpoint or across different viewpoints. The view-selective (within-view) model indicated that face identity is carried by orientation ranges shifting from horizontal in frontal views to vertical in profile views.  In contrast, the view-tolerant (across-views) model showed that the horizontal range provides the most stable identity cues across views. The horizontally-tuned orientation profile of human recognition performance was predicted by the high diagnosticity of horizontal information in frontal views and the stability of the horizontal identity cues across views.\nOur findings indicate that the invariant representation of a face, gradually learned through repeated exposure to its natural appearance statistics, relies primarily on horizontal facial information. By identifying the spatial information supporting view-tolerant face recognition in humans, the present work yields concrete, data-driven constraints for the refinement of visual recognition models.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a significant public health concern due to their high prevalence and substantial impact across the lifespan. Despite advances in understanding their neurobiological underpinnings, the transdiagnostic mechanisms driving psychiatric conditions remain unclear. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI) is an emerging, non-invasive technique for investigating the dopaminergic (DA) and norepinephric (NE) systems, offering valuable insights into their role in psychiatric disorders. This review explores the potential of NM-MRI in psychiatric research, emphasizing its ability to reveal links between DA and NE dysregulation and psychiatric conditions, therewith offering insights in neurobiological mechanisms. We summarize current NM-MRI findings across psychiatric disorders, including psychosis, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. Overall, NM-MRI has shown considerable potential in studying psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, addiction, and depression. However, its application remains limited in disorders like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders, despite their known associations with DA and NE dysfunction. To fully establish NM-MRI as a clinical research tool, further efforts are needed to standardize protocols and improve the technique’s specificity and reliability in psychiatric contexts. Moreover, longitudinal studies and cross-diagnostic comparisons are essential to establish NM-MRI as a potential marker for treatment response and identifying individuals at risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Current review underscores the promise of NM-MRI's for early diagnosis, intervention, and advancing mental health research.",

          "abstract": "Analogies are a fundamental part of our cognition and communication. Humans are also a social species with shared cultural repertoires learnt throughout our lifetimes. As such, we expect analogies to enable the learning of complex, novel information by communication that takes advantage of shared cultural information. Here, we demonstrate the plausibility of this proposal and clarify its scope through computational modelling. We first model the individual-level process of learning via analogy with access to a shared repertoire of cultural information, using NK landscapes to represent high-dimensional solution spaces for complex problems. We then analyse a model of population dynamics to consider the conditions under which analogical communication will evolve and be maintained when costly. Our analyses suggest that even when analogy use is costly in terms of both search time and memory constraints, it can nevertheless be advantageous by allowing learners to obtain high-quality solutions more efficiently and more often than those who don't learn via analogy.",

          "abstract": "Social relationships are central to well-being because they fulfill basic affiliation needs. To describe how these needs are regulated, theories connect daily-life processes of social contact, social desire, and affect. Still, such processes remain empirically underexplored because of their complexity. In this study, we estimated multivariate associations of social desire and affect with social contact across different modalities (in-person, digital), time scales (hourly, daily), and levels of analysis (between-person, contemporaneous, temporally lagged). Participants from two age-heterogeneous samples answered experience sampling questions and contributed data through unobtrusive smartphone sensing, with roughly hourly assessments across 2 days (N = 303) and daily assessments across 14 days (N = 377). Multi-level vector autoregressive network models revealed associations between social contact, social desire, and affect across levels of analysis. Results were highly specific to the examined time scale. When measured at an hourly timescale, people desired more social contact than usual when they engaged in more in-person contact, and higher social desire predicted more future social contact in both experience sampling and smartphone sensing. In contrast, at a daily timescale, social desire did not predict future contact. Bidirectional linkages of affect and social contact were also much denser hourly (vs. daily). Compared to in-person contact, calls and communication app usage generally showed distinct associations with affect. We discuss theoretical implications for the dynamic regulation of social needs, especially regarding temporal processes and the role of positive affect in predicting social contact. Finally, we delineate future directions of multi-method research into daily-life social dynamics.",

          "abstract": "How we recognise objects and people despite their physical appearance can change dramatically across encounters is a central yet unresolved question in vision science. In particular, the visual information that supports the human ability to recognize face identity across views is unknown. Past research suggests horizontally oriented face information plays a key role. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the orientation of the visual information physically available in the face stimulus to support view-tolerant face recognition and how human observers make use of it.\nHuman observers performed an old/new identity recognition task with face stimuli presented under different viewpoints, achieved by rotating the faces in yaw (from full-frontal to profile) and filtered to preserve contrast in selective orientation ranges. Human performance remained tuned to the horizontal range of face information irrespective of yaw. \nWe used a model observer approach to define the information physically available in the stimulus for matching face identity within a single viewpoint or across different viewpoints. The view-selective (within-view) model indicated that face identity is carried by orientation ranges shifting from horizontal in frontal views to vertical in profile views.  In contrast, the view-tolerant (across-views) model showed that the horizontal range provides the most stable identity cues across views. The horizontally-tuned orientation profile of human recognition performance was predicted by the high diagnosticity of horizontal information in frontal views and the stability of the horizontal identity cues across views.\nOur findings indicate that the invariant representation of a face, gradually learned through repeated exposure to its natural appearance statistics, relies primarily on horizontal facial information. By identifying the spatial information supporting view-tolerant face recognition in humans, the present work yields concrete, data-driven constraints for the refinement of visual recognition models.",

Clinical outcomes were derived from changes in repeated self-reported scores on the standardized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 (GAD-7) surveys administered before the first and most recent treatment visits. Adjusted logistic and linear regression was used for the analyses examining type of provider characteristic selected, engagement, and changes in each clinical outcome.\nResults  This study included Grow Therapy patients (mean age 34.0 years; 69.8% identifying as female). Over a quarter of patients selected a provider specialty (27.1%) and 4.4% selected a provider identity. Patients met with their provider a mean of 9.6 times (67.4% had 3 or more visits) and, among complete case patients with at least 2 PHQ-9 and 2 GAD-7 assessments (n=67,105), a large proportion showed significantly improved symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 improvement=3.5, 60.0% with a minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) and anxiety (GAD-7 improvement=3.5, 66.1% MCID). Patients selecting a provider specialty had fewer visits but had greater declines in depression symptoms, and those selecting a provider identity engaged longer in care than patients not selecting each of these characteristics, respectively.\nConclusions and Relevance  This real world study demonstrates that a technology-enabled mental health platform that allows patients to self-select their provider is engaging and preliminarily efficacious. Patients may maximize benefits of these platforms by selecting preferred characteristics of their providers.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

This is a particular challenge in adolescence, where brain and body development are impacted by the environment. The first step in addressing this is understanding the scale of the challenge.\n\nAims: To explore existing literature to identify and understand the needs, barriers, and facilitators in collecting biological data in adolescent mental health research. \n\nMethods: A systematic search identified papers recruiting participants between the ages 11-18, collecting biological data, and focusing on mental health/related psychopathology outcomes. Screening was performed in duplicate, and charting was an iterative process. \nResults: An initial search yielded 11,896 papers. After removal of duplicates and exclusions following screening, 814 papers were included in the review, with 753 explored for data on recruitment, retention, and engagement. Sample sizes &lt;99 were most common (53%), and health settings (36%) were the most frequently used recruitment sources. As labels for ‘barriers’, ‘facilitators’, and ‘needs’ were not used in included papers, information on recruitment, retention, and engagement (such as strategies to engage with young people, stakeholders or communities, for example, involvement in the development of the study) was explored as a proxy. Only 9% of papers reported engagement, and fewer evaluated the efficacy of these strategies. Less than half of the papers (48%) reported retention data, with reasons for lost data mostly relating to the nature of the data collection (for example, the specific methods used, such as scans). \n\nConclusions: Current research does not adequately report the methods used to ensure sufficient collection of representative data. Limited reporting challenges whether facilitators are being implemented or not. Advancing the field requires detailed guidelines, and we present clear recommendations that could serve as the first step to this development.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive difficulties with self-image, interpersonal relationships, emotion regulation and impulse control. Impulsive behaviors can be assessed using tasks such as the stop-signal task (SST). Traditional SSTs are repetitive and cognitively demanding, requiring sustained attention and effort over extended periods. This can be challenging, particularly for clinical populations who often experience difficulties with attention, emotional regulation, and frustration tolerance. In this study, we examined whether a gamified version of the SST (gSST) could effectively differentiate inhibitory control in patients with BPD compared to healthy controls (HC), and explored associations between behavioral performance and self-reported impulsivity. Fifty participants (25 BPD, 25 HC) completed the gSST and the UPPS-P impulsivity questionnaire. Patients with BPD showed significantly faster reaction times, more choice errors, and shorter stop-signal delays, indicating impairments in both proactive and reactive inhibition. However, no significant group difference emerged for the primary measure, the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). The SSRT correlated positively with self-reported positive urgency across the sample, suggesting a link between emotionally driven impulsivity and inhibitory control as assessed with a gSST. These findings highlight the potential of gamified cognitive tasks to provide sensitive, engaging, and ecologically valid measures of impulsivity, with implications for both clinical assessment and personalized intervention strategies in BPD.",

According to our results, the use of short-form videos is related with attention deficits. With three out of the four subjective-objective combinations turning out significant, we resume that short-form video use may indeed have detrimental effects on sustained attention, but that a sensitive perspective has to be cast on the users’ own normative evaluation.

          "abstract": "Attention bias to threat is considered an adaptive cognitive phenomenon that is associated with developmental and psychopathological outcomes across the lifespan. However, investigations into the development of attention bias to threat in infancy have produced mixed results. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs) provide a robust measure of visual cortex processing and attention by capturing brain entrainment to the rhythmic flicker of visual stimuli. This investigation leveraged a novel ssVEP task to examine attention bias to threat via affective expressions and its changes with age within the first two years of life. Infants (N = 118, Mean age = 9.21 months; Range age = 3-22 months; 57.61% Female) viewed a series of affective face pairs (neutral with happy, fearful, or angry) in which one face flickered at 6 Hz and the other at 7.5 Hz, while their brain activity was measured with EEG. Infants’ frequency-tagged brain responses were larger to fearful faces, above all other expressions, consistent with the presence of an attention bias to threat in infancy. Affect-biased attention did not change with age. Furthermore, the presence of an attention bias toward fear was found prior to the literature-suggested age of seven months. This study demonstrated the utility of using a robust and novel measure of attention, ssVEPs, to examine attention bias to threat and its development during infancy.",

Factor fit for the six-subscales was appropriate, as was total-scale and subscale reliability. Importantly, measurement invariance was demonstrated based on both autism status and gender indicating that the CATI can be used to make direct comparisons between members of these groups. Autistic traits were highly similar between diagnosed and self-identifying autistic adults while gender-diverse participants showed more autistic traits than their cis counterparts. Sensitivity and specificity estimates supported the use of the CATI in identifying autistic from non-autistic participants, with discrimination thresholds calculated. Our analysis indicates that the CATI is a practical measure of autistic traits in non-autistic and autistic participants with utility for researchers, clinicians, and for affirming self-identity.",

          "abstract": "The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments’ 2023 Update on Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Major Depressive in Adults was a much-anticipated update to the 2016 Guidelines. The Guidelines feature several significant changes to the 2016 exercise prescription for depression, such as downgrading the level of evidence and altering recommendations around exercise intensity. However, these changes were not communicated to readers and their rationale is not readily apparent. To better understand the 2023 exercise prescription, we reviewed the Guidelines’ 964 references for relevant citations. This Letter to the Editor documents the results of our review, and proposes a revised evidence-based exercise prescription.",

A full ontological development and preliminary global-stability simulations are presented elsewhere (Greenleaf, 2025).\nI supply the mathematical framework that renders this claim falsifiable. A five-dimensional dynamical system has a single locally asymptotically stable fixed point only when all five pattern variables are positive. From that result I derive (i) a necessary lower bound on Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), (ii) an invariance prediction across proxy metrics, and (iii) three concrete experimental touch-points that allow any laboratory to disprove the model.

          "abstract": "Despite the growing body of research on the intergenerational transmission of problem behavior, there is a need for more integrative approaches that consider the interplay between genetic and environmental factors. This study uses unique longitudinal data from TRAILS (analytic sample n = 2201), a prospective multiple-generation cohort study in the Netherlands to examine whether parents’ problem behavior (parents’ self-reported lifetime antisocial behavior and substance use, reported at mean age 40 years) predicts offspring problem behavior nearly two decades later (offspring self-reported aggression and delinquency at mean ages 29 and 32 years). In path analyses, independent and relative contributions of genetic (polygenic scores of parents and offspring) and environmental (harsh parenting) pathways were tested. Results confirm intergenerational transmission and consistently point to genetic nurture whereby genetic predisposition predicts parental problem behavior, which in turn predicts harsh parenting, which in turn predicts offspring problem behavior, all while accounting for offspring genetic predisposition, sex and family socioeconomic position. Though these findings are surprising in light of genetic contributions to behavior, they allow for tentative considerations regarding implication for practice to break intergenerational chains of problem behavior.",

          "authors": "Jai Jackson",
          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity—the brain’s ability to strengthen, weaken, or reorganize synaptic connections—is essential for learning, memory, and cognitive adaptation. Traditionally studied through mechanisms like long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), plasticity has often been viewed in isolation from the brain’s immune system. However, growing evidence reveals that neuroinflammation—a response mediated by microglia, astrocytes, cytokines, and complement proteins—profoundly influences synaptic dynamics across the lifespan.\nThis review examines how neuroinflammation modulates synaptic plasticity under both physiological and pathological conditions. We first describe the cellular and molecular mediators of neuroinflammation and their interactions with core mechanisms of synaptic modulation. Next, we explore how chronic inflammatory signaling impairs synaptic strength, promotes excessive pruning, and alters dendritic spine architecture. These changes are linked to cognitive dysfunction in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, major depression, and schizophrenia. Finally, we evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies—including anti-inflammatory drugs, microglial modulators, lifestyle interventions, and precision medicine approaches—aimed at preserving synaptic function and cognitive resilience.\nBy synthesizing current findings, this review highlights neuroinflammation as a central regulator of plasticity and a promising target for interventions that restore neural health across a range of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, and labor/delivery experience were also collected.\nResults 45.5% of participants used mental health services during pregnancy. Individual counseling/therapy and prescription medication were the most common services used. In univariate models, having less minors in the household, being white, identifying as LGBTQ+, as well as higher depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with higher odds of MHSU in pregnancy – all but depression remained significant in multivariate models. 31.0% of participants who used services in pregnancy had stopped MHSU postpartum. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, desisting from MHSU was predicted by being younger, identifying as cisgender heterosexual, and a more positive labor and delivery experience. 14.6% of participants who did not use services in pregnancy initiated MHSU postpartum, which was predicted by higher depression and anxiety symptoms.\nDiscussion Sociodemographic, psychosocial, and identity factors predict perinatal MHSU beyond the effect of mental health symptoms, suggesting a need for accessible mental health services as well as for mental health screening during pregnancy and postpartum.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the psychological profile of the Don Juan personality type through the framework of Jungian analytical psychology, utilizing Carl Jung’s Word Association Test (WAT) as both a diagnostic and therapeutic instrument. Traditionally used to uncover unconscious complexes by analyzing reaction times, emotional tone, and the content of verbal associations, the WAT is applied here to explore the unconscious dynamics underlying Don Juan-type traits, such as emotional detachment, fear of commitment, and unconscious dependency on maternal figures. By interpreting patterns in the client’s associations to specific stimulus words, the test offers valuable insight into the underlying archetypal structures, particularly the activation of the Puer Aeternus (eternal youth) archetype in its Don Juan expression. The study begins with a brief overview of the Don Juan figure in literature and culture, followed by its interpretation within Jungian theory and its connection to the Puer Aeternus archetype. A clinical case study is presented to illustrate this approach: a male client whose WAT responses revealed emotionally charged associations consistent with the Don Juan personality. The findings not only enhanced therapeutic insight into his relational patterns and unconscious defenses but also guided the psychotherapeutic process, fostering greater self-awareness and psychological integration.",

          "abstract": "Background: The lesion correlates of syntactic deficits in aphasia remain poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

          "abstract": "Addressing the climate crisis requires a nuanced understanding of the beliefs that undermine individual and collective action. While climate denial has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to \"climate delayism\"—a set of beliefs that, while not necessarily negating anthropogenic climate change, serve to justify inaction. These discourses of delay typically involve shifting responsibility, promoting non-transformational solutions, emphasizing the flaws of climate policies, and downplaying climate impacts. Although delayism has been identified as a rhetorical strategy among corporate and political elites, its prevalence within the general public remains under-researched. This study fills that gap by examining the prevalence of climate delayism beliefs and their associations with climate anxiety and denial based on two representative samples of citizens in Poland and the UK (N=1,038). Our results show that: (1) the overall factor structure of climate delayism beliefs is similar in both countries; (2) greater adherence to climate delayism is associated with lower negative climate emotions and higher climate denial; and (3) critically, some delayist beliefs are held even by respondents who believe in climate change and are concerned about it. We discuss these findings and propose that as outright denialist beliefs wane, delay discourses are becoming a more predominant and insidious obstacle to transformative climate action.",

          "authors": "Adam James Parker; Muchan Tao; Martin R. Vasilev",
          "abstract": "Return-sweeps, which move the reader’s gaze from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, typically result in shorter line-final fixations and longer accurate line-initial fixations compared to intra-line fixations. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been widely debated. To assess linguistic and oculomotor contributions to these return-sweep fixation differences, we compared the eye movements of 41 participants during normal reading and z-string scanning, an oculomotor control condition to reading, which is devoid of useful linguistic content. Our results indicate that line-final fixations are shorter and accurate line-initial fixations are longer under both tasks, underscoring the significant role of the oculomotor system in determining fixation durations across tasks. Notably, the reduction in line-final fixation durations compared to intra-line fixations did not differ between tasks. This suggests that oculomotor coordination or visual processing, rather than linguistic processing, drives shorter line-final fixations. In contrast, the difference in accurate line-initial fixation durations between reading and z-string scanning implies that longer accurate line-initial fixations are likely a result of lexical processing and oculomotor coordination or visual processing. These findings advance our understanding of eye movement control by highlighting the combined influence of linguistic and oculomotor processes on return-sweep fixation durations.",

          "abstract": "Dual-coding theory proposes that superior recall for pictures versus words (picture superiority effect; PSE) and concrete versus abstract words (concreteness effect) results from encoding information both verbally and visually, creating dual memory codes. The current study tested this dual-coding theory by examining recall in individuals with aphantasia, who cannot voluntarily generate mental imagery and thus should not benefit from dual coding. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Contrary to dual-coding predictions, aphantasic individuals showed a robust picture superiority effect. Interestingly, while typical imagers recalled pictures and symbols similarly well, aphantasics recalled symbols significantly better than pictures. These findings challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation of the PSE, indicating that either supplementary image codes are unnecessary for enhanced recall, or dual-coding theory requires substantial revision. Such revision might involve reconsidering that dual codes contribute primarily during encoding rather than retrieval, or broadening the definition of the second code beyond visual imagery—for example, to include motor imagery.",

          "abstract": "Prosocial and antisocial behaviors can reflect care or antipathy for a specific person. They can also reflect broader dispositions toward others’ welfare. The motive an observer infers will shape their expectations about the actor’s future behaviors. In four preregistered studies, we investigated 14- and 15-month-old infants’ inferences about social motives by testing their expectations following observations of helping and hindering. After observing two actors help or hinder a common target, infants expected the helper, rather than the hinderer, to help the same target in a new situation. However, this expectation did not generalize to a new target. Infants also used patterns of selective helping amongst multiple targets to infer whose needs the helper would prioritize. These findings show that infants tend to interpret helping as evidence for the existence and strength of target-specific interpersonal care, forming a foundation for understanding social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

          "authors": "Han Zhang; Kevin Miller",
          "abstract": "Purpose: Reading involves a remarkable coordination of perceptual and linguistic processes. This coordination is reflected by a close coupling between reading eye movements and lexical properties of words, such as word frequency and predictability, as well as morpho-syntactic and semantic regularities. Yet, reading is also subject to interference, and a common source of interference is when others are speaking nearby. Then, how does irrelevant speech affect reading as reflected in eye movements? Method: Fifty-nine participants (mean age: 19, 25 females, 34 males, primary language: English) read passages from the PROVO corpus (Luke &amp; Christianson, 2018) under intelligible irrelevant speech or silence, with eye movements recorded. We investigated how irrelevant speech influences the link between eye movements and several indicators of lexical difficulty: word frequency, cloze probability (exact-word predictability), large-language-model-generated surprisal, morpho-syntactic predictability (part-of-speech and inflection), and semantic predictability (general meaning). Results: Relationships between these lexical variables and eye movements remained robust during first-pass reading and were unaffected by irrelevant speech, suggesting intact lexical and syntactic processing during early stages of reading. However, disruption emerged in later eye-movement measures (i.e., total viewing time), where low-frequency and semantically unpredictable words prompted increased re-reading under irrelevant speech. Conclusion: These results indicate that intelligible irrelevant speech selectively interferes with post-lexical, higher-order semantic integration. The increased re-reading of rare and semantically unpredictable words suggests that readers compensate by revisiting these words to repair difficulties in integrating their meanings into a coherent understanding of the text.",

This fact is exemplified by several types of interference effects in choice-reaction tasks, such as Stroop interference and the Simon effect. The observations are typically attributed to inextricable consequences of automatic cognitive processes involved in performing these tasks. However, evidence has accumulated suggesting that processes underlying these effects depend on one’s intention to perform particular tasks, rather than being strictly automatic. Thus, there exists a paradox: the interference from task-irrelevant features presumes processes that are under intentional control. The present review attempts to resolve this paradox. I propose an integrated view of attentional control, Action Field Theory, which formulates principles that account for a range of phenomena concerning automatic control of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "Background and Aims: Neurodevelopmental models regard impulsivity as a central risk factor for adolescent substance use and subsequent adverse health outcomes. However, prior research has been constrained by cross-sectional designs, relatively small sample sizes, and/or the use of a narrow subset of impulsivity measures. More recent studies using mutli-site consortia, while larger in sample size, have focused on largely data-driven substance use prediction from all available variables, spanning sociodemographic factors to brain imaging, but without strong theory, leaving critical questions on the neurodevelopmental impulsivity theory of adolescent substance use unanswered. Here we aimed to comprehensively test the extent to which measures of impulsivity predict adolescent substance use with large, multi-site data and multiple questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures, while following best practices in reproducible analyses of observational data.  \n\nMethod: We leveraged the large, multi-site ABCD dataset (n = 11,868) with baseline and up to three years of longitudinal follow up and assessed impulsivity with three questionnaire (CBCL Externalizing, UPPS-P Impulsive Behavioral Scale, Behavioral Activation System) and three behavioral (Delay Discounting, Stop Signal, and Flanker Task) impulsivity assessments. First, we identified correlations among questionnaire and behavioral impulsivity measures. Next, we assessed their prospective longitudinal and concurrent predictive utility regarding two adolescent substance use outcomes (substance use prior to age 15, and perceived harm of substance use). All analyses used pre-established and pre-registered discovery and validation subsamples to directly test reproducibility. Finally, we used simulation to inform how associations between impulsivity and adolescent substance use and impulsivity vary across sampling strategies (population versus high-risk cohorts) and sample sizes.\n \nFindings: Correlations between standard questionnaire and behavioral measures of impulsivity were consistently small and did not exceed our pre-registered threshold (r-equivalent of 0.08). Questionnaires significantly outperformed behavioral measures of impulsivity in predicting both future substance use initiation and harm perception, with negligible incremental benefit from behavioral assessments. Predictions of substance use based on impulsivity were generally modest (e.g. AUC’s ~0.6 - 0.76), exhibiting high sensitivity to both sample size and the base rate of substance use. Large samples (n &gt; 1,000) were needed to have adequate power for impulsivity measures to predict substance use initiation.\n\nConclusion: These results support the involvement of impulsivity in the onset of adolescent substance use, particularly as indicated through questionnaires, but clearly indicate that these factors alone, as currently measured, are insufficient for robust predictions. In non-enriched community samples or population-based datasets, large sample sizes are needed for reproducible impulsivity prediction of adolescent substance use.",

          "abstract": "Politics can have substantial and wide adverse effects on people’s physical and mental health, especially in politically polarized environments. As a result, political polarization is now recognized as a major non-medical cause of disease and suffering. We examine if and how citizens can protect their health from such adverse effects without undermining their civic engagement.  We identify a psychological mechanism of resilience rooted in bodily awareness and show that interoception –the ability to perceive and trust one’s internal bodily signals– can act as a protective factor against the adverse health effects of politics. Across three studies on over 2,000 participants conducted during the 2022 mid-term U.S. election and the 2024 U.S. presidential election, higher interoceptive sensibility was consistently associated with lower reported costs of politics on emotional, physical, behavioral, and social health, while controlling for political identity, demographics, and emotion regulation strategies. During the emotionally charged 2024 election, individuals high in interoceptive sensibility reported fewer negative emotions, greater hope for the future and less fear, particularly if their candidate lost. These benefits extended to greater emotional resilience and a more positive outlook about the nation’s future. Importantly, interoceptive sensibility was positively associated with political engagement and efficacy, suggesting that better interoception awareness enhances, rather than inhibits, democratic participation. Our findings highlight interoceptive sensibility as a promising trait for mitigating politi-cal stress without reducing civic involvement.",

          "abstract": "In language processing, word meanings are retrieved from memory and converted into sentential expressions that have referential meaning at the level of utterances. Cognitive processes related to lexical retrieval versus the construction of referential meaning through grammar have not been properly disentangled yet. We addressed this with an experimental design aimed to link well-known N400 effects and late positive components (LPCs) to this distinction. We tested the hypothesis that semantic conflicts derived from a collision with stored (= ‘offline’) knowledge would elicit N400 effects, while semantic conflicts arising ‘online’ during the grammatical construction of referential meaning would exclusively trigger LPCs and also differ in their latency, amplitude or topography from formal-syntactic violations. Three anomalous conditions were compared against a baseline of correct sentences, across five word-positions within stimulus sentences: semantic anomalies that are lexically- but not grammatically-driven (I arrived in a button last week), semantic anomalies that are grammatically- but not lexically-driven (I arrived in a London last week), and formal-syntactic anomalies (I arrived in a cities last week). Results showed, in line with predictions, that (i) only the lexically-driven anomalies elicited N400 components, while (ii) all three anomalous conditions elicited LPCs, extending from the target word to subsequent word positions in the sentence; and (iii) the LPCs were all distinct in latency, amplitude and spatiotemporal topographies. These results demonstrate for the first time that grammar-level meaning, which is referential rather than lexical-conceptual in nature, has its own distinctive ERP, while confining the role of the N400 to effects of stored, or else contextually updated, memory.",

          "authors": "Ethan Landes",
          "abstract": "Everyone who has come up with a new idea or concept faces the same problem: they need to call it something. This choice is simultaneously arbitrary and important. The new idea could have any name, but some names for it are clearly better than others. This paper builds upon existing research on the perceived relationship between label and word meaning to better understand the way that label choice affects language design, particularly conceptual engineering. Across three experiments, the paper finds that when learning novel concepts, the labels serving as vehicles for the novel concepts affect how people perceive the novel concepts’ content. In particular, the experiments find that labels influence people’s perception of novel concepts’ valence. Not all forms of information are readily extracted from labels, however, and subtle forms of information, particularly phonesthemes, do not appear to be noticed by people learning new concepts. Accordingly, conceptual engineers and other forms of language designers need to do careful research into how a given label will affect how their novel concept is interpreted by others.",

          "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic condition that is often misunderstood and stigmatized. This study explores the impact of public stigma on women* with endometriosis, focusing on its effects before and after diagnosis. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with women* who received an endometriosis diagnosis within the past three years. Participants shared their experiences with public stigma, self-stigma, and its influence on health behaviors and disease coping.\nThe findings reveal that greater and earlier exposure to public stigma led to decreased trust in medical professionals, withdrawal from the healthcare system, and the development of hyper-independence. Receiving a diagnosis came with benefits and risks for the affected women*. While some women develop greater self-confidence through the validation of their symptoms, others experience negative emotional effects. \nThis study highlights the need to raise awareness of endometriosis in the medical field and to develop strategies for reducing patients' experiences of stigma in order to ensure access to empathetic and patient-centered care. It underscores the need for healthcare professionals to be better trained in recognizing and avoiding stigmatizing behaviors during the diagnostic process and in patients coping with the disease. Such efforts could mitigate the negative consequences of stigma and improve patient outcomes.",

          "authors": "Manuel J. B. Oliveira; Carlos Zednik; Gunter Bombaerts; Bert Sadowski; Rianne Conijn",
          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

In this study, we investigate the reliability of the U-curve phenomenon in a cross-sectional sample to replicate findings using each of the 17 different measures from previous studies. The aim was to identify measures that have similar and different outcomes with previously established results in a sample of 280 adults. Here we replicate the U-curve when different preregistered sets of control variables are included. We further show heterogeneity across happiness measures, showing that the U-curve is not consistent across items.

We synthesised current systematic review evidence on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis.\n\nWe conducted an umbrella review, systematically searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central and Google Scholar (up to 19 July 2024) for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on psychosis. 2898 citations were de-duplicated and screened, included reviews were assessed for risk of bias using AMSTAR-2 and extracted data analysed narratively following a pre-registered protocol (CRD42023400656).\n\nSeven reviews (reporting 23 primary studies representing 40,300 participants) met inclusion criteria, five of which explicitly reported on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis. All observed evidence of a positive relationship between the two, including meta-analyses for psychotic symptoms (adjusted OR=1.77, 95%CI 1.26, 2.49) and psychotic experiences (pooled OR=1.94, 95%CI 1.42, 2.67). We observed more robust evidence for psychotic outcomes in non-clinical populations. Despite this, results were driven by cross-sectional studies (87%), and were hindered by high heterogeneity and low (n=2) or critically low (n=5) AMSTAR-2 review quality scores. \n\nThe available systematic review evidence supports a role for racial/ethnic discrimination in developing psychosis, but high-quality studies are needed to determine the temporal and mechanistic causal pathways through which this occurs. The current findings add to knowledge on the widespread presence and deleterious impacts of racism on health and inform potential public health interventions that reduce exposure to, and the impact of, racial/ethnic discrimination.",

The study follows families from a range of socio-economic backgrounds who participate at ten timepoints, from the third trimester of pregnancy until their infant is nine months old, with three visits taking place during the infant’s first postnatal month.\nThe study harnesses recent methodological advances coupled with the drive for more ecologically valid data collection by undertaking many of these visits in families’ homes. Methods include measures of fetal behaviour using 4D ultrasound scanning; infant brain imaging using fNIRS and EEG; a full-day video recording of the home environment from the infant’s perspective, with physiological measures; measures of recent stress in both infant and mother; questionnaires relating to the home environment as well as parents’ feelings, attitudes, health and parenting routines; and standardised measures of infant behaviour and development.\nSpecific aims are to investigate: i) individual differences in basic sensory, behavioural and motor processing between late prenatal and early postnatal periods; ii) rapid change in cortical functions over the first month, particularly for brain networks that support social behaviour; iii) effects of social interaction on developing brain function; and iv) individual differences in developmental trajectories associated with poverty-related contextual factors.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control dysfunction—manifested as impairments in attention, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility—is a core feature of depression. While extensively documented, its origins remain debated. This review proposes that such dysfunction may not simply reflect pathological failure but rather evolutionarily conserved strategies. Integrating three leading evolutionary accounts—Social Rank Theory (SRT), the Analytical Rumination Hypothesis (ARH), and Social Bargaining Theory (SBT)—the paper explores how each framework accounts for cognitive control impairment in depression.\nSRT suggests that executive downregulation facilitates submission following social defeat. ARH proposes that cognitive resources are reallocated to problem-focused rumination, impairing broader flexibility. SBT interprets dysfunction as a communicative signal that elicits social support. Empirical evidence from human and animal studies supports each model, revealing context-dependent trade-offs in cognitive functioning.\nThe review further highlights developmental, cultural, and neurobiological moderators of these effects, and situates them within broader frameworks of evolutionary mismatch and comorbidity. It argues that understanding cognitive impairment through an adaptive lens clarifies its persistence, heterogeneity, and resistance to treatment.\nFinally, the paper discusses clinical implications, including tailoring interventions to the dominant evolutionary mechanism underlying a given depressive profile. By bridging cognitive science, clinical psychology, and evolutionary theory, this review offers a novel integrative framework for interpreting cognitive dysfunction in depression as a context-sensitive adaptation that may become maladaptive in modern environments.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is essential for temporarily retaining goal-relevant visual information, yet its limited capacity renders it vulnerable to distraction. While previous studies have examined the effects of distractors occurring during encoding or maintenance, it remains unclear how stimulus presentation duration modulates these effects and whether different types or quantities of distractors exert similar costs. Across three experiments, we systematically investigated how distraction timing, distractor content, and perceptual load interact with encoding duration to influence VWM performance. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks under four distraction conditions (no-distraction, encoding-, delay-, and full-distraction) and two encoding durations (short: 200 ms; long: 1000 ms). Encoding-stage distractions impaired performance only in the short-duration, high-precision task, whereas delay-stage distractions consistently disrupted memory regardless of duration or task type. Experiment 2 manipulated distractor-target similarity (same-category vs. different-category distractors) and revealed that homogeneous distractors exerted stronger disruption, particularly when presented during the delay period. In contrast, heterogeneous distractors could be effectively suppressed when sufficient encoding time allowed for robust consolidation. Experiment 3 examined perceptual load (low vs. high) and showed that increasing distractor quantity did not amplify interference, suggesting that once memory consolidation is complete, delay-stage distractions disrupt VWM representations regardless of distractor load. Together, these findings reveal an asymmetry in how VWM handles distractions at different processing stages. While extended encoding supports resistance to early interference, maintenance-stage distractions exert persistent effects—especially when distractors are similar to targets. Our results highlight the importance of presentation duration and distractor similarity in shaping VWM robustness, and suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may underlie suppression at encoding and maintenance stages.",

          "abstract": "The climate crisis has increasingly driven scientists to engage in activism. This ethnographic study examines how scientists transition into activism, reconcile their professional identity with activist roles, and sustain engagement over time. Drawing on two years of fieldwork with Scientists for Extinction Rebellion, this research captures the lived experiences of scientists transitioning into activism. Identity-aligned spaces offer emotional support, solidarity, and a sense of collective identity. These spaces help scientists navigate concerns about credibility, career repercussions, and the legitimacy of scientist-activism. The findings reveal how scientists strategically draw on their professional expertise and employ scientific symbols (e.g., lab-coats, papers) to legitimise and justify their actions. Over time, scientists come to see activism as a legitimate and necessary part of their identity. Activism reshapes their professional identity, reinforcing a moral duty to act while requiring ongoing identity management, leading to the development of a hybrid scientist-activist identity. Structured around a process-oriented framework, this study identifies critical moments in scientists’ activist trajectories—from initial hesitations to sustained participation. These insights advance social psychological theories of collective action by exploring how professional identities evolve within movements and by illuminating the role of identity-aligned spaces in sustaining long-term engagement.\nKeywords \nactivism, climate change, ethnography, identity, scientists, collective action",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

We examined whether such sufficiency settings can enhance the personal meaning of sufficiency compared to ordinary shared living environments. Data were collected from 159 residents of the CA and a standard student home. Our findings indicated that residents of the CA experienced greater meaningfulness of shared living, improved sufficiency attitudes and a higher intention to choose shared living in the future. Experiences of shared living had a lagged positive impact on the perceived meaningfulness of shared living. These results imply that sufficiency settings can strengthen sufficiency-oriented living.

We evaluate this approach in the context of attitudes towards COVID-19 and Human Papillomavirus vaccination, using a series of large online survey experiments conducted in Brazil, Mexico, and the US (total N=53,900), and a social media campaign field experiment (35M impressions) conducted in partnership with a public health NGO in Brazil.

          "abstract": "Time series data are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing researchers to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a powerful model for capturing psychological processes. In the HMM, time series are modeled with a process that switches between a number of hidden (i.e., latent) states, each associated with a different response distribution. By extending the HMM to the multilevel framework, we obtain better estimates of person-specific models under standard assumptions; and we get a model for heterogeneity across persons, which allow one to distinguish between population heterogeneity and sampling variation. Despite their potential, multilevel HMMs are currently not widely used to estimate psychological time series. A key reason is that the methodology has not been thoroughly evaluated in this context. In this paper, we address this issue. We evaluate model selection and estimation performance in an extensive simulation study, using scenarios typical for psychological time series research designs and varying the level of state separation and the number of states, modeled variables, persons, and time-series length. Our numerical evaluation results show that researchers can expect the multilevel HMM to perform well when persons are expected to switch between multiple states. Finally, we provide empirically based recommendations, and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially about Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. In the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neuron encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, in the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The whole brain might be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billion neurons and trillions of synapses, which intrinsically function as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, in the frequency domain, we advocate that there is no fundamental difference between the hard problem and the easy problems of consciousness. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) providing a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

HMMs are able to capture behavior that is more complex than currently predominant linear models such as the Vector Autoregressive model: they can characterize multiple equilibrium states and also quantify how the system transitions between states. HMMs are also able to fit frequent empirical data patterns, such as highly skewed or multimodal distributions. Despite their power in modeling within-person dynamics, HMMs are currently not widely used. We see three reasons for this: 1) many researchers are not familiar with HMMs; 2) software to estimate multilevel HMMs  has only recently become available; and 3) estimating, analyzing and reporting HMMs is more involved than for simple linear models and no easy-to-follow tutorials exist. Here, we address all of these issues. We first provide a gentle introduction to HMMs for researchers working with time series data in psychology. We then provide a fully reproducible tutorial that walks the reader through each of the steps of analyzing psychological time series data using the R-package mHMMbayes. Our goal is to removes barriers for researchers working with time series so that they can add (multilevel) HMMs to their methodological toolbox.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation has become a prescient issue in public and academic domains. One pernicious aspect of misinformation is that it can persistently influence people’s judgements after clear and credible correction—a phenomenon dubbed the continued influence effect. There has been speculation that age may affect people’s susceptibility to the continued influence effect, but previous research has produced inconclusive evidence. In an attempt to reconcile conflicting findings, the current study used a continued-influence paradigm in which causal event misinformation was retracted. Two samples were analysed with correlation analyses and linear mixed-effects modelling: an online sample aged 21-79 (online sample; N = 259) and an in-person sample aged 56-92 (in-person sample; N = 143). Results showed that, when controlling for poor encoding of experimental materials in the online sample, age had no significant effect on the effectiveness of misinformation retractions, though declining effectiveness was observed with advanced older age in the in-person sample.",

Adolescents’ assertion and cooperation were linked to parent-child bonding 20 years later, although indirect effects were not significant. We also found no evidence for intergenerational continuity of social competence in form of a direct effect.

          "abstract": "When things are perceived clearly they can be detected with confidence. But under what conditions can one be confident that something is absent? Here we use a meta-perceptual illusion to show that confidence in absence scales not with visibility itself, but with the subjective belief that a stimulus would have been visible, if present. In two pre-registered experiments, participants detected the presence or absence of letters in frames of dynamic noise, and rated their decision confidence. Across trials, stimuli could appear bigger or smaller. Critically, while perceptual sensitivity was increased for smaller stimuli, participants’ meta-perceptual beliefs  (measured with post-experiment debriefing and prospective confidence ratings) were that larger letters were easier to detect. Accordingly, while confidence in presence scaled with objective visibility (and was therefore higher for smaller stimuli), confidence in absence scaled with beliefs about counterfactual visibility (and was therefore higher for bigger stimuli). This dissociation between the effect of stimulus size on confidence in presence and absence diminished as the experiment progressed: a sign of meta-perceptual learning. Furthermore, the effect of size on confidence in absence, but not in presence, correlated with a meta-perceptual parameter from an ideal observer model of perceptual detection, fitted to decision and response time data alone. Overall, we conclude that confidence in absence closely tracked participants’ model-derived expectations about the visibility of counterfactual stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Scaling youth mental health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often hindered by fragmented service delivery, limited specialist availability, and a lack of affordable, adaptable digital infrastructure. This study describes the development, deployment, and preliminary evaluation of shamiriOS, a modular, digital platform designed to support scalable, task-shifted youth mental health care. We conducted a structured environmental review of existing digital platforms, revealing key gaps in affordability, modularity, offline functionality, and alignment with stepped-care models. In response, shamiriOS was developed through a participatory design process and includes three components: the Shamiri Digital Hub for backend operations, Rafi, a youth-facing mental health companion app, and the Shamiri Provider Platform, adapted from third-party software. From 2023 to 2024, the platform was deployed across secondary schools, community hubs, and a university in Kenya. The Shamiri Digital Hub supported service delivery to over 76,000 students via 1,195 youth providers and 111 supervisors, with high satisfaction and usability ratings from supervisory staff. Rafi reached 3,737 university students, with 50.4% engaging in at least one session, though long-term use of self-guided tools remained limited. These early findings suggest that shamiriOS offers a feasible and contextually relevant model for digital infrastructure in LMIC mental health systems. Its modular design, open-source ethos, and integration of operational, clinical, and client-facing tools position it as a replicable framework for global mental health innovation. Future work will focus on expanding AI-driven features, strengthening user engagement, and enabling broader adaptation across diverse settings.",

          "authors": "Dulama alhussain",
          "abstract": ".\n1. Introduction: Meaning Precedes Language – A Journey from Instinctive Perception to Symbolic Consciousness\nThe genesis of meaning and language stands as a profound and enduring enigma across philosophy, psychology, and anthropology. A fundamental question persists: Is language merely a vessel for pre-existing meaning, or does it actively construct the very fabric of our conceptual world? This paper advances a core hypothesis: meaning fundamentally precedes language. We posit that the rudimentary forms of meaning observed in the animal kingdom underwent a radical, evolutionarily driven transformation in humans, largely catalyzed by specific biological and cerebral adaptations. These critical changes paved the way for the emergence of what we term the Symbolic Regulatory Semantic Network (SRSN).\nThe SRSN is conceived not merely as another cognitive mechanism, but as the central bio-psychological backbone connecting disparate evolutionary stages: from basic, instinct-driven responses in lower organisms, through the nascent symbolic capacities of higher animals, to the unparalleled complexity of human symbolic thought. Its primary function is to interpret the continuous influx of sensory experiences and meticulously transform them into abstract, shareable symbols. This transformative process empowers the human brain to liberate meaning from its immediate, reflexive ties to instinctive responses, allowing for its re-representation as a manipulable, abstract structure",

          "abstract": "Background:\nImproving the translation of evidence to support suicide prevention planning is a national priority in Australia. However, there has been limited practical guidance available on the amounts and types of services that should be made available, and for which populations.\n\nObjective:\nThis project aimed to develop an initial proof-of-concept national needs-based planning model for suicide prevention services in Australia, to help inform planning and commissioning of services at the national, state/territory and regional level.\n\nMethods:\nA mixed methods approach synthesised best available literature, data, and expert (including lived experience) input to: (1) estimate the numbers of people in service need groups requiring similar responses (by age, level of distress); (2) describe a taxonomy of services required for population suicide prevention; (3) estimate the average types and quantities of these services required for each need group in a year; (4) identify the appropriate workforce to deliver that care; and (5) combine these inputs to estimate required resourcing for service planning (e.g., full-time equivalent workforce).\n\nResults:\nThe Australian Suicide Prevention Planning Model (AuSPPM) describes 37 need groups across the whole population and ages 12-17, 18-24, 25-64 and 65+ who require a range of suicide prevention services, from population-level programs to individualised clinical and non-clinical supports. A substantial workforce is required to provide good care for these populations and scale up prevention activities, particularly development of the lived experience workforce and alternatives to medical services.\n\nConclusions:\nThis project demonstrates the feasibility of developing a needs-based planning model for suicide prevention. However, aspects of the model would benefit from a more robust evidence base on population needs and service effectiveness. Further work is needed to consider how the model can best accommodate the specific service needs of different populations disproportionately impacted by suicide, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and LGBTQIA+ populations.",

          "abstract": "How do people sustain concern for future generations when thinking about existential threats that will face those to come? Across two longitudinal studies spanning 12 months, we examine the stability and behavioral relevance of “intergenerational futures thinking,” a constellation of psychological constructs theorized to motivate long-term prosocial action: intergenerational concern (IGC), impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB), obligation to future generations, moral concern, and legacy motivation. Supporting their theorized but underexplored role as durable dispositions, all constructs show high temporal stability. And, although based on reported real-world behavior over the course of the year, IGC predicts greater future-oriented collective action but not general charitable giving. Moral concern and legacy motivation, in contrast, predict both charitable giving and collective action, while obligation predicts collective action only. Because reported donations were general rather than future-targeted, this design allowed us to test which intergenerational traits spill over into broader prosociality, speaking to ongoing debates about whether prioritizing future generations reduces concern for the present. Relatedly, we find that IIB, which captures sustained regard for future people regardless of their temporal distance, associates with greater moral concern for present-day outgroups and nature. This suggests that concern for the future and present can coexist, aligning with a theorized view of a “moral circle” that expands increasingly outward from the self. Finally, while showing trait-like stability, IGC also exhibits reciprocal relationships with both obligation and moral concern, suggesting that components of intergenerational futures thinking may mutually reinforce one another to sustain long-term ethical engagement.",

However, limited research has explored differences in their perspectives regarding the strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers to educational success for autistic students which was the aim of this study. This knowledge is important for fostering collaboration to optimally support autistic students. Participants included 133 Australians parents/caregivers (n = 64), educators (n = 37), and allied health professionals (n = 32) who completed an open-ended online survey listing their top three educational strengths, educational needs, barriers, and enablers for autistic students. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis for each of the four areas (strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers). Analysis identified that strengths included thinking and reasoning, personality, skills and talents, academic, and social. Needs included classroom accommodations, social-emotional, academic, adaptive behaviour, and mental health supports. Enablers and barriers commonly reflected the presence or absence of supports, including support networks, environmental supports, autism knowledge, and supportive attitudes. While commonalities were observed across stakeholder perspectives, significant variation both within and across stakeholder groups was observed for perceived strengths and challenges including around the importance of environmental factors, foci of social support, and academic needs. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is essential for providing multidimensional support to autistic students. Understanding can inform professional learning and support collaborative multidisciplinary teams who work with, and care for, the same individual across contexts including school, home, and therapy services.",

          "abstract": "Plant cognition has progressed from anecdote to rigor, yet the field still lacks a quantitative test for when distributed plant activity crosses into unified—perhaps conscious—processing. I introduce Pattern–Temporal Synergy (PTS), a substrate-agnostic metric rooted in Dynergeia, a relation-first ontology that defines consciousness as reflexive coherence among five universal patterns—self-reference, division-creation, information integration, responsiveness and flux—phase-locked inside a system’s binding window (τ). Each pattern is operationalized with established signal-processing measures; their mean strength is multiplied by their mean synergy and released only if a τ-specific coherence gate is met.\nThree preregistered hypotheses anchor the study: H1 baseline PTS &gt; 0 in intact plants; H2 4 % diethyl-ether collapses PTS below threshold φ; H3 PTS rebounds on wash-out. A multispecies protocol—Mimosa pudica, Arabidopsis thaliana, Picea abies—combines 64-channel surface electrodes, glutamate-sensitive Ca²⁺ imaging and micro-optode O₂/heat-flux probes. Sliding 3 × τ windows with phase-shuffled surrogates yield z-scored PTS trajectories, adjudicated by preregistered effect-size criteria.\nBy turning decades of qualitative insight into falsifiable numbers, PTS offers plant biology a litmus test for conscious-level processing, directly challenges Integrated Information Theory and supplies a road-map for cross-kingdom comparisons—including neuromorphic silicon. Confirmatory results would shift debates on plant sentience from speculation to data; null results would equally refine what consciousness requires.",

          "abstract": "Value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC) is where a stimulus captures more attention than it otherwise would because of its association with a valuable outcome. Previous research has investigated whether there is a relationship between VMAC and awareness of the stimulus-value association. However, this research has been limited by the awareness tests used and obtained mixed findings on whether VMAC is found in participants who do not show awareness of the stimulus-value association and whether VMAC in these participants differs in magnitude from VMAC in participants who show awareness of the association. We present three experiments that used a multi-trial “generative” awareness test where participants were asked to predict the valuable outcome across multiple awareness test trials in the absence of outcome feedback. Evidence of VMAC was found only in aware participants. Furthermore, evidence of VMAC in these participants was observed in test phase trials where outcome feedback was not received, but only once participants received information (from a message presented after the first test block) that could be used as confirmation that the training phase associations, responsible for establishing this effect, were still in operation. VMAC did not sustain under test phase conditions that extinguished these associations and provided explicit reward feedback. Our findings suggest that after a stimulus-value association has been repeatedly presented, VMAC is found only in those that show awareness of the stimulus-value association, and belief that the association is still in effect is sufficient to sustain it in the absence of explicit feedback about the outcome.",

Previous studies have suggested that distinct error types in expressive syntax, such as paragrammatic and agrammatic speech, may be associated with damage to different brain regions, but the specific lesion correlates of these errors have not been fully delineated.\nObjective: To identify the lesion correlates associated with distinct expressive syntactic error types in individuals with chronic post-stroke aphasia, using a novel utterance-level analysis of spontaneous speech errors.\nMethods: We analyzed spontaneous speech samples from individuals with chronic aphasia, categorizing errors into hierarchical (paragrammatic-like) and linearization (agrammatic-like) errors. Lesion-symptom mapping was conducted to identify brain regions associated with these error types. The analysis was based on a two-stage model of sentence production, with hierarchical processing and linearization analyzed as distinct stages.\nResults: Lesion clusters in the medial superior temporal sulcus and inferior parietal lobe were associated with hierarchical errors, while large frontal lesions, including those in the inferior and middle frontal lobe, were associated with linearization errors. These results provide support for a two-stage model of syntactic encoding, with distinct neural correlates for hierarchical and linearization processes. \nConclusion: Our findings suggest a dichotomy of the lesion basis for syntactic deficits in aphasia, suggesting that distinct brain regions contribute to different stages of syntactic encoding. Hierarchical processing seems to be supported by posterior temporal-parietal regions, while linearization seems to be supported by frontal regions. These results suggest that the diagnosis and treatment of aphasia should take into account the existence of distinct syntactic production deficits resulting from different patterns of brain damage.",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have the potential to expand treatment access for anxiety but often have low user engagement. The present study analyzed differences in psychosocial outcomes for different behavioral engagement patterns in a free web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) program. CBM-I is designed to shift interpretation biases common in anxiety by providing practice thinking about emotionally ambiguous situations in less threatening ways. Using data from 697 anxious community adults undergoing five weekly sessions of CBM-I in a clinical trial, we extracted program use markers based on task completion rate and time spent on training and assessment tasks. After using an exploratory cluster analysis of these markers to create two engagement groups (whose patterns ended up reflecting generally more vs. less time spent across tasks), we used multilevel models to test for group differences in interpretation bias and anxiety outcomes. Unexpectedly, engagement group did not significantly predict differential change in positive interpretation bias or anxiety. Further, participants who generally spent less time on the program (including both training and assessment tasks) improved in negative interpretation bias (on one of two measures) significantly more during the training phase than those who spent more time (and post hoc tests found were significantly older and slightly less educated). However, participants who generally spent less time had a significant loss in training gains for negative bias (on both measures) by 2-month follow-up. Findings highlight the challenge of interpreting time spent as a marker of engagement and the need to consider cognitive and affective markers of engagement in addition to behavioral markers. Further understanding engagement patterns holds promise for improving DMHIs for anxiety.",

However, causal evidence for mechanisms underpinning dissociation remains scarce, particularly in youth. Nine NHS patients (aged 16 to 23) participated three multiple baseline single case experimental design (SCED) studies. Every participant received four sessions of individual CBT, with each SCED addressing a different hypothesised mechanism: cognitive appraisals of dissociation, perseverative thinking, and affect intolerance. Results indicated successful targeting of cognitive appraisals, and partial success in targeting perseverative thinking and affect intolerance. They support cognitive appraisals, and partially support affect intolerance, as causal mechanisms in youth transdiagnostic dissociation. Any causal effect of perseverative thinking was better accounted for by reduced cognitive appraisals in this SCED. Across participants, low phase stability of the target measures limited inference, but these findings advance a mechanistic understanding of youth dissociation and inform treatment development.",

          "abstract": "Community mobilisation efforts to prevent violence against women (VAW) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often premised on the idea that raising awareness of structural gender inequality motivates collective action. Experimental evidence for this assumption in LMICs remains scarce. We conducted a randomized field experiment with 720 women in informal settlements in Mumbai, India, embedded within the larger SNEHA-TARA trial of community mobilisation, which combined regular local group meetings of women, men, and adolescents with volunteer training over a three-to-four-year period. In our field experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three 30-45 minutes reflective sessions: on structural injustice, types of violence (control 1), or child nutrition (control 2). In the session on structural injustice, we used a game to stimulate discussion and reflection on gender inequality and its connection to VAW. We measured participant performance of three real-time collective action behaviours addressing VAW: contribution of a face photo to a poster campaign, contribution of a hand photo to the same campaign, or discussing VAW with a neighbour. Despite increasing recognition of gender inequality as a cause of VAW, the structural injustice session had no statistically significant impact on collective action relative to controls. By contrast, participation in NGO-led groups and volunteering was strongly associated with action, mediated by perceived efficacy and activist identity. Our findings challenge the assumption that awareness of injustice alone is sufficient to spark collective action and suggest the importance of fostering community identity and self-efficacy in mobilisation programmes. In contexts of entrenched patriarchy and normalisation of VAW, merely recognising injustice may be insufficient to catalyse collective action.",

We set out to develop an instrument to measure a recent theory concerning emotional episodes (Eerola et al., 2024) related to music and their associated constructs. To establish this instrument, we: (1) operationalised the theory; (2) proposed and adapted a set of items to represent the relevant constructs; (3) analysed and reduced the item pool; (4) assessed the content validity of the items using subject matter experts; and (5) refined and reassessed the item pool based on expert feedback. In Step 1, we identified 25 sub-constructs. In Step 2, these were represented by an initial pool of 495 items, of which 290 were adapted from existing instruments. Step 3 involved eliminating 159 semantically similar items. In Step 4, twelve subject matter experts in music and emotion evaluated a sample of 366 items for relevance, providing suggestions for reclassification and identifying missing content. Expert agreement was used to determine item retention. Based on their feedback, a revised pool of 302 items underwent a second round of expert review. This process resulted in a set of 168 relevant items and 115 of the most representative items encompassing the emotional episodes, the descriptive schemes, and the contextual constructs across 23 sub-constructs. Together, relevant and representative scores indicate the quality of the content but future psychometric processes will need to test construct validity. We conclude by discussing the content validity of the constructs and frame a modular scheme that implements the underlying theoretical framework.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "authors": "Shinnosuke Shimizu",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel cognitive framework called “My Harmonic Cognitive OS,” which models human cognition as a structured interaction among three core layers: viewpoint filters (Fi, Fe, Te, Ti), judgment structures (i/e), and perceptual styles—namely the four cognitive functions Si, Se, Ni, and Ne. Each perceptual function is defined as follows: Si (Introverted Sensing) as internal memory reference, Se (Extraverted Sensing) as immediate sensory response, Ni (Introverted Intuition) as convergence into future insight, and Ne (Extraverted Intuition) as divergent associative idea generation. These are further structured into directional causal pairs: \nSi–Ne          &lt;  expansive\nand Se–Ni  &gt;  convergent,   \n forming the perceptual OS of this model. By redefining traditional MBTI components into a dynamic, process-oriented architecture, this model enables precise mapping of individual cognitive processes. The framework is not only theoretically coherent but also demonstrates high applicability in education, AI development, and human resource management. It emphasizes cognitive diversity, ethical decision-making, and the capacity for meta-cognition, ultimately aiming to foster what is termed a “multi-perspective cognitive being.” The paper also outlines practical implementations and potential economic impacts, positioning this OS-based structure as a foundational paradigm for the next generation of cognitive science and applied artificial intelligence.",

Predicting which treatment will work best for a given patient is a challenge and requires a comprehensive yet feasible assessment of baseline characteristics. This paper describes the development of a baseline battery for a precision treatment trial designed to guide optimal treatment allocation for adults with depression in primary care in India.\nMethods\nWe used a stepwise multimethod approach to develop the battery. We updated a prior review to identify constructs associated with differential treatment response, conducted an expert survey (220 invited; 80 responses) to refine the list, and selected measurement tools based on brevity, validity, and scalability. We then applied semantic analysis to identify redundancies, piloted the battery with 200 primary care patients, and used exploratory factor analysis and machine learning to optimize item selection.\nResults\nThe final battery included 68 constructs covering clinical, psychological, cognitive, socioeconomic, and biological domains across multiple assessment modalities (questionnaires, neurocognitive tasks, and biological markers). Pilot testing revealed comprehension challenges, participant fatigue, and low-variability items. Statistical techniques reduced the total items by over 25% while retaining coverage of all targeted constructs. This reduced administration time from more than three hours to approximately two.\nConclusion\nThe OptimizeD battery provides a novel, scalable framework for identifying personalized treatment strategies in primary care. The trial will evaluate which variables best predict optimal treatment assignment, informing future integration of predictive tools into routine care in low-resource settings.",

          "abstract": "Real-world recognition requires our memory system to accommodate perceptual changes that \noccur after encoding; for example, eyewitnesses must recognize perpetrators across changes in \nappearance. However, it is not clear how this flexible recognition ability can be improved: \nStandard strategies such as increasing encoding duration are not only ineffective, but can in fact \nbe detrimental for recognizing people across appearance changes. Given the effectiveness of \nvisual imagery in creating and modifying memory representations, we examined whether \ncounterfactual visual imagery could be used to manipulate flexible recognition by simulating an \nincrease in encoding-retrieval similarity. Across two experiments, participants (n=317) encoded \nfaces with neutral expressions and were cued to imagine the faces with either happy or angry \nexpressions. During later retrieval, participants saw lineups of old and new faces with either \nhappy or angry expressions, and selected the old face and provided recognition confidence. \nOld/new recognition discriminability and confidence were higher when a face’s expression at \nretrieval matched the expression that it was imagined in during encoding (i.e., congruent \nimagery); interestingly, however, there was Bayesian evidence for no benefit of imagery \ncongruence for face-choice accuracy. Moreover, congruent imagery improved recognition for old \narrays irrespective of whether participants correctly selected the old face, suggesting that the \nimagery manipulation increased a diffuse sense of recognition without increasing the ability to \nattribute that sense of recognition to a specific stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that \nvisual imagery can directionally manipulate recognition for changed faces, and produces a novel \ndissociation between old/new recognition and forced-choice accuracy.",

The present study investigated how individual listener differences in working memory capacity and attentional control may predict the degree of processing costs (as measured by response time and accuracy) incurred by trial-to-trial switches in English talkers of first language (L1) American accent and second language (L2) Mandarin Chinese accent. Listeners completed a dual-task experiment with a primary listening task and secondary non-linguistic task as well as measures of working memory capacity (the Word Auditory Recognition and Recall Measure) and attentional control (the Trail Making Test and a Stroop Test). Results indicated that, on trials with a talker switch, listeners with smaller working memory capacities were slower to respond to the secondary task and had poorer recognition accuracy for the primary task. The measures of attentional control did not predict switching costs, but Stroop test scores did interact with the accent manipulation such that listeners with better attentional control had better overall recognition accuracy for L2 accent. Working memory capacity, on the other hand, did not predict differences in recognition accuracy between the L1 and L2 accent conditions. We conclude that working memory plays a critical role in supporting rapid (trial-to-trial) talker accommodation. Attentional control appears to support processing of L2 accent more generally, but may not be critical for rapid accommodation.",

          "abstract": "People vigilantly evaluate advice: they seek to learn from competent and well-intentioned informants, while ignoring incompetent or manipulative ones. Yet the mechanisms that support vigilance of informants' motivations remain poorly-understood. For instance, how do people combine informants' incentives and intentions when evaluating testimony---through rational inference, or simple heuristics? To answer such questions, here we develop a rational model of vigilance and test its predictions in two pre-registered online experiments with participants in the U.S (Ns = 626, 555). Across financial, real estate, and medical decision scenarios, participants' inferences closely tracked our model’s predictions: participants discounted advice when selfish speakers benefited from manipulating them, and this discounting was attenuated by perceived benevolence. When pay-offs were shared, incentives increased trust, as our rational model---but not simple heuristics---predict. Our rational analysis thus establishes a formal framework for vigilance of motivations that also sheds light on phenomena from persuasion to polarization.",
