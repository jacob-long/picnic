          "authors": "Marta Topor; Henrik Danielsson",
          "abstract": "Preregistration, the process of publicly recording a study’s hypotheses, design, and analysis plan before data collection and/or analysis, is an essential practice for enhancing transparency, methodological rigour, and reproducibility in research. This chapter provides a practical guide for integrating preregistration into teaching and supervision.\n\nThe first section highlights arguments for adopting preregistration, emphasising its role in reducing biases. It introduces preregistration as a critical skill for academic development and offers guidance for designing learning exercises, including activities that build competencies in hypothesis formulation, study design, and analysis planning relevant to both quantitative and qualitative studies.\nThe second section addresses the practical implementation of preregistration in student-led projects. It discusses how to support preregistration across methodological traditions—quantitative, qualitative, and systematic reviews—and offers concrete guidance on template selection, platform use, managing deviations from preregistered plans, and reporting exploratory analyses.",

          "authors": "Magda Skubera; Roksana Sobolak; Thomas Rhys Evans",
          "abstract": "Feedback is an important mechanism to support education, development and quality within research. Yet current feedback mechanisms are often hard to navigate and sub-optimally timed such that feedback often extends existing inequalities. Much knowledge about how to ‘do’ feedback is not formally taught or trained and remains a significant part of the hidden curriculum of research. Using qualitative insights drawn from a trans-disciplinary global survey of researchers (n=867), the current study provides seven recommendations for improving feedback. Moving beyond widely accepted ‘good’ feedback practices, and exposing some of the unspoken realities of navigating the feedback culture of research, we hope the collective wisdom of this vast array of researchers supports researchers (especially early career, and those from minoritised backgrounds), towards a more accessible research culture for all.",

          "abstract": "The adoption of open science principles for data has been instrumental in enabling the creation and reuse of large datasets and efficient collaboration, but requires a dedicated open data sharing infrastructure. Although clinical neuroscience research increasingly involves large-scale collaboration on controlled, sensitive data, open science principles can bring key benefits in this setting. The unique privacy and access requirements of clinical research create challenges that require a specialized data infrastructure, focused on local governance. Here we present a narrative account of a pilot project to establish such an infrastructure for the data of the ENIGMA Parkinson’s Disease working group by adopting the decentralized Nipoppy and Neurobagel tool stack. Our collaboration has led to the adoption of community data standards among international sites of the working group and has launched an open portal that enables the cross-site discovery of cohorts based on harmonized metadata. We discuss our approach to this collaboration, the social and technical challenges we have encountered and how we addressed them in the hope that groups in similar situations may benefit from our experiences.",

          "authors": "Rachel Ham; John Gardner; Adrian Carter; Paul Liknaitzky",
          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) frequently utilises a “cotherapy” model, in which two therapists jointly support participants or patients through preparation, dosing, and integration sessions. While common in clinical trials, the experience of cotherapy from the participant perspective remains underexplored. \n\nThis qualitative study examined experiences of cotherapy within a trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy for generalised anxiety disorder. Semi-structured interviews with 18 participants (29 interviews in total) were analysed thematically, guided by Affordance Theory to consider how cotherapy dynamics shaped therapeutic possibilities. Three major themes were developed: (1) Dose day cotherapy: safety, trust and the realities of access; (2) Cotherapy influences therapeutic processes; (3) Cotherapy shapes the impact and credibility of therapeutic insights.\n\nTogether, these findings position cotherapy in PAT as both a safety and supportive measure, and a potentiator of therapeutic processes. In the context of a single site with high levels of clinician qualification and training, participants generally valued cotherapy. Insights from this study can guide clinical practice and future research, so that feasibility and accessibility are enhanced while preserving the safety and therapeutic benefits afforded by cotherapy.",

          "authors": "Hongkai Mao; Yuan Chang Leong; Yutong Jiang; Alex Koch; William J. Brady; Joshua Conrad Jackson",
          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "authors": "Michał Bilewicz; Aleksandra Bilewicz",
          "abstract": "This paper explores how political demands transform into collective rights through a psychological lens, emphasizing the process of naturalization. Building on Moghaddam et al.'s framework, the authors introduce the idea that collective demands, when reframed as rights, are perceived as inherent, timeless, and essential to group identity. The paper discusses psychological mechanisms like essentialism, autochthony beliefs, and collective continuity, illustrating how groups come to view their demands as fundamental aspects of their existence. The authors explore examples from the Middle East’s ethno-political conflicts and food sovereignty movements, showing how rights claims are naturalized to strengthen group identity and mobilize action. However, the paper also highlights the potential negative consequences of this process, such as deepening social polarization and complicating conflict resolution. By framing rights as eternal, these demands become resistant to negotiation, often intensifying divisions rather than fostering shared human values. The study calls for a more nuanced understanding of rights discourse in contemporary political struggles.",

          "title": "When Threats Backfire: Overcharged Defendants Overestimate Their Trial Prospects and Reject Plea Offers More Often",
          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas",
          "abstract": "Objective(s): Strategic overcharging involves threatening disproportionately harsh punishment to widen the differential between the potential sentence if convicted at trial (PTS) and the plea sentence. Though larger discounts increase plea acceptance, excessive PTSs can counterintuitively reduce acceptances when holding discount constant. Drawing on anchoring theories, I investigated whether PTSs anchor defendants’ sentencing preferences, alter case appraisals, and influence plea decisions.\n\nHypotheses: I predicted (a) transparently irrelevant numeric anchors would not affect plea decisions; (b) a disproportionately harsh PTS would raise maximum acceptable sentences; and (c) higher sentencing preferences would increase plea acceptance.\n\nMethod: Prolific.com adults read a felony-DUI vignette and rendered a plea decision. Experiments 1 (N = 247) and 2 (N = 193) presented irrelevant anchors (48 vs. 8 months); Experiment 2 framed the anchor as a starting point for adjustment or hypothesis-testing. Experiment 3 (N = 844) presented more severe, prosecutor-threatened PTSs (18 vs. 4 years vs. none).\n\nResults: Irrelevant anchors did not alter plea decisions, ORExperiment_1 = 0.95 [0.57, 1.57]; ORExperiment_2 = 1.01 [0.56, 1.80]. In Experiment 3, the 18-year PTS increased sentencing preferences (d18_vs_4 = 1.04 [0.87, 1.22]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.75 [0.58, 0.92], but paradoxically increased estimates of acquittal (OR18_vs_4 = 1.74 [1.25, 2.44]; OR18_vs_No-PTS = 1.56 [1.12, 2.18]), strengthened perceptions of favorable evidence (d18_vs_4 = 0.26 [0.09, 0.42]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.22 [0.06, 0.39]), and increased plea rejections (OR18_vs_4 = 8.25 [4.41,15.42]).\n\nConclusions: PTS values may operate through distinct psychological pathways—altering sentencing preferences through less elaborative processes, but case appraisals via more elaborative processes. This challenges the rational-actor model assumption that treats PTS and conviction likelihood as independent, exogenous inputs to defendants’ plea decisions. Practically, overcharging may backfire from its intended strategic goal by causing defendants to overestimate their trial prospects.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight. The work offers a new framework for studying visual consciousness beyond\nthe limits of traditional single-target paradigms.",

          "authors": "Chiara Samatanga; Alexandra Lapteva; Wanja Wolff; Corinna Martarelli",
          "abstract": "Classical musicians’ individual practice time is central to their musical life and development, yet little research has examined the cognitive and affective processes that influence its effectiveness. This study investigates boredom, mind-wandering and flow during classical music practice, both on the trait and state level (i.e., during practice in general as well as during a specific session) as experiences associated with practice effectiveness. Classical musicians (N=105) completed two 20-minute practice sessions and filled out questionnaires beforehand, between sessions, and after the second session. Boredom emerged as a clear negative correlate for all performance outcomes: Trait boredom during practice was negatively associated with performance satisfaction, while state boredom was negatively related to both efficacy and creativity in a specific practice session. No significant associations were found between trait or state mind-wandering during practice and any outcome variables. Flow during practice, on the other hand, was positively associated with both efficacy and creativity. These findings suggest that while boredom is robustly linked to poorer outcomes and flow to better outcomes in classical music practice, the same is not true for mind-wandering. A possible explanation may lie in heterogeneous nature of mind-wandering and the relative freedom of practice. Given that boredom was consistently associated with less effective, less creative practice and lower performance satisfaction, whereas flow states were linked to more effective practice and higher creativity, future experimental or intervention-based studies should be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive and affective states influence musicians’ practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Children’s literature can teach life lessons and effective coping strategies, and can be a way to disseminate evidence-based practices (EBPs) for mental health as a universal prevention strategy. We conducted a content analysis on the presence of EBPs for youth anxiety in children’s literature picture books about anxiety. \nMethod: Analytic plan was preregistered on OSF. 1640 books were screened, and 191 books were coded for eight EBPs for youth anxiety: psychoeducation, labeling body sensations, relaxation, identifying/challenging anxious thoughts, problem solving, contingency management (e.g., rewards and praise), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (i.e., exposure), and post-approach processing.\nResults: Characters in the books modeled an average of 2.39 EBPs (SD = 1.76). The most frequently modeled EBPs were identifying/challenging anxious thoughts (60% of books), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (46%), and labeling body sensations (42%). The least commonly modeled EBP was contingency management (7%). Books written by licensed therapists were more likely to demonstrate post-approach processing. Books with self-help information at the end were more likely to model post-approach processing and relaxation skills. Books written for youth age 9-12 years modeled more EBPs than books written for youth age 8 years and younger.\nConclusions: Children’s books on youth anxiety model relatively few EBPs. Although approaching anxiety-provoking situations was one of the most used EBPs, 54% of books with an anxious character do not model having that character face their fears–a key strategy for youth anxiety. Additionally, few books demonstrate use of rewards and praise by caregivers, who often read stories with their children. Clinicians, caregivers, and librarians are encouraged to purchase books written by therapists or with self-help information in the back, given that these books are more likely to model EBPs.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a pivotal time for peer relationships. However, there is a historic rise in adolescent loneliness, and autistic youth may be at particular risk. Evidence suggests feelings of similarity drive friendship formation and continuation. Youth who feel dissimilar to peers may have fewer opportunities to develop friendships. In the current study, we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale to assess autistic and non-autistic youth perceptions of dissimilarity to other kids in general and to a friend. We then examined if youth perceptions of dissimilarity associated with related constructs and concurrent and future loneliness. 194 adolescents (36% autistic, 36% female, 64% White, Mage = 12.81) participated in the study. At the first assessment, youth self-reported perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness and completed an fMRI scan to assess neural similarity. At the second and third assessments, youth self-reported loneliness. Exploratory factor analysis indicated we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale with two discrete subscales (kids vs friend) that had high internal consistency across groups (α’s ≥ .80). Autistic youth experienced more perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness than their non-autistic peers, particularly to kids rather than to a friend. Autistic youth with greater neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids, whereas non-autistic youth with lesser neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids. Additionally, perceived dissimilarity to kids mediated the relation between group and loneliness. Our Perceived Dissimilarity Scale is a valuable metric for understanding individual differences in youth and may better explain experiences of loneliness than an autism diagnosis alone.",

          "authors": "Alexander Turner; Aly Magassouba; Sobanawartiny Wijeakumar",
          "abstract": "Multimodal caregiver-infant interactions have both concurrent and long-term impacts of child attention, cognitive and social skills. These multimodal behaviours are manually coded by human researchers, making these approaches susceptible to observer bias, dependent on inter-rater reliability, and substantial demands on time and resources. In this study, we aimed to develop a multimodal machine-learning model that could be capable of automatically detecting and classifying multimodal behaviours from video recordings of caregivers and their infants (N=81; infant mean age = 251.334.9 days) engaging with objects. We focused on four behaviors i.e., caregiver scaffolding, caregiver intrusiveness, infant object engagement and infant distractibility. Low-level features from audio, video, and pose data were extracted using specific AI models, and input into a Transformer-based architecture capable of learning temporal patterns across modalities. Our findings revealed a significant contrast in model performance depending on how the data was partitioned. When the dataset was split such that data from all dyads contributed to the training, validation, and test sets - the models achieved notably high classification accuracy of over 98%. However, following 5-fold cross-validation with dyad-level separation, ensuring that test set dyads were entirely unseen during training and validation, the performance dropped markedly to ~55%. These results suggest that the models did not learn behaviors of interest but instead relied on video-specific or dyad-specific details. This work lays a foundation for future research aimed at refining these models and extending their applicability across diverse caregiving contexts.",

          "authors": "Daniel Romero; Esmeralda matute; Yaira Chamorro; Lauren K. Schiller; Miriam Rosenberg-Lee; Roberto A. Abreu-Mendoza",
          "abstract": "Students often rely on flawed strategies to compare fractions, focusing on individual components rather than rational magnitudes. Only a handful of studies have explored whether these strategies result in difficulties in other fraction domains or whether they are the consequence of reduced cognitive capacities or attending to the wrong numerical distances (e.g., numerator and denominator distances). Mexican high school students (N=76, mean age=16.18 years) completed a fraction comparison task with pairs either compatible with whole-number rules (e.g., 18/19 vs. 12/19) or misleading (e.g., 23/49 vs. 23/30). Participants completed conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge tests and three executive function tasks. First, cluster analyses revealed that almost half of the students used flawed componential fraction comparison strategies. Particularly, we found two biased (whole-number bias and reverse bias) groups and a third group with overall high performance. Notably, whole-number biased students had lower math achievement, conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge than reverse biased or high-performance students. Next, we probed differences in rational and componential magnitude processing between these groups. Remarkably, both biased groups showed neither rational nor componential distance effects. In contrast, high-performing students' performance was better explained by robust rational distance effects. Together, these results suggest that while fraction conceptual and procedural knowledge distinguish whole-number bias students from reverse-bias and high-performing students, only rational magnitude processing distinguishes between students with flawed strategies and high-performing students.",

          "abstract": "Although moral attitudes are often characterized as stable and rooted in “moral truth,” whether people act on them depends heavily on situational factors. We present a framework for understanding how attitudes, social norms, and perceived control collectively shape moral behavior. People adapt their behavior as they move across social contexts, following norms that either encourage moral behaviors (e.g., expressions of outrage on social media) or restrain them (e.g., professional settings). We explain why people are influenced by norms, focusing on two goals – affiliation (desire to affiliate with one’s group) and accuracy (desire to be morally right in ambiguous situations) – and how these goals become uniquely intertwined in moral behavior. This framework can help explain why people overestimate their willingness to speak out on a moral issue, when people opt out of collective action, and why they engage in moral hypocrisy.",

          "abstract": "How does the brain prioritize information when visual scenes contain multiple relevant features? While emotionally evocative content has long been considered central to attentional capture, recent perspectives highlight the intrinsic relevance of social information. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of these relevance dimensions remain unclear. We co-registered event-related potentials (ERPs) and eye movements while participants viewed complex scenes varying in social content (social, non-social) and emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral). Early ERP responses (P1) showed enhanced amplitudes for positive social images, suggesting that social relevance can mitigate the early-stage negativity bias. Social content also modulated the EPN, while emotional valence shaped later components (P300, LPC), with larger amplitudes for negative scenes. Eye-tracking measures mirrored these effects: initial saccades were faster for social images, and fixation patterns showed increased visual exploration for both positive and negative social scenes compared to neutral. Together, these results support a sequential appraisal process in which social content is prioritized at early perceptual stages, while emotional valence influences later evaluative processing. This pattern challenges the notion of a general negativity bias and highlights the interactive and stage-specific contributions of social and emotional relevance in affective scene perception.",

          "authors": "Christy D. Yoon; Hedda Meadan; Frederick Shic",
          "abstract": "Background: Eye tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing autism research, including diagnostics and interventions. However, studies on joint attention (JA) in autistic children have predominantly concentrated on the responding to joint attention (RJA) construct, with limited focus on the initiating joint attention (IJA) construct. Moreover, despite the interactive nature of JA, researchers have often relied on passive paradigms to study JA in this population. To address these gaps, we developed a gaze-contingent eye-tracking battery targeting three developmentally appropriate JA skills for young children: RJA, IJA to request, and IJA to comment or reference.\n\nMethods: The development process was multifaceted and iterative, involving a series of collaborative steps and the allocation of various resources. These steps included determining the motion format and type of stimuli, designing and prototyping the stimuli, recruiting an actor to serve as a communication partner in the stimuli, recording and editing videos for the stimuli, and building and test-running the battery.\n\nResults: We developed the Interactive Eye Tracking for Joint Attention (IET-JA) battery, which consists of 32 JA stimuli: 16 RJA stimuli, eight IJA-Request stimuli, and eight IJA-Comment/Reference stimuli. The stimuli are dynamic (i.e., videos) and feature a preprogrammed interactive human communication partner who is responsive to the participant’s gaze. The IET-JA takes approximately 8 minutes to complete, and its duration is expected to vary based on the participant’s level of engagement.\n\nConclusion: Implications for advancing methodologies, fostering team science, and enhancing iterative processes are discussed.",

This study examined acceptability of in-person and online remote psychotherapy, integrating quantitative and qualitative perspectives.\nMethod: Convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Quantitative data were obtained from 449 adults (18–65+ years) in online survey assessing acceptability, delivery format preference, technology use, cultural influences, and treatment orientation. Qualitative data were acquired in semi-structured interviews with 34 participants (20–62 years) from diverse cultural backgrounds. Thematic analysis explored experiences and perceptions of formats.\nResults: \nIn-person psychotherapy was rated significantly higher for affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, ethicality, and likelihood of recommendation, whereas remote psychotherapy was rated higher for convenience and accessibility. Ethnicity and technology self-efficacy modestly influenced preferences, while cultural influences affected in-person acceptability among specific subgroups (e.g., Arab women). Thematic analysis identified themes: (1) connection and therapeutic presence, emphasising nonverbal cues and physical co-presence for understanding (2) therapeutic space, with structured environments valued for in-person; (3) safety and privacy, emphasising importance of confidentiality and emotional security; (4) practical aspects of online therapy, and (5) perceived suitability of format. \nConclusion: In-person psychotherapy was preferred by most participants, while online delivery was viewed as an acceptable and practical alternative.",

Während ihre Relevanz auf internationaler Ebene hinlänglich nachgewiesen wurde, verläuft die Entwicklung im deutschsprachigen Raum langsamer, und es fehlt an wissenschaftlicher Evidenz zur Wirksamkeit pflegerischer Interventionen.\nZielsetzung: Darstellung und Analyse der Wirksamkeit psychiatrisch-pflegerischer Interventionen auf Basis randomisiert kontrollierter Studien (RCTs) einschließlich Metaanalysen.\nMethode: Es wurde eine narrative Literaturübersicht unter Verwendung von PubMed, Embase und CINAHL durchgeführt (Zeitraum: 2015–2025). Eingeschlossen wurden RCTs, systematische Reviews und Metaanalysen, die Interventionen untersuchten, welche von psychiatrischen Pflegefachpersonen durchgeführt wurden. \nErgebnisse: Es wurden 28 RCTs aus 13 Ländern eingeschlossen, die überwiegend in ambulanten bzw. gemeindenahen Setting durchgeführt wurden, häufig mit Fokus auf Personen mit Schizophrenie oder anderen schweren psychischen Erkrankungen. Die Interventionen lassen sich vier Gruppen zuordnen: psychologische/psychotherapeutische, psychosoziale/selbstmanagementorientierte, ganzheitlich-kreative sowie strukturell-systemische Ansätze. Die untersuchten Outcomes waren vielfältig, ließen sich jedoch in Symptome, Recovery-bezogene Perspektiven, soziale Teilhabe sowie Gesundheitsverhalten bzw. Inanspruchnahme von Diensten einteilen. Positive Effekte wurden konsistent für psychische Symptome, soziale Funktionsfähigkeit und Gesundheitsverhalten berichtet. Die Ergebnisse für Adhärenz und Krankheitseinsicht waren heterogen, während die meisten Studien überwiegend keine klaren Effekte für körperliche Parameter zeigten.\nSchlussfolgerungen: Psychiatrische Pflegeinterventionen zeigen ein deutliches Potenzial zur Verbesserung patientenbezogener Outcomes. Ihre breitere Implementierung im deutschsprachigen Raum erfordert gezielte Schulungen, klare Rollenprofile und unterstützende Rahmenbedingungen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte stärker Recovery-orientierte Outcomes, PROMs und PREMs berücksichtigen und Studiendesigns einsetzen, die komplexe pflegerische Interventionen adäquat abbilden.\n\n(English) Abstract \nBackground: Psychiatric nurses play a key role in the care of people with mental illness. While their contribution is well established internationally, progress in German-speaking countries is slower, and evidence on the effectiveness of their interventions remains limited.\nObjective: To summarise and analyse the effectiveness of psychiatric nursing interventions based on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including meta-analyses.\nMethod: A narrative literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL (period: 2015–2025). Eligible studies included RCTs, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses of interventions delivered by psychiatric nurses.\nResults: Twenty-eight RCTs from 13 countries were included, mostly in community or outpatient settings and frequently targeting people with schizophrenia or other severe mental illness. Interventions fell into four groups: psychological/psychotherapeutic, psychosocial/self-management, holistic-creative, and structural-systemic approaches. Outcomes were diverse but clustered into symptoms, recovery-related perspectives, social participation, and health behaviour/service use. Positive effects were consistently reported for psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and health behaviour. Findings on adherence and illness insight were heterogeneous, while most studies showed no clear benefits for physical parameters.\nConclusions: Psychiatric nursing interventions demonstrate clear potential to improve patient-related outcomes. Their broader implementation in German-speaking countries requires targeted training, clear role profiles, and supportive framework conditions. Future research should emphasise recovery-oriented outcomes, PROMs and PREMs, and employ study designs suitable for complex nursing interventions.",

          "abstract": "As authoritarianism rises worldwide, understanding authoritarian tendencies among ordinary citizens is an increasingly urgent scientific and societal challenge. However, our understanding of individuals’ authoritarian tendencies is limited by thin empirical evidence on their everyday behavioral patterns. Here, we develop a comprehensive behavioral portrait of authoritarianism in everyday life using more than 280 million digital records collected via smartphones. These records include app usage, music listening, keyboard typing, calling and texting, locking and unlocking, and GPS location logs collected over three to six months from 669 volunteers’ smartphones. We processed the digital records using a theory-informed variable derivation approach, enriched them with data from external sources, and analyzed them using interpretable machine learning methods. Our findings are twofold. First, we find that everyday behavioral patterns predicted self-reported authoritarian tendencies independently of, and more strongly than, demographic characteristics typically linked to authoritarianism. Second, we find that behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies included reduced exposure to unfamiliar people and cultures, a preoccupation with status and hierarchy, and heightened aggression and emotionality. Notably, patterns of social media use—particularly greater Facebook use—were the strongest behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies. Overall, these behavioral patterns provide insight into the psychology of individuals with authoritarian tendencies, advancing psychological theories of authoritarianism. We discuss the implications of our findings for developing behavioral assessments and interventions that document and potentially counter authoritarianism’s rise among ordinary citizens in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to develop “empathic AI” often assume a universal definition for empathy—a singular, objective understanding of “human” experiences. This implies that achieving empathic AI is only a matter of optimization difficulty, where researchers should find the “correct” way to align AI systems with human-like empathy—essentially an engineering problem. In this chapter, we challenge this assumption. We begin by emphasizing the multifaceted nature of empathy. Then, we explore how variations in (1) the multiple forms of empathy and (2) the many groups we are embedded within present significant challenges in creating a universally applicable empathic AI. We discuss the difficulties of codifying empathy (an inherently context-dependent phenomenon) into AI systems, as well as the recent evidence for cultural biases and moral stereotypes in widely used Large Language Models (an important class of AI systems), highlighting the broader ethical, epistemic, and possibly existential issues inherent in designing machines that “understand” or “feel” others as humans do. We conclude by advocating for a more contextualized approach to empathic AI, one that is culture-aware, context-sensitive, and pluralistic, moving beyond the reductionist notion of “humans” as a monolith. We do not intend to address the question in our chapter’s title with a simple yes-or-no answer; instead, we advocate for asking questions such as “What kind of empathy?” and “Empathy for whom?” as researchers and engineers move toward developing more empathic generative language models.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Geiselmann; Lasana Harris; Ophelia Deroy",
          "abstract": "Perceiving agency from motion cues is fundamental to social cognition. While goal-directed motion is a well-known agency cue, the role of synchronous motion between inanimate entities remains underexplored. This study examines whether synchrony contributes to agency perception, enhances goal-directed motion cues, and influences metacognitive confidence. In Experiment 1, 78 U.S.-based neurotypical participants watched videos of pre-programmed disc movements, judged whether the discs were chasing, and rated their confidence. Experiment 2 (78 participants) extended the investigation to purposeful interactions beyond chasing. Findings demonstrate that synchrony plays a fundamental role in agency perception, shaping judgments of chasing and purposeful interaction. While chasing perception requires cue integration, with synchrony amplifying directed motion effects, purposeful interaction perception is shaped independently by each factor. Response times and confidence ratings reveal cue integration, suggesting that even when categorical judgments treat cues separately, the perceptual system processes both. Data was collected in August 2024. Age and gender were balanced, but the sample was predominantly White, highly educated, and U.S.-raised, limiting generalizability. While perceptual mechanisms are likely universal, cultural, developmental, and neurocognitive factors may shape higher-level judgments. These findings inform social cognition and interactions with artificial intelligence, highlighting synchrony as key to perceived agency.",

          "abstract": "Previous work has shown that the sense of agency increases when commanding other people. However, such work has primarily been limited to dyads, and little is known about how the sense of agency changes when the number of followers increases. Furthermore, it is unclear if commanding social agents vs. mere physical events changes one's sense of agency. Three experiments, involving making virtual agents clap their hands and/or streetlamps turning on, explore this topic. All three experiments reveal a robust linear increase in explicit agency judgments with follower count. Interestingly, experiments 2 and 3 show that this effect is amplified with human-like avatars (relative to streetlamps), suggesting that there may be something special about commanding a group of human-like social agents. This research provides further insight to our understanding of the sense of agency in group dynamics.",

First, I describe various considerations of the nature of knowledge in the history of philosophy with a focus on the age-old epistemological controversy between rationalism and empiricism. Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

          "abstract": "The balancing of cognitive flexibility versus stability is an important everyday skill that can be learned through reinforcement and may be impaired in autism or other transdiagnostic traits. In this preregistered study (n=412), we show that rewarding people more on task switch trials led them to show more voluntary switching behaviour, but also more task-rule interference. We further show that it is difficult to unlearn this shift along the flexibility-stability trade-off, even when the mapping between task switching and reward reversed. People with more autism traits or an autism diagnosis were equally fast at learning these contingencies but seemed to start from an overall smaller task-rule interference effect and larger switch costs – suggesting they show higher levels of cognitive stability at the cost of less flexibility. These patterns seemed unique to autism, as we failed to observe similar effects in four major transdiagnostic traits extracted from a principal component analysis based on 15 clinical questionnaires.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, demonstrate that numerical magnitude is represented along a left-right continuum. Theories of shared magnitude processing (ATOM) and polarity correspondence suggest that emotional dimensions might be spatialized in a similar way. Across two experiments, we tested whether emotional valence and intensity elicit spatial-emotional associations and whether exposure to emotional stimuli modulates numerical SNAs. In Experiment 1, participants completed a number parity judgment task (NT) and a gender judgment task with emotional faces (FT) that varied in both valence (happy/sad) and intensity (0%, 20%, 80%, 100%). Experiment 2 removed direct valence contrasts by presenting either happy or fearful faces per participant, isolating intensity effects. Across both experiments, the NT revealed a reliable reverse SNARC effect. Crucially, this effect disappeared when the FT preceded the NT, indicating that emotionally salient stimuli disrupted subsequent SNAs. By contrast, emotional intensity produced no consistent spatial mapping in the FT, regardless of valence. These findings challenge the view that emotional magnitude is spatialized like numerical magnitude and instead suggest that emotional stimuli indirectly influence SNAs by taxing attentional or control processes. Emotional salience thus modulates, but does not itself constitute, spatial-magnitude representations.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

          "abstract": "Individual family members impact each other and the family system at the physiological, brain, behavioral, phenomenological, and social level. Previous research used established methods, such as self-report and behavioral observation, to provide thorough insights into family dynamics. Here, we aim to complement existing methods and argue for a neurocognitive approach in family research. Neurocognitive tools can provide detailed and nuanced insights into complex family dynamics by capturing behavioral and brain processes at the individual and family level. By measuring neural activity and the alignment of brain activity between family members we can uncover complex recurrent and situation-dependent interactions that so far have remained hidden. Using this approach, we can increase the scope of family research, especially when measuring family members across generations with different levels of verbal ability. It allows to study emotionally interconnected family members across multiple generations. Measuring behavior and brain activity of multiple family members simultaneously is therefore a promising method to reveal additional factors contributing to family well-being and inform theory and practice. As mobile neuroimaging advances, studying family interactions in natural settings, such as the family home, becomes more feasible. This opens new possibilities for family research while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. The neurocognitive approach allows us to understand known and unknown factors contributing to family dynamics and brings a mechanistic understanding closer to “home”.",

Alcohol-related risk perception is distorted in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), but it is rarely employed in substance use research and therapy. The German questionnaire “Form to assess Alcohol-related Risk perception (‘Fragebogen zur alkoholbezogenen Risikowahrnehmung’; FAR) is a 44-item self-report instrument measuring the subjective risk perception of typical dangers caused by hazardous alcohol use (health, risk behavior, social life, work, law). It is based on the theoretical framework of four risk perception domains and allows the quantification of the Optimistic Bias. In this study, we report on the validation of the German 20-item short version, FAR-S.\nWe used two secondary data sets: A first sample of 690 students was used to perform a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. In a second sample of 57 AUD patients discriminant and convergent validity was studied. Furthermore, we examined item characteristics and scale reliability.\nOur results show that the FAR-S replicates the theoretical factor structure, support confirmatory and discriminant validity and prove good psychometric characteristics. The theoretical expected distortion of comparative risk perception in AUD patients in comparison to students was shown.\nThe FAR-S is an economic and valid instrument to assess alcohol-related risk perception. The instrument seems appropriate for a variety of contexts, such as research, prevention, or therapy. Alcohol-related risk perception might provide new insights into important questions like who might develop AUD or relapse; it might allow to study psychological changes along alcohol use careers and to identify new treatment targets.",

          "abstract": "Background: How patients perceive the risks related to their antipsychotic treatment (e.g. unwanted side effects) is a crucial factor for adherence; however, our current understanding of cognitive constructs underlying antipsychotic adherence is scarce. Recently, the self-report questionnaire Form to Assess Risk Perception of Antipsychotics (FRA) was introduced. The instrument measures the patients’ subjective perspective of two antithetical aspects of the perceived risks related to antipsychotic medication: risks attributed (1) to continuously taking the prescribed antipsychotics (e.g. probably causing unwanted effects) and (2) to stopping them (e.g. probably causing relapse of psychosis). Based on the two subscales the Difference Score is calculated, indicating which of the two risk perception views is stronger. This paper aims to further validate the FAR and introduces an additional method to calculate a composite Ambivalence Score.\nMethods: Fourty-one inpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (ICD-10; F-2) completed the FRA and further questionnaires during inpatient treatment. Convergent and discriminant validity of previously reported and new scoring methods were examined via correlations with theoretically related and unrelated constructs.\nResults: Our data show the hypothesized contrastive correlations of the two risk perception subscales and the two composite scores with instruments measuring related constructs, i.e. medication adherence, insight into the disorder, beliefs about needing medication or concerns about taking these drugs, distress and tension-relieving impulsive behavior patterns, confirming convergent validity. Lack of correlations with non-related constructs, e.g. emotion regulation and social support, supporting discriminant validity. The combined scores of both contrasting dimensions of risks perception are not related. \nConclusion: Our study lends further support to the validity of the FRA and sheds new light on cognitive processes underlying non-adherence. Since both risk perception subscales and the two composite scores correlate antithetically with different related constructs, this supports that it is promising to consider perceived risks of medication adherence and of medication non-adherence in the assessment of antipsychotic risk perception. Risk perception might be a factor, which can shed new light on the understanding of medication adherence and, thus, might provide new impulses in therapeutic treatment of patients with psychosis.",

In study 2 (https://osf.io/n7z6y), 40 SZ and 36 HC completed the Game of Dice Task (decision-making under risk), the Iowa Gambling Task (decision-making under ambiguity), the n-back task (working memory), a verbal IQ estimate, and the Trauma History Questionnaire.\nIn study 1, we neither found a direct association between ACE and hasty decision-making, nor mediated effects by IQ or psychopathology. Also in study 2, we neither found an association between trauma history and decision-making under risk or under ambiguity, nor any mediated effects by IQ, working memory, or psychopathology.\nTaken together, we find no evidence for an association of ACE/lifetime traumatic experiences and decision-making impairments, independent of the applied measure. This suggests that the assumed impact of adverse life experiences on cognitive functioning in SZ might not extend to decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Ordinality is considered to be one of the core properties of numbers and its understanding is seen as foundational for children’s numerical development. During the last two decades, the research field on ordinality has witnessed a significant rise in studies indicating that performance in different ordinality tasks are significant predictors of mathematics achievement. Crucially however, the research literature on ordinality is characterized by substantial ambiguity regarding its descriptions, measures, and terminology. \nAccordingly, the purpose of the present systematic literature review was to gather, evaluate, and analyze the literature on ordinality from these aspects. In total, 148 articles were included from the research areas of mathematics education and numerical cognition Across these, 151 distinct descriptions of ordinality were identified that clustered into ten categories. In addition, 18 types of measures were used to assess ordinality knowledge, and 638 unique terms referring to the construct were identified. Notably, studies including the same description often used different measures. The results suggested that ordinality cannot be captured by a single description or measure, but should be treated as a multifaceted construct. Based on the results, a theoretical framework for ordinality is proposed.",

          "abstract": "In stratified societies, structural and perceived socioeconomic inequalities increasingly shape adolescents’ learning trajectories—not only through access to resources but also through their self-beliefs and adaptive functioning. This study investigates how both objective socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived academic standing influence the development of general self-efficacy (GSE), a core motivational mechanism linked to learning and well-being. Using longitudinal survey data from 6,994 adolescents in Singapore, we show that subjective perceptions of academic standing significantly mediate the relationship between SES and self-efficacy, underscoring the cognitive salience of relative academic rank in high-stakes systems. We further disentangle adaptability into cognitive, behavioural, and affective domains and identify affective adaptability as the most robust predictor of GSE across all SES levels. Notably, for adolescents in the lowest SES deciles, the predictive value of perceived rank is attenuated, whereas affective adaptability remains a stable, universal predictor. These findings highlight GSE as a malleable cognitive-motivational construct shaped by both sociocultural and intrapersonal factors. We discuss implications for designing equity-oriented learning environments that support emotional adaptability and foster positive learning beliefs, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth.",

          "abstract": "Effective social support can benefit recipients, but it can be challenging to give. Determining what type of support will be most effective, for whom, and when, is a multi-pronged calculation that providers execute while balancing personal goals, motivations, and current resources. Prior research outlines support providers’ traits and methods that may improve support-giving, but the internal and psychological processes that underlie optimal support provision remain unclear. Here, we argue that self-regulation plays a critical and understudied role in giving effective social support. We leverage research on self-regulatory processes to examine how they influence effective support provision. We propose that support providers must first evaluate their aims and prioritize relational goals with recipients, and next utilize self-regulatory processes (e.g., effort, cognitive control) to understand recipient’s goals and deliver support. More effective self-regulation may enhance support exchanges for all involved. This framework generates testable research questions on how people give optimal support.",

          "abstract": "This study examines performance evaluation in perceptual detection tasks using response-time-based signal detection theory (SDT) analysis. A defining feature of detection tasks is the asymmetry between trials with stimulus presence and absence, often reflected in asymmetric type-1 ROC curves. This ROC asymmetry indicates greater signal variability in stimulus-present trials, which contradicts canonical assumptions in equal-variance SDT models. Across multiple datasets, we implemented an unequal-variance SDT model using response time (RT) data, and compared its estimates with those obtained from the traditional confidence-based method. RT-based estimates of SDT parameters, the SD ratio (σ) and mean difference (μ), aligned closely with confidence-based estimates. The resulting sensitivity measure dₐ—an unequal-variance extension of d′—derived from RT and confidence showed strong consistency across all datasets. Notably, the conventional d′ measure consistently overestimated detection performance compared to the dₐ measures, highlighting the importance of accounting for the degree of unequal variance. Our findings demonstrate that RT-based SDT analysis offers a reliable, cost-effective alternative for the precise evaluation of perceptual detection performance, particularly when confidence ratings are impractical or unavailable.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses.

          "abstract": "Music psychology researchers have long been interested in how emotions are expressed in music. Increasingly, researchers employ computationally derived measures of emotion (e.g., valence and arousal) from services such as Spotify. These measures are easy to use, but how they are calculated is not transparent. It is not clear whether these computational measures reflect how people rate perceived emotions in music. Addressing this, our study investigated the validity of Spotify’s automated ratings with subjective ratings from actual listeners. Participants were recruited from first-year university student cohorts and the general public (N = 244). Participants listened to 40 song excerpts, approximately 20-30 seconds in length, and rated tracks on their perception of its mood (valence), energy (arousal), danceability, familiarity, and enjoyment. Participant ratings were compared with Spotify’s automated ratings. We found that Spotify audio features energy and valence were positively associated with human ratings for these factors, with a strong relationship for arousal, and moderate relationship for valence. Spotify danceability, however, was not strongly associated with human ratings of danceability. These findings corroborate the utility of the widely used circumplex model for measuring emotions concisely. We further extend this by validating automated emotion ratings, such as those implemented by Spotify’s system, for use in music psychology, and highlight that if used cautiously, this is a useful tool in research.",

Using a large cross-cultural sample (k = 110, N = 108,946), we confirmed that people consistently judge climate change as posing a significantly greater harm to future generations than to themselves—a pattern that remained robust after controlling for demographics and multiple comparisons. Exploratory analysis indicated that temporal pessimism was greater among individuals with higher levels of climate worry and in nations with higher GDP per capita, stronger environmental performance, and greater human development, but smaller in nations with higher economic inequality.

          "abstract": "Numerous fields have demonstrated that our decisions are guided by social information, and one important piece of social information is social comparison. Previous research has suggested that social status can influence trust, but most prior studies examining the influence of social comparison on trust decisions employed social comparison contexts that potentially “justify” the difference in social status, such as performing better/worse in a task. The current study investigated how, instead, interpersonal trust and risk-related decisions are made after experiencing arbitrarily manipulated social comparison contexts. In addition, the study directly compared people’s behaviors in trust and risk environments under different social positions in a single experimental paradigm. Across two experiments (Experiment 1: discovery sample, N = 302; Experiment 2: validation sample, N = 299), we showed that exposure to randomly manipulated social comparison contexts significantly influenced participants’ economic allocation decisions, their perceived relative ranks, and their reported levels of envy towards their target of comparison. However, our findings suggest that participants’ subsequent decision-making regarding interpersonal trust and risk-taking were not affected by this arbitrary-based social comparison. Our results also show that participants perceived risk and trust environments differently, with smaller amounts invested in the risk scenario than in the trust scenario. Overall, our findings indicate which behaviors and feelings are more likely to be affected by being randomly placed in a favorable or unfavorable social comparison scenario, and increase our understanding of trust and risk across social comparison scenarios.",

Yet studies that explore how young people in the Global South perceive, emotionally respond to, and understand climate change are still scarce. Here, through a nationally representative survey of 2,220 Colombian youth (aged 18–32) we conducted, we examine young people's climate-related knowledge, emotions, and perceived efficacy of environmentally friendly behaviours in a Global South context. We also explore the role of socio-demographic variation in shaping those characteristics. Our findings reveal a high prevalence of negative “eco-emotions” (e.g., anxiety, fear) alongside widespread misconceptions about climate change causes and solutions. Most participants felt worried or fearful about climate change, yet only about one-third correctly identified fossil fuel use as the primary cause (with deforestation often mistakenly perceived as the leading driver). Respondents also overestimated the climate benefits of certain low-impact actions (e.g., banning single-use plastic bags, planting one tree) while under-recognizing higher-impact behaviours. Socio-demographic factors predicted distinct emotional and cognitive patterns: women and students reported more intense negative emotions, whereas rural and lower-income youth were less likely to demonstrate accurate climate change knowledge. Political orientation showed an influence on knowledge without the stark polarization observed elsewhere. Interestingly, colombian youth who fear comfort losses are 13 times more likely to dismiss eco-friendly actions. These findings underscore the need for climate education policy and practice with differential approaches across socio-economic levels in the Global South to empower young people as informed and emotionally-resilient agents of climate action.",

We use a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks.

          "abstract": "Purpose: To compare spoken language input to young deaf/hard of hearing (DHH) children with cochlear implants and matched chronological- and hearing-age hearing controls. Method: We used long-form audio-recordings (M=14.3hrs) from 48 6-32mo’s (16/group). We manually transcribed 40min/recording, and ran automated LENA algorithms over the full daylong recording. We computed 10 automated and manually annotated metrics of input quantity, complexity, and conceptual content. We also computed speech outcomes, and linked the input metrics to those outcomes. Results: There were no significant cross-group differences in input quantity, or in any input metrics between DHH and chronological age-matches. The DHH group heard significantly shorter sentences and more highly auditory words than hearing-age matches. While they produced more (and more mature) vocalizations than hearing-age matches, they produced fewer mature vocalizations than age-matched peers. DHH vocalizations also increased less robustly with age. In regression models, only hearing status explained variance in child vocalizations for DHH and hearing-age matches. For DHH and same age matches, age, hearing status (hearing&gt;DHH), input quantity, and shorter MLU input collectively predicted &gt;50% of the variance in children’s vocal maturity. Conclusions: DHH children and hearing children differed little in their language input. Differences from hearing-age controls are likely explained by their younger age. Nevertheless, we find lower rates of child vocalizations in the DHH group and a weaker increase over age.

          "abstract": "Measuring attitudes on sensitive topics such as immigration, prejudice, and multiculturalism is a persistent methodological challenge because standard self-report instruments are prone to social desirability bias. This bias—the tendency for participants to provide socially acceptable answers rather than their true beliefs—can distort both predictors and outcomes, severely compromising the rigor of research. Statistical control via social desirability scales offers only partial remediation, and when the same bias affects all measured variables, statistical control alone is often insufficient or even counterproductive. This tutorial introduces a novel methodological tool that mitigates social desirability bias by eliciting responses through creative reflection—an open-ended, low-stakes task that prompts participants to express their views indirectly. We detail the process of designing such tasks, coding and analyzing the resulting data, and integrating these methods into broader research designs. Our analysis applies a mixed-methods framework that integrates quantitative survey responses from 454 in-service teachers with qualitative creative narratives from 413 in-service teachers. Step-by-step code, annotated examples, and the full dataset are provided to enable replication and adaptation. While illustrated with a study of teachers’ multicultural attitudes, the approach is applicable to other sensitive psychological and educational research topics.",

          "abstract": "Event segmentation is a fundamental component of human perception and cognition. The field of event cognition studies how people decide where distinct events occur in incoming sensory data, how these \"event boundaries\" alter decision-making and memory processes, how events reveal themselves in neural activity, and how events may be represented within perception itself. The latter point is critical — the representation of events in the first place is filtered through perception. But what counts as a minimal event that is perceptible to humans? And to what extent is the perceptual representation of minimal events driven by physical properties within stimuli (e.g., sudden changes of a tennis ball's direction when one player strikes it) versus the semantic structure of events (e.g., \"step one\" versus \"step two\" of a tennis serve)? Here, across seven preregistered experiments, we explore the perceptual representation of event structure within single brief actions, and dissociate the roles of visual features and semantic structures in the perceptual segmentation of minimal events. First, participants produced boundary labels by segmenting videos of brief physical actions (e.g., kicking a ball). Then, separate groups of observers were asked to visually detect subtle disruptions in the video clips, unaware that the disruptions systematically occurred at boundary versus non-boundary timepoints. The results consistently showed an interfering effect of event boundaries on the detection of disruptions, suggesting a spontaneous perceptual representation of action structure even in very brief single actions. Moreover, boundary effects were strongest when stimuli were presented in recognizable forms versus distorted forms that only preserved lower-level features. Thus, automatic and rapid perceptual segmentation of single actions that only last several seconds may be driven by both sensory cues and our internal models of the world.",

Authoritarianism is often understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes and practices as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior as the main unit of analysis. We specify a set of behaviors made available only when people interact with the state, and use state rules and state punishment to carry out their own desires (e.g., for revenge, dominance) at the expense of the rule of law. Then, we propose that at the heart of these authoritarian behaviors is regular, everyday psychology—the psychology of norms and norm enforcement via third party punishment, albeit formalized, codified, and refracted through state procedures. States solve large scale coordination problems, largely with codified rules and official third- party punishments. Sometimes people use these procedures to fairly and legitimately uphold the rule of law, and sometimes people use them for their own ends, amounting to authoritarianism. We review how the state channels human desires for punishment and rules, and how people can use state punishment and state rules to behave in authoritarian ways; State punishments can be administered selectively and personally. Official rules can be made that keep individuals from public services, or exist only to keep some people in positions of power over others. The psychology of norms and third party punishment, which enables large-scale human cooperation, is at the heart of authoritarianism.",

Results from both studies (n=2,704; n=3,002) suggest that individuals low in Need for Chaos are risk-averse toward gains but risk-seeking toward losses, whereas those high in Need for Chaos exhibit the opposite pattern, seeking risk when anticipating gains and avoiding risk when anticipating losses. Our findings add important nuance to existing research by demonstrating that individuals higher in Need for Chaos are not merely indifferent to framing; rather, they also systematically respond to gain and loss frames. This work underscores how individual differences may help to shape judgment and decision making, particularly in times of societal and political uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Everyday learning unfolds across multiple senses, yet the long-term retention of multisensory statistical learning (SL) remains poorly understood. SL—the implicit detection and extraction of regularities from continuous input—has been documented across sensory modalities, but most work has focused on immediate learning in unisensory contexts. This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Why do today, what you can fail to do tomorrow? How to pace or allocate work over time, whether to delay starting to work, and how much effort to exert are decisions people face daily. People sometimes procrastinate, facing detrimental effects due to delays. Previous research has recognised multiple shapes of pacing and types of procrastination, influenced by a myriad of psychological and situational factors. However, the main mechanistic explanation for delays and pacing, which concerns temporal discounting of distant rewards, focuses on only a subset. Here, we introduce a systematic taxonomy of pacing and procrastination, integrating multiple mechanistic routes to them within a common framework. The taxonomy is based on the sequence of temporal decisions involved in choosing how to distribute work in time, and shows how these decisions can be influenced by characteristics of the task and the (sub-)optimality of decision-making. Using reinforcement learning and decision-making models, we simulate diverse sources of pacing to illustrate aspects of the taxonomy and demonstrate how they give rise to different types of pacing and procrastination, showing the plausibility of our taxonomy. Our approach provides a theoretical foundation for understanding pacing and procrastination, enabling the integration of both established and novel mechanisms within a unified conceptual framework.",

          "abstract": "As global aging accelerates, retirement has become a critical transition in older adults’ lives, with profound implications for mental health. Depression trajectories around retirement are inconsistent, with some studies suggesting worsening symptoms and others indicating improvement. This study will examine depressive symptom trajectories around the retirement transition using data from four aging studies: HRS, SHARE, CHARLS, and KLoSA. We emphasize three key components of the retirement transition: retirement age, pre-retirement phase, and post-retirement phase. Using multilevel models, we will estimate changes in depressive symptoms around retirement transition, accounting for cross-national and historical differences. The findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how individual retirement decisions interact with macro-level factors, providing insights for the design of policies that support mental health during the retirement transition.",

          "abstract": "Academics and pundits alike suggest politics harms our health. In the literature on mental health and politics -work that spans different disorders and political outcomes-there has been a turn to domain-specific measures of `political health'. However, when studying the complex relationship between mental health and politics, it is not yet clear if we need a disorder specific or general approach and to that end, if there is a need for domain-specificity (i.e., what it might contribute beyond traditional mental health measurements). To investigate this, we test and compare the construct and predictive validity of domain-specific political mental health (PMH) and general mental health (MH) in a study conducted in the Dutch population. Through our tests of construct validity, we find PMH is an independent construct to MH. Our tests of predictive validity demonstrate that while both PMH and MH have a range of political correlates, from political participation to external political efficacy, it is PMH that has stronger and broader political associations -- to affective polarization, ideological extremism and news aversion, among others. In the discussion we outline a research agenda for moving forward the study of mental health and politics in light of our findings: our results imply that domain-specificity is needed to properly identify the extent to which mental health is connected to engagement with politics and who may be the most affected and importantly, that PMH and MH have more far reaching political consequences than previously assumed.",

While this contextual-cueing effect is well established in vision, it is less clear whether and how context-based facilitation is realized in the auditory modality. In five experiments with 136 participants, we employed a new auditory search task in which constant (vs. variable) human speech sounds (letters as distractors, numbers as targets) were presented sequentially from distinct spatial locations using five loudspeakers. We find that distractor identity is both necessary and sufficient for auditory contextual cueing. This finding stands in striking contrast to visual contextual cueing, where fixed spatial layouts are typically crucial for the effect. Thus, it highlights the complementary strengths of the two modalities: While the visual system prioritizes spatial context, the auditory system rapidly recodes input into categorical, identity-based representations, making these central to statistical contextual learning.",

We focus specifically on how negative emotions alter the balance of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems. We consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine bases of these computations. We propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

Here I examine the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) as a case study illustrating how judgment noise can interact with structural features of a multi-stage evaluation system. Simulations show that noise in both internal departmental reviews and REF panel reviews, in conjunction with the bounded REF rating scale, produces systematic underestimation of the highest-performing departments. Panel noise, rather than internal noise, had a disproportionate impact on department rankings, with even moderate noise producing severe distortions. At a policy level, these results underscore the need for a noise audit of REF panel ratings. More broadly, the case of REF demonstrates that noise embedded in sequential evaluation, for example, in hiring and grant review decisions, does not “cancel out”, but instead can propagate in potentially surprising ways.",

          "abstract": "The perception of voluntariness in task failure during extreme physical effort is debated in endurance sports. This study tested whether power meter data availability affects perceived voluntariness and performance in cyclists accustomed to power meters. Forty trained cyclists completed two counterbalanced maximal incremental tests: one without feedback and one with real-time power visualization. Confirmatory analyses showed that power visualization increased maximal aerobic power (MAP) (p = 0.004, ES = 0.487) without affecting VO2MAX, maximal heart rate, RPE, or perceived voluntariness (p &gt; 0.05). Exploratory analyses revealed an order effect: participants who first performed the test with power data perceived their decision to stop as more voluntary in that condition compared to the subsequent no-feedback test (p = 0.029). This effect was absent in the reverse order group (p = 0.749). No order effects were found for other variables. Cyclists’ performance judgments aligned with actual MAP differences (p = 0.744). These findings suggest that removing power data after prior exposure reduces perceived control over task failure decisions, while access to power data enhances MAP. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in self-paced efforts. This study highlights the role of performance feedback in shaping effort perception and performance in cycling.",

This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

This association may result from methodological issues, such as misinterpretation of psychosis questionnaires by autistic individuals and clinician difficulty differentiating between symptoms of autism and psychosis. This meta-analysis aimed to update the review of this association and examine whether it is moderated by the methods used to measure it. \nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science. Included studies required: autism and psychosis measurements, comorbidity data, adult participants, and quantitative data. Risk of bias was assessed using Hoy et al. (2012) criteria, and analyses examined correlational data, computed odds ratios, and computed Cohen's d. \nResults: Sixty-three papers were included. Significant correlations were found between autistic traits and overall (r = 0.435, p &lt; .0001), positive (r = .274, p &lt; .0001), negative (r = .506, p &lt; .0001), and disorganized (r = .366, p &lt; .0001) psychotic symptoms. Individuals with one condition had increased risk of being diagnosed with the other (OR = 7.03, p &lt; .001), and scored higher on trait measures of the other (d = 1.187, p &lt; .0001). No moderating effect of measurement was found. \nDiscussion: This meta-analysis provides an updated overview of the association between autism and psychosis, with no evidence that methodological issues are specific to any measure. The weaker correlation between autistic traits and positive psychotic symptoms suggests symptom overlap may partly explain the association.",

          "abstract": "Moving towards more plant-based diets is a win-win for both human and planetary health. However, for successful adoption, such diets must be realistic and convenient. This study explored the factors influencing food choices among young women in Scotland and examined how they interpret and use plant-based and convenience food in their daily lives. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 women aged 18-24 and generated six themes using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework. We found meat consumption to be socially and culturally embedded, reinforced by family, peers, and social media (Theme 1). Participants expressed a sense of safety with familiar meat-based dishes and fear towards unfamiliar plant-based dishes (Theme 2). ‘Plant-based’ was widely perceived as meat alternatives only, which were rejected across health, taste, cost, and identity considerations. Although cost was the biggest driver of food choice, meat was perceived as a necessary expense, further justified by health motivations (Theme 3). Environmental concerns were less important, with participants demonstrating limited awareness about the environmental impact of food (Theme 4). Convenience was important, though ready meals were rejected in favour of batch cooking and quick-prep meals (Theme 5). Meat reduction was perceived as an all-or-nothing identity shift, with negative vegan stereotypes deterring even small reductions in intake (Theme 6). These findings highlight the need to reposition plant-based foods as affordable, convenient, healthy, and familiar, likely requiring wider food system changes. Further, health benefits of increased plant-based wholefoods and reduced meat consumption should be emphasised in government and industry messaging.",

Using robust tests instead does not rely on assuming normality and equal variances. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives, like the Mann–Whitney U test or robust linear regression. Restricting on a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids multiple results, thus counteracts fishing for the desired result, which can occur subtly. It counteracts nonreplicated findings that are just due data anomalies like extreme values and outliers that occur differently across studies. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and there are many robust methods readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

Pain (global pain perception, pain intensity, pain affect, pain tolerance) and stress responses (subjective reports, autonomic [electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, salivary alpha-amylase] and endocrine activity [salivary cortisol]) were measured. Individual differences of the experience, trait empathy and absorption were investigated.\nExposure to multimodal art resulted in longer pain tolerance than single modality of visual art, but no difference was found for music. Other measures of pain intensity, stress intensity, and pain affect did not differ across the conditions. Regarding the mechanisms, exposure to all types of art distracted participants’ attention from pain, prompted mind wandering, and elicited greater enjoyment than the control condition. Physiological measures of electrocardiography and electrodermal activity validated our design: participants were more stressed during the cold pressor test, but no differences were observed across the four conditions. Also, no differences were found regarding cortisol and alpha-amylase. Regarding individual differences, higher trait absorption was associated with longer pain tolerance in the multimodal condition and with lower pain intensity in the music-only condition, compared to the other conditions. In conclusion, exposure to art can influence pain; however, the underlying mechanisms require further research.",

This narrative review synthesizes current evidence across these domains to advance a comprehensive framework for understanding BPD’s developmental pathways. While concepts such as equifinality, multifinality, and differential susceptibility have been sporadically noted in prior work, only a handful of studies explicitly apply them to BPD. To our knowledge, this article provides the most extensive integration of these perspectives to date, situating BPD within a developmental psychopathology model that explains both shared and divergent outcomes across individuals. By emphasizing plasticity alongside vulnerability, we propose an empirically grounded, multifactorial account that holds particular promise for psychiatric understanding as well as psychodynamic and other psychotherapeutic treatments. This integrative approach highlights the complex etiological architecture of BPD and underscores opportunities for tailoring interventions to patients’ unique developmental trajectories.",

In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effect of bystander affiliative intervention on stress-related behaviours indicating anxiety, anger and pain expressed by antagonists of conflicts. By conducting video analysis on interpersonal conflicts recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces of Amsterdam, we found that antagonists displayed fewer anger-related behaviours after receiving non-physical affiliation, such as non-verbal interaction or proximity. Our findings suggest that bystanders adopt a safe option to regulate antagonists’ stress, showing a continuity in the conflict management strategies evolved in social animals.",

This study provides a comparative investigation of three widely used PSRA questionnaires – the Questionnaire for Psychosocial Risk Assessment (QPRA), the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), and Welliba PSRA – to investigate their conceptual overlap and psychometric performance. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of N = 98 participants who completed all three questionnaires. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess relationships of scales within and between questionnaires, examining their convergent and discriminant validity. The results revealed substantial intercorrelations among conceptually related scales within and between all questionnaires, supporting convergent validity. However, numerous strong associations were observed between theoretically distinct constructs, highlighting poor discriminant validity across the tools. Hence, the investigated questionnaires appear to uniformly measure psychosocial risk as a general construct, while the lack of specificity outlines that their utility to assess delimited hazards is limited. The findings underscore the need for psychometric refinement of PSRA instruments and suggest that practitioners should supplement quantitative assessments with qualitative methods to ensure a rigorous and effective risk management process.",

Through education, reconsideration of our shared values, and direct action like activism, there is hope that Occupational Psychology can carve itself a renewed identity for challenging the wide problematic context it works within towards a more socially responsible community.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "abstract": "Watching what others put in their mouths is a powerful way to learn what to eat. Yet human diets and eating behaviors are complicated, and not everything that goes into another person's mouth is food: The fusilli is edible, but the fork is not. Therefore, some selectivity is necessary to guide social learning processes about food. Here we examined 6-month-old infants' expectations about what kinds of entities are likely to be edible using a violation-of-expectation setup in which infants viewed an actor eating from two different items. We hypothesized that infants may have selective edibility expectations about plants, and in particular fruits, that stem from humans' long evolutionary history of foraging wild plant foods and specialization in higher caloric density plant parts. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we found that infants expect plants, relative to feature-matched artifacts, to be edible, replicating a previous finding [Wertz &amp; Wynn, 2014a]. In Experiments 2 (N = 40) and 3 (N = 39), we examined, for the first time, whether selective expectations about plant edibility are tied to particular plant parts. Our results showed that infants do not differentially expect leaves to be edible, but our results for fruits were inconsistent. Taken together, these findings suggest that infants differentially expect plants to be edible, and that these expectations appear to be strongest for whole plants.",

          "authors": "Xufeng Duan; Bei Xiao; Beijia Kan; Zhenguang G. Cai",
          "abstract": "The construction of high-quality experimental stimuli is foundational to psychological research, yet current practices remain labor-intensive, reliant on expert intuition, and limited in scale and reproducibility. As the field increasingly pursues large-scale, cross-linguistic, and rapid experimental designs, stimulus generation has become a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automating aspects of stimulus creation, but questions remain regarding the fidelity, interpretability, and experimental validity of LLM-constructed stimuli. We, therefore, present StimMAS, which is the first multi-agent LLM framework that automates stimulus generation, validation, and evaluation, all within a psychologist-in-the-loop architecture. We validated the framework by comparing LLM-constructed stimuli against human-authored counterparts in three behavioral psycholinguistic experiments with 300 participants. Results show that LLM-constructed materials reliably replicate established effects. Stimuli produced by StimMAS yielded lower response entropy, indicating enhanced interpretive clarity, and interaction analyses revealed that key psycholinguistic effects were preserved or amplified. Ablation studies confirmed that, compared to a single-agent system, the multi-agent architecture significantly improves stimulus quality by reducing redundancy, enforcing experimental constraints, and—particularly when using GPT-4o—achieving stronger alignment with expert judgment than DeepSeek, especially in the construction of English-language items. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent LLM systems, when guided by domain expertise, can serve as scalable, reproducible, and theoretically aligned tools for stimulus construction. StimMAS offers a publicly available platform that lowers barriers to high-quality experimental design, advancing the integration of AI into the empirical workflows of psychological science.

          "abstract": "Measuring the subjective well-being of societies is important in its own right and as a determinant of health outcomes. Traditionally, self-report surveys such as Gallup’s daily poll have tracked well-being, but they are expensive and provide limited coverage of communities. Over the past decade, research has shown that social media (e.g., Twitter/X) offers a cost-effective alternative. Yet, through ownership and policy changes, access to these “digital commons” is increasingly restricted. What are we losing without access for researchers? We argue that well-being estimates derived from geolocated, demographically post-stratified Twitter language provided the most valid indicators of US population well-being available. We compare estimates for 1,208 US counties (~89% of the population) derived from 1.53 billion posts by 5.25 million users to Gallup estimates from 1.9 million survey responses. Twitter-based estimates were more predictive of external health and economic indicators and met a wide variety of validity criteria, including a convergent correlation of r = .70 with Gallup, high test-retest stability, linguistic face validity, and generalizability across US cities, states, and the UK. We further show that Gallup ground truth data is not required by building an independent language model on n = 9,419 Twitter users, which produced valid estimates that again outperformed Gallup in predicting external variables. These findings establish that social media can capture population well-being more robustly and with better coverage than even the largest survey efforts, and that ensuring researcher access to these data is essential for understanding and improving societies.",

          "abstract": "While intergroup contact theory traditionally focuses on prejudice reduction, intergroup contact may paradoxically increase consensus in race-based thinking of others. We measured individuals’ mental representations of how personality traits interrelate for different racial groups at conceptual (abstract) and perceptual (face-based) levels. Stereotype structure alignment was defined as the extent to which an individual’s trait associations across racial group members align with group-typical structures averaged across all participants, capturing shared perceptions. In a diverse Singapore sample comprising Chinese, Malay, and Indian participants (N = 153), quality contact (but not quantity) predicted stronger alignment with shared trait structures for ethnic minorities. Specifically, higher quality contact with minority groups (e.g., Malays) predicted greater convergence in abstract trait associations (but not face-based representations). These findings challenge assumptions about contact’s de-stereotyping effects. Quality contact appears to help people develop more culturally informed trait representations, which shape face perception, revealing a paradox in how intergroup contact influences stereotype structure alignment.",

          "abstract": "Difficulties in speech perception in noise are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may be associated with an attentional bias toward non-social stimuli. Although our previous study found no interactive effect of (non-)social noise on the relationship between autistic traits and speech-in-noise perception difficulties, this effect could be observed in children and adolescents with ASD who have greater attentional bias than individuals with high autistic traits in the general population. In this context, the present study tested two hypotheses: (1) children and adolescents with ASD show greater difficulty perceiving speech in noise than those without ASD, and (2) they experience greater difficulty perceiving speech in non-vocal noise than in vocal noise. Participants detected words embedded in vocal and non-vocal background noise. Children and adolescents with ASD had greater difficulties in speech perception in noise than those without ASD, supporting the first hypothesis. This difference was not explained by performance in speech perception in silence or hypersensitivity to noise. However, the second hypothesis was not supported, which is consistent with the results of our previous study. These results suggest that autistic traits other than attentional bias toward non-vocal sounds explain the difficulties in speech perception in noise.",

          "abstract": "Reappraisal is a linguistic strategy for regulating emotions that has the potential to produce powerful therapeutic effects. Consequently, there is growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to help people reappraise. However, little is known about the factors that make one reappraisal more effective than another, or how these factors map to different individuals. A key challenge is the lack of a framework to differentiate reappraisals, making it difficult to characterize what is expected to work for whom. We conducted two studies (N = 471) examining values as a person-specific predictor of reappraisal effectiveness. Our findings suggest that LLM-generated reappraisals that aligned with individuals’ more strongly endorsed values (relative to their other values) were more likely to address their specific concerns, be perceived as more effective, and lead to greater emotional change. These results highlight the importance of tailoring reappraisals to individuals’ personal values and provide a foundation for improving the personalization of AI-assisted emotion regulation interventions.",

          "authors": "Yuqing Shi; DongWon Oh",
          "abstract": "Forming first impressions from faces involves inherent uncertainty, as perceivers must make rapid personality judgments from limited information. Individuals and cultures differ in how they handle this uncertainty, with some showing greater aversion to ambiguity. We propose that higher uncertainty avoidance leads to more differentiated personality trait impressions, as a cognitive strategy for managing social ambiguity. Across three studies, we demonstrate converging evidence that uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes impression formation. Study 1 (N = 10,552) analyzed face-based trait ratings from 40 regions, revealing that individuals from cultures high in uncertainty avoidance exhibit greater differentiation between trait impressions. Study 2 (N = 105) examined individual differences and found that personal uncertainty avoidance predicts impression differentiation. This relationship was mediated by how distinctly people conceptualize personality traits. Study 3 (N = 212, preregistered) experimentally manipulated uncertainty avoidance, establishing a causal effect: participants formed more differentiated impressions from faces with an uncertainty-avoidant mindset. These findings reveal how uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes person perception across cultural and individual contexts. This work provides new insights into the mechanistic understanding of person perception and challenges the assumption of universality in face-based impressions. It demonstrates how domain-general cognitive diversity creates rich variation in social perception.",

          "abstract": "Everyday learning unfolds across multiple senses, yet the long-term retention of multisensory statistical learning (SL) remains poorly understood. SL—the implicit detection and extraction of regularities from continuous input—has been documented across sensory modalities, but most work has focused on immediate learning in unisensory contexts. This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

Ambivalent and indifferent people were less likely to vote for pro-Palestinian presidential candidates (Cornel West or Jill Stein) and more likely to vote for Trump, compared with pro-Palestinian participants. Finally, we reveal the ideological profiles of ambivalent and indifferent people based on egalitarianism, moral traditionalism, racial resentment, and nationalism.

          "abstract": "Background: Although extensive evidence suggests domain-general differences in autistic attention are common and impactful, frameworks for understanding these experiences remain confused. Concepts like monotropism, autotelic (flow-prone) personality, and hyperfocus seemingly have overlapping features and distinct attributes. How they relate to one another is not empirically clear.\nMethods: 111 autistic and 39 non-autistic adults filled out a Prolific survey. We examined group differences in ADHD inattention traits and subscales from monotropism, autotelic personality, and hyperfocus measures, and how subscales were related in autism. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as an initial exploration of dimensions potentially underlying these constructs. We also examined whether PCA components were related to anxiety and sensory hyperresponsitivity.\nResults: Autistic people reported more monotropism, hyperfocus, and inattention than non-autistic people. Autistic people reported more of some autotelic personality subscales (enjoyment of boredom, curiosity before correction) but less of another (attentional control). However, attentional control and self-centredness were largely unrelated to other autotelic personality dimensions; instead, they respectively converged with ADHD inattention traits and social anxiety. One PCA dimension seemingly reflected intense, enjoyable focus; it was related to sensory hyperresponsiveness, and indirectly via hyperresponsiveness with anxiety. Another seemingly reflected inattention and difficulties with attentional control; this was directly related to anxiety. These two PCA dimensions each explained relatively little variance, reflecting the complexity of autistic attention.\nConclusion: These results emphasise that attention in autism can have both positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., propensity to sensory distress) aspects. Underlying intense, enjoyable focus experiences likely contribute to hyperfocus, monotropism, and autotelic personality, but there appear to be many dimensions of attention in autism. Autotelic personality, as currently conceptualised, likely includes aspects that are more reflective of other existing constructs. Further research is needed to understand neurocognitive of and real-world manifestations and effects of these attention styles.",

Items assess attitudes about harmful speech (e.g., \"Vulnerable people should not be exposed to certain kinds of speech, as this might harm them\") and written words (e.g., \"I could be left emotionally scarred by something I read\"). In a representative sample of American adults (N = 956), the WCHS demonstrated strong internal reliability (α = .92) and robust test-retest reliability (r = .80). People higher in the belief that words can harm tended to be younger, female, non-White, and politically liberal. The WCHS was associated with self-reported intellectual humility, empathy, moral grandstanding, and the belief in the importance of silencing others. The WCHS was also associated with concern for political correctness and endorsement of trigger warnings and safe spaces. Individuals who believed that words can harm had worse mental health: they reported being more anxious and depressed, less resilient, and having more difficulties in emotion regulation. The WCHS is a reliable tool for measuring beliefs about the harmfulness of speech—a salient and divisive issue within modern cultural discourse.",

To fill this gap, in three experiments we investigated whether merely reading a short text claiming that free will does not exist, influences beliefs related to free will over time. Two experiments demonstrate that reading an anti-free will text (as compared to a control text) reduces participants’ beliefs related to free will when measured on the same day (Experiment 1 and 2), the next day (Experiment 1 and 2) as well as one week later (Experiment 2). Critically, when controlling for potential demand effects by making sure that participants do not associate the assessment of free will beliefs with the first session in which beliefs were manipulated (Experiment 3), results no longer showed an effect of reading the anti-free will text over time. Theoretical and ethical implications of these findings are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM) – quantum theory applications outside of physics – are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose and well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT) – a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical  ``oscillatory cognition'' of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, i.e., “mental entanglement.” We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing “local observables” and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on “mental entanglement” detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite research on case factors that can trigger confirmation bias in investigations leading to wrongful convictions, we know little about what sparks this chain reaction and why an innocent person initially falls under suspicion. Across four studies, we investigated what perceived behaviors exhibited by 911 callers (urgency, emotionality, cognitive load, impression management, and information management) are related to laypeople’s (Studies 1-2, 4) and police officers’ (Study 3) suspicion toward the caller. Hypotheses: We predicted, for lay and police samples, callers perceived as more urgent or emotional would be perceived as less suspicious, whereas callers perceived as more under cognitive load, managing information, or managing impressions of themselves would be perceived as more suspicious. We tested whether these relationships depended on caller gender—predicting gender stereotypes might play a role, particularly with emotionality. Method: Participants (Studies 1-2, 4: online laypeople, Study 3: police officers) listened to a real 911 call (Studies 1 and 4) or a more controlled, simulated 911 call (Studies 2 and 3) by a male or female caller. We assessed behavioral predictors associated with suspicion via participants’ spontaneous impressions and scales assessing these behaviors. Participants indicated how suspicious they found the caller and how much the caller violated their expectations. Results: Participants spontaneously mentioned the callers’ emotionality most frequently and consistently across studies (77-85%). Perceptions of callers being more urgent and emotional were associated with less suspicion and violation of expectations, while perceptions of callers engaging in more information management and impression management were associated with more suspicion and violation of expectations. Police, but not laypeople, perceived male callers as more suspicious than female callers—despite holding 911 call scripts constant. Conclusion: Citizens engaging in the well-intentioned act of calling 911 risk observers—including police—holding expectations for their behavior and targeting them as a suspect if they violate those expectations.",

          "authors": "Daniel J. Chiacchia; George E. Newman; Rachel Lise Ruttan",
          "abstract": "Which mental process reveals one’s authentic preference—deliberative reasoning or one’s gut impulses? The existing literature offers conflicting answers to this question: Some research suggests that people generally see deliberation as more fundamental, while other work suggests that people see intuition as more fundamental. This paper argues that belief in a true self provides a unifying framework to explain when participants will attribute one’s authentic preference to either System 1 or System 2. In line with predictions made by our theory, the results from four experiments (N=3,399 American adults) show that attributions about others’ authentic preferences vary predictably across normative and non-normative contexts. Further, we show that the more participants report believing in a good true self, the more their judgments about others adhere to a predictable pattern; and, directly manipulating information about a target’s true self changes people’s judgments about a target’s authentic preferences. By integrating theories of decision conflict and existing research on the true self, this work advances our understanding of how people reason about others’ minds, revealing how lay theories about identity can systematically shape social prediction and judgment.",

          "abstract": "A consensus definition of loneliness is elusive, partly because it is not yet clear whether loneliness is experienced in a homogenous fashion. This question could be probed by asking individuals to define their understanding of loneliness. Using a meta-synthesis analytic approach on data from four studies which elicited such definitions from distinct populations, we report cross-study consensus on three characteristics of loneliness: its negative emotional valence; its standing as a consequence of 1) absence of genuine social connection, and of 2) lack of receipt of adequate social support. Other characteristics of loneliness are described for which there was not cross-study consensus. We conclude that there may be characteristics of loneliness which apply across multiple contexts, although we acknowledge the limited reach of our data. We discuss our findings in the context of existing definitions of loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Youth psychopathology is a pressing global challenge. High comorbidity rates and only moderate psychotherapy effects highlight the need for transdiagnostic approaches, which target mechanisms cutting across diagnostic categories to better understand the etiology and maintenance of mental disorders. Traditional diagnostic instruments, however, face limitations such as recall bias and inability to capture the dynamic, context-dependent nature of youth psychopathology. Recent advances in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) now enable real-time, naturalistic measurement, but EMA studies in youth rarely adopt a transdiagnostic focus, and transdiagnostic research has seldom incorporated EMA.\nThis paper is a call for the integration of transdiagnostic science and EMA methods to advance clinical research and practice in youth. Although guidelines exist for EMA design in youth, recommendations on how to realize a transdiagnostic perspective using EMA is currently lacking. We summarize recent developments primarily in the field of adult research and outline key steps for the development and evaluation of a transdiagnostic EMA tool for youth. We conclude our call by outlining implications for transdiagnostic EMA research, including the potential of bridging theoretical transdiagnostic models and clinical applications.",

          "authors": "Ivan Tomic; Sebastian Schneegans; Paul Bays",
          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) performance declines with the quantity of material stored and the duration of its maintenance, but it is disputed whether these constraints are independent or interact. Specifically, different studies have reached contradictory conclusions on whether greater memory load accelerates deterioration of the stored information during retention, a question with implications for storage mechanisms. Meanwhile, prominent models of VWM based on stable attractors predict that recall should become increasingly biased towards a fixed set of canonical features with longer retention, but empirical support is mixed. Uncertainty is further exacerbated by limited data, methodological variation, and inconsistent analytical approaches across studies. Moreover, previous studies have not always distinguished response variability from stimulus-specific biases, nor considered the possibility of swap errors (intrusions). To address these issues, we conducted six new VWM experiments and reanalysed data from seven published experiments using consistent analytical methods to examine the effects of set size and delay on variability and bias. Our results show that recall variability increased with longer delays and higher set sizes, consistent with prior findings, and importantly, that these effects did not operate independently: the effect of delay was amplified at higher set sizes. We also observed consistent evidence for systematic biases across stimuli, but unlike variability, bias amplitude did not change with either set size or retention interval. These results support diffusion accounts of VWM maintenance, in which variability grows through the accumulation of random error, while challenging stable attractor accounts that predict systematic drift towards canonical values during maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Background. Opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment mainly involves long-term use of medications that either stimulate (agonists) or block (antagonists) mu-opioid receptors and that could potentially affect patients’ experiences of pain. We therefore conducted an observational study of pain symptoms and sensitivity in patients receiving opioid agonist and antagonist treatment for OUD, and healthy volunteers.\nMethods. Seventy-four OUD patients receiving the antagonist extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX; n = 34) or opioid agonists (methadone or buprenorphine; n = 40), as well as 50 healthy volunteers participated in a single study session. Participants answered questions about their current pain symptoms, and completed a Cold Pressor Test (CPT) while we measured heart rate and salivary cortisol. Hypotheses and analyses were preregistered before data access. Group differences in chronic pain rates and cold pain responses were modeled with logistic, beta and linear regression and tested with likelihood ratio χ2- and F-tests.\nResults. Half of patients in either treatment reported living with chronic pain. Individual CPT responses were variable. Patients on opioid agonists and XR-NTX reported pain 2 and 9 seconds earlier than and removed their hand 34 and 46 seconds before healthy volunteers. These group differences align with prior findings of heightened pain sensitivity in agonist-maintained patients but were non-significant (ps = 1). Differences in cold pain intensity and cold pain-induced changes in heart rate and cortisol aligned with hypotheses but were also non-significant (ps ≥ 0.17). \nConclusion. Consistent with prior observations, the current findings indicate that a considerable number of OUD patients experience persistent pain symptoms while undergoing either opioid agonists or XR-NTX treatment. Major detrimental or beneficial effects of these medications on pain and pain sensitivity seem unlikely however.",

          "authors": "Elouise Botes; Ziwen Teuber; Nora Vitali; Jean-Marc Dewaele; Joanne Colling",
          "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular, large language models (LLMs) have become embedded in the research process, with scientists increasingly using LLMs to assist with manuscript drafting. Previous studies have documented the linguistic fingerprints of LLMs in biomedical and technical sciences, whereas psychology has remained largely unexplored. This study investigates the presence of AI-associated linguistic markers in psychology publications between 2020 and 2024. We constructed a corpus of 368,531 abstracts indexed in Scopus across 1,121 psychology journals and analysed the relative frequencies of 28 words previously identified as overrepresented in AI-assisted writing. Results indicated that the use of these stylistic markers remained stable from 2020 to 2022 but rose significantly following the release of ChatGPT, with relative frequencies increasing in 2023 and showing a substantial surge in 2024. Counterfactual modelling suggested that at least 9% of 2024 abstracts contained linguistic traces consistent with LLM editing. Group-level analyses revealed that increases were not confined to lower-prestige outlets as higher-ranked journals, major publishers, and both English- and non-English speaking countries all showed significant growth in AI-associated word use. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence that generative AI has measurably shaped the psychology publication record. The results raise critical implications for research integrity, transparency, and equity in scientific publishing. As psychology continues to address its credibility challenges, proactive standards, ethical guidelines, and detection practices will be essential for integrating AI tools responsibly into the scholarly ecosystem.",

          "abstract": "A sense of belonging is linked to people’s engagement, performance and wellbeing in educational and workplace settings. However, previous literature on belonging at university lacks conceptual clarity, often using unidimensional measures that foreground social integration, which may not be valid and transferable to neurodivergent students and employees. Adopting an inclusive definition of neurodivergence, we report a participatory action research project in the context of a university in northern England, with the aim of understanding and promoting belonging on campus. At the first phase, 152 anonymous contributions were received across a multi-media cross-campus installation. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis, which identified key determinants of belonging for neurodivergent people: (1) Meaningful inclusive practice, characterised by flexibility and choice in learning, inclusion by default, validation and being believed; (2) Neurodivergent representation as a shared responsibility, supported by identity spaces and visible acceptance of difference; and (3) Navigating time, space and transition, highlighting the interdependency between space and experience, via constant cost-benefit decision-making. These themes informed a second phase of in-depth interviews with staff and students (n=13), analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. The findings are presented as a Model of Neurodivergent Belonging at University, framed through five questions that people negotiate to actively construct a sense of belonging in their contexts. We conclude that belonging at university for neurodivergent people requires authentic acceptance, rather than assimilation or institutional affiliation. Making small, achievable changes across university systems can cascade into meaningful gains in success and wellbeing for neurodivergent people.",

First, we manipulate within-subjects across 39 attitudes what year in the past we ask people to estimate American attitudes from 2012 back to 1822. We also manipulate whether we ask people at all about the past, or present, or future, across attitudes. Finally, we ask people to predict American attitudes in the future, within-subjects from 10 to 200 years in the future. Across 4,664 estimates—we replicate the finding that Americans believe progress has occurred. We also show, however, that Americans believe progress has occurred only relatively recently, attitudes in the more distant past were stable and unchanging. We also show that Americans believe progress will continue into the future, although at a slower rate. Overall, our findings replicate that stereotypes of the past lead people to misperceive attitude change, but largely because we misperceive how the past was. Americans see the past as a stable and unmoving place.",

          "abstract": "Humans organize semantic knowledge into complex networks that encode relations between concepts. The structure of those networks has broad implications for human cognitive processes, and for theories of semantic development. Evidence from large lexical networks such as those derived from word associations suggest that semantic networks are characterized by high sparsity and clustering while maintaining short average paths between concepts, a phenomenon known as a 'small-world' network. It has also been argued that those networks are 'scale-free', meaning that the number of connections (or degree) between concepts follows a power-law distribution whereby most concepts have few connections while a few have many. However, the scale-free property is still debated, and the extent to which the lexical evidence reflects the naturally occurring semantic regularities of the environment has not been investigated systematically. To address this, we collected and analyzed semantic descriptors, human evaluations, and similarity judgments from four large datasets of naturalistic stimuli across three modalities (visual, auditory, and audio-visual) comprising 7,916 stimuli and 610,841 human responses. By connecting concepts that co-occur as descriptors of the same stimuli, we construct 'multimodal' semantic networks. We show that these networks exhibit a clear small-world structure with a degree distribution that is best captured by a truncated power law (i.e., the most-connected concepts are less common than predicted by a perfect power law). We further show that these networks are predictive of human sensory judgments on these domains, as well as reaction times in an independent lexical decision task. Finally, we show that multimodal networks also share overlapping themes with previously analyzed lexical networks, which upon a more rigorous re-analysis are revealed to be truncated too. Our findings shed new light on the origins of the structure of semantic networks by tying it to the semantic regularities of the environment.",

This largely underappreciated polysemy problem prevents associative accounts of biological cognitive systems from being properly articulated, understood and criticized. Based on a review traversing psychological, neuronal and behavioral sciences, we delineate and characterize these five categories of usage, to show how such classification improves transparency across fields and casts new light on various debates.

          "abstract": "Disgust is a fundamental and multifaceted human emotion that plays a crucial role in survival by helping individuals avoid contamination and disease. Disgust manifests in response to odors, textures, and visual cues such as bodily fluids and insects, triggering avoidance behaviors like scrunching the nose or averting the eyes. It also influences social interactions, morality, and mate selection. Disgust is categorized into pathogen, sexual, and moral domains, each shaping human behavior differently. This study examines the social and pathological aspects of disgust, focusing on how personality traits and gender influence its manifestation. We found that disgust significantly impacts thoughts and behaviors, often leading to biases such as stigma, discrimination, and social rejection. Additionally, the experience of disgust varies between genders. Our review also highlights that heightened disgust sensitivity is associated with conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Our study shows that despite advancements in understanding the psychological implications of disgust, current intervention techniques often fall short due to its deep-seated, learned nature, highlighting the need for more effective behavioral and psychotherapeutic strategies to mitigate the maladaptive aspects of disgust, both in clinical settings and everyday social interactions.",

Previous studies often conflate tactile communication with concurrent visual or auditory cues, or reduce touch to artificial stimulation, leaving its independent communicative role unresolved. Here we introduce a dyadic paradigm that isolates touch as the sole channel of affective exchange. While Senders viewed negative or neutral videos, blindfolded Receivers—deprived of auditory input—were asked to infer the Sender’s emotional state based only on handholding. Across 59 dyads, tactile contact significantly enhanced behavioral alignment, particularly for arousal in negative contexts. Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that handholding increased inter-brain synchrony (IBS) in prefrontal circuits, with the Receiver’s left inferior frontal gyrus emerging as a central hub. Moreover, trait empathy differentially modulated these effects in Senders and Receivers, highlighting the role of dispositional factors in tactile communication. Together, these findings provide convergent behavioral, neural, and dispositional evidence that touch constitutes a dedicated channel for emotional transmission, advancing a mechanistic framework for its foundational role in human social connection.",

          "abstract": "Aim. The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) has become a widespread tool to study time-varying constructs across many subfields of psychological and psychiatric research. Variety in subfields of research and constructs of interest has contributed to considerable methodological variation. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to 1) describe the methodological variation  in ESM study designs and 2) assess the transparency (i.e., reporting and open science practices) of ESM studies. \nMethods. We developed an extensive list of data extraction items covering the entire workflow of an ESM study, from conception of the research question to reporting the results. This data was extracted from 150 recently published articles, describing 162 studies applying ESM in the field of psychology and psychiatry. \nResults.  As expected, variation was observed for every methodological decision. Some findings aligned with previous syntheses of the literature (e.g., a median study duration of ten days, a majority of studies including convenience samples of the general population, the high prevalence of multilevel modeling). Regarding other decisions, this review was able to provide new insights (e.g., questionnaire length and content often varied between and/or within participants, average sample sizes have increased over time). Transparency in reporting and open science practices seem to have improved in recent years, but there is room for further development of awareness and guidance. \nImplications.  This broad overview of ESM research serves as a first step towards a broader goal to improve the methodological quality of ESM research in psychology, contributing to a more rigorous, credible science of daily life.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nBackground\nAlthough autistic adults experience depression at higher rates than non-autistic adults, little is known about how psychologists assess depression in this group. It is unclear whether psychologists apply DSM-5-TR criteria directly, adapt them, or supplement them with additional considerations, given that autism-related characteristics may influence how depressive symptoms are described and interpreted. This study examined how psychologists interpret depressive symptoms in autistic adults, and whether the use of DSM-5-TR criteria differs from assessments with non-autistic adults.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted an exploratory qualitative study with 20 psychologists who had experience assessing and treating depression in autistic adults. We conducted semi-structured interviews between October 2024 and January 2025. Using direct content analysis, we coded responses according to DSM-5-TR criteria and employed inductive analysis to identify additional features outside these criteria.\n\nResults\nPsychologists described using DSM-5-TR criteria as a guiding framework while adapting interpretation to account for autistic baselines. They described depressed mood as pervasive hopelessness, anger, or somatic complaints, more often than sadness, and more entrenched than in non-autistic adults. They described autistic anhedonia and depression attacks as alternative variations of core DSM-5-TR criteria, with depression attacks characterised as sudden episodes of acute hopelessness and suicidality distinct from chronic mood disturbance. Worthlessness reflected lived experiences of exclusion rather than cognitive distortion. Psychologists considered several DSM-5-TR symptoms diagnostically ambiguous. They also noted depression-related modulation of autistic characteristics and self-injurious behaviour as meaningful clinical indicators. Psychologists provided clinical observations across criteria to inform assessment.\n\nConclusion\nPsychologists emphasised that while DSM-5-TR criteria remain applicable, they require adaptation when assessing autistic adults. Psychologists highlighted autistic anhedonia, depression attacks, self-injurious behaviour, and depression-related changes in autistic characteristics as critical for accurate diagnosis and risk assessment. These findings underscore the need for autism-informed clinical guidance and co-designed diagnostic tools that reflect autistic experiences of depression.",

          "abstract": "The Netherlands Autism Register (NAR) is a longitudinal, community-based cohort study based on annual data from autistic individuals, their caregivers, and a non-autistic comparison group, covering a broad range of domains including health, education, employment, and well-being. Survey data are supplemented by diverse methodologies including online tests, interviews, ecological momentary assessment, genetic sampling, and neuroimaging.\nThe NAR prioritizes transparent communication, participant reciprocity, and societal impact. Participants receive personalized feedback, and aggregated results are shared through public dashboards and regional policy reports. Autistic individuals are structurally involved at all research stages, within the research team, through advisory panels, and via the NAR Ambassador role.\nCompared to other international autism cohorts, the NAR is distinctive in its co-creation infrastructure, option for proxy reporting on autistic adults with high support needs, and its integration of diverse methods. The register has generated extensive scientific output and contributed to public debate and evidence-based policy.\nThis protocol outlines the structure, methodology, strengths, and limitations of the NAR, and discusses future directions including reaching underrepresented groups, data harmonisation with other cohorts, and broader societal engagement. The NAR aims to remain a flexible, participant-centred infrastructure supporting autism research and practice in the Netherlands and beyond.",

          "abstract": "Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) symptoms are related to emotion regulation difficulties which, in turn, are thought to contribute to negative outcomes such as mental health, social and behavioural difficulties. Emotion regulation theory suggests that the use of emotion regulation strategies is an important component of emotion regulation; however, whether and in which ways this may be disrupted by ADHD symptoms remains unclear. Capturing emotion regulation strategy use in daily life is particularly valuable for illuminating the reasons underlying emotion regulation difficulties in ADHD. Method: We used dynamic structural equation modelling (DSEM) to explore the associations between ADHD symptoms and the dynamics of four emotion regulation strategies in daily life: acceptance, rumination, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. We used data from the D2M study (n= 451, nobservations =16,129), a two-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study of young adults.  Results: ADHD symptoms were associated with higher levels of negative affect, rumination and suppression in daily life, as well as lower use of reappraisal and acceptance. Subtler emotion regulation dynamics such as the strength of relations between strategy use and subsequent negative affect and between negative affect and subsequent strategy use were only significantly related to ADHD symptoms for a subset of negative emotion-strategy combinations. Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are associated with emotion regulation strategy use in the course of daily life. By implication, training strategy use, especially reducing rumination, could be a potentially valuable intervention target to reduce emotional difficulties associated with ADHD symptoms and their downstream impacts.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Live music provides a multisensory and socially engaging experience that may amplify emotional responses compared with passive listening. However, extant studies frequently rely on small samples and utilize limited statistical approaches, thereby constraining the generalizability of findings. \nObjective: The present study sought to compare valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation) between live music attendance and passive listening using a large, ecologically valid dataset and employing both Bayesian and frequentist methodologies. \nMethods: A total of 17,498 observations were drawn from the Open Science Framework “Moods and Activities in Music” dataset. Following data cleaning, 15,007 valid cases for valence and 9,552 for arousal remained. Ratings of valence and arousal were recoded on a continuous scale ranging from −1 to +1. Independent-samples Welch t-tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted, complemented by Bayesian t-tests and ANOVAs (Cauchy prior r = 0.707) to quantify evidence strength. \nResults: Live music attendance yielded significantly higher valence (M = 0.121, SD = 0.418) than passive listening (M = 0.057, SD = 0.394), t(15,005) = −8.432, p &lt; .001, d = −0.161, BF10 = 5.19 × 10¹³. Arousal was also significantly higher for live music (M = 0.130, SD = 0.528) versus passive listening (M = −0.011, SD = 0.448), t(9,550) = −12.645, p &lt; .001, d = −0.301, BF10 = 267.23. Classical (frequentist) and Bayesian analyses demonstrated convergent results. \nConclusions: The findings support the hypothesis that engagement with live music intensifies emotional responses, plausibly via enhanced dopaminergic reward processing and collectively synchronized neural activity. The results underscore the value of integrating Bayesian and frequentist approaches and advocate for future research employing physiological and neuroimaging measures to elucidate causal mechanisms underlying these effects. \nKeywords: live music; valence; arousal; Bayesian analysis; emotion; music psychology",

          "authors": "Manuel Mello; Emilie Serraille; Jean-Rémy Hochmann; Liuba Papeo",
          "abstract": "Social cognition abilities develop rapidly in the second year of life, yet even in the first months, infants show sophistication in representing social events, such as dyadic interactions. The neural structures supporting these early capacities remain unknown. Human neuroimaging has identified a posterior occipitotemporal pathway, originating in the visual cortex, that responds selectively to interacting (vs. non-interacting) people by representing features (e.g., spatial relations) relevant to social event categorization. We asked whether such neural selectivity is present in preverbal infants, as a potential neural mechanism for early social perception. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we recorded brain activity in 6- and 10-month-old infants, as well as adults, while they viewed point-light displays of interacting (face-to-face) or non-interacting (back-to-back) dyads. In adults, interacting dyads yielded increased activity in posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and adjacent occipitotemporal and temporoparietal regions, replicating established neuroimaging findings. In infants, the same contrast engaged a similar network. No reliable difference emerged between 6- and 10-month-olds, though the effect was less widespread in the younger group, with a peak around pSTS. This social-interaction effect was distinct from that of body motion perception, suggesting separate mechanisms for perceiving general biological agents versus interacting agents. These findings demonstrate that, early in life, the human brain is tuned to visual cues of social engagement. We propose that early processing of human social relationships relies on a perceptual cue-based mechanism for recognizing interactions from relational properties in the stimulus, such as face-to-face interpersonal orientation.",

          "authors": "Ziyuan Li; Stefano Coretta",
          "abstract": "Evidence suggests that lifelong practice of two or more languages may contribute to cognitive reserve and protect against dementia. Most retrospective studies comparing bilinguals’ and monolinguals’ age at dementia onset report a delay for bilinguals. However, some studies suggest that such protective effects may be specific to certain types of dementia. Meanwhile, several prospective studies which investigated whether bilingualism reduces the incidence rate of dementia produced null results. Therefore, we conducted the first Bayesian meta-analysis to examine the relationship between bilingualism and age at onset of dementia and bilingualism and the incidence rate of dementia respectively. The results from 18 age at onset studies revealed that bilinguals were, on average, 3.45 years older than monolinguals at symptom onset (95% credible interval [CrI]: [2.8, 4.1]). Moreover, the result was only slightly influenced by years of education, although the effect of education on dementia remains uncertain. The results from 6 incidence rate studies did not provide robust evidence for bilingualism’s preventive effect. Therefore, this meta-analysis demonstrated that bilingualism has potential effects in delaying the onset of dementia but not preventing it. Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed a relatively consistent pattern of delayed symptom onset among bilinguals, though the estimated delays differed across dementia types. However, due to the limited number of studies available for each dementia subtype, uncertainty remains regarding whether bilingualism induces differential effects across dementia types. This highlights the need for further research specifically targeting non-Alzheimer’s dementias to better clarify these potential differences.",

          "abstract": "Cultural attractor theory proposes that recurrent psychological biases shape the persistence and transformation of cultural traditions. Portraiture offers a unique test case, embedding perceptual cues that reflect both individual choices and collective conventions. Using automated facial analysis (OpenFace), we examined over 2,000 digitized portraits from Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe, religious artworks, and Japanese ukiyo-e. Results replicated Morin’s (2013) finding of a Renaissance shift toward direct gaze, but this trend reversed after 1600, suggesting the attractor was not stable. Religious works diverged, becoming more averted, while secular portraits engaged viewers. The left cheek bias was strong in the Renaissance, weakened in later Europe, and remained stable in ukiyo-e. Across analyses, sitter fame—but not gaze—predicted cultural visibility. Our study demonstrates how computational analyses of artworks can recover long-term dynamics of human psychology, offering “cognitive fossils” that illuminate the coevolution of visual culture and social behavior.",

          "abstract": "Achievement emotions are a common experience in sport and exercise, yet comprehensive frameworks for conceptualizing and measuring these emotions are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce a taxonomy to the sport and exercise domain that organizes achievement emotions by valence (positive, negative), arousal (activating, deactivating), and object focus (activity, prospective outcomes, retrospective outcomes). To provide a measure that is consistent with this taxonomy, we further introduce the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire – Sport and Exercise (AEQ-SE), a new instrument assessing prototypical emotions across all twelve resulting emotion categories. Across two independent samples (total N = 862), results from network modeling and regression analysis supported the relevance of valence, arousal, and object focus for capturing the structure of achievement emotions in sport and exercise. Moreover, AEQ-SE scales were systematically associated with key theoretical antecedents (control and value appraisals) and outcomes (satisfaction, motivation, sport and exercise behavior, indicators of well-being). Together, our findings provide empirical evidence for the proposed three-dimensional taxonomy and establish the AEQ-SE as a psychometrically sound tool for studying achievement emotions in sport and exercise contexts.",

This study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of CBT trainer, an app facilitating training of CBT therapists through AI simulation of therapeutic interactions with feedback supporting competency development.\n\nMethod: This mixed-methods pilot study employed a two-stage approach. Stage 1 involved initial usability testing. Stage 2 included 59 participants from psychological practitioner training programs (77.2% from Low Intensity CBT Interventions program, 22.8% from Doctorate in Clinical Psychology) who engaged with the application over a month. Outcome measures included the System Usability Scale, platform engagement, post-study surveys on perceived learning outcomes, and qualitative feedback.\n\nResults: The CBT Trainer exceeded all pre-specified outcome targets, with participants spending an average of 95.24 minutes (SD = 134.58) engaging with roleplays. Participants voluntarily created an average of 4.15 role-play sessions each (SD = 3.55), with each session containing an average of 49.69 interactions. The platform achieved excellent usability with a mean SUS score of 82.20 (SD = 12.93). Assessment skills were the most significantly self-reported improved area (96.7%), followed by information gathering skills (66.7%). Participants valued immediate feedback (83.3%) and convenience (73.3%) as key advantages over traditional methods. \n\nConclusion: This pilot study provides evidence that AI-based virtual patient simulation offers a promising supplementary training tool for CBT therapists, with particular strengths in accessibility and immediate feedback. Future research should employ randomized controlled designs with objective competency assessments to determine whether simulated practice translates to measurable improvements in clinical performance.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge for psychological theorizing is: At what level(s) should we look for the best explanations and predictions of human behavior? The dominant view is that potentially the best theories to explain behavior are found in neuroscience and biology. Therefore, we start from the perspective of these lower levels, and consider the prospects of developing theories based on those levels. We focus on C. elegans, a model organism whose entire neuronal connectome is mapped, and use it as a case study to highlight the difficulties in developing neuroscientific theories of cognition and behavior. We argue that the neuroscientific levels are not promising avenues for constructing explanatory or predictive psychological theories. This is due to the immense complexity and context-dependency of biological systems, even those as simple as C. elegans. In order to tackle this complexity, we need higher-level variables that capture stable features of these systems. For psychological theory development, this implies that we should focus on conceptual work and discovering robust phenomena, and take psychology and behavior as the starting points.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how action histories – unfolding sequences of actions with objects – provide a context for both attentional allocation and linguistic repair strategies. Building on theories of enactive cognition [34] and sensorimotor contingency theory [40], we experimentally manipulated action sequences (action history) to create either simple or rich “situational models,” and investigated how these models interact with attention and reflect in linguistic processes during human–robot interaction. Participants (N = 30) engaged in a controlled object placement task with a humanoid robot, where the action (manner) information was either provided or omitted. The omission elicited repair behaviors in participants that were in focus of our investigation. For rich models (competing action possibilities) participants demonstrated: a) increased attentional reorientation, reflecting active engagement with the situational model b) preference for restricted repairs, targeting the specific source of trouble in action selection. Conversely, a simple situational model led to more generalized attention patterns and open repair strategies, suggesting weaker constraints on internal processing. These findings highlight how situational structures emerge externally to scaffold internal cognitive processes, with action histories serving as a crucial context for the interface between perception, action, and language. We discuss how to implement such a tight loop in the assistance of a system.",

Digital media use has proliferated dramatically during this developmental window, yet neuroscientific understanding of its impact on brain development remains limited.\nObjectives: To systematically review and synthesize neuroimaging evidence examining digital media effects on adolescent brain development, with focus on reward, salience, cognitive control, and social brain networks during critical developmental periods.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies examining digital media use in adolescents aged 11-19 years. Electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Neuroscience databases) were searched from 2015-2024. Inclusion criteria required original neuroimaging data (fMRI, structural MRI, DTI, EEG), validated digital media measures, and minimum sample sizes of 20 participants. Coordinate-based meta-analysis used Activation Likelihood Estimation, with qualitative synthesis organized by brain networks and developmental trajectories.\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria (N=11,234 participants total).

Although semantic and phonological DRM tasks yield parallel false recognition patterns for non-presented critical lures (CLs), prior work argued they reflect distinct processes, based partly on findings that semantic CLs elicit more false “Remember”(R) judgments, whereas phonological CLs elicit more false “Know”(K) judgments. The current study directly evaluated this claim by testing both semantic and phonological DRM tasks with old-new recognition and RK ratings. We replicated the RK dissociation, yet both parametric and non-parametric analyses indicated a single underlying dimension. First, a signal detection theory model provided a near-perfect fit to the data where R judgments merely reflect a higher response criterion than K. Moreover, a state-trace analysis uncovered a monotonic relationship between semantic and phonological overall and R false alarms.

To address this gap, the present study examined the effects of exposure to virtual nature in a VR room on adolescents’ affective states (i.e., positive and negative affect) and physiological stress responses (i.e., salivary α-amylase) using a randomized controlled trial. The study also tested whether the effects of the VR intervention varied according to individual differences in environmental sensitivity assessed as a personality trait (i.e., trait sensitivity). Thirty-four Japanese adolescents were randomly assigned to either a Forest condition or a Clock condition. A significant Condition × Time interaction was detected in a mixed linear model predicting negative affect. Negative affect decreased from pre- to post-intervention in the Forest condition, but not in the Clock condition. Individual differences in trait sensitivity did not moderate the effects of the VR intervention. Overall, the findings of this study are consistent with those reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses with adult samples.

          "abstract": "It is well documented that ADHD is associated with challenges in inhibitory control.  However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these difficulties are not well established. Here, we employ a novel “forced-response” method with computational modeling to disentangle the time-dependent control of habitual and goal-directed processing in response-conflict tasks in adults with ADHD. We use a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks. These findings mark an important step toward elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to real-life challenges in inhibiting distracting information in adults with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Wording effects, the systematic method variance arising from the inconsistent responding to positively and negatively worded items of the same construct, are pervasive in the behavioral and health sciences. Although several factor modeling strategies have been proposed to mitigate their adverse effects, there is limited systematic research assessing their performance with exploratory structural equation models (ESEM). The present study evaluated the impact of different types of response bias related to wording effects (random and straight-line carelessness, acquiescence, item difficulty, and mixed) on ESEM models incorporating two popular method modeling strategies, the correlated traits-correlated methods minus one (CTC[M-1]) model and random intercept item factor analysis (RIIFA), as well as the “do nothing” approach. Five variables were manipulated using Monte Carlo methods: the type and magnitude of response bias, factor loadings, factor correlations, and sample size. Overall, the results showed that ignoring wording effects leads to poor model fit and serious distortions of the ESEM estimates. The RIIFA approach generally performed best at countering these adverse impacts and recovering unbiased factor structures, whereas the CTC(M-1) models struggled when biases affected both positively and negatively worded items. A straightforward guide is offered to applied researchers who wish to use ESEM with mixed-worded scales.",

This study identified trajectories of PSMU among Polish adolescents and tested psychosocial predictors of class membership. Students (N = 179; 54.7% female; Mage = 15.34, SD = 1.11) from Warsaw schools completed surveys at three waves over eight months. Measures included the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction Scale (BPNS), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale–Short Form (DERS-SF), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Perceived Stress Scale–4 (PSS-4). Latent class growth analysis identified three classes; multinomial logistic regression predicted membership. A three-class solution fit best: High–stable (18.5%), Moderate–decreasing (37.6%), and Low–stable (43.8%). Relative to High–stable, fewer emotion regulation difficulties predicted Low–stable membership (OR = 0.933, 95% CI [0.885, 0.983], p = .009). Higher need satisfaction (OR = 1.13, 95% CI [1.02, 1.25], p = .015) and lower perceived support (OR = 0.943, 95% CI [0.895, 0.994], p = .028) differentiated the Moderate–decreasing group; stress was nonsignificant; McFadden R² = .12. Emotion dysregulation and unmet needs distinguish higher-risk trajectories. Interventions should prioritize regulation skills and autonomy-supportive contexts.",

          "abstract": "Residual-based fit statistics, which compare observed item statistics (e.g., proportions) with model-implied probabilities, are widely used to evaluate model fit, item fit, and local dependence in item response theory (IRT) models. Despite the prevalence of item non-responses in empirical studies, their impact on these statistics has not been systematically examined. Existing software (package) often applies heuristic treatments (e.g., listwise or pairwise deletion), which can distort fit statistics because missing data further inflate discrepancies between observed and expected proportions. This study evaluates the appropriateness of such treatments through extensive simulation. Results show that deletion methods degrade the accuracy of fit testing: fit indices are inflated under both null and power conditions, with the bias worsening as missingness increases. In addition, the impact of missing data exceeds that of model misspecification. Practical recommendations and alternative methods are discussed to guide applied researchers.",

So, what drives some to actively pursue challenging tasks even when immediate benefits are absent? We introduce meaningfulness of effort, a trait reflecting the tendency to derive meaning from effortful pursuits. Across 3 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies (N = 3,323), including student, general adult, and military veteran samples, we demonstrate that Meaningfulness of Effort acts as a stable unidimensional facet of conscientiousness. It is tightly linked to industriousness, with comparable test-retest reliability, and distinct from need for cognition, while also uniquely predictive of wellbeing outcomes. Those higher in meaningfulness of effort pursue and find meaning in more effortful activities. Similarly, they enjoy higher meaning in life, life and job satisfaction, and less psychological distress, burnout, and PTSD symptoms. Importantly, we saw that Meaningfulness of Effort predicted these wellbeing outcomes over longer time lags. Our findings place Meaningfulness of Effort as a useful trait in understanding why some might pursue effort absent of any clear reward; for them, effort feels fulfilling.",

          "abstract": "Background: Autistic college students may encounter academic content about autism that is deficit-focused. In this study, we compared how autistic and non-autistic students evaluated such content and the extent to which the content affected their self-esteem.\nMethods: The final sample included 172 undergraduate students (n non-autistic=  86, n autistic = 86) recruited using Prolific. Participants read a brief vignette about an autistic child taken from a popular psychology textbook. They rated how useful they found the vignette for understanding autism, how useful the average college student would find it, and how offensive and stigmatizing it was. Participants also provided self-esteem ratings before and after reading the vignette and completed three individual difference measures (strength of autistic identity, autism knowledge, ableism critical consciousness).\nResults: Compared to non-autistic participants, autistic participants rated the vignette as less useful and as more offensive and more stigmatizing. Individual differences influenced these effects in two ways: First, the stronger the autistic participants’ autism identity, the more offensive and stigmatizing they found the vignette to be. Second, participants with greater autism knowledge rated the vignette as less useful. Although average self-esteem ratings did not change after reading the vignette for either neurotype, 39.5% of the autistic sample reported feeling worse about themselves after reading the vignette than before. \nConclusion: This study provides insight into how autistic and non-autistic college students react to autism-related academic content, highlighting the roles of identity strength and autism knowledge in shaping these reactions. The findings underscore the need for more inclusive and representative depictions of autism in academic content by revealing significant differences in how autistic and non-autistic students evaluate the same material.",

          "abstract": "Because Visual Working Memory (VWM) capacity is limited, previous research has aimed to improve VWM with feedback and monetary incentives. However, the effects of feedback and incentives on VWM have been mixed. Here, we propose an “optimal strategy” account to explain when feedback will be effective versus ineffective at improving VWM performance. We hypothesized that incentivizing individuals with performance goals that are aligned to their capacity would yield higher average performance and fewer performance failures (“lapses”). Participants completed a whole-report VWM task and we varied the performance goal needed to earn bonus money on each trial (e.g., “Remember 3!”). In Experiments 1a and 1b, performance goals varied from 1 to 5 items, and we manipulated whether goals were blocked (Experiment 1a) or intermixed (Experiment 1b). In Experiment 2 (pre-registered), we replicated Experiment 1a with a larger sample size to examine individual differences in optimal VWM performance. Across all three experiments, group-averaged optimal VWM performance corresponded to goals that aligned to typical group-level capacity (~3 items). In contrast, supra-capacity goals (e.g., “remember 5 items”) tended to harm VWM performance by increasing lapses, consistent with an overload effect. In Experiment 2, we found that participants performed best when goals corresponded to their individual capacity estimate, and replicated overload effects at supra-capacity goals. However, we found a trade-off between metacognitive accuracy and optimal VWM performance. Altogether, our results suggest that VWM performance improvements rely on feedback that encourages the allocation of typical capacity limits, rather than encouraging maximizing performance.",

          "abstract": "Numerous fields have demonstrated that our decisions are guided by social information, and one important piece of social information is social comparison. Previous research has suggested that social status can influence trust, but most prior studies examining the influence of social comparison on trust decisions employed social comparison contexts that potentially “justify” the difference in social status, such as performing better/worse in a task. The current study investigated how, instead, interpersonal trust and risk-related decisions are made after experiencing arbitrarily manipulated social comparison contexts. In addition, the study directly compared people’s behaviors in trust and risk environments under different social positions in a single experimental paradigm. Across two experiments (Experiment 1: discovery sample, N = 302; Experiment 2: validation sample, N = 299), we showed that exposure to randomly manipulated social comparison contexts significantly influenced participants’ economic allocation decisions, their perceived relative ranks, and their reported levels of envy towards their target of comparison. However, our findings suggest that participants’ subsequent decision-making regarding interpersonal trust and risk-taking were not affected by this arbitrary-based social comparison. Our results also show that participants perceived risk and trust environments differently, with smaller amounts invested in the risk scenario than in the trust scenario. Overall, our findings indicate which behaviors and feelings are more likely to be affected by being randomly placed in a favorable or unfavorable social comparison scenario, and increase our understanding of trust and risk across social comparison scenarios.",

We present evidence for the two proposed factors—engaging in repentance with God and experiencing absolution from God—of the RWGS based on analyses of internal structure, internal consistency, convergent validity, and discriminative validity.

          "abstract": "Individuals who experience schizophrenias often have premorbid signs as early as childhood. However, they rarely develop pathognomonic psychotic symptoms until adolescence or young adulthood, a period of substantial brain remodeling. Current efforts to reduce risk for psychosis include psychosocial interventions as well as drugs designed to treat existing psychosis in mature individuals. These interventions have shown only modest beneficial effects, on average. This paper reviews evidence suggesting that other existing medications might be more effective in reducing risk of psychosis. Over the last decade, results have accrued on the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes that support healthy adolescent brain remodeling. In addition, studies have identified which of these processes may be inherently abnormal in those at risk for schizophrenias. Some mechanisms have been observed convergently from brain imaging, genomic, and cell culture studies. These mechanisms prominently include abnormal neuronal and glial development and function, compromised synapse remodeling, aberrant energy production, and altered immune functions. A search was performed to identify medications, already in use for other clinical purposes, that are known to target, modulate, and support these mechanisms and processes. Agents with those properties are noted and discussed. These drugs have well known standard doses and effects. They should be considered for trials in adolescents at high risk for psychosis. They might also serve as models for the design of even better-targeted agents to prevent or ameliorate psychosis.",

          "abstract": "In the natural world, higher-level visual features (e.g., scenes and objects) systematically co-occur\nwith specific lower-level features (e.g., textures and patterns). This natural covariation makes it\ndifficult to isolate aspects of behavior or brain activity that are specific to one level of the feature\nhierarchy. For example, a particular brain or behavioral response may reflect recognition of a\n“jungle” scene, or it may reflect sensitivity to leaf textures and dense vertical lines that constitute\njungle scenes. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach for decoupling higher-\nand lower-level features in naturalistic images. We employed a Stable Diffusion image generation\nframework to create a naturalistic image set in which scene–object pairings and texture–pattern\npairings are factorially combined, enabling independent manipulations of higher-level and\nlower-level image content. To validate our approach, we used state-of-the-art image processing\nmodels to confirm that higher-level features are represented similarly regardless of their\nlower-level constituent features and, conversely, that lower-level features are represented\nsimilarly regardless of the higher-level objects/scenes to which they contribute. We then\nconfirmed that human participants can readily and rapidly categorize these features in our\ngenerated images.

In this report, we rigorously assess the reliability of the results obtained with a professional crowdstorming method in a real-world setting. Two separate but equivalent groups of MBA students in the same course were asked to independently propose and prioritize ideas to improve the MBA program. Using semantic similarity measures based on OpenAI and Google's embeddings, we find that the two groups independently proposed similar sets of valuable ideas but different sets of poor ideas. We also find that they prioritized similar ideas similarly, enabling the decision maker to select similar sets of winning ideas in both groups. This suggests that a well-designed crowdstorming process may be trusted to produce results that accurately and reliably capture the collective intelligence.",

The\ncorpus contributes to a small collection of corpora with simultaneous recording of reading times and EEG. While this is often achieved using eye-tracking, the use of SPR offers methodological advantages, particularly in aligning neural signals with word-level processing.

          "abstract": "The developmental trajectory of the generalisation of avoidance has received limited research attention, despite generalisation and avoidance being key features of anxiety disorders. This study used a gamified avoidance task to investigate generalisation in 96 children aged 5–11 years old. The task was an adaption of the classic “Space Invaders” videogame, in which participants have to shoot at spaceships to win points but also avoid being shot by a large spaceship (i.e., aversive outcome). The appearance of the large spaceship (the outcome; which resulted in loss of points) was signalled by coloured sensors at the top of the screen. One sensor predicted the outcome (CS+; an aqua coloured sensor), and a second did not (CS-; orange). Participants could avoid the loss of points by moving into the safe areas of the screen in anticipation of the large spaceship. Following avoidance training, we then presented six generalisation stimuli varying along the blue-green dimension of the CS+, to assess generalisation. Our findings revealed that age significantly influenced generalisation gradients, with younger children (5-8) exhibiting broader gradients compared to older children (9-11). Regression analyses indicated that age, but not anxiety, was a significant predictor of generalisation. These results underscore the impact of ontogenetic changes on the generalisation of avoidance behaviour and highlight the importance of including young children in research to better understand the mechanisms underlying generalization and factors leading to anxiety disorders.",

We tested 127 British children in Years 2 and 3 before and after a six-week home-based intervention, in which children were randomly assigned to an experimental group who watched television with English subtitles or a control group who watched television without subtitles. Children’s reading fluency was assessed via two standard tests of reading fluency and via their engagement with subtitles while watching videos, measured with eye-tracking. Results showed that both groups improved their reading fluency over six weeks. Crucially, there was no evidence that subtitle exposure (of around 66 hours on average) drove an improvement in reading fluency, or that a more intensive subtitle intervention provided any additional benefit. We conclude that same-language subtitles are unlikely to improve children’s reading fluency. However, the primary school reading curriculum has a positive impact on reading fluency that can be observed over a relatively short time-scale.",

          "abstract": "Collecting intensive longitudinal data via methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is necessary to study dynamics in psychological constructs. However, detecting careless responding is more important than ever, as this methodology burdens participants more than traditional single survey studies. If undetected, careless responding reduces data quality and can lead to invalid findings by distorting correlations between items and constructs and compromising the psychometric properties of scales. In turn, this hinders progress toward cumulative psychological science. In recent years, several data-driven approaches have been proposed that assess whether an individual was attentive or careless for each timepoint-specific measurement after data collection. However, the variety and complexity of available methods can be overwhelming for researchers. In this paper, we summarized, applied, and compared 13 methods that flag careless responses in a rich EMA dataset from the WARN-D study with 206,318 observations (from n = 1194 participants). Together with our detailed supplementary tutorials, the paper serves as a guide for researchers to evaluate and report careless responding in their own data. At the same time, we show that the development of methods for careless responding detection is still in its early stages, as the studied approaches produced very different results. We provide recommendations for which methods are currently most promising based on our findings and discuss important next steps in validating them empirically.",

          "abstract": "Musical training is associated with improved cognitive and academic performance across development. While specific neural mechanisms have been implicated in these associations, the precise relationship between white matter structure and putative cognitive effects of musical training are unclear. The present study examined the effects of musical training on cognitive performance and white matter structure in middle childhood using a combination of behavioral assessments and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a sample of 175 preadolescents (38 musicians and 137 non-musicians) between 7-9 years old.  Cognitive abilities were tested using the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III) and the Operation Span Task (OSPAN), while academic achievement was assessed using the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA II). In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by measuring maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). Behavioral results revealed that participants with musical training had higher cognitive scores (F(15, 155) = 3.01, p &lt; 0.001), greater academic achievement (F(14, 156) = 3.57, p &lt; 0.001), and higher relative VO2 max (F(1, 170) = 6.32, p = 0.01) compared to non-musicians. DTI results revealed that musical training was associated with higher fractional anisotropy (F(1, 81) = 4.95, p = 0.029) and higher mode (F(1, 81) = 4.00, p = 0.049) in the left PCG to MTGp tract of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). Together, these results provide both behavioral and neural evidence for the relationship between musical training and cognition in a large sample of preadolescents.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and wearable devices afford opportunities to collect real-time data on events experienced in daily life. Examples of event-based data in the psychological and behavioral sciences include smoking a cigarette, experiencing a stressor, having a disruption to sleep, experiencing a depressive or manic episode, drinking an alcoholic beverage, or engaging in a bout of exercise. The increasing availability of dense sampling approaches allows for the measurement of such events at relatively fast time-scales (e.g., occurring across minutes, hours, days, or weeks), expanding the possibilities for how time can be conceptualized and modeled. Survival analysis is a modeling approach that allows researchers to address scientific questions regarding whether and when events occur in time. Although not often applied to EMA data, there are myriad research questions relevant to psychosocial and behavioral scientists which can be addressed using survival analysis. This article provides an overview of survival analysis, describes several time-based considerations for modeling event-based EMA data using survival analysis, and provides several illustrative examples of the different time-based considerations. Altogether, the goals of this article are to enhance knowledge of the types of research questions that can be examined using survival analysis, to illustrate nuances of applying the method to EMA data, and to spark ideas for future empirical and methodological research.",

          "abstract": "Sensory processing differences are increasingly recognized as a clinically meaningful feature of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with implications for motor control and gait. This study examined how sensory load and rhythmic cues affect gait cadence in adults with ADHD using a virtual reality (VR) paradigm. 28 adults with ADHD and 28 non-ADHD controls walked under systematically varied auditory and visual sensory loads, as well as rhythmic versus non-rhythmic conditions. Analyses revealed a significant interaction between sensory load and diagnosis: individuals with ADHD exhibited a greater decrease in cadence with increasing sensory load than their non-ADHD controls. Auditory load produced the strongest effects, consistent with evidence of atypical auditory filtering in ADHD. Rhythmic cues facilitated gait entrainment in controls to a greater extent than in those with ADHD, reflecting documented deficits in temporal processing and beat perception. These findings highlight that high sensory loads disrupt, rather than support, gait in ADHD, and that rhythm’s positive effect on cadence is not observed in ADHD to the same extent as in those without ADHD. By leveraging VR, this study extends motor findings in pediatric ADHD to adults, underscoring the role of sensory integration in everyday motor function.",

          "abstract": "Individualism-Collectivism (I-C), a key concept in cross-cultural research and one of the most studied context variables in personality, social, and developmental psychology, is often treated as synonymous with Hofstede’s pioneering nation scores. Concerns are growing about these scores’ validity, but subsequent research has not produced a widely accepted alternative. In Study 1, we systematically evaluated Hofstede’s I-C index, revealing inferior convergent and nomological validity compared to subsequent measures. Specific biases in Hofstede’s scores overestimate the individualism of English-speaking countries and collectivism of East Asian societies, which may perpetuate cultural stereotypes and underpin flawed theorizing. We illustrate how applying Hofstede’s scores can bias research findings. In Study 2, we aimed to develop an authoritative, theory-driven I-C index, using nationally representative data from the World Values Survey and European Values Study, covering 102 countries/territories inhabited by an estimated 88% of the world’s population. Our index shows excellent internal coherence and temporal stability and outperforms Hofstede’s I-C in associations with a nomological network of 28 societal indicators theoretically linked to I-C. We argue for an overdue paradigm shift in cross-cultural research: scholars should rely on theoretically appropriate and up-to-date measures of societal culture when seeking to understand global variation in human psychological functioning.",

          "abstract": "Recent research suggests that volitional personality change is possible through structured interventions, yet little is known about the temporal dynamics of such change. In psychotherapy, sudden gains—abrupt, substantial improvements between sessions—are robust predictors of treatment success. Based on 448 participants who completed a 12-week personality intervention, we examined whether similar sudden shifts occur in the context of volitional personality change and whether they explain differences in trait, life satisfaction, and self-esteem changes from the pre-test to the follow-up 3 months later. We compared four different measures for detecting shifts: daily and weekly personality states, generic change factors (e.g., gaining insight), and subjective progress. Sudden gains were relatively common and—with the exception of daily states—consistently associated with improvements in the targeted traits, life satisfaction, and self-esteem. Sudden gains in weekly states co-occurred with increased intervention engagement and key change processes such as gaining insight and practicing new behaviors—paralleling mechanisms found in psychotherapy. In contrast, sudden losses were less frequent and showed no meaningful negative effects for trait changes or life satisfaction. However, high dropout rates may have masked more consequential losses. These findings challenge the assumption that personality change is exclusively gradual and underscore the value of capturing dynamic, within-person fluctuations. Monitoring and leveraging such shifts may help to personalize interventions and optimize their impact. Future research should explore how sudden gains can be intentionally triggered and how interventions can be designed to support lasting change through both gradual and sudden pathways.",

          "abstract": "Language production in clinical populations varies not only by neurological condition but also by the type of discourse task used during assessment. This study introduces a detailed analysis of connected speech production tasks—Narrative, Procedural, and Picture-based—conducted in etiologically heterogeneous patient groups with neurological damage, namely, 1,394 individuals with Left and Right Hemisphere Damage (LHD, RHD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), dementia, and healthy controls. Drawing on over 290 linguistic features spanning phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, lexicon, and readability, we conducted a large-scale analysis of spoken texts using mixed-effects models to isolate the effects of diagnosis, task, and their interaction. Results revealed that task type exerts a pervasive influence on linguistic output, significantly interacting with diagnostic group across nearly all linguistic domains. Narrative tasks elicited more complex syntax and aspectual morphology, while procedural and descriptive tasks prompted simpler grammatical structures and greater lexical diversity, respectively. To explore high-dimensional linguistic patterns visually, we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), which revealed clear clustering of observations according to task type. The spatial arrangement of clusters reflected a continuum of contextual constraint: from highly structured picture description tasks (e.g., Cookie Theft), through procedural instruction tasks (e.g., sandwich-making), to conversational speech and open-ended narratives (e.g., accounts of brain injury, recovery, or illness). This gradient likely corresponds to increasing cognitive–linguistic demands, with unstructured tasks requiring greater topic generation, discourse planning, and memory retrieval. Crucially, the interaction between task and diagnosis modulates how underlying impairments manifest, indicating that linguistic deficits are not uniformly expressed across tasks. This challenges the validity of task-agnostic assessment and analysis practices, as well as normative comparisons. We propose a task-specific framework for clinical language assessment, enabling more precise identification of linguistic impairments and informing targeted therapeutic interventions. Our findings underscore the necessity of accounting for task effects in both clinical evaluation and the development of computational tools for neurogenic language disorders.",

          "abstract": "Human–AI co-creativity is often understood through a tool-use or collaboration frame, obscuring the relational dynamics of artistic practice with machine learning (ML) systems. To advance the field, we recast such artistic practice through Material Engagement Theory (MET), emphasizing how creative and aesthetic processes emerge in sustained relations between artist and system. We examined 18 contemporary artists’ engagements with ML from 54 documents using a qualitative, interpretive, and framework-guided approach. Our findings show how artists and ML systems co-constitute creative and aesthetic properties by mutually discovering and attuning to each other’s affordances, where creativity unfolds along a control-chance continuum driven by creative and aesthetic thinging, enabling a mutual aesthetic becoming through sustained interaction. Key factors include developing artistic intuition for ML, internalisation, and the evolving role of the meta-artist. Herewith, we contribute MET as a framework for enriching our understanding of human–AI co-creativity as emergent and relational.",

          "abstract": "Problematic smartphone use (PSU) is an increasing concern for adolescent mental health. This three-wave longitudinal study examined PSU trajectories and psychosocial predictors in 416 Polish adolescents (ages 11–18) across one academic year. Latent class growth analysis compared one- to four-class models; a three-class solution provided the best fit: High-Stable (persistently elevated Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale [SABAS] scores; n = 97), Mid-Stable (moderate, stable; n = 235), and Low-Decreasing (elevated baseline with decline; n = 84). Across waves, 20–22% met the SABAS cutoff, with higher prevalence among girls. Between-class comparisons showed clear psychosocial differentiation: the Low-Decreasing group reported the poorest adjustment (greater emotion regulation difficulties, higher anxiety, lower well-being), whereas the High-Stable group showed the most adaptive profile. In multinomial logistic regression, emotion regulation difficulties uniquely predicted higher odds of belonging to Mid-Stable (RRR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.04, 1.10]) and Low-Decreasing (RRR = 1.10, 95% CI [1.06, 1.13]) relative to High-Stable, while other predictors were nonsignificant. Sensitivity analyses with posterior-probability weighting yielded the same inferences. Findings indicate heterogeneous PSU courses in adolescence and highlight emotion regulation as a key differentiator of risk profiles. Results support integrating emotion-focused strategies into prevention and demonstrate the value of person-centered, longitudinal designs.",

This study investigated potential PPPT factors in FS and FMS separately.  \n\nMethods: Two hundred participants (FS=50, FMS=50, individuals with anxiety and/or depression [CC]=50, healthy controls [HC]=50) completed an in-depth medical history interview and online questionnaires to assess self-reported potential aetiological factors including traumatic/adverse life events, alexithymia, autistic traits, psychological and physical symptoms, illness perceptions, cognitive-behavioural responses, and outcome measures of general functioning, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL).  \n\nOutcomes: Participants with FS more frequently reported traumatic/adverse events and psychopathology (e.g., dissociation, PTSD) as illness causes/precipitating factors, and sensory symptom triggers, relative to FMS and/or CCs. In contrast, participants with FMS endorsed physical illness causes/precipitating factors, and physical activity and emotion-related symptom triggers, more frequently than FS and/or CCs. Physical and dissociative symptoms were elevated, alongside reductions in HRQoL and general functioning, in FS/FMS compared to CCs/HCs. Greater current, threatening illness-related beliefs and cognitions were disclosed in FS/FMS compared to CCs. Negative associations between HRQoL, cognitive-behavioural responses, and traumatic/adverse events were also seen in FS/FMS.  \n\nInterpretation: Distinct biopsychosocial factors may be involved in the development and maintenance of FS and FMS: traumatic events and psychopathology in FS, and physical illness/injury, physical functioning, and alexithymia in FMS. Unhelpful illness-related beliefs, and impacts on HRQoL and general functioning, are shared between these subtypes. The results of this study provide insight into potential subtype-specific characteristics of FS/FMS, with implications for treatment.  \n\nFunding: The study is funded by an MRC Career Development Award to SP [MR/V032771/1].

          "abstract": "Personality pathology presents unique challenges in adolescence, a critical period for developing social autonomy and complex peer relationships. Yet, little research examines how these vulnerabilities unfold in daily life. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment (AA) study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female) aged 12–21, capturing 13,190 interactions over 14 days. Using Contemporary Interpersonal Theory and the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we modeled links between personality pathology, perceptions of others’ and participants’ interpersonal behavior, and mentalizing. Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM) revealed that personality pathology was associated with lower daily social satisfaction in youth. Self-reports linked pathology to reduced perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, personality pathology was not associated with lower average mentalization but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Higher pathology strengthened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance, driven by Antagonism, while Psychoticism showed the reverse pattern, weakening this association. Detachment reduced the association of mentalizing and perceived warmth, and negative affectivity weakened the link between mentalizing and enacted dominance. Findings highlight the dynamic nature of interpersonal dysfunction in adolescent personality pathology. Recognizing maladaptive patterns early may guide interventions that stabilize social interactions and promote mentalizing in ways that foster connection rather than control, reducing long-term challenges.",

          "abstract": "Adults are adept at metacognitively monitoring their memory accuracy explicitly and implicitly, and at using metacognitive control to maintain high memory accuracy, but the development of monitoring and control is less understood. We administered an episodic cued recall task with children aged five to 11 years (N = 106). Participants watched two video clips of everyday episodic events before answering cued recall memory questions. For each memory question, participants provided a confidence rating (explicit monitoring), sorted their answer into show/hide boxes (control), and chose to volunteer/withhold their response (control). Multiple behavioural gestures of cognitive effort (implicit monitoring; e.g., looking to carer, non-word fillers) were recorded and later coded by blind raters. Children were less accurate and less able to assign confidence to reflect their memory accuracy when they were forced to generate a response after previously saying “I don’t know”. But on volunteered trials, explicit, implicit monitoring and control measures predicted memory accuracy. There were age-related improvements in explicit monitoring for predicting memory accuracy, but there were no age differences in implicit monitoring or control processes. We found evidence for a direct and an indirect link between confidence and memory accuracy. Our findings suggest that explicit and implicit monitoring have different developmental trajectories in cued recall and that children can be adaptive to control their memory accuracy to a similar extent from early- to mid-childhood.",

We understood that managing diabetes could be challenging, especially dealing with painful insulin injections and strict food rules. By talking with children and young people, we sought to learn more about their needs and what mattered most to them in terms of research. \nMethods: This study was conducted by Diabetes UK in collaboration with the University of East London to understand what children and young people with type 1 diabetes need to better take care of themselves. The study involved 21 participants aged 6 to 17 from England, Wales, and Scotland. We conducted focus groups with children and young people, as well as separate proxy focus groups with parents/guardians of the youngest research participants. The parent/guardian focus groups supplemented the evidence from the children’s focus groups, with the study prioritizing the voices of children and young people, to explore the challenges they faced in managing diabetes at home, school, and during leisure activities.\nResults: Our study revealed significant issues in diabetes management across different age groups: 6–8-year-olds prioritize research for managing glucose levels at home, and educating catering assistants about diabetes; 9–11-year-olds prioritize easier-to-change pumps, and educating friends about diabetes; 12–14-year-olds focus on educating teachers, creating safe spaces for managing hypoglycaemia, and raising awareness about sports and mood fluctuations; 15–17-year-olds seek to reduce the burden of educating others about diabetes in school.\nConclusions: This study is significant for future research and practice because it provides valuable insights that will guide future work in supporting children and young people with type 1 diabetes. By understanding their needs and priorities, we can develop strategies and policies that align with their lifestyles and expectations. This, in turn, will help them better manage their condition, reduce the risk of health crises, and improve their overall well-being as they grow older with diabetes.",

          "abstract": "Missing data frequently occur in longitudinal designs and are commonly addressed using multiple imputation (MI), either in the form of multilevel MI, which treats repeated measures as nested within participants, or single-level MI, which treats repeated measures as separate variables. Previous research has shown that both approaches can perform well in applications of latent curve models (LCMs) in which the assumptions underlying multilevel MI are met. Using two simulation studies, we extend prior work in two directions: (1) to applications of single-indicator LCMs in which the assumptions of multilevel MI are violated, and (2) to multiple-indicator designs, in which multilevel MI can be challenging to implement and single-level MI may be computationally unstable due to the large number of variables. Results indicate that single-level MI provides the most accurate results in the contexts studied here, especially in conditions in which common implementations of multilevel MI are misspecified, and that large numbers of variables can be accommodated in single-level MI by employing dimension reduction techniques such as partial least squares. We also discuss the implications of these findings for applied research and illustrate the application of these methods with an empirical example.",

This question could be probed by asking individuals to define their understanding of loneliness. Using a meta-synthesis analytic approach on data from four studies which elicited such definitions from distinct populations, we report cross-study consensus on three characteristics of loneliness: its negative emotional valence; its standing as a consequence of 1) absence of genuine social connection, and of 2) lack of receipt of adequate social support. Other characteristics of loneliness are described for which there was not cross-study consensus. We conclude that there may be characteristics of loneliness which apply across multiple contexts, although we acknowledge the limited reach of our data.

In contrast, we present four experiments using the picture–word interference (PWI) task in which joint action removed cognitive interference and facilitated performance. In the standard PWI task performed alone, participants respond to target pictures while ignoring distractor words written on top. If picture–word pairs are related (e.g., apple–orange) then responses are slowed compared to when they are unrelated (e.g., apple–book), known as semantic interference. In our joint version of the task, we removed semantic interference by telling participants they would be collaborating with a partner who was responsible for the distractor words (Experiment 1, N = 77). Furthermore, interference was only removed when participants believed that their partner was responding specifically to the words (Experiment 2, N = 78), was perceived as high in social status (Experiment 3, N = 80), or high in task competence (Experiment 4, N = 76). We propose this demonstrates how people can de-prioritise information associated with partners on shared tasks. In doing so, they can reduce their own cognitive demands by leveraging the cognitive resources of others to support an efficient division-of-cognitive-labour. We term this social offloading.",

          "authors": "Josianne Kollmann; Sophie Charlotte Reckels; Nadja Contzen",
          "abstract": "Microplastics contaminate the environment, including water, soil, and air, and have also been found in the human body. Currently, however, there is only scientific evidence of a danger to aquatic ecosystems at high concentrations of microplastics, but no evidence of a present danger to human health. Based on the high level of scientific uncertainty and the assumed temporal distance of negative consequences due to the increasing pollution of microplastics, it could be assumed that people perceive a high psychological distance regarding microplastics pollution, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions. Moreover, an additional dimension, namely biological distance, might be relevant in this context, as, to date, the evidence suggests a danger only to aquatic ecosystems but not humans. This study therefore investigated the perceived psychological distance of microplastics pollution on the four conventional dimensions (spatial, social, temporal, hypothetical distance), and on the proposed biological dimension. Additionally, it was investigated whether psychological distance can explain public concern about microplastics pollution for oneself, for others, and for nature, and whether psychological distance can, either directly or mediated by concern, explain people’s willingness to engage in mitigation activities, specifically their behavioural intentions to reduce pollution and their willingness to pay for mitigation policies. This was analysed in an online sample of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 707) using Structural Equation Modelling. The results showed that, on average, a low distance towards microplastics pollution was perceived, particularly on the hypothetical and temporal dimensions, contrasting the current scientific evidence. Further, lower psychological distance was associated with greater concern for oneself, for others, and for nature, as well as with higher behavioural intention to reduce pollution, both directly and mediated by concern for nature. Willingness to pay, however was only explained by psychological distance but not by concern. Overall, the findings show that low perceived psychological distance can explain public concern regarding microplastics pollution, and that it may motivate people to engage in mitigation activities, even if they are not concerned about themselves or humans in general. Yet, the study also indicates that, next to concern, other factors might play a role in mediating the relationship between psychological distance and willingness to engage in mitigation activities.",

          "abstract": "Background and aims. Problematic technology use (PTU), often referred to as digital addictions, includes excessive use of online pornography, social media, the Internet in general, smartphones, and gaming. Although research on PTU is expanding, nationally representative data on prevalence, co-occurrence, and psychosocial predictors remain limited, particularly in Central Europe. This study examined these aspects in a representative sample of Polish adults.\nMethods. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among a nationwide random quota sample of 2,122 adults (aged 19–98 years; 47.3% male). PTU was assessed across five domains: online pornography (BPS), social media (BSMAS), general Internet use (s-IAT), smartphones (SABAS), and gaming (GDT). Psychological predictors included social support (MSPSS), basic psychological needs (BPNSFS), loneliness (R-UCLA-SF), and self-control (BSCS). Psychopathological symptoms were measured with the GAD-7 (anxiety) and PHQ-2 (depression).\nResults. Prevalence estimates indicated the highest rates of problematic online pornography use (22%), followed by social media (7%), general Internet use (6%), smartphones (5%), and gaming (3%). Men showed significantly higher rates of problematic pornography use and gaming. Latent class analysis identified three subgroups: Class 1 (n = 1,944; 91.6%) with uniformly low probabilities of PTU, Class 2 (n = 146; 6.9%) marked by problematic pornography and Internet use, and Class 3 (n = 32; 1.5%) characterized by problematic social media, smartphone, and Internet use. High social support and low needs fulfillment predicted membership in class 2, while loneliness, low self-control, anxiety, and depression predicted both problematic co-occurrence classes.\nConclusions. PTU is prevalent and heterogeneous in Polish adults, with distinct co-occurrence profiles linked to psychosocial and psychopathological vulnerabilities. Findings highlight the need for integrated prevention and intervention strategies addressing both psychosocial factors and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Instagram is one of the most widely used social media platforms worldwide and its impact on mental health has become a major research topic. While many studies focus on frequency or duration of use, little is known about the role of motivations for using Instagram in relation to internalizing complaints such as depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study investigated how different motivations and intensity of Instagram use relate to internalizing complaints in young adults. A total of 459 participants aged 18 to 35 years completed questionnaires measuring depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms, five motivations for using Instagram (social interaction, archiving, self-expression, escapism, and peeking), and three intensity-of-use dimensions (persistence, boredom, and overuse). Bayesian network analyses were used to model conditional dependencies, and Directed Acyclic Graphs were used to explore potential causal pathways between Instagram motivations, intensity-of-use metrics, and internalizing complaints. Results indicated that internalizing complaints were not directly linked to intensity of use, yet had clear associations with specific motivations. Depressive symptoms were negatively associated with social interaction motives and positively associated with escapism. Exploratory causal modelling suggested that higher internalizing complaints may increase the motivation to use Instagram as a form of escapism. These findings underscore the importance of considering motivational factors, rather than only time or frequency, in understanding the complex relationship between Instagram use and mental health.",

          "authors": "Haijiao Cui; Liu-Fang Zhou",
          "abstract": "Affective adaptation and construction are fundamental psychological processes shaped by multiple interacting factors, including reference points, stimulus inherent value, attention, negativity bias, adaptation rate, and time. While decades of research have underscored the importance of these factors, a unified theoretical framework that quantifies their complex interactions—and their cumulative impact on affective responses—remains lacking. To address this gap, we propose ARIA (Attention–Reference Interaction Adaptation), a computational framework that describes how the brain dynamically generates affective responses to changing environments. ARIA posits that negativity bias, together with the inherent values of both the current stimulus and relevant reference points, jointly determine attention allocation and adaptation rate. Additionally, the attention-capturing capacity of the current stimulus regulates the adaptation rate. As a result, affective responses are constructed based on current external stimuli, internal psychological reference points formed by past experiences, and the cognitive processes that mediate the interaction between them. By integrating multiple psychological mechanisms (reference-dependent evaluation, value-driven attention allocation, and negativity bias) into a single theoretical framework, ARIA offers a unified explanation for both classic affective phenomena (e.g., exponential decay of affect and affective after-reactions) and anomalous affective phenomena that existing theories have struggled to account for (e.g., environmental improvements do not necessarily induce pleasure). Simulations based on ARIA reveal the adaptive and dynamic nature of affective responses, providing theoretical guidance for fields such as built-environment management, user-experience design, behavioral economics, affective computing, and emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Research on internet use and mental health has often focused narrowly on screen time, overlooking the differential effects of how much and how the internet is used. Emerging evidence suggests that the quality of online engagement (types and purposes of use) and its interaction with problematic internet use (PIU) may provide a more nuanced explanation of psychological outcomes. Hence, this study examined how the quantity and quality of internet use relate to well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress, with various mediators and moderators. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 493 college students in the two north-eastern states of India. Measures included the Adult Internet Usage Questionnaire, the Internet Addiction Test, the Mental Health Continuum, and the DASS-21. Data were analyzed using hierarchical regression and PROCESS Macro (v4.1) to test mediation and moderation models. \nResults: Quantity and quality of internet use did not uniformly predict psychological outcomes. PIU consistently mediated the relationship between both dimensions of internet use and well-being, depression, anxiety, and stress. While quality of use was directly associated with greater well-being, its effect on negative mental health outcomes was limited. Moderation analyses revealed that gender and quantity of use further shaped specific pathways, particularly in health-related and social network use. Conclusion:  The findings challenge the adequacy of screen-time metrics and underscore PIU as the central mechanism linking internet use to mental health. Interventions should focus on fostering purposeful engagement while preventing maladaptive usage patterns.",

          "abstract": "Affective variability is a pervasive phenomenon with important implications for well-being and psychopathology. Yet, the broad concept of “variability” may conflate distinct processes, such as transient fluctuations versus more sustained shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a mechanistic framework for these processes, but RL is often studied in artificial settings, raising questions about ecological validity.\nWe combined RL-based task measures with real-world experience sampling (ESM) from 339 participants. Using a computational model, we decomposed affective variability into short-lived “affective noise,” reflecting immediate reactivity to rewards, and longer-term “affective volatility,” reflecting sustained responses to past rewards. Task-derived noise was driven by recent outcomes, while volatility reflected more distant ones. Importantly, task-based noise and volatility selectively mapped onto their real-world ESM counterparts. These findings provide a mechanistic account of distinct reward-processing timescales underlying affective variability and demonstrate the ecological validity of laboratory tasks for studying real-world affect dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The wisdom-of-crowds effect relies on the independence of individual judgments, such that idiosyncratic errors cancel out when aggregated. Yet in online rating environments, social influence undermines this independence: individuals often conform to visible evaluations, reducing variance and degrading collective accuracy. Prior simulation studies have shown that conformity alone erodes accuracy. At the same time, research in consumer behavior highlights that individuals sometimes strategically diverge, particularly in identity-relevant domains. In this study, we integrate these perspectives by incorporating both conformity and contrarian behavior into agent-based simulations of product evaluation. We modelled sequential evaluations under two conditions: binary choice (K=2 items) and multi-item environments (K=50 items), closely following prior setups. Contrarian behavior was implemented as a probabilistic sign-flip of social influence, such that some agents deliberately chose against prevailing ratings. Across thousands of simulated trials, we observed that while pure conformity inflated error, and pure contrarianism was equally harmful, mixtures of the two produced a robust U-shaped relationship. Moderate diversity in strategies—some agents conforming, others diverging—yielded the lowest root mean squared error relative to ground truth. This demonstrates that diversity in strategies of preference expression, rather than cues or inference alone, can rescue the wisdom-of-crowds effect. These findings extend diversity research in collective intelligence by identifying strategic divergence as a functional contributor to accuracy. They also point to promising avenues for empirical validation, for example by linking product-domain differences in conformity versus divergence (hedonic vs. utilitarian goods) with aggregate performance.",

          "abstract": "Investigating how athletes navigate these decisions in tactical contexts can provide critical insights into their behavioral preferences and strategic tendencies under conditions of temporal delay and risk. To this end, the present study designed a risky intertemporal choice task simulating a pre-match tactical scenario, and introduced a monetary condition as a control, aiming to uncover the domain-specific temporal preferences of soccer players and the underlying computational mechanisms. In Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b (n = 95), participants completed a two-alternative risky intertemporal choices task. In both experiments, the proportion of choosing the “larger-later” (LL) option was below the chance level. However, participants made more LL choices and responded more slowly in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context, with no significant performance differences between participant types. Experiment 2 (n = 33) further validated the behavioral findings and revealed significantly higher exponential discount rates and starting point biases in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context. Additionally, stronger functional connectivity between the right postcentral gyrus and mid-cingulate cortex was observed during soccer tactical decision-making, and it is significantly positively correlated with the exponential discount rate. This study found that although soccer players exhibit delay discounting in tactical choices, they demonstrate a greater degree of rationality. This rationality may be related to how a higher discount rate induces starting point biases, affecting the accumulation of decision evidence. The underlying neural basis may involve integrative processing within the postcentral gyrus-cingulate circuit.",

Across three studies, we evaluate its feasibility and limitations. In Study 1, we show that large language models (LLMs) capture semantic similarities among Big Five measures, providing a basis for personality assignment. In Study 2, we create AI-Agents using prompts designed based on the Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in different format, and find that AI-Agents powered by new models align more closely with human responses on the Mini-Markers test, although the finer pattern of results (e.g., factor loading patterns) were sometimes inconsistent. In Study 3, we validate our AI-Agents on risk-taking and moral dilemma vignettes, finding that models prompted with the BFI-2-Expanded format most closely reproduce human personality-decision associations, while safety-aligned models generally inflate ‘moral’ ratings. Overall, our results show that AI-Agents align with humans in correlations between input Big Five traits and output responses and may serve as useful tools for preliminary research. Nevertheless, discrepancies in finer response patterns indicate that AI-Agents cannot (yet) fully substitute for human participants in precision or high-stakes projects.",

To find a solution to this, we established the Automated Identification of Moderate-to-Severe TBI (AIMS-TBI) challenge for MICCAI 2024. For this challenge, the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Brain Injury working group collated 1100 T1-w scans from individuals with ms-TBI across 12 sites.

For these analyses, 388 images were used in the training dataset, 101 for validation, and 275 for the final test set. During the validation phase, 12 submissions were received, and five teams submitted the final test set. To identify the algorithm that generated the most accurate lesion segmentation from the teams, four metrics were computed, including Dice score, absolute volume difference, absolute lesion count difference, and the lesion-wise F1 score.

Prospective and co-twin control analyses examined (a) cross-sectional and prospective links between cannabis use and STB, (b) whether these links persisted after adjusting for genetic and environmental confounds, and (c) whether middle-adulthood associations were moderated by legalized recreational cannabis.\n\nFindings: More frequent cannabis use was associated with elevated STB. After accounting for shared familial factors via co-twin control, this relationship remained significant in cross-sectional, but not prospective, analyses. In middle adulthood, associations between cannabis use and STB did not differ across states, regardless of recreational cannabis legalization status. \n\nInterpretation: Findings support a contemporaneous link between cannabis use and STB within twin pairs, potentially reflecting causal effects. However, the absence of a prospective within-pair association provides little support for the notion that cannabis use elevates future STB risk independent of familial liability. This pattern suggests causation may be limited to short-term effects, or that the cannabis-STB relationship may primarily reflect confounding by unmeasured time-varying factors (e.g., acute stressors).",

          "abstract": "The rise of online learning has transformed education beyond the classroom setting. In online education, it is popular to motivate learners through gamified learning activities. One common approach to gamification involves awarding points based on learners' performance to encourage them to engage in learning activities. However, designing an optimal point system is still an art rather than a science, and many point systems inadvertently incentivize unintended behaviors that hurt student learning. We propose a scalable computational method for designing point systems that avoid those pitfalls and motivate students to choose the activities they will learn from the most. Our method calculates a point system that aligns the learning activities' short-term appeal with their long-term learning benefits. This intelligent incentive system monitors learners' progress and adjusts the number of points the learner can earn for alternative activities accordingly. As a proof-of-concept, we applied our method to design an optimal point system for game-based second-language learning (\"approximated brain points\") and tested it in both a simulated language learning task and in Dawn of Civilization, an English learning application. The results of both experiments demonstrate that Brain Points effectively enhance learning outcomes and motivate students to practice skills they have not yet mastered. The successful proof-of-concept and the findings of our experiments highlight the potential of our method to design effective nudges for technology-enhanced learning.",

Prior studies often use material from different sound sources and provide response-label categories. Here, we use stimulus material from the dùndún drum–a speech surrogate that can signal either speech-related or musical content, rather unfamiliar to Western listeners. We first replicate standard speech-music categorization results (N=108). Then, we depart from the typical experimental procedure by asking new participants (N=180) to freely sort then label the stimulus material. Hierarchical clustering of participants’ stimulus groupings shows that the speech/music distinction emerges but is not primary. By reverse engineering the acoustic features and semantic labels underlying participants’ auditory categories, we provide an empirical argument for moderating the long-standing, but nevertheless disputable, perceptual salience of music and speech categories.",

Yet approximately 25% of patients drop out prematurely, reducing its effectiveness and public health impact. Despite this, few studies have contacted patients post-dropout to survey their reasons for dropout. Understanding the patient perspective is critical to identify barriers and inform strategies to improve treatment retention.\n \nObjective: This study investigated reasons for dropout from group CBT for anxiety and related disorders, quantitatively contrasting individual- versus treatment-related factors and qualitatively identifying themes in patients’ own words.\n \nMethods: Adult outpatients (N = 84) who discontinued a 12-session group CBT program at a tertiary-care clinic completed the Reasons for Leaving Treatment Questionnaire (RLTQ) and provided optional qualitative feedback. A mixed-methods approach was employed: a paired-samples t test examined quantitative differences between individual-level and treatment-related factors, and qualitative responses (N = 36) underwent inductive thematic analysis.\n \nResults: On average, participants discontinued group CBT at session 5. Individual-level factors were more significantly endorsed than treatment-related factors as reasons for dropout. Qualitative analyses identified eight themes, with four major themes: (1) lack of relevance to specific issues/needs, (2) discomfort with group format and/or dynamics, (3) issues with facilitators and/or treatment organization, and (4) issues with CBT content, pace, structure, and/or length.\n \nConclusion: Findings indicate that dropout is influenced not only by individual-level factors but also by modifiable treatment-related factors, pointing to actionable dropout-prevention strategies—including personalization, cohesion-building, shorter waitlists, and re-engagement after missed sessions.",

          "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO), a pervasive psychological phenomenon characterized by the distressing perception that others are engaging in rewarding experiences from which one is absent, is increasingly relevant in the workplace. This study investigates both general and workplace FoMO across three culturally distinct countries: Poland, China, and the United States, focusing on their relationships with job satisfaction and alternative job search. Online survey data (N = 626) revealed unexpected cross-country differences: Poland reported the highest general FoMO, while China reported the highest workplace FoMO. Moreover, general FoMO negatively predicted job satisfaction, particularly among individuals who viewed their jobs as personally undesirable. Contrary to expectations, workplace FoMO positively predicted job satisfaction, especially for those in roles perceived as less desirable, suggesting that FoMO may function as a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, workplace FoMO positively predicted alternative job search, while general FoMO did not. A mediation analysis showed that job satisfaction indirectly buffered the link between workplace FoMO and job search behavior. These findings underscore the complex, context-dependent nature of FoMO in professional settings and offer practical implications for managing digital engagement and employee retention in increasingly connected workplaces.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

Unlike standard static benchmarks, our approach models human–AI performance as a joint process, capturing both user-specific factors and moment-to-moment fluctuations. We validate the framework by applying it to human–AI benchmark data (n=667) and find significant synergy. We demonstrate that collaboration ability is distinct from individual problem-solving ability. Users better able to infer and adapt to others’ perspectives achieve superior collaborative performance with AI–but not when working alone. Moreover, moment-to-moment fluctuations in perspective taking influence AI response quality, highlighting the role of dynamic user factors in collaboration. By introducing a principled framework to analyze data from human-AI collaboration, interactive benchmarks can better complement current single-task benchmarks and crowd-assessment methods. This work informs the design and training of language models that transcend static prompt benchmarks to achieve adaptive, socially aware collaboration with diverse and dynamic human partners.",

          "authors": "Santiago Castiello; Andrew R Delamater",
          "abstract": "During category learning tasks participants often group together, i.e., “commonly code,” within-category exemplars. In two experiments, human participants learned to classify fractal exemplars into two arbitrarily-defined categories. After an initial learning phase, we reversed the exemplar-category assignments in two ways: a Total-Reversal task (all assignments were switched) and a Partial-Reversal task (only half were switched). If common coding occurs, participants should learn the Total-Reversal faster than the Partial-Reversal and should show within-category interference in the Partial-Reversal task (between reversed and nonreversed exemplars). Our behavioral results supported these predictions. Using multidimensional scaling methods, an additional experiment determined that our fractal exemplars were grouped through category learning rather than perceptual processes. To understand the mechanisms behind these findings, we modeled category learning with a 3-layered artificial neural network (ANN). We observed that such models can readily form category representations, but suffer from catastrophic interference during reversal training. To overcome this problem, we modified the network by applying different dynamic learning rates to its different layers. Inspired by associative learning theories (Mackintosh, 1975; Pearce and Hall, 1980), we incorporated a mechanism that promotes slower weight changes in the input-hidden layer and faster changes in the hidden-output layer as the ANN learns the task. This modified ANN successfully simulated our empirical findings, demonstrating that applying differential dynamic learning rates can help prevent catastrophic interference problems and provide a mechanistic explanation for common coding effects. Our study highlights the importance of associative mechanisms in category learning.",

          "abstract": "Background. The integration of AI-based digital technologies in mental healthcare represents a transformative shift, especially with regards to chatbots, and avatar-based interventions. A central component of the success of AI-based digital mental health interventions has to do with the level of acceptance of this new technology; the degree to which stakeholders perceive a technology as useful, user-friendly, and worth adopting. We aimed to establish the level of acceptance of AI-based digital mental health interventions (AI chatbot, AI avatar-based interventions) compared to the acceptance levels of teletherapy via videoconferencing among clinicians, patients, and a representative community sample (i.e., potential future patients). We also explored the extent to which these difference towards these technologies might be explained by individuals’ attitudes towards AI in general. \nMethods. Clinicians (N= 658), patients (N= 451), and US census-based community sample (N= 520) completed standardized measures of everyday artificial intelligence use, general attitudes towards AI, and acceptability of digital technology use for mental health interventions.  \nResults. We found that community participants are most optimistic about AI-based mental health tools (chatbots and avatars), whereas clinicians consistently express more skepticism, especially regarding usability. General attitudes toward AI (both positive and negative) play a major role in shaping acceptance of chatbot and avatar-based interventions, often more than their professional role or demographic identity. \nDiscussion. These findings might carry clinical implications for the design, deployment, and integration of these technologies into mental health services.",

Two experiments tested Mandarin speakers with no knowledge of EP on disyllabic nonce words differing in syllable weight. In Experiment 1, participants were better at identifying final stress when the final syllable was heavier. They also showed a gradient pattern: responses were most accurate for diphthongs (CVV), followed by nasal codas (CVC), and least accurate for light CV syllables. Experiment 2 confirmed the gradient effect only when orthography was present, not with auditory input alone. These results underscore the multimodal nature of L2 phonological acquisition and reveal that orthography can trigger nonnative sensitivity to phonological weight in stress perception.",

          "abstract": "Creative cognition is often argued to involve a degree of inhibitory control, but it remains unclear what amount, and type, of inhibitory control is relevant to which type of creative cognition. Some evidence suggests that creative performance benefits from stronger inhibition (particularly in laboratory settings), while other evidence suggests that it benefits from weaker inhibition. Supposing that this variation in findings might be due to the multifaceted nature of both inhibitory control and creative cognition, we sought to clarify the relationship between these constructs using several measures of each, using factor analysis and regressions. We examined creative cognition using two measures of divergent thinking (the alternative uses task and a figural completion drawing task), and a measure of convergent thinking (the remote associates test). We examined inhibitory control using two measures of response inhibition (the Stroop and the Emotional Stroop), a measure of cognitive inhibition (retrieval-induced forgetting), and a measure of latent inhibition. Participants (N = 151) also completed measures of personality, intelligence, self-monitoring, and real-world creative achievement. Results revealed that cognitive inhibition was a significant predictor of divergent thinking after accounting for both trait openness and fluid intelligence, but was unrelated to convergent thinking or real-world creative achievement. Meanwhile, response inhibition and latent inhibition were not significantly related to any measure of creative cognition. These findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between inhibitory control and creative cognition, and highlight the importance of assessing these multifaceted constructs with a variety of measures.",

          "abstract": "The developmental literature testifies to young children’s remarkable communicative skills in language and gesture, but much less is known about the domain of graphical communication. In three coordinated studies with identical procedures, young children’s ability to spontaneously comprehend unfamiliar graphic symbols was tested in a simple object-choice task across a wide variety of symbol-referent relationships. In four conditions per study, reference was established via representation, part-whole relationships, analogies in size, number and form but also gestalt-like principles such as orientation, alignment or figure-ground relationships. The samples comprise German-speaking children continuously spread from the third to the seventh birthday (Study 1, N = 106; Study 2, N = 99; Study 3, N = 99). While children are generally able to use direct representations to identify the correct target item already prior to their third birthday, group-level success in all other conditions was observed later, but well before school age. Converging results from conditions employing several abstract and conceptual symbol-referent relationships point to a qualitative shift in symbolic competence around the fourth birthday. Together, this set of studies explores the conceptual continuum from iconic to abstract graphical representations and, therein, provides one of the most comprehensive, robust and systematic investigations of young children’s ability to find meaning in unfamiliar graphic symbols - a largely unexplored component of emerging literacy.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions play a central role in regulating affect and physiological arousal, with familiar and supportive relationships often associated with reduced anxiety and adaptive autonomic responses. However, it remains unclear whether individuals with depression benefit similarly from these so-called social buffering effects in everyday life. The present study examined momentary anxiety and cardiovascular responses (heart rate [HR] and heart rate variability [HRV]) during real-life social interactions in patients suffering from depression (N = 57) and matched healthy controls (N = 57). Participants reported on the familiarity and the gender of social interaction partners and the interaction context across five days, while a subsample also wore ambulatory electrocardiogram sensors. Across the patient and control group, higher interaction partner familiarity was associated with reduced state anxiety. However, only controls reported lower social interaction anxiety with increasing familiarity, indicating that the benefits of familiar social contexts only partially extends to clinical populations and that social interaction anxiety might be driven by depression-specific cognitive biases and affective patterns. State social interaction anxiety was higher in controls when they interacted with female interaction partners, while there were no differences for patients. Regarding autonomic responses, patients exhibited higher baseline and state HR and lower baseline and state HRV compared to controls, consistent with autonomic dysregulation. We also observed lower HRs in opposite-gender interactions among controls but not among patients. Overall, these findings suggest that familiar social interactions can reduce general state anxiety in both patients with depression and healthy controls, whereas social interaction anxiety and autonomic responses appear to be less strongly influenced by familiarity or the gender of interaction partners in patients. This research offers insights into how everyday social environments might support emotion regulation in clinical populations.",

We randomly assigned adults to auditory, visual, audiovisual, or control training groups using a validated protocol adapted across modalities, and assessed emotion recognition using auditory, visual, and audiovisual tests. Responses were scored with a similarity-based metric, and change was indexed with a normalized gain difference score. Primary analyses tested training-group effects on overall and modality-specific difference scores and evaluated cross-modal generalization (improvement on untrained modalities) and trained-modality advantage (improvement on the trained modality relative to the other two). All trained groups showed reliable pre- to post-test improvement across modalities. Between-group comparisons indicated that the auditory group outperformed control on the overall measure, and the audiovisual group outperformed control on the audiovisual task. Cross-modal generalization was evident in every trained group and absent in control, indicating transfer beyond the trained modality. Trained-modality advantage was not detected, suggesting more generalized training benefits. An exploratory comparison of basic and social emotions revealed a main effect of emotion type, without differences by training condition. Taken together, the results indicate that brief training strengthens perceptual cue use and cue integration, yielding gains within and across modalities. Practically, training programs that include audiovisual components may maximize benefits while also supporting generalization beyond the trained setting.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to develop and validate the Wise Emotion Regulation Ability (WERA) scale—a brief, seven-item measure designed to assess core components of effective wise emotion regulation. Drawing on the PoWER model (Ford &amp; Gross, 2019), which conceptualizes emotion regulation as a process involving situation-sensitive identification, adaptation, and management, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted on data from 152 working adults. Results supported a three-factor structure—Emotional Adaptation, Emotional Identification, and Emotional Self-Management—with excellent model fit: χ²(11) = 7.17, p = .785; CFI = 1.00; TLI = 1.06; RMSEA = 0.000; SRMR = 0.037. The three-factor model significantly outperformed a one-factor alternative (Δχ²(3) = 18.72, p &lt; .001), confirming the multidimensionality of the construct. While most standardized loadings exceeded .50, one item (WERA1) showed a weaker loading (β = .255), warranting future refinement. Internal consistency for each subscale was acceptable (ω = .54–.62), although average variance extracted (AVE) values fell below the recommended threshold, reflecting the brief nature of each factor. Discriminant validity was supported via the Fornell-Larcker criterion and HTMT analysis. The WERA scale offers a practical, low-burden tool for researchers and practitioners to assess emotion regulation in workplace and organizational contexts. Limitations include modest sample size and reliance on self-report data. Future research should explore predictive and test-retest validity in broader populations.

          "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract regularities from sensory input, is hypothesized to play a major role in many aspects of higher-level cognition. While earlier investigations centered on group-level effects, a growing body of research now focuses on individual differences in this ability. This consensus paper presents the collective insights of 27 researchers worldwide who are active in the field of individual differences in SL, with the goal of reflecting on the field’s progress so far while outlining key challenges going forward. Our discussion covers possible theoretical and operational definitions of SL, the trade-offs between controlled laboratory tasks and ecologically valid paradigms, considerations in interpreting correlations between SL performance and other cognitive abilities, issues of measurement reliability and statistical power, and rationales for adopting individual-differences versus group-level approaches. Based on these discussions, we outline nine actionable recommendations for the field to move forward, which are meant to lead to a new body of evidence that is more theoretically informed and more methodologically robust.",

          "authors": "Laure Debroux; Christine Bastin; Emma Delhaye",
          "abstract": "Objective: Episodic memory naturally declines with age. The method of loci is an encoding\nstrategy that has been shown to enhance episodic memory. However, it relies heavily on\nassociative memory, as it consists in associating each item of a to-be-learnt list with a location\nalong a familiar route, and associative memory is thought to be the source of the episodic age-related decline. However, when associative memory is supported by semantic knowledge, older\nadults can compensate for this decline. This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci,\nthat we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory, to improve episodic\nmemory in aging. Methods: Word recall performance of young (18–30 years old) and older\n(60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci\nunder two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a\ncontrol condition. Results: The results showed significant memory performance improvement\nin both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, in\nolder adults, performance in the incongruent condition did not improve compared with that\nobserved during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic\nlinks for associative memory. Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent\nassociations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was\nnot the case with incongruent associations. Conclusions: The method of loci applied in\nconditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for\nolder adults.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data collection methods like the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) and Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) are used to repeatedly assess people’s emotional states, behaviors, and context to examine their associations. Many variables of interest, such as negative affect and psychopathological symptoms, are measured with bounded scales that can produce right-skewed data. Standard linear mixed-effects models do not account for this intricacy, potentially producing biased parameter estimates.\nThis study proposes to conceptualize skewed observations as censored manifestations of underlying latent variables, using mixed-effects tobit models as an alternative analytical approach. Using data from N = 322 participants from three mental health groups (controls, depressed, psychotic) who completed mood assessments ten times daily for six days, we examined  parameter recovery capabilities of the standard linear and tobit mixed-effects models by inducing increasing skewness into an originally roughly normally distributed outcome variable (positive affect). Results indicated that the tobit model provided relatively stable parameter estimates under progressive censoring conditions, while the standard linear model showed deterioration in slope estimates approaching zero.\nWhen applied to a naturally skewed outcome variable (negative affect), the tobit model again estimated larger associations across all groups, with the greatest differences observed in controls, where floor effects were most pronounced. Tobit models also revealed greater between-person variability and reduced intercept-slope correlations.\nWhile computational complexity presents implementation challenges, these findings suggest that tobit models offer important advantages for analyzing bounded psychological constructs in ESM research. However, further research across diverse contexts is needed to establish implementation guidelines.",

          "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to ease the increasing workload in ophthalmology by supporting ophthalmologists’ clinical decision-making. However, despite regulatory approvals, the adoption and use of AI-enabled clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in ophthalmology remains limited. Critical obstacles that innovative healthcare technologies such as AI-CDSS face on their path to widespread clinical use are nonadoption and abandonment by their intended users, which prevent broader dissemination and real clinical benefit. This study explores how to overcome nonadoption and prevent abandonment of ophthalmic AI-CDSS by identifying ophthalmology professionals’ requirements for adoption and continued use of such tools in clinical practice.\nMethods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 ophthalmology professionals from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, representing a range of professional roles, clinical settings, and extent of AI-CDSS experience. To explore sociotechnical factors shaping ophthalmology professionals’ adoption decisions and their ability to derive added value from ophthalmic AI-CDSS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis combining deductive and inductive coding. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework deductively guided the development of higher-level code categories, representing seven sociotechnical domains relevant for the implementation of healthcare technologies. These were further refined into subcategories through inductive coding of the interview material.\nResults: Most participants expressed general openness to ophthalmic AI-CDSS. However, actual adoption decisions and the ability to derive clinical value from these tools were shaped not just by individual attitudes but also by a range of other sociotechnical influences. Specifically, we inductively identified 29 code categories, representing sociotechnical influences and requirements from all seven NASSS domains, including technological, user, organizational, and societal aspects. Our findings also suggest that while many sociotechnical influences and challenges are shared between AI-based and traditional healthcare technologies, a key distinction of (ophthalmic) AI-CDSS lies in the users’ psychological appraisal of such tools. \nConclusions: Our findings highlight the complex and context-specific nature of integrating AI-CDSS into ophthalmic practice. This study also informs AI and healthcare researchers on the applicability of the NASSS framework for studying AI implementation and provides actionable insights for AI developers and implementers aiming to address user needs more effectively.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with high levels of Autistic traits often experience challenges in interpreting others' emotions, potentially stemming from atypical patterns of visual attention to facial cues. This study investigates whether Autism-like traits in a non-clinical sample are associated with overall emotion recognition accuracy, differential attention to facial areas of interest (eyes, mouth, and other regions), and emotion-specific recognition impairments. Eighty-two participants were presented with videos of actors displaying the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) at high and low intensities while eye movements were recorded. Autism-like traits were quantified using a composite score derived from well-validated questionnaires. Overall, higher Autism-like traits correlated with weaker emotion recognition performance (r = -.34, p = .002). Attention to the mouth was positively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy (r = .24, p = .03), but not to the eyes. Notably, levels of Autistic traits did not correlate with gaze patterns to either mouth or eye regions, a null finding that differs from established literature on eye avoidance patterns in Autistic populations. Levels of Autistic traits were selectively associated with recognition of negative emotions of anger, disgust, and fear, but not happiness. These findings confirm the relationship between Autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties in the broader population, as well as the importance of attention to emotionally salient facial features in emotion recognition. However, our hypothesis that eye-gaze patterns would mediate the relationship between autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties was not supported.",

Based on this recommendation, we subtyped children with ADHD using autistic and ADHD traits, cognitive and psychopathological domains. Our goal was to identify distinct and meaningful subgroups within the ADHD population. We used 892 ADHD participants aged 5 to 18 from the HBN data set. Using the Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), we identified subgroups based on the following features: (1) Inattentive, Hyperactive–Impulsive subscales measured by SWAN (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-symptoms and Normal-behaviours), (2) cognitive flexibility, working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control assessed with NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, (3) autistic traits evaluated with SRS-2 (Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition), SCQ (Social Communication Questionnaire), and ASSQ (Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire), (4) internalizing symptoms assessed with the MFQ-P (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire) and the SCARED-P (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Parent Report), (5) externalizing symptoms measured with the Rule-Breaking Behavior and Aggressive Behavior subscales of the CBCL (Child Behavior Checklist). All classes’ features showed significant results in differentiating class profiles, with externalizing symptoms showing the largest effect size and inattention, working memory, anxiety, and processing speed showed the smallest (but still significant). We found four meaningful classes: a moderately high EF/ very low symptoms profile, a high EF/ mild symptoms profile, a moderately low EF/ high symptoms profile, and an impaired EF/ low symptoms profile. We used the PSI-4 (Parenting Stress Index, Fourth Edition), SDSC (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children), PCIAT (Parent-Child Internet Addiction Test), CGAS (Children’s Global Assessment Scale), and WIAT (Wechsler Individual Achievement Test) for external validation of the classes. The classes with the worst EF performance had lower academic achievement, and classes with more severe symptoms had greater internet addiction, parenting stress, and sleep disturbance problems. The combination of the high EF and low symptoms yielded the best outcome.",

Its extensions recognize that transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming individuals experience unique stressors beyond those faced by cisgender non-heterosexual people, including both distal and proximal stressors affecting their well-being. Aims: This study investigates factors contributing to high rates of psychological distress in transgender, non-binary, and gender-nonconforming (TGNC) individuals, focusing on minority stressors and sources of resilience. Methods: Using a sample of 250 TGNC (transgender: 20%; nonbinary: 33%; other identities: 9%) and cisgender (38%) individuals, we assessed the effects of distal (Perceived and Anticipated Discrimination) and proximal (Internalized Transphobia) minority stressors, alongside resilience factors (Social Support and Support for Gender/Sexual Identity), on symptoms of common mental disorders (SRQ-20 scores) and internalizing symptoms (IDAS-II scores). Data were analyzed using generalized linear models with moderated mediation. Results: TGNC participants exhibited higher SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores compared to cisgender participants. Minority stressors mediated the relationship between gender identity and SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores. While Social Support moderated the relationship between trans identity and both Anticipated Discrimination and Internalized Transphobia, its protective effect varied across gender identities. Support for Gender/Sexual Identity mitigated the impact of Internalized Transphobia in SRQ-20 and IDAS-II scores in TGNC individuals. Conclusion: TGNC individuals face elevated psychological distress due to unique stressors. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions that promote social and identity-based support, emphasizing the role of resilience factors in improving mental health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Ruminative brooding is a transdiagnostic symptom defined as repetitive dwelling on thoughts and emotions, and has been linked to emotion dysregulation, maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, and abnormal interoception, but the relative contributions of these factors and their neural mechanisms remain unclear. We used source-localized resting-state EEG analyses (n=31) to map these processes onto cross-frequency coupling (CFC) networks. We first identified symptoms of interest for CFC analyses by employing  regularized symptom network analyses which revealed two clusters relevant to brooding: one dominated by interoceptive/mindfulness dimensions and another by metacognitive/emotional dysregulation, with brooding aligning with the latter. We then examined links between representative symptoms from each cluster and resting-state cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling (PAC) using partial least squares (PLS) correlation. Emotional dysregulation and brooding were associated with delta-beta PAC, whereas mindfulness symptoms related to beta-gamma and theta-gamma PAC. For the brooding/dysregulation signature, prefrontal and cingulate phase activity modulated amplitudes in regions implicated in emotion regulation and interoception (e.g., subcallosal cingulate, somatosensory cortex, insula, parietal cortex). The mindfulness/interoception signature reflected coupling within networks supporting interoceptive awareness and emotion regulation. Overall, our results indicate that brooding is more tightly linked to maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and emotional dysregulation than to mindfulness/interoception, consistent with resistance toward one’s thoughts and emotions. Neurally, this may be reflected by compensatory top-down control from prefrontal and cingulate areas over interoceptive, affective, and self-referential systems, pointing to the potential value of therapies that cultivate self-acceptance and modify maladaptive metacognitive beliefs for reducing rumination.",

          "abstract": "We see not only objects and their features (e.g., glass vases or wooden tables) but also relations between them (e.g., a vase on a table). An emerging view accounts for such relational representations by positing that visual perception is compositional: Much like language, where words combine to form phrases and sentences, many visual representations contain discrete constituents that combine systematically. This perspective raises a fundamental question: What principles guide the composition of relational representations, and how are they built over time? Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mind constructs relational representations in a canonical order. Inspired by a distinction from cognitive linguistics, we predicted that 'reference' objects (typically large, stable, and able to physically control other objects; e.g., tables) take precedence over 'figure' objects (e.g., vases) during scene composition. In Experiment 1, participants who arranged items to match linguistic descriptions (e.g., \"The vase is on the table\", \"The table is supporting the vase\") consistently placed reference objects first (e.g., table, then vase). Experiments 2–5 extended these findings to visual recognition itself: participants were faster to verify scene descriptions when reference objects appeared before figure objects in a scene, rather than vice versa. This Reference-first advantage emerged rapidly (within 100 ms), persisted in a purely visual task, and reflected abstract principles (e.g., physical forces) beyond simple differences in size or shape. Our findings reveal psychophysical principles underlying compositionality in visual processing: the mind builds representations of object relations sequentially, guided by the objects' roles in those relations.",

Generating a good plan therefore requires judicious selection of which parts of the plan space to mentally explore. Drawing on past studies of human exploration, we propose that mental exploration might invoke similar mechanisms. In particular, we test the hypothesis that mental exploration during planning is uncertainty-driven, such that people will exhibit a tendency to explore parts of the plan space that have high epistemic uncertainty. We developed a route-planning task, displayed as a binary tree, where participants were instructed to collect as many treats (rewards) as possible by traversing the tree. By separating the planning and execution phases, we encouraged participants to externalize their planning process. We manipulated uncertainty by varying the number of potential future states available from each current state. Across two studies, the data suggest that people preferred to explore options with more successor states after controlling for value differences, supporting the uncertainty-driven planning hypothesis. We also found that uncertainty played a larger role during the planning phase than during the execution phase, consistent with the hypothesis that the uncertainty effect primarily reflects a property of human planning algorithms rather than an intrinsic preference for uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "The ability to efficiently identify, respond to and regulate emotions is impaired in a large range of psychiatric disorders. Interoception, the ability to perceive, integrate and interpret internal bodily signals, contributes to emotions as it is responsible for the emergence of the subjective bodily sensations involved in affective states. Bodily maps of emotions allow visualizing where individuals feel bodily changes during discrete emotions, offering a direct window onto the interoceptive phenomenology of emotional experience. This paradigm thus also provides a direct way to observe the involvement of interoception in emotional disturbances, a transdiagnostic process of most psychiatric states. However, although the role of bodily sensations in emotional processing has been examined in certain psychiatric conditions, it has not yet been integrated into a broader transdiagnostic framework.\nFollowing PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review synthesizes research using bodily maps to assess interoceptive emotional experiences in psychiatric populations. We identified altered interoceptive experiences related to emotions and highlighted underexplored areas in this field.\nWe found altered interoceptive experiences of emotions are common across a large range of psychiatric states, including depression, schizophrenia, autism, and alcohol use disorder. Despite these broad disruptions, studies failed to establish the mechanisms by which interoceptive experiences may contribute to difficulties in different emotional processes (i.e., identification, response, and regulation). We hence propose new directions for the use of bodily maps to foster a more theoretically grounded and comprehensive analysis of interoceptive experiences in psychiatry.",

In Study 3 (United States, N = 300, pre-registered) we used an experimental vignette featuring a fictitious country to illustrate that eliciting ressentiment (as compared to a control condition) led to a significant increase in support for populism among citizens.

AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant (Experiment 1). In contrast, no such difference was observed for participants who had not encoded crime-related items (Experiment 2). The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT.

Results replicated Morin’s (2013) finding of a Renaissance shift toward direct gaze, but this trend reversed after 1600, suggesting the attractor was not stable. Religious works diverged, becoming more averted, while secular portraits engaged viewers. The left cheek bias was strong in the Renaissance, weakened in later Europe, and remained stable in ukiyo-e.

Using latent profile and latent transition analyses with a two-wave sample of 1,059 U.S. parents (52% mothers) of 6th–9th graders, five parental involvement profiles were identified based on four involvement dimensions (i.e., autonomy support, psychological control, provision of structure, and warmth): Need-Supportive (~ 8%), Autonomy-Supportive Warm (~ 10%), Low Involved (~ 20%), Controlling (~ 27%), and Mixed (~ 35%). The Controlling profile showed the highest stability (82%), while the Need-Supportive profile demonstrated the highest dynamics (53%). Parental integrative emotion regulation predicted the highest probability of membership in the Need-supportive profile, whereas parental emotional dysregulation was associated with the highest likelihood of belonging to the Controlling profile. Overall, time-invariant sociodemographic factors and parental health-related problems (e.g., feeling depressed, physical pain) had minimal effects on profile probabilities. Findings regarding outcomes suggest that the Need-supportive profile is the most adaptive, contributing to a sense of self-determination in parenting, whereas the Controlling profile is the most dysfunctional, linking to the highest levels of exhaustion and need frustration in parenting. However, no differences in offspring’s school performance were found to be associated with profile membership. The study has important implications for understanding parental involvement quality and suggests ways to support parents.",

          "abstract": "Previous research on children’s emotional and behavioral reactions to reading has primarily employed a variable-centered approach, which assumes a homogeneous population with only one underlying pattern of emotional and behavioral reactions to reading. However, previous literature suggests that children can differ in their patterns of emotional and behavioral reactions to academic subjects, including reading. In this preregistered study, we aimed to identify profiles of children based on their reading-related emotions and behaviors (i.e., reading interest, reading self-efficacy, reading anxiety, and reading avoidance). By identifying these profiles, we can inform the development of interventions that target the specific emotional and behavioral traits that individual children are struggling with. Using a national sample of 1,287 U.S. twin children in 3rd through 12th grade, four profiles of reading-related emotions and behaviors were identified. About half of the children were in a profile exemplified by high positive and low negative reading-related emotions and behaviors. The other half of the children were struggling with reading-related emotions and behaviors across three distinct profiles. About 20% of the children were disengaged from reading, while another 20% of the children were primarily struggling with high reading anxiety. Finally, 7% of children presented a global distress toward reading, characterized by low reading interest and self-efficacy and very high reading anxiety and avoidance. Future directions for developing interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of children with each profile of reading-related emotions and behaviors are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Both vision and language carry rich information useful for social understanding in the real world, yet the neural processing of these signals have been mostly studied separately. Even most prior work with naturalistic stimuli does not model the contributions of vision and language signals together. Here we combined established fMRI localizer experiments, which identify social interaction perception- and language-selective regions, with a fMRI movie-viewing paradigm in the same individual participants (n=34). To pinpoint how multi-modal signals contribute to movie responses, we densely labeled the movie using vision and language deep neural networks (DNNs) and use these to predict neural responses. We found that vision model (motion and image) embeddings of movie frames predict significant activity across the cortex, while language model (speech, word, and sentence) embeddings of the spoken language predict well only in portions of the STS. We find that the individually localized motion and social interaction regions are best explained by vision model embeddings. Language regions, on the other hand, are well predicted by speech, word, and sentence language model embeddings and, surprisingly, are as equally well predicted by vision model embeddings. In an analysis of the vision model’s layer-wise and unit-wise predictivity, we find that the most predictive model units in social interaction and language regions are distinct from those in lower-level motion regions. Exploratory analyses suggest that the most predictive vision model units in social interaction and language regions contain social-semantic information conveyed by vision. Together, these results suggest that high-level visual information drives neural responses across cortex, even in language-selective regions, with varying integration of spoken language information across the STS.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite research on case factors that can trigger confirmation bias in investigations leading to wrongful convictions, we know little about what sparks this chain reaction and why an innocent person initially falls under suspicion. Across four studies, we investigated what perceived behaviors exhibited by 911 callers (urgency, emotionality, cognitive load, impression management, and information management) are related to laypeople’s (Studies 1-2, 4) and police officers’ (Study 3) suspicion toward the caller. Hypotheses: We predicted, for lay and police samples, callers perceived as more urgent or emotional would be perceived as less suspicious, whereas callers perceived as more under cognitive load, managing information, or managing impressions of themselves would be perceived as more suspicious. We tested whether these relationships depended on caller gender—predicting gender stereotypes might play a role, particularly with emotionality. Method: Participants (Studies 1-2, 4: online laypeople, Study 3: police officers) listened to a real 911 call (Studies 1 and 4) or a more controlled, simulated 911 call (Studies 2 and 3) by a male or female caller. We assessed behavioral predictors associated with suspicion via participants’ spontaneous impressions and scales assessing these behaviors. Participants indicated how suspicious they found the caller and how much the caller violated their expectations. Results: Participants spontaneously mentioned the callers’ emotionality most frequently and consistently across studies (77-85%). Perceptions of callers being more urgent and emotional were associated with less suspicion and violation of expectations, while perceptions of callers engaging in more information management and impression management were associated with more suspicion and violation of expectations. Police, but not laypeople, perceived male callers as more suspicious than female callers—despite holding 911 call scripts constant. Conclusion: Citizens engaging in the well-intentioned act of calling 911 risk observers—including police—holding expectations for their behavior and targeting them as a suspect if they violate those expectations.",

          "authors": "Eva Tzschaschel; Kevin R. Brooks; Ian D Stephen",
          "abstract": "Body posture represents an underexplored cue in social perception research, despite its potential to signal psychological states. To investigate predictions from the Embodied Emotion Theory, we examined whether body posture influences perceptions of attractiveness and self-esteem, and whether these perceptions serve as valid cues to self-reported self-esteem. First, individuals completed self-esteem measures and were photographed. Then, across three studies, observers rated photographs of these individuals (N = 108) displaying upright and slouched postures from profile and frontal viewing angles. Study 1 examined the correlations between posture angles and observer ratings using left-profile photographs. Study 2 extended this to right-profile and frontal views to distinguish posture alignment from symmetry effects. Study 3 employed a forced-choice experimental design to establish causal relationships. Results demonstrate a systematic preference for upright postures in forced-choice comparisons, with observers consistently selecting more upright over slouched postures as more attractive and indicative of higher self-esteem. However, while observers accurately judged participants’ self-esteem levels, no significant associations emerged between posture and attractiveness ratings in correlational analyses. Two unexpected findings emerged: only 13% of subjects naturally displayed upright posture, and mediation analysis revealed no relationship between posture presentation and actual self-reported self-esteem. These findings suggest that observers consistently use posture cues for social judgements and show strong preferences for upright postures. However, standard angular measurements may not capture the subtle posture information that observers naturally detect. Most subjects displayed slouched postures, yet observers consistently evaluated upright presentations more positively.",

          "abstract": "People’s first impressions, including social evaluations, are strongly influenced by the appearances of others. Body posture contributes to one’s appearance and hence may be associated with these social judgements. This study investigated whether body posture influences observers’ perceptions of trustworthiness and dominance, two principal components of body perception. The stimuli (N = 121) consist of greyscale photos depicting individuals in standardised clothing, standing naturally in left profile. Posture was objectively quantified by measuring three angles: head tilt, neck angle, and shoulder angle. Judgements from raters (N = 237) were analysed in relation to these posture metrics. A more upright posture was associated with higher perceived trustworthiness and dominance. Importantly, these effects remained significant even after accounting for sex-based anatomical differences using z-score normalisation. While sex independently contributed to the perception of trustworthiness and dominance, posture contributed uniquely and consistently to social judgements. These findings highlight posture as a key element of body perception and underscore its importance in shaping first impressions.",

          "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms are dynamic, yet traditional assessments often measure them retrospectively and at single timepoints, potentially missing clinically meaningful symptom variability. Further, many measures are population-specific, limiting their use across the psychosis continuum. To address these gaps, we developed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences\n(MAPE), a brief self-report questionnaire measuring in-the-moment psychosis across the continuum. Validation was conducted across four community samples recruited via Prolific (N = 3,552) and one clinical sample with psychotic disorders (N = 73). The initial 56-item pool was reduced to 30 items through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in community samples. Internal consistency was examined across samples. Convergent validity was tested against the Paranoia Scale, Magical Ideation Scale, Revised Hallucinations Scale, and Revised Social Anhedonia Scale. Concurrent validity in the clinical sample was evaluated using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms. Analyses identified five factors: unusual thoughts/sensory experiences, paranoia, amotivation/anhedonia, social anhedonia, and negative affect. This structure showed excellent fit and internal consistency in community samples, with comparable reliability in the clinical sample. MAPE subscales demonstrated moderate correlations with subclinical psychosis measures in community samples and interviewer-rated symptoms in the clinical sample. Findings support the MAPE as a valid and standardized measure of momentary psychotic experiences. By focusing on current state, the MAPE reduces retrospective bias and improves ecological validity. Designed for use across both subclinical and clinical populations, the MAPE also offers a unique tool for studying psychotic symptoms along the continuum.",

          "abstract": "The folded-X pattern has been identified as a critical signature of confidence, wherein easier conditions lead to confidence increases for correct trials but confidence decreases for error trials. However, recent work has identified violations of the folded-X pattern where easier conditions lead to increased confidence for both correct and error trials (double-increase pattern). Nevertheless, it remains an open question what stimulus manipulations lead to the folded-X vs. double-increase patterns. Here we test the hypothesis that the double-increase pattern emerges for manipulations of the quality of the sensory input (stimulus reliability), whereas the folded-X pattern emerges for manipulations of the distance between the sensory feature of interest and the decision boundary (boundary distance). Across two experiments (N = 78) using orientation judgment with either Gabor patches or moving dots, we first replicate previous findings that boundary distance manipulations have a stronger effect on accuracy whereas stimulus reliability manipulations have a stronger effect on confidence. Critically, we find that boundary distance manipulations produce the standard folded-X pattern, while the stimulus reliability manipulations result in the double-increase pattern. We further show that reaction time (RT) patterns largely mirror confidence patterns, though with some notable exceptions, highlighting both the utility and limitations of using RT as a proxy for confidence. These results demonstrate that different stimulus manipulations have dissociable effects on the signatures of confidence and could allow researchers to predict a priori whether a new manipulation would lead to the folded-X or the double-increase pattern.",

          "abstract": "The rising prevalence of mental health problems among adolescents has prompted increased scrutiny of social media as a contributing factor. Previous research has produced mixed results, likely due to the varying impact of social media on different dimensions of mental health. To advance understanding in this area, this study examined how social media use affects three critical dimensions of adolescent mental health – well-being, self-esteem, and friendship closeness. Specifically, we examined whether adolescents experienced consistent (unity) or contrasting (duality) effects across these dimensions by analyzing 44,211 daily diaries from 479 adolescents over 100 days. We found that the majority of adolescents (60%) experienced unity in negative effects of social media, suggesting that social media use is a notable contributor to mental health issues. Moreover, 13.6% of adolescents experienced duality in effects, indicating that social media use simultaneously harms and benefits different dimensions of their mental health. Exploratory analyses demonstrated the importance of examining platform-specific effects, revealing negative impacts of TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram use and positive or null effects of Snapchat and WhatsApp use on the three dimensions of mental health. Our findings highlight the need for tailored strategies that account for the varying impacts of social media on adolescent mental health.",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation. In this way, the article highlights the need to broaden the methodological and epistemological repertoire of cognitive science, paving the way for a science of experience consistent with the very nature of what it seeks to investigate.",

          "abstract": "Personal goals represent the motivational foundation underlying personality traits, yet the motivational underpinnings of honesty-humility remain poorly understood. We developed and validated the Goals for Honesty and Goals for Dishonesty (GHGD) questionnaire - the first comprehensive instrument measuring honesty-humility through its motivational core. Using a multi-method, bottom-up approach across three studies, we systematically identified and classified personal goals associated with honesty-humility traits. Study 1 employed participant-driven goal elicitation using personality-descriptive adjectives. Responses were classified using natural language processing and independent raters' coding, yielding a final set of goals. Study 2 refined candidate goals, selecting those specifically associated with honesty-humility and its facets, and developed the GHGD questionnaire. Study 3 provided comprehensive validation using self-reports, informant-reports, and observed behavior in an incentivized cheating task. Results revealed a robust two-factor structure distinguishing honesty-oriented goals (GH) from dishonesty-oriented goals (GD). These dimensions were moderately negatively correlated, indicating distinct rather than bipolar motivational orientations. GD consistently predicted actual dishonest behavior beyond traditional trait measures, while GH related more strongly to authentic living and self-concept integrity. Agreement between self- and informant-reports suggested that close others can form quite accurate impressions of individuals' honesty-related motivations. Findings demonstrate that goal-based assessments can improve prediction of honest behavior compared to conventional trait self-reports. This work integrates trait-based and process-oriented approaches to personality, delivering theoretical contributions and empirical instruments that will facilitate future research on moral personality and behavior.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory is a declarative long-term memory of a specific past experience. As such, it is multifaceted, encompassing both the objective and subjective components of that experience. These components can be flexibly represented at different levels of granularity, from precise, context-specific details to generalized, gist-like representations. In this review, we suggest that 1) multiple representations of an episodic memory at different levels of granularity are simultaneously encoded into a memory trace and 2) the relative weighting of these representations determines the extent to which a memory is reconstructed or reproduced at retrieval. We propose that this representational flexibility drives adaptive behavior by prioritizing reconstruction or reproduction depending on the age of the memory, its relationship to prior knowledge, current attentional goals, or task demands, and individual differences. Drawing on research in humans and non-human animals, we show a close correspondence between psychological and neural representations of a memory across encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Specifically, we discuss how hippocampal activity in humans and engram formation and activation in rodents support the reproduction of detailed memory representations, while schema formation across species, mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex, facilitates reconstruction and generalization to guide behavior. Finally, we consider how species- and individual-level differences shape episodic memory representations. By integrating findings across species, we illustrate how the correspondence between neural and psychological representations enables multiple memory representations to balance stability and flexibility, ultimately driving adaptive behavior.",

          "abstract": "A person’s gaze can be highly informative—it can reveal which people, objects, or places interest the person, and it can help observers predict what they might do next. It can also be difficult to understand. Relative to actions for which someone physically contacts a target (e.g., by reaching and touching), gaze may be difficult to understand because of the physical distance between the action and target. Indeed, classic research suggests that before 12 months of age, infants do not readily track the targets of others’ gaze. However, studies on the development of gaze understanding have mostly presented infants with unfamiliar adults acting on inanimate objects. Here, we provide evidence that 8- to 9-month-old infants can track the targets of their parents' gaze when that gaze was directed at a potential social partner: an animate puppet. When infants observed their own parents look toward an animate puppet, they expected them to continue looking towards the same puppet later. Infants did not have the same expectations when their parents looked toward inanimate objects, nor when they observed the gaze of an unfamiliar adult. Thus, before infants track the targets of object-directed gaze, they already track the targets of their parents’ social gaze. These findings are consistent with the possibility that social relevance shapes infants’ understanding of others’ actions.",

This study compares prevalence of food insecurity in a treatment-seeking sample to state and national population averages and tests food insecurity’s influence on parent/child mental health, child dietary intake, and parent/child body mass. \nMethods: Parent/child dyads in rural Kansas (n = 148) recruited based on child weight status (i.e., above 85th percentile) completed measures of household food insecurity, eligibility for free and reduced-price lunch, mental health, and child dietary intake, as well as standardized height/weight at baseline for a family-based healthy lifestyles intervention study. \nFindings: Results indicate the rate of food insecurity (25%) and child healthy eating index scores (M = 51.01, SD = 8.40) were significantly elevated compared to population metrics (ps &lt; .001); however, eligibility for free and reduced price lunch in this sample (50%) was similar to national and state averages. Families with food insecurity, compared to those in the study who were food secure, exhibited significant differences (ps &lt; .05) regarding: poorer parent mental health, higher parent BMI, and increased sugar-sweetened beverage intake for children. \nConclusion: Findings highlight the need to assess and address food insecurity in family-focused obesity interventions, especially among families living in rural areas.",

In a pre-registered electroencephalography study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility by examining neural signatures of cognitive control adjustments. Specifically, we tested whether deliberate enhancements in cognitive stability and flexibility levels were associated with a facilitation of goal shielding and shifting, respectively. Participants completed a task-switching experiment in which they received explicit strategy instructions that aimed at promoting either cognitive stability or flexibility in a within-subjects design. We assessed mid-frontal theta power as an indicator of cognitive control recruitment and effort mobilization. Participants succeeded in adopting the instructed control states and behaviorally exhibited inverse adjustments in indicators of cognitive stability and flexibility. However, we did not find any differences in theta power in response to shielding or shifting demands between conditions. Consistent with previous studies and subjective effort ratings, more stable control states were further not associated with a generally increased recruitment of cognitive control. We thus did not find that adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility were linked to modulations in effort or cognitive control recruitment. Potential processes that may have promoted more effective task shielding and shifting are discussed, providing directions for future research.",

Despite growing evidence that altered interoceptive processing is central to EDs, the use of interoceptive-based interventions (IBIs) in this population remains under-explored. This systematic review aims to evaluate the application and efficacy of IBIs in the treatment of eating disorders.\nA comprehensive search of PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, case series, and single-case studies involving individuals with ED diagnoses and interventions incorporating interoceptive elements (e.g., mindfulness, biofeedback, interoceptive exposure). The primary outcomes evaluated were ED-related clinical measures and psychological variables such as anxiety and stress.\nEleven studies, totaling 404 participants, were included in the review. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) were the most common and consistently led to improvements in emotional regulation, reduced binge/compensatory behaviors, and enhanced bodily awareness. While promising, preliminary findings from studies on interoceptive exposure and biofeedback indicated a potential for reducing avoidance and anxiety, particularly in patients with anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. A key limitation across most studies was a high risk of bias and a lack of standardized measures for assessing interoceptive outcomes.\nThis review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature on IBIs for eating disorders, enhancing our understanding of their clinical application and highlighting critical areas for future research and refinement.",

          "abstract": "Art engagement is increasingly recognized as a supportive intervention in behavioral health settings, with evidence linking art exposure and participation to improvements in emotion regulation, stress reduction, therapeutic engagement, and clinical outcomes. Yet there is limited research on how art engagement is implemented and perceived in behavioral health settings, including across levels – passive, active, and interactive art exposure, and art-making. This study first conducted a literature review in neuroscience, psychology, and environmental design, to identify mechanisms by which art engagement may influence brain function, health and wellbeing, and clinical outcomes. To extend this research, two surveys were conducted across 40 behavioral health institutions in the United States to evaluate staff’s perceptions of art’s impact on themselves and their patients. Respondents reported positive impacts of art interventions on mood, stress, patient engagement in therapy, and staff morale, while also identifying barriers such as funding, leadership support, and arts training. Arts programming was more commonly offered to patients than staff, despite high staff interest, yet institutions offering programming to both groups reported better outcomes across nearly every measured domain. Drawing from the literature and survey data, a framework is proposed for integrating art into behavioral health settings at environmental, programmatic, and organizational levels: the CARE framework – Curated environment, Active programming, Recovery tools, Equitable access. Together, these findings position art engagement as an evidence-informed strategy to enhance patient care and staff wellbeing and highlight the need for standardized approaches to implementation and evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion has been linked to increased risk for psychotic experiences; however, it remains unclear whether exclusion has a unique impact beyond general negative experiences. Across two studies run between April 2024 and May 2024, we tested whether recalling autobiographical experiences of exclusion leads to greater increases in psychotic experiences compared to recalling other negatively valenced experiences (i.e., sadness) using a within-subjects design and a novel momentary self-report measure. Participants completed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (MAPE) immediately before and after a five-minute recall task, during which they were randomly assigned to recall an experience of exclusion, sadness, inclusion, or a neutral event. Study 1 (N = 810) found that neither the exclusion nor sadness induction increased positive symptoms. Both conditions led to increased negative symptoms but did not differ significantly from each other. Study 2 (N = 836) replicated these findings in an independent sample. Across both studies, inclusion unexpectedly led to a reduction in negative symptoms, including amotivation and anhedonia, and social anhedonia. These findings suggest that exclusion contributes to short-term increases in psychotic experiences that reflect negative symptoms, but its effects are not distinguishable from other negatively valenced life experiences. In contrast, inclusion may have a protective effect, reducing specific negative symptoms. Together, these findings highlight the need to consider both negative and positive life experiences when evaluating social risk and protective factors for psychotic experiences.",

Despite decades of calls for their abolishment and more strength-based understandings of neurodiversity, no compelling alternatives yet exist. In this article, we illustrate and differentiate behaviour currently associated with attention disorder labels of ADHD and CDS. Extending our existing spacetime attention framework within process-based therapy theory we model ADHD and CDS-related traits as lower attention retention and selection over multiple tasks and goals. With the assumption spacetime attention fluctuations dictate the direction and duration of relational development, we provide a more nuanced understanding of how attention changes may affect functional, meaningful outcomes across different contexts and success criteria. As examples, attention moving away from uncomfortable internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, and emotions) may prevent suppression and regain mindful, present moment attention; attention moving internally may help creativity and encourage more meaningful actions. We then provide practical recommendations for assessment and holistic support for clients struggling with inattention within acceptance-based psychology practice.",

Across three studies (N = 220) using an Object Copying Task, we show that some participants consistently exhibited greater WM usage than others. These tendencies were reliable, stable across time, and predicted individuals’ task efficiency and responses to changing task demands. Finally, spontaneous WM usage could only partially be explained by established measures of WM capacity and attentional control – two plausible predictors of natural WM usage. In summary, we find stable tendencies in individuals’ spontaneous WM usage, despite the variable nature of self-structured natural behaviour. Our results position inter-individual variability as an important dimension in understanding natural, memory-guided behaviour, highlighting the need to investigate its broader determinants and behavioural consequences.",

          "abstract": "There is now robust evidence that individuals can direct their attention towards particularly valuable information in working memory. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying such effects are still under debate. One possibility is that participants preferentially encode high value information, creating a stronger representation relative to other information presented. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments. Participants completed a visual working memory task, which involved remembering the color of shapes for a brief period of time. During the encoding phase participants’ eye movements were recorded to assess fixation behaviors. Participants were then presented with one shape and asked to report the color as accurately as possible on a color wheel. In Experiment 1, participants were either told that one particular item was more valuable (i.e., worth more notional points than the rest), or that all items were of equal value. In Experiment 2, each item differed in its value in a graded manner (i.e., 1-2-3-4 points). Across both experiments, participants exhibited the lowest recall error for the highest value information. Moreover, participants spent significantly longer fixating on high value items during the encoding phase relative to other information presented. Further, the extent to which participants fixated on an item during encoding partially mediated the effect of value on recall error. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that participants vary their eye movements during encoding as a function of value, and suggest that value-driven prioritization effects in working memory are partially driven by such behaviors.",

          "abstract": "Children who have returned from the Caliphate, living under the ISIS-regime, and from Kurdish camps have faced harsh living conditions, including war and separation from their parents. Such experiences are risk factors for the development of affect, cognition, behaviour, attachment, and social-emotional competencies. However, there is still limited knowledge about the development of this specific group of children, since previous studies were solely based on adult perspectives. \nThe participants of the current study were 22 Dutch children, who returned to the Netherlands between September 2018 and November 2022. Data were also gathered from their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Assessment took place in the first nine months after return. \nAdditionally, the current study is the first study on child returnees with a mixed-methods design. Standardised, normed instruments (‘quantitative’) and interviews (‘qualitative’) were employed to assess the children’s experiences in Syria and/or Iraq, their affect, cognition, behaviour, attachment and social-emotional competencies upon return and their living conditions following their return to the Netherlands. \nThe results confirm that the children experienced harsh physical and emotional living conditions in Syria/Iraq, and indicate affective problems, delays in cognitive development, problematic attachment and adaptation problems. However, positive outcomes were also identified, including the children's strong social-emotional skills in recognizing and empathizing with other people’s emotions.\nIn conclusion, the affective and cognitive development of children who have returned appear to be most threatened by their experiences, although causality cannot be demonstrated. The findings imply the needs for careful assessment of each individual, treatment of trauma and deviant affective development, as well as availability of attachment figures. Monitoring children over a longer period is however crucial to identifying possible resilience and long-term consequences. Although the mixed-methods multi-informant approach proved crucial for balanced conclusions, differences between informants and measures also make it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. \n\nKEYWORDS: Child Returnees – Caliphate – Psychological Trauma – Traumatic Stress – War Violence – Terrorism – Development – Reintegration",

          "authors": "Shane McLoughlin",
          "abstract": "Character education research is often constrained by blunt methodological tools. Surveys capture breadth without depth; case studies offer richness but lack replicability; and randomised controlled trials (RCTs), though indispensable at the policy level, are costly, disruptive, and ill-suited to everyday practice. More troublingly, they rest on an ergodic fallacy: assuming that what works on average must work for each individual. In reality, interventions that deliver modest positive effect sizes typically conceal a mix of no effects, negative effects, and only some benefits. This leaves teachers, mentors, and coaches without rigorous tools to evaluate what matters most: whether an intervention works here, now, for this pupil. This paper argues that single-subject designs (SSDs) offer a neglected but transformative solution. SSDs involve repeated measurement in which individuals serve as their own controls, allowing strong causal inference through replication while remaining sensitive to idiosyncratic development. They democratise research by enabling practitioners to capture and publish the wisdom of context-sensitive practice without the machinery of large trials. Through worked examples drawn from moral and character education, this tutorial demonstrates how to design, measure, analyse, and report SSDs to rigorous standards. SSDs can reshape the field into a cumulative, idionomic science that empowers practitioners and complements large-scale studies.",

          "abstract": "Collocations, frequently co-occurring words, are fundamental to language use, yet it remains unclear whether they are processed holistically or sequentially through their constituents over the timecourse of comprehension. Therefore, using eye-tracking, we investigated how frequency and family size (i.e., the number of collocations sharing a constituent; fatal  fatal accident/error/inquiry/disease) influence collocation processing in L1 and L2 speakers. We observed that higher-frequency constituents were read faster than low-frequency constituents in earlier eye-tracking measures, while high-frequency collocations received fewer fixations than low-frequency collocations in later eye-tracking measures. Additionally, high family sizes facilitated processing frequent collocations in L1 speakers, whereas the opposite pattern was observed in L2 speakers. These findings demonstrate that L1 and L2 speakers are sensitive to frequency at both the word and phrase level. However, L2 speakers’ greater reliance on constituent-level cues suggests weaker holistic representations. The study supports the usage-based and statistical learning models.",

While much research has focussed on its capacity limitations, less is known about how vSTM operates in dynamic environments where priorities shift across feature dimensions. In this study, we bridge research on vSTM and cognitive control by embedding change detection (Experiments 1 and 2) and delayed estimation (Experiment 3) paradigms within a task switching paradigm, where the relevant feature dimension (colour or orientation) either repeated or switched across trials. Across all experiments we observed a cost to vSTM performance on switch relative to repetition trials. Mixture modelling of delayed estimation responses revealed that these switch costs were not due to reduced memory precision or memory failures, but rather to a selective increase in non-target responses reflecting feature--location binding errors. We propose that dimension switching selectively impairs the binding of feature values to locations and allows interference from irrelevant (but recently attended) feature dimensions. Our findings demonstrate that vSTM is sensitive to failures of attentional control, not just capacity limits.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown a processing advantage for multiword sequences (MWS) in both first language (L1) and second language (L2) speakers over novel word combinations. However, whether this advantage holds for different types of MWS for both groups is not known. We used a self- paced reading paradigm combined with a stop-making-sense task to investigate the processing of idioms used figuratively (e.g., “grey area”), idioms used literally, collocations (e.g., “vast area”), and novel combinations (e.g., “rare area”), in both L1 and L2 speakers. In line with previous findings, both L1 and L2 speakers read collocations faster than novel word combinations. Only L1 speakers showed a processing advantage for idioms used figuratively over collocations after controlling for distributional factors (e.g., phrase-level frequency, familiarity and contextual predictability), suggesting that semantic conventionality facilitates direct retrieval of idiomatic meanings. L2 speakers with lower proficiency did not show an advantage for idioms used figuratively but exhibited faster reading for idioms used literally over idioms used figuratively. While the meaning dominance of idioms did not exert an effect, greater idiom decomposability facilitated processing. Together, these findings indicate that, while frequency effects broadly support MWS processing, L2 speakers rely on compositional analysis in idiom comprehension more than L1 speakers.",

          "abstract": "A central goal of perceptual decision making is to determine the computations underlying choice and confidence in complex, multi-alternative tasks. However, revealing these computations requires knowledge of the internal evidence representation upon which the computations operate. Unfortunately, unlike for 2-choice tasks, there is no established method in multi-choice tasks to determine how stimuli are transformed into internal evidence. Here we address this critical gap by developing a novel modeling paradigm that reveals how the brain transforms external stimuli into internal evidence representations during multi-alternative decision making. Across three experiments that feature 3- and 5-choice conditions, we show that the internal evidence representation for these stimuli can be described with a simple, two-parameter equation that fits data for up to 12 conditions. Critically, the ability to model the internal evidence representations allowed us to test six theories of confidence computation. Our results support a new model where confidence reflects the raw evidence difference between the top two alternatives. These results establish a new paradigm in which a two-parameter equation can be used to determine the internal evidence representation for potentially unlimited number of multi-alternative conditions and put forward a new model of confidence computation in multi-alternative tasks.",

          "abstract": "The visual system can quickly extract statistical properties of multiple objects (ensembles). Observers can explicitly access and report the distribution of low-level features, such as color. Here, we investigate whether explicit access extends to the distributions of high-level features, e.g., emotional expressions of a group of faces. In Experiment 1, we presented observers with ensembles that have a Gaussian, uniform or bimodal distribution of emotional expressions (or colors as a low-level baseline condition). The task was to report the frequency of a randomly chosen feature value. Observers’ responses closely followed the underlying distribution for colors but were much noisier for the emotional expressions.  Observers could distinguish all the three color distributions while they could discern only the most contrasting distributions of emotional expressions (Gaussian and bimodal). Additionally, modelling showed that observers’ performance in both conditions was based on the integration of global information rather than the subsampling of a few objects. Experiment 2 showed that disrupting holistic face processing via face inversion manipulation does not change the observer’s performance for ensembles of emotional expressions. It indicates that the visual system cannot form a high-level feature distributional representation per se. Instead, it relies on low-level correlates (e.g., mouth curvature, brows’ tilt, etc.) to build a distributional representation of multiple facial expressions. Our findings help to explain how people can quickly obtain emotional information from many faces in a crowd and have a rich perceptual experience despite severe capacity limitations of visual attention and working memory.",

We examined the association of MEAL scores with happiness, frustration and boredom during the frustration-inducing mood drift task, in which participants wait for six minutes and rate their mood every 30 seconds.\nResults\nThe MEAL showed good psychometric properties, capturing three factors for hunger-related ‘irritability’, ‘low mood’ and ‘somatic feelings’ (RMSEA = 0.03 in community adults, 0.05 in community adolescents, 0.08 in adults with mental health disorder history). Quantitative and qualitative responses evidenced that hunger-related mood dysregulation impacts relationships, work and other activities.

          "abstract": "From 2010 to 2014, a series of events and publications revealed that much of the psychological literature was less robust than the field believed. Researchers have highlighted various issues underlying fragile findings in large swaths of psychological science. In response, the field has also proposed solutions to help build a more robust literature. Foremost among these solutions are a suite of Open Science practices, including preregistration, Registered Reports, and the posting of materials, data, and analytic scripts. While these solutions have primarily emerged outside of clinical science, there is some evidence that clinical science is beginning to adopt Open Science practices. The present study focuses on the use of Open Science practices in personality disorder research, specifically. We discuss the relevance of these practices to personality disorder research, and examine rates of Open Science practices in articles published between 2021-2023 in two personality disorder journals, Journal of Personality Disorders (Article N=150) and Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment (Article N=158). The rate of Open Science practices in these articles was compared to empirical articles from a select number of general personality journals published during the same time period (Article N range=125-247). Overall, the personality disorder articles showed lower rates of Open Science practices compared to the general personality articles, while some practices (Registered Reports) were consistently low across all articles. In light of these findings, we discuss ways that personality disorder researchers can effectively implement Open Science practices to help facilitate a more transparent research literature.",

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "What are the evolutionary functions of imaginative-narrative simulation as evident in fiction and other expressions of imagination, and how do they influence psychological wellbeing? We propose an integrative and multifunctional framework for understanding imaginative-narrative simulation—the mental, imaginative simulation of events, sourced from memory and fiction, and structured through narrative—as a key adaptive capacity. Drawing from evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, and media studies, we identify four core functions of this capacity: functions that support (i) planning and future thought, (ii) coping and emotion regulation, (iii) bonding and social needs, and (iv) identity and worldviews. We argue that these functions can importantly support psychological wellbeing, and we review a range of empirical studies that have investigated imagination, fiction, and psychological wellbeing during the lockdown restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic that speak to these effects. We suggest that despite its potential, there is a significant gap in the literature on the adaptive value of imagination and fiction, especially in the context of global crises, and offer concrete directions for future empirical work.",

          "abstract": "Digital games can shape everyday cognition, yet the roles of player skill, videogame genre, and play frequency across adulthood remain unclear. We studied 507 adult gamers of 3 age-groups (18–35, 36–55, 56+ years) to test how gaming skill and frequency relate to everyday memory and executive functioning. Participants completed the Gaming Skills Questionnaire (GSQ) and measures of everyday cognition: the Executive Skills Questionnaire–Revised, Everyday Memory Questionnaire–Revised, and Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the GSQ’s validity and reliability. Mixed-effects models estimated main and interaction effects of skill, frequency, age, and videogame genre. Higher skill was linked to fewer difficulties—especially for strategy and role-playing games—with advantages in planning, emotion regulation, and prospective/retrospective memory. In contrast, higher frequency was linked to more difficulties, particularly among younger adults. Puzzle play showed mixed associations: better organisation/time management but greater behavioural-regulation challenges. Age moderated several effects, with benefits attenuating from young to middle-aged and older groups. Findings specify conditions for genre-specific links with everyday memory and executive control: skill appears beneficial, whereas excessive frequency may undermine control processes. The GSQ offers a genre-sensitive measure for profiling gaming skill and frequency and can support research and practice on everyday memory across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is assumed to have had a large impact on the mental health of adolescents. Finding out for which youth the mental health impact was largest is imperative for strengthening future crisis responses. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of different sociodemographic groups of general population adolescents in Flanders, Belgium. Methods: Adolescents were tested for the SIGMA study, at W1 (n=1913; mean age=13.8; 63.1% female; 2018/2019); W2 (n=272; mean age=16.5; 74.0% female; 2020); and W3 (n=227; mean age=18.0; 78.4% female; 2022/2023). Subclinical anxiety, depression, psychoticism, and general psychopathology were measured with the Brief Symptom Inventory-53. Multilevel linear regression models with imputed data sets were used to test cross-wave differences in each psychopathology outcome (controlling for age-related increases), effects of time since the beginning of the pandemic and stringency of pandemic-related measures, and effects of several sociodemographic predictors on levels and changes in psychopathology (from W1 to W2, and from W1 to W3). Results: Results indicated limited overall early increases in psychopathology (only for depression from W1 to W2), and some decreases in psychopathology levels from W1 to W3 (for anxiety and general psychopathology). Girls and those reporting same-gender attraction reported higher levels of nearly all symptoms. Conclusion: Although most youth in this sample were resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic, some groups consistently showed high psychopathology levels. Attention is still needed for groups that were at risk before the pandemic, notably, LGTBQIA+ youth.",

          "abstract": "Learning to predict threat based on environmental cues, and to adapt behaviour accordingly, is critical to human survival. This type of learning is governed by distinct systems in the brain. Model-free learning is reflexive and computationally efficient, allowing for rapid responses based on past experience. In contrast, model-based learning is more flexible and relies on an internal model of the environment, which can be updated without direct experience. To enhance the translational value of human fear-conditioning research and facilitate the interpretation of fear-reduction interventions, it is essential to determine what type of learning underlies commonly used measures of conditioned responding. To address this question, we evaluated whether fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance responses (SCRs) reflected model-free and/or model-based learning in three fear-conditioning experiments (total n = 132). All experiments included a phase in which the value of the US was decreased through instructions, or through removal of the US electrode (US devaluation), enabling us to distinguish between model-based and model-free learning processes. In the first two experiments, FPS responses remained elevated after US devaluation, reflecting model-free learning, while SCRs updated instantly, indicating model-based control. In the third experiment, both measures followed a model-based pattern. We speculate that these differences between experiments are due to decreased uncertainty and overall less differential conditioning (FPS) in the third experiment. In sum, while SCRs seem best explained by a model-based account of learning, FPS responses appear able to index both model-free and model-based learning, with the balance between these two systems potentially depending on the level of uncertainty in the environment.",

          "abstract": "Childhood maltreatment significantly impacts future mental health, but the mechanisms linking maltreatment and psychopathology remain unclear. Neurocognitive adaptations following maltreatment may constitute a latent vulnerability for mental health problems. While previous research shows that maltreatment alters threat and reward processing, its effects on learning and decision-making are poorly understood. We investigated how childhood maltreatment influences future learning and decision-making motivated by win-seeking vs. loss-avoidance in volatile environments. Adolescents aged 12-17 with (n=59) and without (n=46) maltreatment exposure completed a probabilistic reversal learning task with separate win-seeking and loss-avoidance conditions during fMRI. We employed computational modelling to assess latent learning processes. We explored effects of the extent of maltreatment and psychiatric symptoms. A belief-based Hidden Markov model showed that maltreatment-exposed individuals expected less stable reward contingencies in in the win-seeking condition than controls. Congruently, maltreated adolescents perseverated less and thus outperformed controls after reversals in the win-seeking condition. At the neural level, maltreated adolescents displayed lower right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation associated with environmental changes (upcoming reversals). In maltreated adolescents, lower estimates of stability in the win condition were associated with more psychiatric symptoms and impaired performance during stable task phases. Together, our results show that childhood maltreatment may lead to neurocognitive alterations that enhance flexibility in win-seeking contexts, consistent with an adaptive calibration account of maltreatment. These alterations, if excessive, lead to maladaptive decision-making in stable environments and may also contribute to the development of psychiatric symptoms.",

Care workers provided information on adolescents’ demographics (i.e., age, gender, and nationality) and care history variables (i.e., age at entry into care, number of out-of-home placements). Adolescents self-reported their internalizing and externalizing problems, perception of the group climate, and school engagement.\nResults: After accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., adolescents nested within residential facilities, the results showed that higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and having experience multiple out-of-home placements, were associated with lower levels of school engagement. In contrast, the perception of an open group climate was related to higher levels of school engagement.\nConclusions: This study highlights the importance of factors associated with school engagement, which are essential for developing guidelines and recommendations to help practitioners and group care workers support adolescents with school-related issues.",

We investigated how population-level behavioural traits influence the proportion of terrestrial protected area by using large-scale cross-cultural surveys and geospatial data from 75 countries. We show that behavioural traits explain more variation in protected area coverage than economic indicators alone. Furthermore, trust is negatively associated with protected area coverage at the country level, suggesting that high-trust societies rely more on informal conservation practices. These findings challenge conventional models focused on economic and governance drivers and highlight the need for policies that align with population behaviours. Integrating behavioural insights into conservation planning could unlock more effective biodiversity conservation strategies in the era of environmental changes.",

Using primary data from 12 studies (N = 40 interaction effects), we analyzed how age, gender, and education moderate the effectiveness of defaults compared to active choice conditions. Results show no consistent and rarely any interaction effects, suggesting defaults influence food decisions similarly across socio-demographic groups. A possible exception is that harmful defaults may be more effective among less educated individuals.

          "abstract": "The integration of social robots into educational contexts is steadily increasing, as these agents are used to foster engagement, support personalized learning, and create interactive experiences. In these contexts, empathy towards a social robot is a crucial mechanism to build trust, motivation, and social connections. Narrative framing has been shown to support the elicitation of empathy. However, little is known about how children’s empathy towards robots is affected by different narrative framing and how individual factors shape this relationship. Across two preregistered experiments, we investigated 7-15-year-olds’ empathy towards a social robot in focus groups (Experiment 1; n = 19) and the effect of narrative framing (sad vs. neutral), baseline empathy, age, and gender thereon in an experimental study (Experiment 2; n = 73). Experiment 1 showed that robot perception, personal experiences, and social norms affected children’s empathy towards a robot. Experiment 2 showed no significant effects of narrative framing, age, or baseline empathy on children’s empathy towards the robot. However, varying the narrative framing of the robot resulted in gender differences in elicited empathy, with girls showing higher empathy than boys in the neutral narrative condition. Our findings indicate that contextual and relational cues might exert a stronger influence on children’s empathic responses towards robots than developmental factors or dispositional traits specific to individual children. The two experiments that compose this study offer\nvaluable insights into how empathy might be elicited through social robots. These insights hold promise for informing how best to design robotic agents that children can connect with in meaningful and effective ways in education and learning contexts.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",

          "abstract": "Working memory and processing speed were previously shown to mediate the effect of age on real-world path integration performance, and the current study investigated whether such mediating effects could similarly apply to visual path integration in a virtual environment. Neuropsychological assessment showed letter-number sequencing performance as the only working memory variable that mediated the effect of age on path integration performance. Self-reported computer experience, performance in another test of working memory (spatial span), and tests of processing speed (letter and number comparisons), and verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test), all failed to mediate the age effects on path integration performance. Taken together, we interpreted these findings as representing a divergence between the visuospatial processes engaged when performing the spatial span and visual path integration tasks, and that the cognitive test measures of processing speed might be less sensitive to visual path integration performance, which indexed less perceptual processing than real-world path integration due to the absence of proprioceptive cues. Importantly, this study demonstrated path integration as an inherently complex navigation task that may engage cognitive processes or functions differently under distinct environmental or testing conditions. As a marked decline in path integration ability is commonly observed among older adults who are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the current findings will have positive benefits for future studies that aim to pinpoint the cognitive processes or factors that mediate or underlie the navigational difficulties of aged individuals with incipient AD.",

          "abstract": "The promise of social robot applications for children’s education has attracted growing enthusiasm over the past decade, with the potential to augment and support diverse learning outcomes. However, the adoption of education robots and their expected benefits for children are yet to be\nrealised, due to complexity, cost, and variability between robots. Soft robots offer a possible solution. However, a concern is that these robots may be seen as less competent, decreasing their adoption and utility in learning environments. In this preregistered, mixed-methods study, we investigated teachers’ (n = 120) perception of 12 hard and soft social robots along different dimensions, learning tasks, roles, and contexts. Teachers perceived hard robots as more competent, human-like, and familiar than soft robots. Soft robots were perceived as more physically/visually warm. Hard robots were also more likely to be perceived as suitable for “technical tasks” and adopting a teacher/tutor role for supporting the learning of adults or groups. Soft robots were more likely to be evaluated as suitable for use with younger learners in individual learning contexts and playing the role of a co-learner/novice. This study provides a detailed account of how soft and hard robot features influence teachers’ perceptions of robot suitability for education applications. The findings directly inform how to optimise the design and situation of social robots to maximize adoption, effectiveness, and accessibility across diverse learners and learning contexts. By highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between competence and warmth, this research challenges theoretical assumptions that complex hard robots are universally superior in educational settings.",

          "abstract": "Background.  Emotional and behavioural difficulties have been shown to be precursors of later mental health issues. The objectives of the current study were to: 1) identify developmental trajectories of emotional and behavioural difficulties, from preschool to adolescence, for the five Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scales; 2) identify for each scale the variables that contributed to the likelihood of a child being in a high problem trajectory; and 3) examine the trends and relative risk of belonging to a specific trajectory group over time by analyzing variables that were repeated over multiple waves. \nMethods.  The study utilized data from an Australian longitudinal cohort of 1,910 children recruited at age 8 months. Parent-reported SDQ data were collected across seven waves from ages 4 to 13 years, with additional child, environmental, and parental concern variables. Person-centred group-based trajectory models were employed to identify developmental trajectories for each of the five SDQ subscales.     \nResults. Depending on the scale, four or five development trajectories were identified. Quality of Life was identified as a protective factor, while global temperament (where a child is perceived to be more difficult by a parent), specific child temperament traits, maternal distress, socio-economic disadvantage, early parental concern, and maternal education level were predictors of being in a high problem trajectory. Notably, these predictors varied across different scales. Additionally, two variables introduced in later data collection waves - number of social activities and a health concern report from a health professional - were significant predictors. \nConclusions. The findings underscore the importance of capturing parental perspectives of their child’s early behaviors, alongside other measures of child, family and environmental factors. Specifically, asking parents about perceived difficulty of their child (the global temperament question) could help identify children at risk of emotional and behavioral problems in the early years, thereby facilitating timely intervention.",

A mostly unacknowledged fact is that a particular type of non-normality can make the coefficient capturing this association non-zero. To further understand this connection, a theoretical investigation was conducted. A generalization of Isserli’s theorem from multivariate normal densities to all elliptical densities is presented. Through this generalization, it was found that the family of elliptical densities (which includes the multivariate normal) cannot generate a product-interaction term. Moreover, asymmetry in lower and/or higher dimensions can induce a product-interaction term. Special case studies are presented where the variables are unidimensional symmetric, but jointly non-symmetric, resulting in a moderated multiple regression model. A call is made for researchers to think carefully and decide when they have a true interaction term, theorized a priori, and when non-normality is mimicking an interaction effect.",

          "abstract": "In the domain of memory research, there are strong relationships between the accuracy and response times (RT) for choices in tasks such as recognition memory and recall. The strongest unification of these variables to come out of cognitive psychology is in the sequential sampling model framework, in which evidence accumulates in a noisy fashion until a threshold for a given response is reached. In this chapter, we provide an overview of these models within the memory domain. We begin with the classical diffusion model along with the motivations for the \"full\" diffusion model which includes variability in drift rates and starting points and describe how such models can produce interpretable parameter estimates for testing psychological theory. In addition, we summarize the connections between diffusion models and signal detection theory, extensions to confidence, recall, and continuous responses, and how such models can serve as back-end decision models for theories of retrieval.",

          "abstract": "One of the most common method of eliciting false memories in the laboratory is the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger \\&amp; McDermott, 1995), where participants study a set of items that are all similar to a non-presented critical lure. A common finding is that false recognition to critical lures is much higher than to other non-presented items and in some cases is even comparable to true recognition, regardless of whether similarity is semantic or structural (e.g., phonological or orthographic) relations. While there exists a handful of computational models of this paradigm, they have only been applied to semantic but not structural false recognition, they have not been fit at the level of individual participants, and they have not been applied to response times (RTs). We present a global matching model that addresses all three of these current gaps. Global similarity of semantic and structural representations drives a pair of linear ballistic accumulators, which are used to produce decisions as well as complete RT distributions. In addition to being able to account for heightened false recognition of critical lures, the model was able to account for differences across both individual participants and items, lower correlations between semantic and structural false recognition than true recognition, differences in false recognition across levels of processing, improved true recognition but not false recognition with higher study time, and heightened false recognition under speed emphasis. The model suggests that semantic and structural false recognition can be explained using only a single retrieval mechanism.",

Previous research has focused on TCTSY offered in group settings. The present study examined experiences of individuals practicing TCTSY one-to-one (i.e., one client, one TCTSY facilitator). Study aims were to: (1) learn about participants’ experiences with and reasons for attending one-to-one TCTSY; (2) describe and compare participants’ experiences between group and one-to-one yoga settings; (3) explore participants’ perceptions of the impacts of TCTSY on their trauma healing; and (4) document participants’ intentions for continued one-to-one TCTSY use. Semistructured interviews were offered to participants at completion of a longitudinal observational study of one-to-one TCTSY; 4 of the 10 participants agreed to be interviewed. Interviewees were located in the United States and self-reported experiencing childhood trauma and a current PTSD diagnosis. Following the consensual qualitative research method, domains were initially created deductively by the team. Adjustments, as well as categories and core ideas, were created inductively. Results indicated that participants: (1) preferred one-to-one over groups because of perceived safety and comfort; (2) had positive experiences with TCTSY; (3) perceived biopsychosocial benefits from the practice and described using TCTSY principles outside of sessions; and (4) intended to practice indefinitely. This study provided insight to the lived experiences of participants who use TCTSY as complementary care. Yoga facilitators and clinical trauma care providers are recommended to collaborate to offer one-to-one somatic-based approaches to create more access options for trauma healing.",

This paper\ninvestigates the relationship between technology adoption and urban mobility dynamics, framing\nthe exploration within the ’mobilities turn’ conceptual framework. We introduce the Digital Mobility\nModel (DMM)—an agent-based model designed to explore how digital technologies influence\nindividual mobility patterns and delve into how technological advancements could shape or reshape\ninequalities at the urban level. The DMM employs the concept of ”learning by moving,” wherein\nindividuals acquire digital skills during their mobility experiences, thereby affecting their ability\nto access digitally enabled places. The model simulates the interaction between individuals (i.e.,\ndynamic agents) and places (i.e., static agents) demonstrating how technology adoption dynamics\nresult in unequal mobility patterns, which in turn impact access to urban services. As such the\nDMM provides a novel theoretical framework, bridging mobility studies and ICT approaches, and\nunderscores its potential for understanding the evolving landscape of digital inequalities in urban\ncontexts, which contributes to ongoing discussions on mobility, technology, and societal transformations.\nKeywords: Mobilities, Digital divide, Digital mobility, Agent-based model, Technology adoption",

How should we rethink career development in research? Traditionally, 'talent' (picked locally or acquired externally) is hired into positions with an expectation to perform along similar and standardized norms; we argue for more diverse and individual approaches to academic careers as part of academic citizenship. We outline a career programme for scientists and academic leaders developed by professors at the University of Copenhagen. We describe the programme’s structure, content and outcomes, and evaluate the participant’s gains from the first two rounds, each lasting 10 months.

          "abstract": "Accurate occupational classification from open-ended survey responses is vital for research in sociology, economics, and political science, yet manual coding remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. We propose a novel pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval (RAG) to automate the assignment of International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes. Drawing on survey data from a sample of recently arrived Afghan and Syrian refugees in Germany, we preprocess noisy occupational descriptions using LLMs and apply vector-based similarity search to retrieve candidate ISCO codes. The final classification is selected by LLMs, constrained to the retrieved candidates and accompanied by interpretable justifications. We evaluate the system’s performance against expert-coded labels, demonstrating high agreement and robustness across languages. Our findings suggest that RAG-powered LLMs can substantially improve the accuracy, scalability, and accessibility of occupational classification, with particular benefits for multilingual and resource-constrained research settings. In addition, we describe a prototypical pipeline that other researchers can readily adapt for applying LLMs to similar classification tasks, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and broader adoption.",

The effect exceeds 0.1 standard deviations in recent elections and is strongest in poorer areas and in towns with high prior far-right support. We find evidence consistent with the symbolic mechanism and mixed evidence for the economic one. TdF exposure increases local GDP per capita, effects on voting are larger when French riders win stages, and a two-wave survey around the 2025 TdF provides suggestive evidence that residents in exposed towns report greater recognition.

We emphasize that risk tolerance is not a fixed individual trait, but rather an emergent disposition that arises from the combination of evolutionary pressures towards risk-aversion, lived experiences—particularly in critical developmental periods—and cultural transmission within and across generational cohorts. We aim to show how, in an uncertain world, people  adjust their behaviors towards risky prospects by relying on evolved social learning strategies, as these provide general-purpose mechanisms for interpreting environmental conditions across different causally-opaque domains. We introduce an integrative theoretical framework that explicitly details how each of these factors—personal and environmental conditions, development, cultural history, and evolutionary trajectories—contribute to our attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors regarding risk.

In their framework, minimum RPM can benefit consumers by encouraging retailers to hold sufficient inventory, thereby lowering prices in high-demand states. We relax the assumption of perfect competition and analyze a continuum of downstream market structures, from monopoly to perfect competition. We show how the interaction of demand uncertainty and retail competition generates distinct regimes, and we identify the conditions under which RPM improves or harms consumer welfare. The results provide guidance for both antitrust policy and managerial strategy, highlighting that the pro-competitive effects of RPM are confined to industries with moderate demand uncertainty and intermediate levels of retail competition.",

Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a two-wave model that distinguishes the visible displacement of human labor by AI tools from the invisible redistribution of attention via algorithmic recommendation, highlighting the societal importance of this shift; (2) we define three measurable indicators—Structure Index (SI), Reusability Index (RI), and Closure Rate (CR)—to operationalize the process quality of discourse and enable quantitative study; and (3) we derive falsifiable predictions suggesting that high–SI/RI/CR discourse is more likely to remain visible, while conclusion-only content is systematically down-scored. We further argue that nonproductive escalation signals (anger, provocation, spike-type virality) degrade long-term visibility. This work bridges algorithmic fairness research with the emerging need to understand AI-mediated social gatekeeping, and it provides a foundation for future empirical validation and platform design intervention.",

          "abstract": "Studies analyzing panel data have gained popularity during the last decades, especially due to the availability of long-running panel surveys and the increasing interest in estimating causal effects. While researchers have investigated the magnitude of measurement error in survey data, little is known about the consequences of measurement error in outcome variables for longitudinal analyses, such as first-difference and fixed-effects models. In this paper, we investigate this issue using the example of monthly earnings and Mincer-style regressions, which are applied to survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Assuming that administrative earnings information reflects true earnings, we show that individuals typically underreport short-term earnings changes in survey data, which can lead to increasing biases with shorter panel durations. We demonstrate that this problem is substantially mitigated when using fixed-effects models, particularly when longer panels are available. Our findings thus imply that measurement error in the dependent variable can bias estimates for models focusing on short-time changes, but has negligible impacts when using long-running data and adequate methods.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",

Survey instruments rely on self-reports that may mask the existence of extended family ties. A population-scale family network can help better understand this measurement challenge. \nMethods\nA population scale family network is linked to records of every government-compensated informal care relation involving recipients over age 65. This sociocentric kinship network allows for measuring family network distance and classifying caregivers as direct kin, extended kin, or true non-kin, and measure family network distance for all ties. Logistic regression models compare caregiver characteristics between extended kin and true non-kin to validate the criterion validity.\nResults\nAround one-third of presumed non-kin caregivers are extended kin rather than non-kin—separated by two degrees in the family network. These extended kin are more distant than direct kin (e.g., cousins) but far closer than the general population. They also display caregiving patterns more akin to family, including heavier care loads and greater co-residence. True non-kin caregivers face distinct constraints, like greater geographical distance and age-related barriers. All caregivers are both disproportionately female, of lower socio-economic status, and more likely to have a migration background.",

          "abstract": "The current study aimed to identify longitudinal trajectories of precarious employment during emerging adulthood (18-24 years) and examine associations with short- and long-term mental health among Australians. Group-based trajectory modelling and adjusted linear/binary regression were applied to panel data from the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The analytic sample (n=499; person-year observations=5,887) included Australian residents employed from 2001 to 2008 between ages 18-24, with subsequent measures of mental health taken at 25 and 35 years. Informed by a youth advisory group, employment precarity was measured using composite scores derived from subjective survey items assessing perceived job security and job control, and mental health was assessed using the self-reported Mental Health Inventory-Five Item (MHI-5). Two distinct trajectories of precarious employment were identified: persistent high precarity, and low and decreasing precarity. Individuals in both persistent high precarity trajectories had significantly poorer mental health at age 25, whereas by age 35, poorer mental health was observed only for persistent job insecurity. Associations between precarious employment and mental health also differed by sex, varying across job control and job security dimensions. These findings suggest that chronically high employment precarity during emerging adulthood is associated with poorer short- and long-term mental health, while transitioning into more stable and secure employment during this developmental period may be protective. Policymakers and employers can help to safeguard the current and future mental health of young Australians by improving job security, stability and autonomy, as well as expanding access to mental health supports.",

Focusing on competition policy and a subsidy programme for foreign investors, it shows how the regime has reshaped the regulatory state in ways distinct from other autocratic populist contexts. Core institutional carriers of the regulatory state have remained in place as non-majoritarian institutions and were even granted greater de jure insulation from government, yet in practice they have been undermined and their authority - along with that of other institutions in the wider regulatory ecosystem (law enforcement bodies, inspectorates, and others) - systematically suppressed. The result is an eroded, hybridised model of the regulatory state: the government has carved out a role for itself to decisively shape and direct sectoral policy, often in an arbitrary manner, with a distinct form of deregulation, namely through the outright non-enforcement of substantial regulatory standards.",

Prior research on speaker-intention discriminations in autism has often employed static stimuli that lack ecological validity, did not capture multimodal communication cues, and primarily focused on children. The present study examined how autistic and non-autistic adults infer speaker intentions and emotional valence in dynamic, naturalistic videos. Participants (N = 73) viewed 50 brief video vignettes from the Relational Inference in Social Communication database, depicting literal, sarcastic, teasing, or prosocial lie scenarios. After each video, they identified the speaker’s communicative intent and rated the emotional response of the addressee. Participants also completed two measures of autistic characteristics (Autism Spectrum Quotient; Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory). Autistic participants showed lower speaker-intention discrimination than non-autistic participants, whereas valence ratings differed modestly by group but followed broadly similar patterns across intentions. Autistic traits predicted lower speaker-intention discrimination in non-autistic adults but were unrelated (Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory) or positively associated (Autism Quotient) in autistic adults. These findings highlight both shared and differing aspects of speaker-intention discriminations and happiness rating across groups and support the value of combining categorical and trait-based approaches to better understand individual differences in social communication.",

          "authors": "Research Bridge publisher; Nyamwaro Lorna Kerubo; Elizabeth Wachiuri; Eric Namusonge",
          "abstract": "The food and beverage manufacturing sector in Kenya faces persistent challenges related to demand variability, perish ability, and inadequate cold chain infrastructure, which amplify inefficiencies within supply chains. A major driver of these inefficiencies is shortage gaming, a phenomenon where customers exaggerate orders during actual or perceived shortages in anticipation of rationing. This behaviour distorts demand signals, complicates production planning, and increases inventory and operational costs, thereby undermining firm performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between shortage gaming, as a dimension of the bullwhip effect, and the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive research design anchored in a post-positivist philosophy, targeting 217 food and beverage firms registered with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. A sample of 208 respondents comprising logistics and procurement managers was selected using Yamane’s formula and simple random sampling. Primary data was collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires, and reliability was confirmed using Cronbach’s Alpha (α ≥ 0.7). Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis with the aid of SPSS software. The findings revealed that shortage gaming significantly influences firm performance. Customers’ exaggerated orders and promotional mechanisms such as discounts and rebates were found to create artificial demand spikes, leading to inefficiencies in production planning and inventory management. Regression results indicated a strong positive correlation (R = 0.871) and high explanatory power (R² = 0.759), confirming that 75.9% of the variation in firm performance is explained by shortage gaming practices. The study concludes that shortage gaming has a significant and positive effect on profitability, sales volume, and market share. It recommends enhancing supply chain visibility, adopting transparent rationing policies, and strengthening supplier partnerships to mitigate opportunistic ordering behaviours and improve performance.",

The project aims to enhance the physical facilities and develop the capabilities of local public service providers in early childhood, such as health centers, branch commissions, and kindergartens. The project is faced with a number of challenges as there are gaps in services for identification and provision of programs for children aged 0-6 with development delays and disabilities. Ensuring a smooth transition between providers depends on each sector being able to effectively provide the service and the coordination of services.

          "abstract": "This study examined the relationship between order batching as a component of the bullwhip effect and the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. The research was motivated by persistent inefficiencies in the sector’s supply chain, including inventory volatility, rising operational costs, and stagnant contribution to GDP despite the Vision 2030 target of 20%. Order batching, manifested through correlated, random, and balanced ordering, has been identified in literature as a key driver of demand variability and operational inefficiencies. The study adopted a descriptive research design with a post-positivist philosophical approach. The target population was 217 food and beverage firms registered by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, from which 208 respondents were sampled using simple random sampling. Primary data was collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires and analysed using SPSS version 25. Both correlation and regression analyses were applied. The findings revealed that order batching significantly and positively influences firm performance, explaining 72.3% of the variance. Specifically, batching improved production efficiency, resource utilisation, cost savings, and customer responsiveness. The study concludes that effective batching strategies mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance profitability, sales volume, and market share. It recommends adoption of demand-driven, collaborative, and balanced batching practices to improve competitiveness.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the role of cyber movements and social media activism in addressing violence against women in Bangladesh through the frameworks of cyberfeminism and hashtag feminism. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 women—including survivors, students, and activists—and content analysis of major online campaigns (#JusticeForTonu, #MeToo, #RageAgainstRape), the study examines how women perceive digital activism, the barriers they encounter, and the broader societal impacts. Findings highlight that online platforms provide survivors with new opportunities to share experiences, overcome stigma, and mobilize solidarity across geographic and social divides. Hashtags and viral campaigns were perceived as powerful tools for raising awareness, amplifying marginalized voices, and pressuring institutions to acknowledge gender-based violence. However, participation remains uneven, shaped by structural barriers such as the digital divide, weak infrastructure, and lack of literacy, as well as cultural constraints including fear of retaliation, patriarchal norms, and stigma. Women also face trolling, online harassment, and emotional exhaustion when engaging in activism. Despite these challenges, cyber movements are reshaping public discourse, empowering survivors, influencing policy debates, and connecting local struggles to global feminist movements. The study concludes that while digital activism alone cannot ensure systemic reform, it plays a critical role in breaking silence, mobilizing awareness, and advancing social justice in patriarchal contexts like Bangladesh",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces Afrostemy as a Black and decolonial call for epistemological justice, aimed at restructuring science from the insurgent cultures of the Global South. Rather than seeking mere entry into existing structures of STEM, Afrostemy demands their reconstitution as plural and liberatory spaces. It denounces the complicity of modern science in epistemicide and in racial, gender, and colonial exclusion, while reclaiming the knowledges, memories, and practices systematically silenced by Eurocentric hegemony. Emerging at the crossroads of ancestral memory, pedagogical praxis, and epistemic insubordination, Afrostemy proposes a science that listens, resists, and reimagines. Grounded in Afro-Brazilian, Latin American, and Global South epistemologies, it fuses theoretical inquiry with pedagogical experimentation, engaging schools, laboratories, and quilombos of thought. Drawing from concepts such as cognitive justice, Exu’s pedagogy of the crossroads, and embodied methodologies, Afrostemy insists on the centrality of ancestral knowledge systems, spirituality, and collective practices in reconfiguring scientific production. Methodologically, the article weaves together critical analysis of coloniality in science with examples of decolonial pedagogies in Brazil, particularly in biosciences education. These cases illustrate how scientific curricula can be redesigned to incorporate Afro-diasporic philosophies, Indigenous cosmologies, and alternative ontologies of nature. In doing so, Afrostemy does not simply critique exclusion, but actively articulates modes of epistemic repair and insurgent imagination. Ultimately, Afrostemy is proposed as a living methodology of resistance, creativity, and epistemic plurality—an invitation to rethink science not as a neutral and universal enterprise, but as a contested field that must be decolonized in order to become truly diverse, just, and transformative.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, several major terror attacks in the name of political Islam have shaken Europe. This study examines how social media users respond to Jihadist terrorism when discussing immigration-related issues from a comparative perspective. The theoretical predictions, derived from combining terror management theory, group threat theory, and the concept of social resilience, are empirically tested using validated Keyword-Assisted Topic Modeling (keyATM). Unlike traditional topic modeling approaches, keyATM is a semi-supervised method that balances inductive discovery with theory-driven guidance. It incorporates pre-specified keywords, enhancing both the precision and interpretability of results while mitigating the impact of researcher subjectivity. The study is based on over 100,000 time-stamped and geo-coded Tweets on immigration and related issues across four languages in the week following eleven major Islamist terrorist attacks in nine European cities. Consistent with the theoretical predictions, the findings reveal that both threat-related and tolerance-related topics emerge prominently across all four languages. Deeper analyses uncover temporal shifts in the discourse: While initial reactions often reflect nationalist and exclusionary views, later stages show a rise in inclusionary and tolerance-oriented topics. These results highlight the dynamic nature of social media debates on migration issues after dramatic events, where initial threat-driven responses often give way to more inclusive and tolerance-oriented discussions as time progresses.",

It introduces a new configuration model that reveals how autonomy, inclusivity, and mission- orientation interact as complementary rather than competing dimensions of state capacity. We demonstrate through comparative case analysis that optimal state capacity requires balanced achievement across all three dimensions, which is not static and variable as evidenced through historical examples.",

We look at the depoliticized topic of immigration in Denmark and analyze 27 anti-immigration, pro-immigration, and attitudinally mixed group discussions. Notwithstanding its waning political significance in this context, we demonstrate that moralized boundaries contribute to the stickiness, solidification, and continued potency of division over immigration. We argue that previous moralization explains focus groups’ perception of division as persistent and insuperable, with disagreements over immigration signifying fundamental differences of moral character between people. Moreover, it sustains a self-conception as political pariahs among anti-immigration participants, despite the contemporary political normalization of their views. Centering citizens’ shared understanding, the study emphasizes how moral boundaries keep division alive—ready to be reactivated and mobilized.",

This study aims to analyze these dynamics among Indonesian female supporters, with a particular focus on Sundanese and Javanese cultural contexts. A qualitative research approach was employed, combining questionnaires and in-depth unstructured interviews. The sample consisted of 1,078 respondents, including 497 female supporters (from groups such as Mojang Bobotoh, Viking Ladies, and Bonita), 233 male supporters, 257 members of the general public, and 91 sports figures. Findings indicate that collaborative efforts and specific measures are needed to ensure the safety of female supporters. Approximately 47.5% of respondents perceived their presence positively, contributing to a more vibrant match atmosphere, although 15% associated it with negative emotional reactions when their team lost. Furthermore, 63% agreed that women are capable of taking care of themselves, while 21.5% noted that their loyalty occasionally conflicts with cultural etiquette. The study concludes that female supporters of Persib and Persebaya play a vital role in enriching Indonesia’s supporter culture. Their expectations and perceptions align with broader societal demands for more active and inclusive female participation in sports. While their potential to promote enthusiasm and peace in football should be encouraged, challenges such as discrimination and internal conflicts remain. The integration of Sundanese and Javanese cultural values by female supporters demonstrates that football fandom can coexist with the preservation of local cultural traditions.",

          "abstract": "The rapid integration of social media into daily life has transformed modes of communication, self-expression, and social interaction, particularly among university students. While social media offers opportunities for connection, entertainment, and knowledge exchange, growing concerns canter on its implications for psychological well-being. This study critically examines the complex relationship between social media use and psychological health indicators, focusing on dimensions such as addiction, social comparison, cyberbullying, and awareness. Grounded in Social Comparison Theory and Uses and Gratifications Theory, the research investigates how different patterns of engagement active versus passive use and socially motivated versus escapist behaviours influence outcomes including anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and overall well-being. A cross-sectional survey design was employed, capturing diverse student experiences across multiple cultural contexts. Findings highlight that the quality and emotional consequences of social media engagement are more salient than the quantity of time spent online. Negative online behaviours such as compulsive checking, fear of missing out, and cyberbullying contribute to psychological distress, whereas meaningful interactions and supportive experiences can serve as protective factors. Importantly, awareness of social media’s potential risks emerged as a moderating variable, mitigating the adverse effects of harmful encounters and underscoring the role of digital literacy. The study advances understanding of the nuanced interplay between social media use and mental health, emphasizing the importance of differentiating between adaptive and maladaptive patterns of engagement. It concludes with recommendations for integrating awareness programs, promoting healthier online environments, and developing strategies at both individual and platform levels to support psychological resilience.",

Using cluster analysis, we identified three collective action archetypes and evaluated their persistence with survival analysis. Nationally, initiatives had a 75% probability of lasting beyond 15 years. Those with high initial resource abundance persisted longest (84%). Initiatives with low initial abundance still endured at similar rates under favorable collective action conditions (78%) but had greater abandonment rates when coupled with low poverty, low productivity, and high surveillance costs (54%).

          "abstract": "Why do African Americans vote in huge numbers, even when enthusiasm for the Democratic Party is low? For decades, scholars pointed to racial solidarity and loyalty to the Democrats. But what if hostility, not loyalty, is a driving force? This paper introduces the defensive turnout theory, which is the idea that in racially charged elections, many Black voters cast ballots not out of enthusiasm for Democrats, but to block Republican threats. Using standard logistic regression models to analyze the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) data, the study finds that hostility toward the Republican Party is positively associated with Black turnout rates more than warmth toward the Democratic Party. Each 10-point increase in anti-Republican sentiment is positively associated with a voting odd of 9%, while equivalent Democratic warmth is counterintuitively associated with a 14.7% decrease in turnout odds at a 95% confidence interval even after accounting for key sociodemographic factors. While causality cannot be inferred from the cross-sectional design, the 2020 election presents a unique case of a high-stakes and racially charged electoral landmark, which invites scholars and practitioners to rethink what truly motivates Black turnout and what belonging means when democracy itself feels contested in a polarized era.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the influence of regional financial ratios on budget implementation performance in Indonesian local governments within the framework of fiscal decentralization. Using the Stewardship Theory as a theoretical foundation, we analyze how fiscal independence and financial efficiency affect the ability of districts/municipalities to translate budget plans into concrete programs. This study used panel data from 250 districts/cities throughout Indonesia for the period 2018-2023, resulting in 1,500 balanced observations. This analysis uses a Fixed Effects Model to control for unobserved regional heterogeneity. The results reveal a counterintuitive finding: the fiscal independence ratio does not significantly affect the performance of budget implementation (coefficient = 0.008380, p = 0.7395), contrary to conventional assumptions about fiscal autonomy. In contrast, the financial efficiency ratio showed a strong positive effect on implementation performance (coefficient = 0.193478, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that resource optimization capabilities are more important than resource availability. These findings suggest that effective management in local government is better realized through efficient financial management than revenue-generating autonomy. This study contributes to the fiscal decentralization literature by challenging the assumption of an autonomy-performance link and provides practical implications for policymakers to prioritize capacity building in financial management rather than increasing fiscal independence. The results support a paradigm shift from a quantity-focused approach to a quality-focused approach in regional financial management in Indonesia's decentralized governance system.",

This study aims to investigate the strategies that social studies teachers use to cope with students’ emotional reactions when teaching about historical traumatic events, as well as their preferred teaching methods and professional support needs. The research was conducted with 25 social studies teachers working at lower-secondary (middle) schools in the central district of Malatya, Türkiye, using a phenomenological qualitative approach. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed via content analysis. The findings reveal that teachers employ strategies such as fostering open communication, building empathy, and creating a supportive classroom environment to help students cope with emotionally charged historical content. Storytelling, the use of real-life examples, visual materials, and drama activities are among the most prominent methods reported. Teachers also adapt their language to be age-appropriate and tend to avoid graphic or potentially traumatic details. The study further highlights teachers’ expressed need for in-service training, psychological support, and access to expert guidance when teaching sensitive historical topics. These results underscore the importance of equipping social studies teachers with appropriate coping and teaching strategies to support students’ historical awareness and emotional well-being.",

          "abstract": "Leadership in higher education is increasingly defined not only by technical expertise but also by relational and behavioral soft skills that are essential for building trust. This article proposes a conceptual framework linking ten leadership soft skills, including collaboration, communication, initiative, leadership ability, personal development, personal effectiveness, planning and organization, presentation skills, critical thinking, and technological competence, to the multidimensional construct of trustworthiness, which is composed of ability, benevolence, and integrity. Drawing on transformational leadership, servant leadership, social exchange theory, leader–member exchange (LMX), and attribution theory of trust, the framework positions soft skills as antecedents that shape leaders’ perceived trustworthiness. Unlike prevailing leadership models that regard trust as a byproduct of leadership style, this study highlights the microlevel behavioral processes through which soft skills generate credibility, ethical consistency, and benevolence in higher education leadership. The paper contributes theoretically by integrating two distinct strands of scholarship, soft skills and trust, into a unified model, and practically by offering guidance for leadership development initiatives in universities and colleges. Although conceptual, the proposed framework lays the foundation for future empirical studies, particularly those employing structural equation modeling (SEM), to validate the pathways connecting soft skills and trustworthiness across diverse higher education contexts.",

          "authors": "Henry Omoregie Egharevba",
          "abstract": "Solving health problems from a communal perspective remains the most effective way to attain better health systems and indices in society. Nigeria and most other African countries, amidst dwindling health funding, exploding population, rising cost of living, and declining living standards, should be more disposed to adopting this approach because it allows wider access while addressing the issues of inequality, inequity, and discrimination. A population’s health needs are best addressed when there is a better understanding of the population and environmental demographics. This work aims to demonstrate the use of systematic health needs assessment in prioritizing health interventions in resource-limited settings like Nigeria using the Federal Capital Territory as a case study. The author applied profiling of population characteristics, health status, and local health determinant factors to identify priority health needs of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. The result showed that the targeted population had poor health status and indices, such as health insurance coverage, available skilled personnel, neonatal and children under-five health mortality and morbidity rates, quality of life, and health-related injuries. Behavioural measures, health inequalities, local health determinant factors such as employment and work data and environmental hygiene, and national priorities were also considered. The study systematically assessed and discussed the priority health needs of the targeted population. Improving health access and promoting equity through mandatory health insurance, and a focus on reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child’s health were identified as priority health needs to improve the health of the population.",

          "abstract": "With the growing importance of the knowledge economy across Europe and beyond, governments increasingly demand research to deliver tangible economic and societal impact, translating into funding systems incentivizing societally relevant research and leading to an increasing monitoring of societal impact. This commentary pleads for a re-engagement with the ‘geographies of research assessment’. Informed by a dualistic understanding of scale as both fixed and socially constructed, the commentary firstly argues for comparing and contrasting the influence of different national research evaluation systems on geographical knowledge production. Secondly, the contribution conceives of research evaluation systems as a form of scalar politics which enables a view of the actors and networks contesting current evaluation systems and promoting alternatives. The paper concludes that rather than trying to fit the discipline to the system, geographers should instead question which evaluation system would fit the discipline.",

          "abstract": "Applying a linked lives perspective on the nexus between institutions and life-courses, this study examines how spouses’ gendered careers shape retirement incomes across 13 European countries. It connects contextual support for (a)symmetric employment constellations with the redistributiveness of Beveridge- and Bismarck-type pension systems across five life-course policy pathways. Based on 8,068 couple biographies from SHARELIFE (waves 3 and 7), Multichannel Sequence Analysis identifies male-breadwinner, 1.5-earner, and dual-earner constellations. Findings show that reconciliation policies and pension regimes jointly shape retirement income stratification. Dual-earner constellations are most common where defamilization is high and tend to achieve more equal and higher joint incomes. Male-breadwinner couples, despite specialization, often fall short in combined retirement income. In Bismarckian systems, dual-earners compensate individual deficits; 1.5-earners benefit from redistribution or institutional privilege but maintain within-couple inequality. Overall, the interplay of life-course policy contexts and pension design is key to understanding gendered income dynamics in later life.",

The whirlpool is conceptualized as a model of social dynamics in which structural pressures, recognition asymmetries, and emotional divergence spiral into critical thresholds. By formalizing the whirlpool as a dynamic system, the study demonstrates how seemingly chaotic flows resolve into patterned equilibria. This metaphor provides a foundation for analyzing social reproduction, market cycles, and digital attention economies. Through the lens of JX theory, the Naruto whirlpool is reframed as a transdisciplinary symbol of both risk concentration and regenerative balance in human systems.",

          "abstract": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting has shifted from voluntary disclosure to a regulatory imperative and cornerstone of corporate transparency. Traditional cost accounting systems, which emphasize direct, indirect, and overhead costs, often ignore externalities like carbon emissions, social equity investments, and governance overhead. This study investigates how embedding ESG-driven cost allocations reshapes financial reporting and managerial decisions in manufacturing firms. Using a simulated dataset spanning three divisions (Energy, Materials, Consumer), we compare outcomes under conventional accounting and an ESG-adjusted framework that includes carbon pricing equivalents, compliance costs, worker and governance programs. Our results show that ESG adjustments increase reported costs by approximately 20-30% and reduce operating margins by 5-7 percentage points, while significantly improving transparency across environmental, social, and governance metrics. Sensitivity analyses (varying carbon pricing) indicate that margin declines are robust to plausible environmental cost changes, though divisions with higher emissions are most affected. This research contributes to sustainability accounting by operationalizing ESG into cost allocation mechanics rather than treating it as supplementary disclosure. It provides a practical model for managers, regulators, and investors seeking to balance profitability with long-term accountability and risk mitigation.",

The analysis acknowledges the inherent tension between politically driven prosecutions and the core principles of American constitutionalism. Despite this dissonance, the paper demonstrates that politically motivated prosecutions have been a recurrent phenomenon throughout U.S. history. It explores several distinct periods where these tactics were particularly prevalent, including the Progressive Era, the Red Scares, the Vietnam War era, the Civil Rights Era, and the War on Terror. Additionally, the paper investigates the influence of interest groups on shaping and driving these prosecutorial decisions.",

          "abstract": "Education has long been considered a key institution in the reproduction of social inequality. In China, as more people are graduating from college with its expansion, the higher education institution plays an increasingly important role in determining social stratiﬁcation and mobility. In my thesis, I look at how higher education aﬀects earnings inequality by family backgrounds and gender, the two critical aspects of social division. In Chapter1, I start by exploring the economic return of the super-elite colleges – Tsinghua University and Peking University – by family background. The conclusion is that only individuals from privileged family backgrounds beneﬁt from having attended a prestigious college. Then I investigate how college aﬀects the gender pay gap in China, in an era when women have outperformed men in gaining college access. In Chapter 2, I look more closely at the social backgrounds of college students by gender and ﬁnd that girls have better socioeconomic backgrounds than their male counterparts. The predicted gender pay gap for college graduates rises when family background disparities between the sexes are considered. Chapter 3 ﬁnds that, despite the rising of women in college attendance, men and women are becoming more segregated in terms of their majors. A large proportion of the gender pay gap among college graduates is explained by the concentration of women in less lucrative non-STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) majors. The three essays collectively show that increasing access to college does not eliminate earnings inequality in China.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter Hildebrandt investigates the link between the contestability that is key to constitutional democracies on the one hand and the falsifiability of scientific theories on the other hand, with regard to large language models (LLMs). Legally relevant decision-making that is based on the deployment of applications that involve LLMs must be contestable in a court of law. The current flavour of such contestability is focused on transparency, usually framed in terms of the explainability of the model (explainable AI). In the long run, however, the fairness and reliability of these models should be tested in a more scientific manner, based on the falsifiability of the theoretical framework that should underpin the model. This requires that researchers in the domain of LLMs learn to abduct theoretical frameworks, based on the output models of LLMs and the real world patterns they imply, while this abduction should be such that the theory can be inductively tested in a way that allows for falsification. On top of that, researchers need to conduct empirical research to enable such inductive testing. The chapter thus argues that the contestability required under the Rule of Law, should move beyond explanations of how the model generates its output, to whether the real world patterns represented in the model output can falsify the theoretical framework that should inform the model.",

Drawing on 110 studies published in leading extremism and communication journals, the review highlights the productive logics – networks of authorship, methodological choices, and topic selection – that shape the empirical meaning of extremism and constrain its definitional scope.\n\nThe analysis reveals a marked disconnect between the broad, multifaceted conceptualisation of extremism in theory and a narrower empirical focus. Research overwhelmingly concentrates on two categories – far/extreme right and Islamic extremism – which dominate co-authorship networks, case descriptions, and ideological analysis. These two dominant types construct crisis narratives in strikingly similar ways, using overlapping themes to justify hostility and violence, thereby challenging simple political–religious distinctions. This approach foregrounds the interplay between discourse, ideology, and research practice in constructing the meaning of extremism.",

          "abstract": "Sociocultural dynamics of autism-related terminology and the interplay between language, identity, and epistemic justice in the Global South are veiled. Employing a mixed-methods approach, including literature review, surveys, and interviews—the study examines how Chinese-language users perceive and conceptualize Chinese autism-related terms like GuDuZheng (孤独症, GDZ, “GuDu” means “isolation/loneliness” and “Zheng” means disease/symptoms) and ZiBiZheng (自闭症, ZBZ, “ZiBi” means “self closing-off”), as well as their extended versions. Through community collaboration and reflexive thematic analysis, the study addresses how these terms reflect broader social constructs of autism and how autistic individuals engage with diagnostic labels. The findings reveal that “Terms Are Socially Constructed” and “The Concept of Autism in the Chinese Context Has Been Typified as ZiBi (Self-closeness).” Despite societal stigmatization, individuals navigate these challenges by actively engaging with the diagnoses to reinterpret their implications within both Eastern and Western understandings. Drawing from Chinese philosophy such as “The unity of heaven and man,” “The equality of all beings,” and “The harmony,” individuals reconstruct personal narratives that counter mainstream discourses, fostering internal coherence and harmonious interpersonal interactions. As one participant articulated, “Loneliness embodies holistic completeness: Like Zhuangzi’s useless tree thriving in the wilderness, Buddhism’s suchness without fabrication, or Stoic’s alignment with natural reason.” To achieve this completeness, participants advocated that “Everyone from the Community Should Work Together,” suggesting concrete action steps for dismantling structural ableism. This study offers new insights into the development of an indigenous neurodiversity paradigm that resonates with the Chinese socio-linguistic context. It facilitates a quadruple dialogue between Eastern and Western, between researchers and community, among neurodiverse individuals, and between autistic individuals and diagnostic labels. Ultimately, this process enables the reclamation of cultural and individual autonomy in the Global South, empowering autistic individuals to reclaim narrative agency and enhance their well-being.",

At a time of heightened concern for political violence in the US, we assess individual-level associations between self-reported approval of the NRA and support for political violence, willingness to engage in political violence, and attitudes and beliefs linked to political violence.\n\nMethods: Findings are for respondents to Wave 2 (conducted May 18-June 8, 2023) of a nationally representative longitudinal general population survey; participants are members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel. (Data on NRA approval were collected in 2022’s Wave 1.) Prevalences are reported as weighted percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Associations are expressed as adjusted prevalence differences (aPDs), measured in percentage points (pp), with p-values adjusted for the false discovery rate and reported as q-values. \n\nResults: The Wave 2 completion rate was 84.2%; there were 9,385 respondents. The analytic sample for this study comprises the 8,361 (89.1%) respondents who reported their level of approval of the National Rifle Association. Strong or very strong NRA approval was reported by 2,669 respondents (“NRA approvers”; 27.0%, 95% CI 25.7%, 28.2%); 3,423 respondents (46.6%, 95% CI 45.1%, 48.0%) reported non-approval. Only half of NRA approvers (49.8%, 95% CI 47.2%, 52.5%) personally owned firearms. Compared with non-approvers, NRA approvers were more likely to support political violence and to be willing to engage in it. For example, approvers were more than twice as likely as non-approvers to view violence as usually or always justified to advance at least 1 political objective (approvers 44.0%, 95% CI 41.4%, 46.6%; non-approvers 21.5%, 95% CI 19.6%, 23.4%; aPD 18.3pp, 95% CI 14.1pp, 22.5pp; q &lt; 0.001) and to consider it very or extremely likely that they would shoot someone to advance such an objective (approvers 4.2%, 95% CI 2.9%, 5.5%; non-approvers 0.8, 95% CI 0.4%, 1.2%; aPD 4.3pp, 95% CI 2.5pp, 6.1pp; q &lt; 0.001). NRA approvers were more likely than non-approvers to endorse a wide array of beliefs and personal characteristics that have been associated with violence, including political violence.\n\nConclusions: Approval of the NRA is associated with increased support for and willingness to engage in political violence, including lethal violence. These findings can help focus political violence prevention efforts in the United States.",

I first deconstruct the LLM as a mathematical and statistical system, demonstrating\nhow its convincing mimicry of cognition emerges from probabilistic pattern-matching, not\ngenuine understanding. I then establish a philosophical threshold for moral agency by\nsynthesizing Humean, Kantian, and phenomenological perspectives, arguing that agency\nrequires affective sentiment, rational autonomy and subjective, temporal experience—all of\nwhich are absent in LLMs. Using a Jungian framework, I re-interpret studies on “deceptive” and\n“scheming” AI not as discoveries of emergent malice, but as manifestations of the projection of\nour own “Shadow” onto an opaque technological artifact. This misinterpretation leads to\ndangerous, quasi-mythological narratives of AI risk, exemplified by reports such as 'AI 2027'. As\nan alternative, I propose a grounded paradigm for alignment that shifts focus from human-like\nmalice to non-human failure modes. This paper concludes not that LLMs are harmless, but that\ndanger is misplaced.

Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data inconsistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, or infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes. We present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country, suggesting education and material conditions influence conversion. We test this hypothesis by analyzing longitudinal municipality level data from the Mexican Population Census (1950-2020). To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. However, we find effect heterogeneity of education on religious change driven by its interaction with distance to urban centers. These findings are consistent with previous cross-national studies on religious conversion.",

This evidence-based review explores the influence of three primary leadership styles—transformational, transactional, and servant leadership—on healthcare team performance. Transformational leadership is shown to inspire innovation, motivation, and higher staff engagement, while transactional leadership provides structure, accountability, and clarity in high-stakes environments. Servant leadership emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and the prioritization of staff needs, contributing to stronger team morale and reduced turnover. Across multiple studies, leadership styles were consistently linked to patient safety, satisfaction, and the overall quality of care. The findings suggest that healthcare organizations benefit most from adaptive leaders who balance transformational vision, transactional structure, and servant-oriented support. This paper highlights the importance of cultivating evidence-based leadership practices to strengthen organizational performance and ensure sustainable improvements in healthcare delivery.\n\nKeywords: Healthcare leadership, Transformational leadership, Team performance, Patient safety, Staff retention, Evidence-based management",

This type of information is provided at different geographic\nand temporal scales and has become increasingly common and decentralised over\ntime. As a result, there is a gap in knowledge about the quality, characteristics, and\neffects of digitally available air quality information and messaging, which has the\npotential to protect public health. This study addresses this gap by conducting a\nsystematic technology review of publicly available digital platforms, or “channels”, that\nshare real-time information and data about localised air pollution levels. Using the UK\nas a case example, computational methods were leveraged to examine how the data\nunderpinning existing digital air quality information channels (websites, mobile\napplications, sensors, etc.) is generated, and by which entities. This involved\nsystematic searches of Google, the Google Play Store (Android), and Apple App Store\n(iOS) using SerpAPI meta search engine software and a list of search terms. 146\nchannels meeting the inclusion criteria were retained and included in the review.\nSummary statistics from channel metadata show trends surrounding the prevalence of\ncertain types of channels, changes in characteristics channels over time, and other\nemerging patterns across the information landscape. This review also examines\nchannel specific differences in available information, however, was limited to AQ\nchannels accesible in the UK and excluded real-time social media data due to cost and\naccess constraints. Lastly, the review considers demographic and other social factors\nthat can affect when, where, and how air quality information and exposure reducing\nbenefits are accessed. Findings from this work contribute to knowledge surrounding\nthe production and consumption of digitally available air quality information with global\nhealth protective potential.",

          "abstract": "Electoral accountability is a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet whether voters effectively punish corruption remains theoretically and empirically contested. While canonical models predict that corruption revelations reduce incumbent support, strategic voting considerations—especially beliefs about others’ behavior—can yield ambiguous accountability outcomes. We exploit a major corruption scandal involving Japan’s ruling party during a national election to examine how social information shapes electoral responses to misconduct. In a pre-registered field experiment, we randomly provided voters with information about prevailing social norms of intolerance toward the scandal. This intervention significantly increased overall turnout and challenger support, particularly among swing voters, consistent with enhanced accountability. Yet the same treatment increased incumbent support among ruling-party loyalists. We show that these heterogeneous effects are systematically driven by voters’ prior beliefs about others’ voting intentions: those expecting others to punish sanctioned more when learning they would not, whereas those expecting tolerance defended more when learning others would punish. These findings reconcile conflicting evidence on electoral accountability by showing how strategic considerations fundamentally shape democratic sanctioning, and suggest that information campaigns can either strengthen or undermine accountability depending on the distribution of voter expectations, with important implications for anti-corruption interventions.",

          "abstract": "Why do people adopt new and different religious beliefs and practices, especially when it is often costly? Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation. However, studies often rely on data inconsistent with the level of analysis of their hypothesized mechanisms, or infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes. We present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country, suggesting education and material conditions influence conversion. We test this hypothesis by analyzing longitudinal municipality level data from the Mexican Population Census (1950-2020). To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. However, we find effect heterogeneity of education on religious change driven by its interaction with distance to urban centers. These findings are consistent with previous cross-national studies on religious conversion.",

          "abstract": "Heterosexual-identified men who have sex with men (H-MSM) defy dominant sexuality frameworks that assume coherence between sexual identity, attraction, and behaviour. While extant models of sexual minority and heterosexual identity and attraction presume that H-MSM experience identity confusion and crisis and that ‘primarily or mostly heterosexual men’ exhibit equal levels of opposite-sex arousal as exclusive heterosexuals but report lower levels of same-sex sexuality than bisexuals in their attractions, fantasies, and behaviours, little research has examined how H-MSM experience sexual identity and attraction. This article is framed by Queer Theory and utilizes interpretative phenomenology to explore how a qualitative sample of 10 H-MSM navigate and negotiate their sexual identity and attraction. Results demonstate that H-MSM situate their same-sex attraction as physical, situational, and exploratory while employing gendered and relational scripts. At the same time, H-MSM sustain their heterosexual identity by decoupling identity from attraction and negotiating identity through heteroromantic desire. These findings demonstrate how sexuality is lived as fluid, shifting, and contingent, rather than as a linear trajectory toward categorical resolution. Unlike stage-based models that interpret identity-attraction-behaviour discordance as confusion or denial, participants described their identities as coherent, meaningful, and grounded in their romantic and long-term commitments to women. Same-sex attraction was acknowledged but framed as separate from participants’ perceived emotional weight of heterosexual relationships. By illustrating how individuals actively weigh and assign meaning to different aspects of sexuality, the study broadens understandings of sexual identity and attraction.",

Utilizando los hallazgos de una extensa colección de meta-análisis, se evalúa la efectividad de los instrumentos de política monetaria convencionales y no convencionales sobre variables macroeconómicas clave como la producción, la inflación, los flujos de capital y el tipo de cambio. La evidencia agregada revela una brecha sistemática entre los efectos reportados en estudios primarios y la magnitud real de dichos efectos, una vez que se corrige por el sesgo de publicación y la heterogeneidad metodológica. Los hallazgos sugieren que, si bien la política monetaria es una herramienta relevante, su poder para modular el ciclo económico ha sido consistentemente sobrestimado en la literatura. Se identifican los factores contextuales—como el grado de desarrollo financiero, el régimen cambiario, la independencia del banco central y las condiciones de crisis—que modulan la transmisión de la política monetaria. En particular, se constata que el sesgo de publicación favorece sistemáticamente resultados estadísticamente significativos y consistentes con la teoría predominante, lo que infla artificialmente la percepción de eficacia. Al corregir estas distorsiones, emerge una imagen de la política monetaria con efectos más modestos, inciertos y con retardos considerables, lo que tiene profundas implicaciones para la teoría macroeconómica y la práctica de la política económica.",

          "authors": "Maher Asaad Baker; Fuad Al-Qrize",
          "abstract": "The protracted conflict in Yemen, entering its tenth year in 2025, has catalyzed one of the world's most severe humanitarian and educational crises. This study employs a longitudinal analysis of key educational indicators from 2015 to 2023, drawing on data from UNICEF, the Yemen Education Cluster, and the World Bank. Moving beyond a mere accounting of decline, we argue that the available data itself serves as a powerful indicator of state collapse. The systematic erosion of national-level educational statistics mirrors the disintegration of government capacity, forcing a reliance on fragmented humanitarian snapshots that document interventions, not a national system. Our findings reveal a sector in profound disrepair: an estimated 4.5 million out-of-school children, widespread destruction of school infrastructure necessitating temporary learning spaces, and the complete dependence of the teaching workforce on externally-funded incentives rather than state salaries. The data consistently shows entrenched gender disparities, exacerbated by negative coping mechanisms like child labor and marriage. This paper concludes that the Yemeni education system has transitioned from a public good to a donor-dependent humanitarian service. The primary methodological finding is that the absence of comprehensive data is a direct consequence of conflict and a critical variable for analysis. We recommend that international policy shift from short-term emergency response to sustainable, locally-led system-building and that future research focus on the qualitative experiences within this collapsed educational landscape.",

Using a transdisciplinary methodology, the study examines human-wildlife coexistence in two contrasting social-ecological systems in South Africa: the Garden Route and the Kalahari. We engage local actors as research partners and develop participatory workshops, collaborative timelines, and focus group discussions to identify the relational values underpinning coexistence, explicitly focusing on the dimensions of care, knowledge, and agency associated with stewardship actions. \nDistinct stewardship positions emerged, reflecting different visions of human-wildlife interactions and conservation. Indigenous research partners notably highlighted transformative stewardship, promoting an inclusive worldview that integrates humans and wildlife through mutual respect and cultural recognition. Conversely, other research partners demonstrated varied stewardship positions ranging from adaptive to sustainability-focused action.\nThe findings underscore the need to explicitly incorporate relational values and care dimensions into conservation strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness in addressing social-ecological complexity.

Using the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and analyzing 40,000 genotyped mother–father–child trios, we test whether children’s polygenic indices (PGIs) predict subsequent fertility, partnership dissolution, and transition to marriage. Accounting for parental PGIs, we found limited evidence for evocative effects across most traits. The exception was that children with a higher ADHD PGI predicted increased parental partnership dissolution (7% [CI=2.9-11.8%] per s.d.), especially in families with daughters (11% [CI=4.9-18%] per s.d.), higher socioeconomic status (15% [CI=7.7-23.2%] per s.d.), and older maternal age at first birth (10% [CI=3-17%] per s.d.). The main source of variation is the socio-economic dimension where child-driven effects are stronger in higher-SES families. The study provides evidence for evocative gene-environment correlations in family demography, demonstrating the importance of child-to-parent effects in shaping family trajectories.",

          "abstract": "We identify a form of gender-based governmental discrimination that directly affects billions of women on a daily basis: the setting of import tariffs for gendered goods. These tax rates, which can differ across otherwise identical gender-specific products, often impose direct penalties on women as consumers. Comparing nearly 200,000 paired tariff rates on men’s and women’s apparel products in 167 countries between 1995 and 2015, we find that women suffer a tax penalty that varies systematically across countries. We demonstrate that in democracies, women’s presence in the legislature is associated with decreased import tax penalties on women’s goods. This finding is buttressed by a comparison of democracies and non-democracies and analyses of the implementation of legislative gender quotas. Our work highlights a previously unacknowledged government policy that penalizes women and also provides powerful evidence that descriptive representation can have a substantial, direct impact on discriminatory policies.",

          "abstract": "The population of Advanced Capitalist Democracies (ACDs) has aged substantially in the last decades. Yet, we know little about the consequences of ageing for the electoral politics of economic performance. This article develops a novel theoretical framework linking ageing to lower economic growth in four interrelated steps: first, elderly voters care more about pensions, but less about childcare, family, and education policies; second, they are less likely to penalize governments for low growth and unemployment; third, grey power pushes governments to protect the growing share of budgets allocated to pensions at the expense of more growth-enhancing policies, most notably social and public investments, while also weakening policy responsiveness during recessions; fourth, this policy reallocation undermines economic growth. This theory is tested using multilevel and fixed-effects regressions, an instrumental variable approach, and causal mediation analysis on micro- and macro-level data across 21 ACDs from the 1960s onwards. The results show that ageing fundamentally alters the electoral politics of economic stagnation in ACDs.",

          "abstract": "The sibling correlation, or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), is a widely used omnibus measure of the total impact of family background on socioeconomic outcomes in social stratification research. A growing literature compares these correlations across subgroups defined by family-level characteristics (e.g., race, parental education) to test theories of social reproduction, such as parental compensation or reinforcement. In this note, I highlight the ambiguities involved in meaningfully interpreting such subgroup variation. I first define the theoretical estimand of intergenerational transmission that researchers are arguably most interested in, and then formally demonstrate why group-specific ICCs do not identify this estimand. In fact, the estimand of interest cannot be recovered from the variance-components models underlying sibling correlations unless researchers are willing to make assumptions that are not only untestable but also likely unrealistic.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study aims to examine how China's newly appointed ambassador to Thailand employs event networks and temporal dynamics to demonstrate issue entry and structural embedding in early diplomatic practices, thereby revealing the priorities and potential trends in China's diplomacy toward Thailand. Existing research predominantly focuses on macro-policy levels, lacking systematic quantitative analysis of event-level diplomatic activities. This study seeks to fill this gap. Methodologically, it employs an event-level observation-computational empirical design, constructing five-layer networks (administrative, legislative, multilateral, social, and media) and time series based on open-source intelligence (OSINT). The analytical process follows the HCLS paradigm: identifying structural hubs (Hub) via the Bridge Center Early Warning Index (BCEW), detecting rhythmic inflection points (Change) using CUSUM, BOCPD, and PELT methods, characterizing lead-response lag relationships (Lag) between issues through cross-correlation and Hawkes processes, and translating multidimensional evidence into issue priority scores (Score) using AHP→TOPSIS. (Score). Results indicate that the administrative and multilateral layers exhibit significant hub status within the network, while security and multilateral issues show statistically significant rhythmic inflection points within short-term windows. “Security→Administrative” and “Multilateral→UN-ESCAP” demonstrate strong coupling at zero lag, whereas legislative channel coupling is weaker and transient. Multi-criteria ranking indicates that security, digital cooperation, and multilateral rules form the priority issue sequence, remaining robust to weight perturbations. Integrating four evidence chains reveals that China's recent diplomatic focus toward Thailand centers on amplifying issue linkage through administrative and multilateral platforms, gradually shifting toward narrative coupling of rule-building and public diplomacy in the medium term. In conclusion, this study not only proposes a reproducible, falsifiable event-level diplomatic analysis methodology but also reveals the logical chain of “hub prioritization—issue triggering—platform amplification—narrative coupling—trend insight” in China-Thailand relations. This research offers a quantitative perspective for understanding the micro-operational mechanisms of Chinese diplomacy while providing empirical evidence for policy formulation and regional cooperation.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the legitimation strategies employed by organizations engaging in criminal activities to influence public opinion about the legitimacy of these criminal activities. These discursive strategies are used to justify criminal actions, such as corruption, fraud, or violence, within broader organizational and cultural contexts. Often involving moral neutralization and moral licensing techniques, these strategies allow organizations engaged in criminal activities to present themselves and their actions as virtuous or justified. Although these strategies can result in societal harm by undermining public support for law enforcement, little is known about what types of legitimation strategies exist, how they differ, and how they influence public opinion. Hence, this scoping review identifies and categorizes the legitimation strategies used by organizations engaged in criminal activities. By conducting a scoping review of 21 empirical studies, a four-dimensional typology of 10 legitimation strategies is developed, clustered by their association with distinct types of legitimacy. The findings propose five mechanisms whereby legitimation strategies impact public opinion. Understanding these strategies and mechanisms is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies to delegitimize criminal actions and enhance societal resilience. This study advances the fragmented discourse on legitimation processes of specifically criminal actions employed by organizations, integrating findings from various disciplines to inform theory and practice.",

The model shows that public coordination reduces variance in received care, increasing the likelihood that vulnerability becomes productive.\nEmpirically, we combine two approaches. First, we analyze World Values Survey data from 25 countries (2017–2022), linking individual attitudes to a novel folktale-based index that captures the cultural salience of care-related virtues versus harm-related vices. Countries scoring higher on this index show greater support for redistributive care; civic participation also plays an independent role. Second, an incentivized framing experiment in Italy reveals that framing care as a private responsibility reduces donations to a pooled care fund by 6–8 percentage points.\nTogether, these findings suggest that institutions and shared narratives jointly shape attitudes toward care. Recognizing care as social infrastructure—and designing time regimes and services that foster trust—may be key to building resilient and inclusive economies.",

          "authors": "Oleksandr Karasov; Henrikki Tenkanen",
          "abstract": "Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are a policy priority under the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework; however, current approaches either commodify CES through monetary valuation or rely on plural, non-comparable metrics, leaving use and experiential quality poorly captured. We propose the subjective quality of personal time—how “well spent” or “wasted” moments feel in a place—as a universal, scalar indicator of CES use. We outline practical routes to measurement via participatory mapping (PPGIS), lightweight experience sampling, and passive digital traces, and show how geosocial collaborative filtering can translate ratings into place-based recommendations. Reframing CES as the increment to time quality provided by the environment resolves the tension between monetary valuation and non-monetary pluralism, yielding a single, comparable metric that remains grounded in lived experience. A proposed PPGIS 2.0 workflow can collect time-quality ratings, tag activities and landscape settings, and return immediate, personalised recommendations, creating continuous data streams rather than one-off surveys. Integration with remote sensing and existing mobility datasets enables mapping of CES potential where participatory data are sparse. A time-quality metric makes CES visible, comparable and actionable across contexts, aligning monitoring with the Global Biodiversity Framework and supporting transformative, people-centred decisions. It offers a generic, accessible message for non-specialists: manage places based on the quality of the time they enable, not merely the quantity of visits, and use participatory, data-driven tools to recommend, protect, and enhance those experiences.",

          "authors": "Kazuhiro Kezuka",
          "abstract": "While most Japanese people conduct religious practices, they also do not believe in religion. This study attempts to explain this puzzle of Japanese views on religion by modifying the church and sect model to specify the relationships between lifestyles (or behavior) and religion. I also estimated the modified church and sect model parameters by applying ISSP 2018 data. The results demonstrate a lifestyle gap between those who believe in a specific religion and those who do not. This indicates that Japanese people recognize their religious identity with differences in lifestyle (e.g., attending worship every Sunday). Comparing the results from the US data, the major religion in the two countries may be crucial and work as a starting point.",

          "abstract": "Gentrification has eroded Seattle of its cultural identity. It has caused the displacement of lower-income families and people of color in an unjust manner. This paper studies how higher costs, ineffective policy actions and corporate influence forced families in Seattle’s Central District and other areas into a modern diaspora. Utilizing data from 2000 to 2024 reveals that 50% of eligible Seattle census tracts have experienced gentrification, with median home values increasing by 47% between 2000 and 2013. The Black population in the Central District declined by 27.65% from 2010 to 2020, while Hispanic populations in gentrified areas decreased by 14.3%. Despite a 5.86% rise in Black household income from 2010 to 2020, rental costs have risen by 41.7%, significantly outpacing income growth. The research extensively analyzes in on policies enacted by the Seattle government, such as MHA and EDI, to combat gentrification and finds that that they were ultimately insufficient.",

          "authors": "Harry J Wilson",
          "abstract": "As one of 26 nations off-track from the global health sector goals, the concentrated epidemics of HIV, viral hepatitis and STIs in Bangladesh have proven difficult to control. Female sex workers (FSWs) are the largest key population group in Bangladesh and contextually imperative to deescalate epidemic momentum. This investigation rationalizes the structural, symbolic and interpersonal violence experienced across the life course of Bangladeshi FSWs. The population characteristics of low educational attainment and high marital separation are contextualized through a structural violence of embodied inequality perspective that substantiates the influence of childhood marriages that push Bangladeshi women into the sex trade. Bourdieu's theory of symbolic violence is used to conceptualize the material harms derived from the portrayal of FSWs as fallen women divorced from the virtuous ideals of the normative gender identity. The analysis contends that the intersections of structural and symbolic violence act to legitimize and perpetuate interpersonal assaults that oppress the body, suppress the voice and repress the spiritual soul of FSWs in Bangladesh. These sociostructural complexities pragmatically challenge the individualized perspectives of biobehavioral research that monitor the effectiveness of proximal interventions designed to correct recidivistic behaviors. The underlying role of social-collectivism in dismantling violent architecture and improved condom negotiation capacity behind structural shifts in sexual risk behaviors among Bangladeshi FSWs are emphasized to evidence the importance of empowering approaches in pursuit of transformative biobehavioral change.",

          "authors": "Brian Lynch",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nEconomics has long been framed as a science of rational choice and incentives. This essay\nargues for a more fundamental starting point: affect, and specifically the primary motivator of\ninterest-excitement. Following the work of psychologist Silvan Tomkins, we posit that interest is the engine of all human action—the force that directs attention, fuels curiosity, and makes\nlearning and creation possible . Its opposite is not irrationality, but interruption—a motivational collapse experienced as profound confusion. This framework reveals that economic expansion is a function of cultivated interest, while contraction and alienation are the results of its systemic interruption. We argue that the painful social experience of economic humiliation is the consequence of a system that generates chronic interruption at the core of motivation. By reframing economics as the science of human attention, we can move beyond abstract models and toward.a discipline capable of addressing the systemic humiliation and motivational collapse that plague modern economic life.",

          "authors": "Shuhei Kitamura; Ryo Takahashi; Katsunori Yamada",
          "abstract": "Electoral accountability is a cornerstone of democratic governance, yet whether voters effectively punish corruption remains theoretically and empirically contested. While canonical models predict that corruption revelations reduce incumbent support, strategic voting considerations—especially beliefs about others’ behavior—can yield ambiguous accountability outcomes. We exploit a major corruption scandal involving Japan’s ruling party during a national election to examine how social information shapes electoral responses to misconduct. In a pre-registered field experiment, we randomly provided voters with information about prevailing social norms of intolerance toward the scandal. This intervention significantly increased overall turnout and challenger support, particularly among swing voters, consistent with enhanced accountability. Yet the same treatment increased incumbent support among ruling-party loyalists. We show that these heterogeneous effects are systematically driven by voters’ prior beliefs about others’ voting intentions: those expecting others to punish sanctioned more when learning they would not, whereas those expecting tolerance defended more when learning others would punish. These findings reconcile conflicting evidence on electoral accountability by showing how strategic considerations fundamentally shape democratic sanctioning, and suggest that information campaigns can either strengthen or undermine accountability depending on the distribution of voter expectations, with important implications for anti-corruption interventions.",

          "abstract": "Storytelling is fundamental to how people and cultures encode, share, and preserve knowledge. Stories may be viewed as characters interacting and evolving over time, making an understanding of characters key to understanding stories. Moreover, representation of real people by characters in fictional stories affects how people live their lives:\n\nFictional characters matter because real character matters.\n\nHere, we determine the essential dimensions of the space of fictional characters in film, television, and literature. We draw on a data set comprising 464 crowd-sourced semantic-differential traits scored for 2000 characters across 341 stories.\n\nOn performing dimensional reduction and studying the alignment of traits and characters, we find that twelve archetypes afforded by six essential dimensions dominate the makeup of characters.\n\nWe interpret these six dimensions as three primary dimensions expressed as semantic differentials of base archetypes:\n\n1. {Fool ⇔ Hero},\n2. {Angel ⇔ Demon},\n3. {Traditionalist ⇔ Adventurer};\nand three secondary dimensions:\n4. {Lone Wolf ⇔ Diva},\n5. {Outcast ⇔ Sophisticate},\n6. {Brute ⇔ Geek}.\n\nWe find that the three primary dimensions of character space are congruent with the three dimensions of essential meaning:\n1. {weak ⇔ powerful},\n2. {safe ⇔ dangerous},\nand\n3. {structured ⇔ unstructured}.\n\nWe also observe that the ‘Big Five’ personality traits are covered by these six essential dimensions, showing that fictional characters, however outsized, reflect everyday people.\n\nIn considering combinations of the six essential dimensions, we generate an expanded set of 232 archetypes (e.g., Traditionalist-Demon-Hero ). We perform a detailed analysis of the resulting collection of archetypes for characters and stories.\n\nWe construct an allotaxonograph for comparing pairs of characters. Our map-and-list visualization is a generalization of the standard correlation coefficient, and has broad applicability to system comparisons.\n\nWe provide a comprehensive set of appendices and an interconnected online card collection which together offer explorations of ranked lists of traits, characters, and archetypes; character maps in archetype space for each story; and individual cards for stories, traits, characters, and archetypes.\n\nOur empirical discovery of 12 base archetypes advances the basic science of stories, while offering an analytic framework for the development of new narratives.",
