          "title": "Affective Framing of Environmental News Headlines Influences Engagement, Donations, and Memory",
          "authors": "Alyssa Hannah Sinclair; Danielle Cosme; Jose Carreras Tartak; Emily B. Falk",
          "abstract": "Negativity motivates people to read and share news, but can also harm mental health and discourage action. We tested an alternate route to engagement—evoking positive emotions by emphasizing action to address a problem. In two experiments, we adapted environmental news headlines to feature different aspects of each story, emphasizing Crisis or Action. Both Crisis and Action framing (and negative and positive emotions, respectively) motivated reading and sharing, relative to the unaltered headlines. Crucially, consistent with theoretical predictions, we identified a trade-off: Crisis framing had the strongest effects on immediate engagement (increasing sharing and charitable donations), but Action framing enhanced future memory for news content. In a third study, we computationally classified content in &gt;25,000 news articles on social media; Action and Crisis framing were both associated with increased engagement. Overall, we demonstrate that the affective framing of news modulates reading, sharing, donations, and memory in laboratory and real-world settings.",

          "title": "Exploring Public Sentiments of Psychedelics Versus Other Substances: A Reddit-Based Natural Language Processing Study",
          "authors": "Brandon-Joe Biba; Brian O’Shea",
          "abstract": "New methods that capture the public's perception of controversial topics may be valuable. This study investigates public sentiments towards psychedelics and other substances through analyzes of Reddit discussions, using Google’s cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) infrastructure. Our findings indicate that illicit substances such as heroin and methamphetamine are associated with highly negative general sentiments, whereas psychedelics like Psilocybin, LSD, and Ayahuasca generally evoke neutral to slightly positive sentiments. This study underscores the effectiveness and cost efficiency of NLP and machine learning models in understanding the public’s perception of sensitive topics. The findings indicate that online public sentiment towards psychedelics may be growing in acceptance of their therapeutic potential. However, limitations include potential selection bias from the Reddit sample and challenges in accurately interpreting nuanced language using NLP. Future research should aim to diversify data sources and enhance NLP models to capture the full spectrum of public sentiment towards psychedelics. Our findings support the importance of ongoing research and public education to inform policy decisions and therapeutic applications of psychedelics.",

          "authors": "Claudia Civai; Marta Caserotti; Nazia Yasmeen Skelton; Elisa Carrus",
          "abstract": "The benefits of digitalisation have been widely embraced, but little is known about one of its downsides, the gradual erosion of human interaction from our lives. What are the psycho-social implications of this? Do people value human contact, and do they value it more when perceived as scarce, effectively turning it into a luxury good? We tested these questions in four pre-registered online studies (N=3521), using hypothetical scenarios encompassing four different domains (education, finance, mental health, and fitness) and a willingness to pay task, where we asked participants how much they were willing to pay for a service, offered either with human contact (e.g., a financial advisor), or fully digital (e.g., an app for financial advice). We found that services offering human contact are valued more than their digital equivalent, and people on higher income are willing to pay more for them, but not for digital; crucially, nudging people to perceive human contact as scarce increased its value, in that people were willing to pay more for it and considered it more important in most of the domains. The results were replicated within a UK and Italian sample, and could not be explained by differences in digital skills and accessibility. These findings support our intuition that the move towards digitalisation could introduce a new form of inequality, that of access to human contact.",

          "authors": "Thomas H Costello; Gordon Pennycook; David Gertler Rand",
          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widely considered resistant to factual correction, yet recent research shows that relatively brief, personalized “debunking” dialogues with a generative AI model can substantially reduce such beliefs. To identify the mechanisms driving this effect, we conducted an experiment spanning eight treatment arms that varied key features of participants’ interactions with GPT-4 during such debunking dialogues (N = 1,297). The debunking effect proved robust across most manipulations—including whether participants were explicitly told the AI aimed to change their minds, were asked to debate the AI, or whether the AI offered them factual information without otherwise seeking to persuade or was concise in its exposition. The only condition that undermined the debunking effect was prompting the AI to persuade participants without presenting any counterevidence, which yielded a null effect. Furthermore, analyses of the AI’s persuasive strategies identified reasoning-based tactics as the sole significant mediator of belief change. Participants who reported feeling persuaded overwhelmingly cited the AI’s rational, evidence-focused approach. Finally, participants higher in actively open-minded thinking showed larger treatment effects. These findings suggest that AI-driven interventions reduce conspiracy beliefs principally by providing factual, targeted counterarguments that address the specific reasons people hold these beliefs.",

          "title": "Experiences of Moment to Moment Tracking in therapist-therapist dyads during fNIRS Hyperscanning",
          "authors": "Niclas Kaiser; Lovisa Blomdahl; My Lögdahl",
          "abstract": "Understanding meaningful interpersonal moments in therapy and daily life remains a challenge for neuroscience. Various overlapping concepts—such as moments of meeting, mutuality, social closeness, intersubjectivity, and social connectedness—seek to capture the unique experience of interpresence, a shared psychological here and now. While these concepts are well-recognized, they have been difficult to study scientifically. Recent methodological advancements, including the 4E/MoBI framework and the ConNECT approach, provide new avenues for empirical investigation. A key question is how therapeutically informed practices can be applied in cross-disciplinary studies to explore experientially enhanced relational processes. This study examines the feasibility of studying therapeutic interventions in a laboratory setting by investigating experiences in therapist-therapist dyads engaging in Moment-to-Moment Tracking, a method designed to foster psychological closeness. Thematic analysis of participant experiences revealed that authenticity was largely preserved despite laboratory constraints. While factors such as the presence of fNIRS equipment and observational pressures influenced engagement, participants reported experiencing genuine moments of connection. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions can be effectively studied in laboratory environments, opening new possibilities for neuroscientific research on interpersonal processes.",

          "authors": "Kyle J. LaFollette; Doroteja Rubez; Heath Demaree; Amit Goldenberg",
          "abstract": "Implicit biases are stereotypes and attitudes that influence decisions and actions, contributing to discrimination and societal inequities. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the most widely used tool for measuring implicit bias, assessing response time in sorting stimuli into labeled categories. Most interpretations assume that IAT performance (D-scores) reflects conflicting associative memories or decision ease. We challenged this assumption by decomposing D-scores into additional cognitive processes that may influence results, particularly response caution—the tendency to trade speed for accuracy. Using Racing Diffusion Models across 39 topics (N = 115,601), we found that response caution explained significantly more variance in D-scores beyond decision ease. Response caution also best predicted explicitly reported biases. These findings challenge the traditional interpretation of D-scores as primarily reflecting associative memory activation and highlight the need to consider multiple cognitive processes when assessing implicit biases.",

          "authors": "Panagiotis Kourtesis; Andrea Lizarraga; Sarah E. MacPherson",
          "abstract": "Objective: Immersive virtual reality (VR) enhances ecologically validity and facilitates intuitive and ergonomic hand interactions for performing neuropsychological assessments. However, its comparability to traditional computerized methods remains unclear. This study investigates the convergent validity, user experience, and usability of VR-based versus PC-based assessments of short-term and working memory, and psychomotor skills, while also examining how demographic and IT-related skills influence performance in both modalities.\nMethods: Sixty-six participants performed the Digit Span Task (DST), Corsi Block Task (CBT), and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task (DLRTT) in both VR- and PC-based formats. Participants’ experience in using computers and smartphones, and playing videogames, was considered. User experience and system usability of the formats were also evaluated.\nResults: While performance on DST was similar across modalities, PC assessments enabled better performance on CBT and faster reaction times in DLRTT. Moderate-to-strong correlations between VR and PC versions supported convergent validity. Regression analyses revealed that performance on PC versions was influenced by age, computing, and gaming experience, whereas performance on VR versions was largely independent of these factors, except for gaming experience predicting performance on CBT backward recall. Moreover, VR assessments received higher ratings for user experience and usability than PC-based assessments.\nConclusion: Immersive VR assessments provide an engaging alternative to traditional computerized methods, with minimal reliance on prior IT experience and demographic factors. This resilience to individual differences suggests that VR may offer a more equitable and accessible platform for cognitive assessment. Future research should explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.",

          "abstract": "Developmental research often involves comparing cross-sectional or repeatedly measured means in small samples (e.g., N &lt; 100), commonly using ANOVA. Generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel modeling (MLM), and structural equation modeling (SEM) are advantageous alternatives, which we didactically explain and demonstrate on N = 42 adolescent boys’ (14–16) alcohol-use data using SPSS and R. To compare their robustness in practice, mixed-design data are simulated under conditions commonly reported in the journal Child Development. Researchers using ANOVA should prefer heteroskedasticity-robust t statistics or CIs to test individual contrasts, whereas MLM and SEM can provide safer omnibus tests, assuming small-sample adjustments are applied to maintain nominal Type I error rates. GEE should be avoided with small samples.",

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, particularly in how stimulus processing is influenced by concurrent cardiac phases (systole and diastole). However, definitions of these phases vary widely. Some studies follow biomedical conventions, defining systole as the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG), with diastole encompassing the remainder of the cycle. Others adopt a time-based heuristic approach, defining systole based on the estimated arrival of afferent cardiac signals in the brain. This approach assumes that baroreceptor activity plays a key role in cognition, though conclusive evidence for this is lacking. This variability leads to inconsistencies, where systole in one study may correspond partly or entirely to diastole in another. To address this, we first review studies examining how cardiac phases modulate stimulus perception. Second, we highlight methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases, particularly in time-based heuristic approaches. Third, we discuss additional sources of variability, such as differences in recording equipment and measures of interoceptive ability. Rather than focusing on specific findings, we highlight broader challenges in replicability and interpretation. Additionally, we introduce the HEARTS framework, a set of guidelines for standardising methodologies in interoception research. This consists of six recommendations: Harmonizing physiological terms across fields, Establishing clear nomenclature, Avoiding selective reporting, Refining mechanistic understanding, Tailoring methods for precision, and Standardizing study comparability. Implementing these recommendations can improve methodological consistency, cross-study reliability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a more accurate understanding of how interoceptive signals shape perception and cognition.",

          "abstract": "The United States prison system, with over 1.2 million incarcerated individuals, faces a crisis of high recidivism and widespread correctional abuse. This review discusses how punishment-oriented prison policies and rhetoric create a dehumanizing environment and contribute to patterns of correctional officer abuse. Using Bandura’s moral disengagement theory, we analyze how media representations normalize systemic prison abuses and shape public perception. Our findings indicate that attitudes in favor of a punitive prison system are a significant obstacle to passing public policies aimed at making prisons more rehabilitative, stressing the importance of new solutions to reduce moral disengagement and its harmful effects in media reporting for safer prisons.",

          "abstract": "Claims about lexical elaboration (e.g. Mongolian has many horse-related terms) are widespread in the scholarly and popular literature. Here we show that computational analyses of bilingual dictionaries can be used to test claims about lexical elaboration at scale. We validate our approach by introducing BILA, a data set including 1574 bilingual dictionaries, and showing that it confirms 147 out of 163 previous claims from the literature. We then identify previously unreported examples of lexical elaboration, and analyze how lexical elaboration is influenced by ecological and cultural variables. Claims about lexical elaboration are sometimes dismissed as either obvious or fanciful, but our work suggests that large-scale computational approaches to the topic can produce non-obvious and well-grounded insights about language and culture.",

          "abstract": "SAttempting to suppress unwanted thoughts is generally characterized by the opposite outcomes of what is desired in motor task performance, resulting in a counterintentional error. This study examined the impact of priming negative cues on elite athletes' performance and reaction time (RT) in Stroop rifle shooting task, guided by ironic processes of mental control theory. Ten elite biathletes completed the task under two conditions: no-frequency negative cue (NFN) and high-frequency negative cue (HFN). Using a quasi-experimental within-subject design and multiple psychophysiological measures, the study assessed target hit rates and RTs at the incongruent stimuli. Bayesian analysis revealed moderate and anecdotal evidence in support of the null model (BF01) for hit rates and RTs towards target hits, indicating no ironic shooting errors and delay to the intended targets. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) also showed no significant variations across conditions. Findings suggest that negative instructions, regardless of frequency, do not disrupt elite biathletes' shooting performance. Thus, directives like \"do not shoot blue\" fail to induce ironic errors, highlighting elite biathletes' resilience to such cues in maintaining consistent shooting performance.",

Thus, individuals not following study invitations (self-selection), not completing all administered measures (showing dropout) and/or not participating at subsequent measurement occasions (showing attrition) pose a significant challenge to personality research. Building on existing research documenting that non-response does not occur randomly, we herein test for potential predictors of non-responding at each of the three stages by combining official register (census) data from a randomly selected participant pool of 100,175 adults, representative for the target population (adults living in Denmark), with data from a personality panel (N = 14,071) recruited from this participant pool. We find that each socio-demographic characteristic considered (i.e., sex, age, marital status, migration background, income, highest completed education, and region of residence) as well as five of the six HEXACO personality dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience; but not Agreeableness vs. Anger) were associated with self-selection, selective dropout, and/or selective attrition. We further compare the sample representativeness at each of the stages and illustrate how to assess potential biases (regarding the obtained HEXACO scores) due to self-selection.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories attempt to explain social phenomena by attributing them to the supposed secret actions of powerful, malevolent groups. Due to their associations with potentially harmful nonnormative behaviours at both the individual and collective levels, researchers have expressed particular concern over conspiracy theories that malign science. To better understand such beliefs, we conducted a national U.S. survey to gauge respondents’ agreement with 11 science-related conspiracy theories and their political, psychological, and social characteristics. We find that beliefs in specific science-related conspiracy theories represent two unique factors that are (i) related to nonnormative behaviours including political violence, vaccine refusal, and sharing false information online, and (ii) undergirded by a range of nonnormative personality traits and attitudes. We conclude by discussing the potential role of political leaders in propagating science-related conspiracy theories and the implications for preventing or reversing science-related conspiracy theory beliefs.",

          "authors": "Liya Merzon",
          "abstract": "Functional connectomics is a popular approach to investigate the neural underpinnings of developmental disorders of which attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent. Nonetheless, neuronal mechanisms driving the aberrant functional connectivity resulting in ADHD symptoms remain largely unclear. Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition. Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group. Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition. These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD. Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.",

          "abstract": "One important distinction in the syntax literature is between agreement that is external to the nominal phrase and agreement that is internal to it (sometimes called concord). How this type of agreement impacts sentence processing, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we ask whether agreement errors are processed differently based on their internal vs external status. We investigate this question in Russian, a Slavic language that has a rich morphological agreement system and flexible word order, allowing us to control for several confounds. Our results are not fully conclusive but do provide moderate evidence that processing of agreement is modulated by internal vs. external status. As a second, methodological contribution, we measure real-time language processing using Mouse Tracking for Reading (MoTR), a new web-deployable measurement tool that has been argued to improve over previous methods (e.g., self-paced reading) but has so far been tested only in English, and never for agreement processing phenomena. We find that MoTR can successfully pick up differences in our factorized psycholinguistic experiment in Russian. A directed comparison with existing data collected using in-lab eye-tracking-while-reading and similar experimental materials (Fuchs et al., 2025) suggests MoTR data yields larger effect sizes than does eye-tracking data.",

          "authors": "Omar D. Perez; Gonzalo Pablo Urcelay",
          "abstract": "Goal-directed actions are defined by their sensitivity to the causal association between actions and outcomes, as well as the subjective value ascribed to those outcomes. When this sensitivity diminishes, actions may transition into habitual behavior. Based on recent findings from animal studies, we hypothesized that delaying outcomes relative to actions would weaken sensitivity to outcome revaluation and reduce action rates. In three experiments ( N = 290 ), participants made fictitious investments in companies within different contexts providing immediate or delayed feedback. After training, participants were informed of a market crash that affected the performance of both companies, favoring one over the other. Across all experiments, action rates were lower in the delayed-feedback condition, and outcome revaluation had a more pronounced effect in the immediate-feedback condition. Self-reported action-outcome knowledge revealed that participants were less aware of the contingencies in the delayed condition. These findings suggest that delays in reinforcement weaken the action-outcome association critical for goal-directed control. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its implications for understanding real-life decisions.",

The findings unveiled distinct structure of, and associations with parent–adolescent convergence and divergence on parental positive reinforcement behaviors, which highlights the importance of disentangling short-term within-family fluctuations from stable between-family differences at different levels.",

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship,\nincluding physical proximity and interpersonal similarities1,2. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends3,4 by capturing how people process the world around them5,6. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here, we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips–acquired before participants met one another–predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (i.e., they were more likely to be friends rather than several “degrees of separation” apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence, and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after meeting each other. Compared to people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this 6-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in “deeper” interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to, and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

          "abstract": "Retirement marks a significant life transition, often accompanied by the loss of structured work routines and an increase in alone time. How this solitude is experienced—positively or negatively—varies depending on individual and environmental factors. This study interviewed 8 pre-retirees and 15 retirees (N = 23) using semi-structured individual and focus group interviews. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, we asked participants to reflect on their retirement transition, attitudes toward solitude, social influences on their alone time, and their perceived control over managing solitude during retirement. Thematic analysis revealed key themes, including shifts in identity, balancing social connection and alone time, and the role of autonomy and financial stability in shaping solitude experiences. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and social isolation. Findings suggest that achieving a balance between alone time and social engagement is critical to fostering positive experiences of solitude in retirement.",

Little research has examined how Asian Americans perceive their ingroup (self-perception) and perceive society’s views of their ingroup (metaperception). This study examined whether incongruence between self- and metaperception in terms of warmth and competence has mental health implications. We hypothesized that perception incongruence would predict poorer mental health.\n \nMethods: Asian American participants (N = 249, 78.7% women, 44.6% East Asian, 73.1% second or later generation) completed an online survey assessing self- and metaperceptions of warmth and competence dimensions as well as depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and affect.\n \nResults: Participants reported perceiving that society views Asian Americans as more competent and less warm than they perceived their own ingroup. Self- and metaperception of high competence and self-perception of low warmth predicted worse mental health and affect. Perception incongruence was unrelated to mental health symptoms and affect.\n \nConclusions: Asian Americans are aware that their own group is perceived as high competence and low warmth, but they view their own group differently. While self- and metaperception consistent with racial stereotypes were related to mental health outcomes, perception incongruence was not. Future research should examine why incongruence may not influence mental health and identify protective factors against stereotype-related harm for Asian Americans.\n\n\nKeywords: Stereotype content model; self-perception; metaperception; perception incongruence; mental health\nPublic significance statement: Asian Americans are cognizant of societal stereotypes but perceive their ingroup differently.

However, progress in identifying unique behavioral markers of psychopathology from smartphone sensors has been stalled by research on diagnostic categories that are heterogenous and have many non-specific symptoms.\nObjective Determine which domains of psychopathology are detectable with smartphone sensors and identify passively sensed markers for (1) general impairment (the p-factor) and (2) specific transdiagnostic domains.\nDesign Observational study including a baseline assessment and 14 days of smartphone monitoring.\nSetting Selected community sample.\nParticipants Participants included 557 adults selected for mental health treatment status (51% currently in outpatient treatment, 29% with treatment history).\nMain outcomes and measures Transdiagnostic psychopathology dimensions of internalizing, detachment, disinhibition, antagonism, thought disorder, somatoform, and the p-factor; 27 behavior markers derived from GPS, accelerometer, motion, call logs, screen on/off, and battery status.\nResults Among the 557 participants included in the study, 82% were female and the mean age was 30.7 (SD = 8.8).  Multiple correlation (R) showed the domain most strongly related to sensed behavior was detachment (R = .42) followed by somatoform (R = .41), internalizing (R = .37), disinhibition (R = .35), antagonism (R = .33), and thought disorder (R = .28).  Each psychopathology domain had significant, bivariate associations with 4-10 smartphone sensor variables. After adjusting for shared variance between psychopathology dimensions, all domains except thought disorder retained significant, incremental associations with sensor variables, reflecting unique behavioral signatures (standardized s = |.15|–|.25|). The p-factor was associated with lower mobility, more time at home, later bedtime, and less phone charge (s = |.12|–|.24|).\nConclusions and relevance This study identified behavioral markers for domains encompassing most major forms of psychopathology using smartphone sensor data. In addition to establishing the breadth of psychopathology that is detectable, findings show smartphone sensors assess markers that distinguish domains of dysfunction. Results showing many behavioral markers reflect non-specific psychopathology reinforces the need for dimensional, transdiagnostic models to maximize the potential of mobile sensing technology. Findings from this study can advance research on day-to-day maintenance mechanisms of psychopathology and inform development of symptom monitoring tools.",

          "abstract": "People connect with others who share their likes, interests, and mental states, a phenomenon known as homophily. Here, we examine human-AI homophily by testing how individuals' psychological traits are related to their affiliation with large language models (LLM) that mimic these traits. In Experiment 1, the LLM GPT-4 was prompted to produce language aligned with either an anxious or non-anxious state. Participants (n=100) engaged with both versions of the LLM and then completed a questionnaire to assess how relatable they found the AI. Participants with high anxiety felt more similar to and understood by the LLM instructed to mimic an anxious state, while participants with lower anxiety reported a perceived difference between themselves and the LLM. In addition, the sentiment of the messages exchanged with each LLM persona mirrored the sentiment of the messages the LLM produced. This apparent display of empathy towards the AI was predicted by participants’ own anxiety in the case of messages with a negative sentiment. In Experiment 2, participants (n=100) engaged with two LLMs prompted to align with either an extroverted or introverted personality. Extroverted participants felt similar to the AI when it mimicked extroversion. Taken together, the findings support the idea that humans affiliate more with LLMs when they are instructed to mirror aspects of their psychology.",

          "abstract": "Students with poor quality relationships (e.g., those lacking parent/carer support, peer support, and/or who are bullied by their peers) typically report lower wellbeing than their peers. Support from school staff may play a compensatory role for these vulnerable learners, but current evidence is meagre. Using data from N=25,977 adolescents (aged 12-15; 50.1% girls) from the #BeeWell study in Greater Manchester, England, we fitted a series of linear regression models to estimate the association between school staff support and psychological wellbeing; optimism; self-esteem; and, life satisfaction. These models were subsequently extended to explore potential moderation effects (i.e., whether the association between school staff support and wellbeing varies based on students’ level of parent/carer support, peer support, and/or exposure to bullying). Analyses revealed that higher levels of school staff support are significantly associated with higher levels of all four student wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed a complex picture, with the nature and magnitude of effects varying by relationship and wellbeing outcome.  For example, for self-esteem and life satisfaction, the association with school staff support is stronger for students reporting low (vs high) parent/carer support or who are exposed (vs unexposed) to bullying. In contrast, for psychological wellbeing and optimism, it is smaller for students reporting low (vs high) social support from peers. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of having supportive school staff for promoting student wellbeing. They also suggest that increasing school staff support is a potentially useful mechanism for bolstering the wellbeing of vulnerable students (e.g., those who are bullied).",

          "abstract": "Theories of personality development emphasize the continuity between who we are as a child and who we are as an adult.  However, there are major unanswered questions about this (dis)continuity because research on traits has long been divided into studies of temperament in childhood and studies of personality in adolescence/adulthood. To bridge this divide, the present study used longitudinal data from a sample of 674 Mexican-origin youth who completed assessments of temperament traits (i.e., Negative Emotionality, Surgency, Affiliation, Effortful Control) from ages 10-16 and assessments of Big Five personality traits from ages 14-26. Leveraging two waves of overlapping temperament/personality trait assessments at ages 14 and 16, we found: (1) continuity between childhood/adolescent temperament and age 26 personality, with the strongest associations between conceptually similar traits, and Effortful Control predicting all Big Five traits (except Extraversion), suggesting self-regulation broadly promotes maturation; (2) temperament starts predicting adult personality traits by age 12-14, indicating that temperamental foundations of adult personality development crystallize in adolescence; (3) conceptually similar temperament/personality traits reflect different expressions of the same underlying trait from age 10-26, established using latent growth models of joint temperament/personality factors; (4) mean-level personality development across late childhood to adulthood showing that all joint traits maintain consistent rank-order stability and youth increase in Effortful Control/Conscientiousness, decrease in Negative Emotionality/Neuroticism and Surgency/Extraversion, and do not change in Affiliation/Agreeableness. Findings add novel support for widely accepted–yet largely untested–theories, although some unexpected results undermine prevailing assumptions about personality development.",

Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant. Overall, we find that loneliness is far more closely related to Neuroticism than previously understood, and distinct from both social isolation and social disconnection.",

          "abstract": "When breaking bad news (BBN) in pediatric oncology, effective triadic communication among healthcare professionals (HCPs), pediatric patients, and their families is essential. The quality of BBN influences the entire cancer care trajectory, impacting BBN receivers’ (patients and their families) shared decision-making abilities, treatment adherence, distress reduction, and coping skills. BBN is considered challenging for both transmitters and receivers. Unlike for adult oncology, there is no specific support for pediatric oncology in Germany, such as guidelines, protocols, or comprehensive BBN skill training.\nIn order to provide practice-based evidence guidance for HCPs in pediatric oncology, the research project OKRA (Orientation Compass for Breaking Bad News in Pediatric Oncology) created a comprehensive BBN-support instrument: the OKRA Compass. This Compass aims to facilitate the navigation of BBN transmitters during the preparatory, transmission, and subsequent follow-up phases of BBN. The initial phase of this study involved formulating high-quality BBN theses (recommendations) through a participatory group Delphi, focusing on multiperspective, practice-based knowledge. Representatives from four groups were constantly engaged: BBN transmitters and receivers, family support organizations, and researchers. Then, based on the theses, a pilot Compass was refined through practical application in five pediatric oncology clinics in Germany.\nThis paper aims to elucidate how the OKRA Compass has engendered novel developments or alterations in the daily BBN routine. Applying the OKRA Compass in daily routines has yielded significant insights across four domains: (1) Considering BBN as a complex process, (2) addressing the multi-layered needs of BBN receivers, (3) encouraging new paths for shared decision-making, and (4) cultivating awareness of the needs of BBN transmitters.\nProviding a BBN support instrument at no cost is imperative to foster high-quality BBN processes. The OKRA Compass underscores the significance of effective communication by offering a structured, comprehensive, and context-tailored orientation to novice BBN transmitters and serving as a catalyst for experienced BBN transmitters. The OKRA Compass is expected to be widely accepted as it not only fills a gap. Incorporating diverse experts during its development was crucial for ensuring its comprehensive utility across all HCPs in pediatric oncology.\nIncorporating the OKRA Compass’s theses into daily routines requires organizational openness to change, which must be enforced at the individual, team, and organizational levels. This process demands a readiness to adapt, allocate resources, and invest in enhancing team communication skills.",

However, realizing lifestyle changes is challenged by\nwidespread misperceptions about the climate impact of different mitigation behaviors, making\nit difficult even for motivated individuals to identify which actions to prioritize and which\npolicies to support. Little is known about the cross-national variability of such climate impact\nperceptions and their association with climate-relevant outcomes. We aim to address this gap\nwith a pre-registered cross-country study (N = 2,742) in China, Germany, and the United\nStates. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we investigate the extent to which participants’\nperceptions of the climate impact of behaviors and their accuracy in estimating carbon\nfootprints is associated with their own climate-related behavior and their support for behavior-\ntargeted climate policies. Across the three countries, participants largely misperceived overall\ncarbon footprints, and underestimated the climate impact of highly carbon-intensive actions.\nDespite these behavior-specific misperceptions, impact perceptions of different actions were\nindependent of each other, showing no evidence for compensatory judgments. Participants’\nimpact perceptions and carbon footprint accuracy were associated with their own\ncorresponding behavior across all countries. However, the association between impact\nperceptions and climate policy support varied by national context with impact perceptions\nhaving a direct effect in Germany, no effect in China, and a moderated effect by political\norientation in the United States.

However, much of the guidance on collecting and interpreting AA data is written for researchers and there are few guides written for clinical practitioners who may be interested in using AA data to inform their clinical practice. As clinical researchers and practitioners ourselves, we aim to increase interdisciplinary crosstalk by illustrating the benefits of integrating AA data into clinical practice using case examples. We offer practical recommendations for how clinicians might effectively use digital data. Specifically, we encourage clinicians to (1) co-create digital assessments that align with their client’s goals, (2) consider which digital device (or assessment modality) may be best suited to measure their client’s symptoms, experiences, or goals, and to (3) co-determine what constitutes ‘meaningful change’ for your client and their goals.

This study examined what factors are linked to dishonest survey responses among adolescents by analyzing data from 176,966 Norwegian teenagers. Using advanced machine learning techniques, researchers achieved a high sensitivity and specificity of 79.9% with an area under the curve of 87.3% in classifying self-reported dishonest responders. The analysis revealed eight key factors related to dishonest responding: perceived stress, anxiety, school dissatisfaction, coping skills, experiences of verbal harassment, substance use, antagonistic behavior, and social well-being. Notably, factors like substance use, school dissatisfaction, and antagonistic behaviors were positively associated with dishonest responding, while anxiety, stress, coping abilities, and social well-being showed negative associations. Contrary to some expectations, the study found no evidence for links between dishonest responses and factors such as socioeconomic status, depression, loneliness, or alcohol use. The findings suggest that dishonest survey responses among adolescents are primarily connected to poor individual and social well-being, difficulty coping with challenges, and problematic externalizing behaviors.

We show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In Study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanized when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, and that they are overly despised.",

          "abstract": "Surveys are essential tools in mental health research and policy making, but dishonest responses can undermine their reliability. This study examined what factors are linked to dishonest survey responses among adolescents by analyzing data from 176,966 Norwegian teenagers. Using advanced machine learning techniques, researchers achieved a high sensitivity and specificity of 79.9% with an area under the curve of 87.3% in classifying self-reported dishonest responders. The analysis revealed eight key factors related to dishonest responding: perceived stress, anxiety, school dissatisfaction, coping skills, experiences of verbal harassment, substance use, antagonistic behavior, and social well-being. Notably, factors like substance use, school dissatisfaction, and antagonistic behaviors were positively associated with dishonest responding, while anxiety, stress, coping abilities, and social well-being showed negative associations. Contrary to some expectations, the study found no evidence for links between dishonest responses and factors such as socioeconomic status, depression, loneliness, or alcohol use. The findings suggest that dishonest survey responses among adolescents are primarily connected to poor individual and social well-being, difficulty coping with challenges, and problematic externalizing behaviors. This understanding can help researchers better design and interpret surveys targeting adolescent populations.",

          "abstract": "Parenthood transforms daily life, yet little is known about how parents regulate their own and each other’s emotions during paternity and maternity leave. Using experience sampling, we tracked the emotion states of Danish mothers and fathers six times daily for a week across maternity (N = 100) and paternity leave (N = 68). Bayesian multilevel coupled-oscillator models revealed distinct patterns of emotion regulation that varied systematically with leave arrangements. Both parents exhibited stronger self-regulation during their partner’s leave period, with arousal amplifying regulatory strength. Emotional synchrony in valence and arousal emerged between co-located partners, suggesting\nthat parents jointly navigated a shared emotional space. During maternity leave but not paternity leave, mothers followed fathers’ emotional lead, especially for high-arousal emotions, whereas fathers displayed arousal-modulated co-regulation, providing emotional counterbalance particularly during mothers’ low-arousal states. These asymmetric patterns demonstrate how couples’ coordinated emotion strategies adapt to changing circumstances and highlight the role of interpersonal processes in shaping emotional experiences.",

Deontological arguments ought to explain why it is better to make things worse. We suggest that arguments attempting to do this are usually fallacious. We list several categories of fallacies. We report two demonstrations in which we ask whether people without special training can classify fallacies correctly. People vary in their classification ability, and that ability is correlated with acceptance of the standards of actively open-minded thinking, possibly because both traits require meta-cognitive competence.",

Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, we asked participants to reflect on their retirement transition, attitudes toward solitude, social influences on their alone time, and their perceived control over managing solitude during retirement. Thematic analysis revealed key themes, including shifts in identity, balancing social connection and alone time, and the role of autonomy and financial stability in shaping solitude experiences. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and social isolation. Findings suggest that achieving a balance between alone time and social engagement is critical to fostering positive experiences of solitude in retirement.",

          "authors": "ru song",
          "abstract": "In moral scenarios, individuals often exhibit divergent interpretations and judgments of the same moral event due to varying prior experiences, making true \"bystander objectivity\" challenging. This study investigates how prior experiences influence perspective selection and subsequently moderate moral judgment and its neural underpinnings by activating different moral role perspectives (decision-maker vs. receiver) using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). Results reveal that activating the receiver's perspective leads to stricter moral judgments, whereas activating the decision-maker's perspective results in more lenient judgments. Furthermore, the moderating effect of perspective on moral judgment weakens as the decision-maker's gains from immoral choices decrease. At the neural level, activating different moral role perspectives affects early processing and emotional arousal during moral judgment, manifesting as larger N1 and P2 components for the decision-maker perspective, and larger FRN components related to expectation violation for the receiver perspective. These findings indicate that prior moral experiences significantly shape an individual's moral judgment preferences as a bystander, primarily by modulating early processing of others' moral decisions.",

This model suggests that individuals’ behaviors are influenced by motivational factors, with online disinhibition moderating this process.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWe observed how individuals expressed their attitudes by clicking “Like” when reading a fictional thread with multiple replies. In Study 1a, participants were shown two types of replies in a thread: inflammatory and normal posts. In Study 1b, we followed up with the participants from Study 1a by asking them how sensational and annoying they perceived each post. In Study 2, we examined whether participants clicked “Like” on a post that contained extreme language.\nFindings\nIn Study 1a, the influence of online disinhibition on Like-clicking did not significantly differ across post types. In Study 1b, when participants perceived posts as sensational or annoying, they were more likely to click “Like” if they experienced high levels of online disinhibition. For posts that were neither sensational nor annoying, online disinhibition did not affect the likelihood of clicking “Like.” In Study 2, although online disinhibition was significantly correlated with Like-clicking on the extreme post, this effect was not observed among participants who held a negative attitude toward the extreme post.\nOriginality\nThis study rigorously examined the causal relationships among motivational factors, online disinhibition, and behaviors, challenging previously overgeneralized explanations of online disinhibition theory regarding online behaviors.",

In this paper, we introduce Drawing of THINGS (DoT), a novel dataset of 28,627 human drawings of 1,854 diverse object concepts, sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language, mirroring the structure of the THINGS image database. In addition to data on drawings’ stroke history, we further collected fine-grained recognition data for each drawing, along with metadata on participant demographics, drawing ability, and mental imagery. We characterize people’s ability to communicate and recognize semantic information encoded in drawings and compare this ability to their ability to recognize real-world images of the same visual objects. We also explore the relationship between drawing understanding and the memorability and typicality of the objects contained in THINGS. In sum, we envision DoT as a powerful tool that builds on the THINGS database to advance understanding of how humans express knowledge about visual concepts.",

The QBE message was hypothesized to reduce preferred speeds in a video speed test.  Contrary to the hypothesis, we found no evidence to support that the QBE message resulted in different speed preferences as compared to the default message.

          "abstract": "Due to the DSM diagnosis category including mental paraphilia, there has been a question of whether or not BDSM/kink is linked to pathology (Moser et al. 2005). Kink refers to unconventional sexual practices or desires. BDSM is an overarching term that refers to a spectrum of sexual behaviors and preferences that incorporate (B)ondage, (D)iscipline (or Domination), (S)adism (or submission), and (M)asochism. The biases and stigma towards BDSM and kink have shown to be detrimental, as research has found that many BDSM and kink identified individuals are not out due to the fear of stigma and concerns regarding clinician beliefs. This is the case regardless of having specific needs relating to their kink behaviors and preferring to be out to their providers (Waldura et. al 2016). Therefore, the current aim of this project is to broadly explore therapists’ understanding and attitudes towards BDSM and kink through semi-structured interviews. IRB approval was obtained and we recruited 10 practicing clinicians using Psychology Today. Consistent with the qualitative research tradition of eliciting diverse responses, we identified individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, we selected participants who listed sex therapy or kink-allied work in their bios as well as those who have no link to these key terms. Participants were asked to provide informed consent and participate in a 30-45 minute interview via Google Meets. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis procedures outlined by Braun and Clarke (2022). Thematic analysis has been used to identify, analyze, and report patterns in the data. We identified several themes that give us a better understanding of how therapists’ react to specific dynamics, and what would make them more comfortable in working with BDSM-and-kink identifying individuals. This exploratory research allows us to better assess future steps needed to work towards BDSM and kink normalization to enhance treatment effectiveness and allow therapists to provide more individualized care for their clients. Additional implications will be discussed.",

          "abstract": "How do we tailor learning experiences to promote formation and generalization of conceptual knowledge? Exposing learners to a highly variable set of examples has been postulated to benefit generalization, but evidence is conflicting. In the present study, we manipulated training set variability in terms of both the typicality of training examples (high vs. low coherence) and the number of unique examples (small vs. large set size) while controlling the total number of training trials. The face family category structure was designed to allow participants to learn by picking up on shared features across category members and/or by attending to unique features of individual category members. We found relatively little effect of set size but a clear benefit of high coherence (lower variability) training both in terms of category learning and generalization. Moreover, high coherence training biased participants to make judgments based on shared features in both categorization and recognition. Using an exploratory model fitting procedure, we tested the hypothesis that high coherence training facilitates prototype abstraction. Instead, we found an exemplar model advantage across training conditions. Yet, there was also systematic misfit for all models for some trial types, including underestimating the influence of shared features in categorization responses. Overall, we show that high-variability training is not necessarily beneficial for concept learning when the total length of training is controlled. Instead, training on typical examples promotes fast learning and broad category knowledge by helping learners extract shared category features.",

          "abstract": "Songs intimately combine two defining human capacities: music and language. As a song unfolds, interconnected musical and linguistic elements such as dissonant chords and evocative words combine to generate fluctuating patterns of tension and relaxation, with associated predictive expectations that shape aesthetic and emotional experiences. However, how these patterns integrate across both domains to produce a holistic sense of tension remains unexplored. We investigated this integration in a tension-rich subset of Western vocal music, late-Romantic art songs, hypothesising that tonal and semantic tension combine superadditively. Using a naturalistic listening paradigm, online participants rated tonal, semantic, and holistic tension in three selected songs. Results suggest that the musical dimension (tonal tension) plays a more prominent role than the linguistic one (semantic tension) in shaping overall affect. Music alone explained a greater proportion of variance in the holistic condition than did lyrics alone. A significant redundant-information component suggested an integration of music and lyrics under genre-specific rules, while a synergistic-information component indicated their combined effect exceeds the sum of their individual contributions. Though based on a specific tonal-poetic idiom, our findings illuminate how music and language might integrate during real-time listening, from the experiential perspective of tension. We discuss how both culture-specific and culture-invariant (universal) mechanisms may contribute to this process, offering insights into cross-domain aesthetic integration.",

Fifty-four students from the University of Limpopo, South Africa, rated these stimuli. Using a 75% rater agreement threshold, we refined the set to 131 validated images, termed the Limpopo facial emotion stimulus set. This subset demonstrated high recognition of the intended facial expressions and strong consistency between raters. We present psychometric results describing these open-access stimuli, which we hope will be informative for other researchers. Our validation process underscores the importance of adapting materials to match the cultural and social context of the target population.

In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then compare the relative evidence for these two competing hypotheses and find that for political topics, it is 20 times more likely that cognitive reflection is associated with less motivated reasoning – in contrast to the prediction from the influential “motivated reflection” hypothesis. Our results highlight the need for more nuanced theories of how different cognitive control processes interact with motivated reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Empathy is essential for human social interaction; however, extending empathy toward individuals with dissimilar characteristics facing daily challenges may be difficult. This study investigated how people without disabilities empathize with individuals with disabilities, specifically those with stroke-induced hemiplegia, during manual interactions with objects or other people. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying empathy in these contexts. Participants observed video stimuli featuring individuals with hemiplegia performing hand movements, such as grasping a human hand or an object (a plastic bottle), using either their hemiplegic or non-hemiplegic hands. Behavioral results showed observing grasping movements performed by the hemiplegic hand elicited stronger negative empathic feelings than those performed by the non-hemiplegic hand, regardless of the grasping targets. Positive empathic feelings were more pronounced while observing the hemiplegic hand grasping the human hand than the object. Furthermore, classification approaches in MVPA revealed that parts of the mirror neuron system and mentalizing networks distinguished empathic responses to grasping the human hand and the object commonly across the hemiplegic and the non-hemiplegic hands conditions. Additionally, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) more accurately classified empathic responses to hemiplegic than non-hemiplegic grasping movements. Representational similarity analysis revealed that brain regions associated with affective empathy were specifically attuned to feelings of relief involved in the grasping movements across conditions. These findings suggest that both affective and cognitive empathic brain systems are mutually engaged when empathizing with individuals with hemiplegia who face complex challenges. The dorsal MPFC likely plays a key role in facilitating precise empathic responses to the challenges of hemiplegic movements. Moreover, the affective system is particularly fine-tuned to positive feelings, such as relief. Our findings advance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying empathy toward individuals with different characteristics.",

Quantum brain theories have not been sufficiently “scaled up”\nto provide clear implications for how quantum physical processes generate\nmore complex cognition. Quantum cognition theories have avoided addressing\nfundamental issues about consciousness and have remained agnostic with\nrespect to the quantum brain hypothesis. This article will address the problem\nof connecting these ideas together by connecting quantum cognition to\nthe other two topics.",

          "abstract": "Parental involvement plays an important role in children’s learning within everyday social contexts. This study investigated whether and how a brief instructional intervention affected parent-child interactions during play, and how parents’ and children’s behaviors impacted children’s learning during the play and subsequent independent exploration. Parents and their 3- to 6-year-old children (N = 72) engaged with causal toys, with parents assigned to one of three conditions: Teaching (teach the child), Helping (help the child), or No-involvement (watch the child). During the Interactive Phase, parent-child dyads had four minutes to explore the toys and figure out the causal rule together. This was followed by the Independent Phase, in which children explored a different set of toys with a new causal rule on their own for three minutes. Children's learning outcomes were assessed after each phase. Results indicated that parents in the No-involvement condition asked fewer questions and provided less feedback and encouragement compared to those in the Teaching and Helping conditions. However, there were no significant differences in parental behaviors between the Helping and Teaching groups. Across all conditions, parents’ use of questioning (particularly pedagogical questions) and guidance in helping children generate evidence during the interaction predicted better learning outcomes for children. These improved learning outcomes were even observed following children’s independent exploration, suggesting that guidance (in particular in the form of pedagogical questions) supports “learning to learn”.",

          "abstract": "A familect is the type of inward-oriented language variety used by families. It exhibits some distinctive features compared to other more outward-oriented vernacular varieties, which result from its function in bonding and marking identity. Familects also share some characteristics with child language and child-oriented speech, as well as with forms of language play. Additionally, most of the familectal features can be found in the languages spoken by small, isolated, close-knit human groups. This commentary reviews both the idiosyncratic features of familects and their overlap with other vernacular varieties, as well as the functional explanations for them. It also argues for promoting research on this understudied variety found in all human languages, which should contribute to a better understanding of language diversity, language change, and language evolution.",

It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then compare the relative evidence for these two competing hypotheses and find that for political topics, it is 20 times more likely that cognitive reflection is associated with less motivated reasoning – in contrast to the prediction from the influential “motivated reflection” hypothesis. Our results highlight the need for more nuanced theories of how different cognitive control processes interact with motivated reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Background \n\nAlcohol and tobacco use as well as increases in psychological distress continue to be public health concerns among youth in the United States (U.S.), including Hispanic youth who represent 25% of all American youth. The social determinants of health (SDOH) in relation to alcohol and tobacco use (ATU) among Hispanic youth have been investigated for decades. Evaluation of the multi-level influence of SDOH on ATU and the intersection with mental health among youth is needed to inform early interventions that promote positive health outcomes among American Hispanic adults. \n\nMethods \n\nWe conducted a systematic, reproducible search on PubMed for empirical research articles published that examined the SDOH of ATU among Hispanic/Latino/a/x adolescents in the U.S. We retrieved and screened 1464 titles and abstracts that yielded 256 articles for full review, of which 63 articles met final criteria for inclusion in the final synthesis. We categorized the SDOH by domains of behavioral, physical/built environment, socio-cultural, health care, and by levels for individual, interpersonal, school, community, and societal factors. \n\nResults \n\nMost studies focused on socio-cultural domains within individual and interpersonal levels. Less studies examined societal and healthcare domains. Along with the influence of individual and interpersonal determinants (e.g., generational status, Hispanic values, acculturation stress, family and peers), community level factors (e.g., neighborhood level factors such as neighborhood exposure to ATU and neighborhood ethnic concentration) emerged as key structural predictors of ATU. Ethnic discrimination was also identified as a societal level predictor that influenced ATU, with potential association of mental health as mediators, moderators, or co-occurring outcomes. About one-third of the studies investigated the influence of SDOH on ATU along with mental health related variables like depression, anxiety, and stress.  \n\nConclusion \n\nSDOH at the societal level and in the healthcare domain were identified as understudied among Hispanic adolescents. Future research is needed on these broader societal and structural determinants, including access to healthcare services and the integration of substance use prevention within these services, to intervene early in adolescence and reduce ATU related health consequences among Hispanic adults in the U.S.",

By reviewing findings on patterns of typing errors and statistical learning in typed production, as well as influences of various factors on typing, including the similarity between the target word and its context, we show that typing has much in common with other modalities of language production and should be viewed as reflecting the general architecture of the language production system. We then discuss some of the contributions of typing research to the action monitoring literature due to the unique position that typing occupies at the interaction of phonological, orthographic, visual, and motor processes. We end by encouraging greater integration of typing research into psycholinguistic frameworks, not simply to confirm the predictions of such theories but to break new frontiers and push for new domains of inquiry.",

The QBE message was hypothesized to reduce preferred speeds in a video speed test.  Contrary to the hypothesis, we found no evidence to support that the QBE message resulted in different speed preferences as compared to the default message.

This question has received considerable attention among researchers, but answering it requires measures of conspiracist belief that function the same among Democrats and Republicans. Unfortunately, evidence of such measurement invariance is scarce. To address this limitation, the current preregistered study tested the invariance of four short-form conspiracist ideation measures across the two major US political parties. We hypothesized that all four scales would achieve strict factorial invariance. The General Measure of Conspiracism was the only measure to reach this level. The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale–5 and Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire, by contrast, only achieved metric invariance, despite the former demonstrating the greatest overall fit of the measures tested. The American Conspiracy Thinking Scale only achieved configural invariance. Researchers who are interested in comparing conspiracist ideation between Democrats and Republicans may, therefore, be best served by using the General Measure of Conspiracism.",

While these skills are correlated, most studies examining the role of speech perception on outcomes do not test both concurrently. Moreover, traditional forced-choice tasks have limitations in accurately indexing these relationships. This study used a visual analog scaling task—a continuous measure of speech categorization—to examine speech categorization alongside conventional language and reading assessments in a large sample of children (n = 237), including those with language and/or reading disabilities. Children with poorer language/reading exhibited lower trial-to-trial categorization consistency, but no differences in the slope of the mean function. Group analyses further linked differences in categorization consistency to language/reading disabilities, with reading being linked particularly to the processing of vowels. Critically, categorization consistency uniquely predicted language/reading, even when controlling for the mediating effect of phonological processing. These findings suggest that the consistency of perceptual processes is more important than the quality of the representations.",

          "abstract": "The study examines the retrieval strategies that people engage in during associative recognition in working memory. To this end, we employ eye movements as a tool to track the underlying retrieval processes. Previous work has shown that during retrieval people tend to look back at empty spatial locations where the information was presented at encoding, known as the looking at nothing (LAN) effect. Thus, reflecting which memorandum has been retrieved. In a series of four experiments, we presented participants with four-word pairs at four different locations at encoding. During an immediate retrieval test, they heard two words and were asked to indicate if these two words belonged to the same word pair (positive probe) or not (lure probe). We hypothesized that LAN observed during lure probes will be diagnostic in informing which strategy participants engage in. On the one hand, participants can retrieve a word pair associated with one of the probe words through a pairwise binding. On the other hand, they can retrieve both word pairs based on a parallel comparison to the integrated representation of all the word pairs to perform the task. All experiments provided evidence in favor of a retrieval strategy where they retrieved only one of the word pairs. Additionally, we implemented a measurement model for the timeline of LAN. The onset of the effect is dependent on the inter word interval at retrieval as well as the size and distance between the locations.",

          "abstract": "Social information plays a key role in almost all areas of human decision-making, helping individuals reduce uncertainty and improve their decisions. Despite a wealth of research on how people use social information, few studies have focused on the process of searching for social information. Social information search is, however, a key component of social learning. People also do not learn from just anyone, for example, they show preference for their ingroup and actively disregard information from the outgroup. Such a bias can have negative outcomes. Here, we examine how partisanship—known to cause a strong ingroup bias—affects social information search and social information use across four studies. We split the search process into initiation—an initial hurdle to seek out social information—and the extent of search after initiation. We found that partisanship did not affect the quantity of search after initiation, with participants exploring the choices of ingroup and outgroup members equally. However, in an election prediction task, where partisan identity was more salient, participants initiated more social information search from the ingroup. For social information use, participants gave more weight to the choices of ingroup members and weighed social information more if it aligned with their political beliefs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of disentangling social information search and use, highlighting that partisan biases in information processing can emerge at different stages.",

          "abstract": "Randomized experiments remain the gold standard for establishing causality, yet ethical and practical constraints in certain fields often require researchers to rely on observational data. Although psychologists recognize that correlation does not imply causality, the conventional cautionary statements regarding correlation typically found at the end of articles have not sufficiently advanced psychological science, particularly in subfields such as developmental and personality psychology that predominantly rely on observational data. Sensitivity analyses commonly used in biostatistics and epidemiology offer powerful tools to quantify the risk of unmeasured confounding in observational data analysis, essentially encouraging applied researchers to assess how strongly an unmeasured confounder must be associated with both the predictor and outcome in order to negate an observed predictor-outcome association (i.e., reduce the effect to null). This tutorial explores the frequently overlooked but critical issue of unmeasured confounding in psychological research and introduces psychologists to the E-value, a novel and straightforward method for assessing the robustness of exposure-outcome associations to unmeasured confounding. We demonstrate the application of E-value using common psychological research scenarios in R and discuss its strengths, limitations, and recommended best practices. Psychologists can more accurately assess and transparently report research findings, particularly in subfields relying primarily on observational data, by more explicitly considering unmeasured confounding and incorporating sensitivity analysis techniques like the E-value into their methodological toolkits.",

Parallel to this development, recent times have seen more stringent guidelines with respect to data privacy, culminating in the General Data Protection Regulation law, or GDPR. Navigating the balance between protecting participants’ privacy and making one's dataset as open as possible can be challenging for researchers.

Many of them rely on R Markdown as a language to dynamically generate reproducible research assets (e.g., reports, posters, or presentations).\n However, a simple way to detect non-reproducibility, that is, unwanted changes in these assets over time is still missing.

While belief updating was optimistically biased and Reinforcement-learning-like outside the pandemic, the bias faded, and belief updating became more rational Bayesian-like during the pandemic. This malleability of anticipating the future during the COVID-19 pandemic was further underpinned by a lower integration of positive belief-disconfirming information, fewer but stronger negative estimations, and more confidence in base rates. The findings offer a window into the putative cognitive mechanisms of belief updating during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven more by quantifying the uncertainty of the future than by the motivational salience of optimistic outlooks.",

          "authors": "Maleen Thiele; Gustaf Gredebäck; Daniel Haun",
          "abstract": "Decades of research have highlighted the important role of joint attention in early cultural learning. However, most previous studies focused on a limited range of joint attention settings involving the learner’s first-person participation in joint visual attention, characterized by eye contact and triadic gaze following. This has created an incomplete picture, tending to neglect the diversity in which infants experience social connectedness in their daily lives. To deepen our understanding of the multifaceted nature of joint attention, this study investigated infants’ object memory in previously unexplored joint attention contexts, including physical cues of togetherness within observed interactions. Nine- and 18-month-old German infants participated in an object encoding task featuring videos of two people looking at an object. The videos varied in the presence and combination of mutual eye contact and mutual touch in physical proximity. After each video, the familiarized object reappeared next to a novel object. Infants’ looking time preference for the novel object was used as a measure of their prior encoding of the familiarized object. Eighteen-month-olds demonstrated superior encoding in all conditions involving interpersonal connectedness, expressed through eye contact, proximal touch, or a combination of both. In contrast, 9-month-olds’ object encoding was only enhanced in the presence of eye contact, regardless of proximal touch. These findings demonstrate a developmental refinement from a primary reliance on visual cues to a more comprehensive understanding of third-party jointness incorporating a broader range of cues. Joint attention is a highly flexible social learning mechanism, capable of operating in diverse social environments.",

          "abstract": "Mixture models for visual working memory tasks using continuous report recall are highly popular measurement models in visual working memory research. Yet, efficient and easy- to-implement estimation procedures that flexibly enable group or condition comparisons are scarce. Specifically, most software packages implementing mixture models have used maximum likelihood estimation for single-subject data. Such estimation procedures require large trial numbers per participant to obtain robust and reliable estimates. This problem can be solved with hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedures that provide robust and reliable estimates with lower trial numbers. In this tutorial, we illustrate how mixture models for visual working memory tasks can be specified and fit in the newly developed R package bmm. The benefit of this implementation over existing hierarchical Bayesian implementations is that bmm integrates hierarchical Bayesian estimation of the mixture models with an efficient linear model syntax that enables us to adapt the mixture model to practically any experimental design. Specifically, this implementation allows varying model parameters over arbitrary groups or experimental conditions. Additionally, the hierarchical structure and the specification of informed priors can improve subject-level parameter estimation and solve estimation problems frequently. We illustrate these benefits in different examples and provide R code for easy adaptation to other use cases.",

This study explores the continuous responses of listeners to a piece of Chinese orchestral music and how their musical backgrounds influence affective responses, as well as the acoustic and musical features used in the perception of affective intentions. Three groups of listeners (trained in Chinese and Western art music traditions and nonmusicians) were presented with a 15.5-minute piece of music and responded continuously on a unidimensional emotional intensity scale and a two-dimensional valence and arousal interface in separate blocks. Functional data analysis compared differences between listener groups' response profiles. Time series analysis explored how each listener group utilized different acoustic and musical features over the course of the music. Results show significant differences between listener groups over different sections of the music. Valence responses diverge more than arousal or emotional intensity responses.

          "abstract": "Our minds consistently distort memories of objects and events. Oftentimes, these distortions serve to transform incoherent memories into coherent ones, as when we misremember partial events as whole (“event completion”). What mechanisms drive these distortions? Whereas extant work shows that representations of causality, continuity, familiarity, physical coherence, or event coherence create memory distortions, we suggest that a simpler and more fundamental mechanism may be at play: object persistence. Merely seeing an object take part in an event can create a persisting memory of its presence throughout that event. In 8 pre-registered experiments (N=317 adults), participants performed a simple task where they watched an animation, then chose whether or not a frame from the animation contained an object. Participants falsely remembered seeing an object when it was not there (E1). These effects persisted in the absence of causality (E2), continuity (E3), event familiarity (E4), object familiarity (E5), even when the events violated physical laws (E6), and when the events themselves were not coherent (E7). However, the effect disappeared when we abolished object persistence (E8). Thus, object persistence alone creates rich, enduring, and coherent representations of objects and events.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies support the existence of objective emotional visual cues. For\ninstance, red and blue are usually associated with high and low arousal, respectively. A similar phenomenon has been observed with other colors, as well as textures, shapes, and motion patterns. Yet, it is not clear to which extent this phenomenon can be extrapolated to Virtual Reality (VR) stimuli. Therefore, this manuscript presents an experiment where five virtual environments were evaluated by 21 participants in terms of valence and arousal. The design of the virtual environments was informed by evidence found in previous studies. Each environment represents one of the four quadrants of the Circumplex Model of Affect, plus a neutral environment. The results suggest that the emotions associated with the virtual environments are consistent with the evidence used to inform the design\nprocess. Individual differences across participants do not seem to influence the evaluation of the visual cues.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the well-being of Iranian immigrants in the U.S., investigating the potential buffering role of social support in coping with discrimination in both workplace and everyday situations. The research sought to understand the unique challenges faced by this demographic, especially in the context of recent political events and the broader U.S.-Iran relationship.  A sample of 139 Iranian immigrants currently residing in the U.S. (62% Female, M age = 35.54, range age = 21–85) using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. Sociodemographic factors were collected, such as experiences of discrimination at work and in daily life, perceived social support, and measures of well-being and happiness. This sample’s well-being was compared to a sample of Iranians living in Iran (N = 248). Findings suggest that Iranian immigrants in the U.S. report higher levels of well-being compared to Iranians residing in Iran. Age, relationship status, and health were significantly associated with well-being in Iranian immigrants. Rather than everyday discrimination, work discrimination emerged as a significant negative predictor of well-being. While social support did not moderate the relationship between work discrimination and well-being, it was a significant predictor of well-being on its own. Despite facing workplace discrimination, Iranian immigrants in the U.S. demonstrate greater well-being than their counterparts in Iran, with social support playing a pivotal role in their overall happiness. This signifies the importance of immigration for the well-being of people immigrating from unstable countries such as Iran.",

          "abstract": "Some spoken phrases, when heard repeatedly, seem to transform into music, in a classic finding known as the speech-to-song illusion. Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive work on the evolution of cooperation, the roles of teaching and leadership in transmitting opaque cultural norms—foundations of cooperative behaviors—are underexplored. Similarly, while teaching is well-studied in the evolution of instrumental culture, little attention is given to its role in transmitting opaque culture, such as social values and norms. Transmitting opaque culture often requires teaching, and group leaders are well-positioned to facilitate this process. Using comparative ethnographic data, we explore teaching, leadership, and instrumental versus opaque culture by examining whether opaque culture is primarily transmitted via teaching, which age groups tend to learn these norms, and whether leaders are disproportionately involved in teaching. Drawing on ethnographic data from 23 egalitarian foraging societies, we find teaching is more strongly associated with transmitting cultural values and kinship knowledge than subsistence skills and is closely linked to opaque culture and leadership. Leader-directed teaching may drive cooperation, suggesting new research avenues.",

If a memory is fuzzy, it likely occurred longer ago than a memory that is vivid. Here, we demonstrate a robust illusion of time that stands in stark contrast with this prediction. In six experiments, we show that experiences which are repeated (and, consequently, better remembered) are counterintuitively remembered as having initially occurred further away in time. This illusion is robust (amounting to as much as a 25% distortion in perceived time), consistent (exhibited by the vast majority of participants tested), and applicable at the scale of ordinary day-to-day experience (occurring even when participants were tested over one full week). We argue that this may be one of the key mechanisms underlying why it is that people’s sense of time often strongly deviates from reality.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the hypothesis that modern East Asian populations inherited and\nmaintained extensive psycho-social adaptations to arctic environments from ancestral\nAncient Northern East Asian populations, which inhabited arctic and subarctic\nNortheast Eurasia around the Last Glacial Maximum period of the late Pleistocene, prior to back migrating southwards into East Asia in the Holocene. I present the first cross-psychology comparison between modern East Asian and Inuit populations, using the latter as a model for paleolithic\nArctic populations. The comparison reveals that both East Asians and the Inuit exhibit\nnotably high emotional control/suppression, ingroup harmony/cohesion and subdomain\nunassertiveness, indirectness, self and social consciousness, reserve/introversion,\ncautiousness, and perseverance/endurance. The same traits have been identified by\ndecades of research in polar psychology (i.e., psychological research on workers,\nexpeditioners, and military personnel living and working in the Arctic and Antarctic) as\nbeing adaptive for, or byproducts of, life in polar environments. I interpret this as\nindirect evidence supporting my hypothesis that the proposed Arcticist traits in modern\nEast Asian and Inuit populations, primarily represent adaptations to arctic climates,\nspecifically for the adaptive challenges of highly interdependent survival in an\nextremely dangerous, unpredictable, and isolated environment, with frequent\nprolonged close-quarters group confinement, and exacerbated consequences for\nsocial devaluation/exclusion/expulsion. The paper concludes with a re-examination of\nprevious theories on the roots of East Asian psychology, mainly that of rice farming and\nConfucianism, in the light of my Arcticism theory.",

          "abstract": "Volunteering and charitable giving are core examples of traditional philanthropy that contribute to the health of democratic societies and individual well-being. Differences in people’s willingness to engage in these behaviors hint at a role of psychological factors that foster or hinder these types of philanthropic engagement. Theory and empirical research suggest that broad personality traits may shape volunteering and charitable giving. However, existing evidence for links between specific traits and philanthropic engagement has been mixed, in part because of insufficient statistical power and methodological variation across studies. In this preregistered meta-analysis, we integrated data from 29 studies to estimate the associations between the Big Five personality traits with volunteering (N = 91,241, Median age = 34 years, 61% female, 36% U.S. samples) and charitable giving (N = 3559, Median age = 39 years, 52% female, 40% U.S. samples). We further examined potential moderators, including the types of personality and philanthropic behavior measures used, gender, age, and sample region, to begin to explain the substantial heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies. Results indicated modest but robust correlations between the Big Five personality traits, volunteering, and charitable giving, with the largest effect sizes emerging for the links between extraversion and volunteering (r = .09, 95% CI [.05, .12]) and for agreeableness and charitable giving (r = .14, 95% CI [.04, .25]). There was little evidence for systematic moderator effects.

Children and adolescents often explore more than adults, a tendency commonly attributed to greater decision-making noise or stronger motivation to learn. Here, we propose developmental changes in structure learning as an alternative driver of exploration. Through exploration, we uncover relevant statistical relationships in our environment that can be leveraged to obtain rewards. To test this proposal, 252 8-to-25-year-old participants completed a patch-foraging task indexing individual differences in structure learning. Younger participants explored more, leaving patches sooner than adults. Computational modeling revealed that their early departures stemmed from their use of simpler and easier-to-plan-over structure representations to guide their decisions. Our findings go beyond previous algorithmic accounts of developmental change in exploration, suggesting that heightened exploration can also arise from differences in how children learn the structure of their environments.",

          "abstract": "'Brain fog,' or the experience of mental fatigue, impaired cognitive acuity, and confusion in the general population, has remained a largely under-researched phenomenon. However, it has been receiving increased scholarly attention in recent years. While previous literature has established a predictive relationship between mental fatigue and perceived stress, as well as the protective and mitigative role played by exposure to nature and mindfulness interventions, there exists minimal research specifically on brain fog, the non-clinical factors contributing to the development of its symptoms, and the factors that moderate these associations in the general population. The present study aims to address these research gaps and assess if Perceived Stress can predict Brain Fog. Furthermore, it aims to gauge if a sense of Connectedness to Nature and Mindfulness moderate the relationship between Brain Fog and Perceived Stress. Employing a quantitative and cross-sectional approach, this study recruited a sample of N = 70 participants via convenience-snowball sampling. The participants filled out an online survey comprising self-report inventories for each variable. The results indicated that Perceived Stress was a significant predictor of Brain Fog, negatively moderated by Connectedness to Nature. While Mindfulness did not predict or moderate Brain Fog, the Acting with Awareness facet of Mindfulness negatively moderated, or weakened, the relationship between Perceived Stress and Brain Fog. Insights obtained from this research will contribute to formulating alternative and holistic treatment pathways for the general population, who do not have access to specialized treatments, that can aid in mitigating symptomatic distress, including non-pathological levels of Brain Fog.\nKeywords: Brain Fog, Perceived Stress, Connectedness to Nature, Mindfulness",

          "abstract": "Measuring subjective experiences in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies has become a popular approach. A design choice in such studies is the response scale of the survey questions. Typically, researchers choose between a Likert scale and a visual analog scale (VAS). However, there is little guidance on this choice. We conducted a between-person experiment comparing a 7-point Likert scale (n=63) with a VAS (n=56) in an EMA study measuring affective states over 14 days. Using Bayesian multilevel models, we found that the VAS resulted in moderately higher within-person item means, lag-0 correlations, lag-1 autocorrelations, as well as lower within-person skewnesses and response frequencies of exact zeros. We found the largest difference in correlations with external criteria related to psychopathology, where correlations for the VAS were much higher. We did not observe reliable differences in within-person item variances, root mean squared successive differences, missing data, duration of measurements, and ratings about the experiences with the EMA survey. Apart from higher within-person means and higher correlations with external criteria in the VAS group, the differences were relatively small. While more research on response scales in EMA is needed, based on our results we conclude that the VAS should be preferred in studies aiming at capturing affective states relating to general psychopathology, as well as for items whose variation occurs close to scale limits. We conclude by discussing how our findings may contribute to a larger research agenda that addresses the fit of different response scales for different research aims.",

Using a set of computer simulations and two experiments, we tested the predictions of these two accounts. In addition to comparing the typing of homophones to well-matched controls in a sentence-dictation task (Exp. 1) and in a question-answering task (Exp. 2), we also examined the influence of lexical competition and syntactic category on homophone typing: sentences either contained one or both homophones, and the homophones either belonged to the same or different syntactic categories. Homophone interference persisted after ruling our poor spelling knowledge, and was stronger with increased lexical competition, supporting the performance account. There was little evidence of sensitivity to syntax. Collectively, these results point to competition (both lexical and segmental) as the main source of homophone interference in typing.",

Open science practices aim to enhance the transparency of research\nthereby both enabling others to reproduce the results presented in a paper and increasing\nthe replicability of these results using new data. Examples of these practices include\npreregistration, publication of data and analyses, open access publications, and replication\nresearch.\nAlthough open science practices are gaining traction, they have rarely been placed in\na broader epistemological context. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces the\nopen empirical cycle. It draws upon De Groot’s empirical cycle, a model of cumulative\nknowledge generation via scientific research. The open empirical cycle is a pragmatic guide\nfor researchers that includes and links to open science practices. Adhering to the open\nempirical cycle, if only partly, will structure the scientific workflow and create awareness of\nthe adverse consequences of deviations. Following the open empirical cycle increases the\ntransparency, quality, trustworthiness, and replicability of research.\nThe open empirical cycle presented in this paper focusses on hypothesis evaluation\nusing quantitative data in psychology. However, it can straightforwardly be applied to\nhypothesis evaluation in other social and behavioral sciences and biomedical sciences.

          "authors": "Sean Delaney",
          "abstract": "Although the evidential support of CBT as an integrated treatment package is overwhelming there have been a number of objections against the centrality of cognition in clinical change. This paper will focus on three such challenges:\n•\tComponent-based studies of CBT\n•\tMulti-level theories of cognition\n•\tThird wave CBT approaches\nThe paper accepts that although these three challenges pose questions, they are themselves not without criticism and their evidence is somewhat limited, inconsistent and open to interpretation. Yet it also observes an anomaly: despite repeated reference to evidential data within the cognitive therapy movement, there is limited research into the efficacy of specific cognitive techniques. It concludes however that while Beck’s notion of cognition as the centre-piece of psychotherapeutic process is evidentially assumptive, such is the role of the current cognitive paradigm that any radical alteration is deemed unlikely.",

          "abstract": "Efficiently allocating individuals to work on complex decision problems is a key challenge for groups, organizations, and societies. It involves a crucial trade- off: Increasing the number of individuals working on a task typically improves accuracy, but also increases costs. Research in collective intelligence has proposed a plethora of mechanisms to pool the judgments of independent decision makers in order to improve performance. However, these mechanisms are static; because they do not adjust the number of crowd members to the challenge at hand, they incur high, fixed costs for every decision problem. We develop and test three decision rules that make it possible to benefit from the wisdom of the crowd adaptively depending on a case’s difficulty. Our rules rely on decision makers’ confidence judgments to stop crowd growth. Empirical analyses in four real-world domains (cancer diagnoses, false news classification, criminology, and forecasting) using seven datasets show that our adaptive decision rules can result in equal or higher accuracy compared to widely used static crowd aggregators, while relying on fewer individuals. Our findings present easily applicable practical decision guidelines that can substantially boost the efficiency of crowds.",

          "authors": "Paul Hoffman; Clara Moeller; Holly Maclean",
          "abstract": "Producing coherent discourse requires us to regulate the content of our speech and avoid interference from discourse-irrelevant concepts that become active in semantic memory. The inhibitory deficit hypothesis proposes that coherence declines in later life are due to a reduced ability to inhibit these irrelevant ideas. However, existing evidence in support of this view is correlational. We performed an experimental test of the hypothesis by asking young (18-25) and older (70-90) participants to produce discourse on a range of topics while attending to two types of visual distractors: images of meaningful concepts and meaningless abstract patterns. The overall global coherence of responses was lower when participants were distracted (cf. no distraction) but this effect was not larger for meaningful distractors. Participants also spoke more slowly under distraction. These effects did not differ between age groups. Critically, however, in the meaningful distractor condition, responses diverged from the original topic more quickly than in the other conditions. This effect was only present in older participants. These results suggest two underlying effects at play. First, performing a concurrent task has a general effect on the speed and coherence of discourse, which in this study was age-invariant. Second, for older people, tasks that activate a series of irrelevant semantic representations have an additional cumulative effect on discourse content, causing it to deviate off topic more rapidly. Our results support the inhibitory deficit hypothesis and suggest that older people can improve their coherence by avoiding semantically-laden environmental distractors like TV or radio programmes.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Psychedelic research has expanded globally, but studies in Japan remain limited due to strict drug policies and social stigma. This study investigates the demographic characteristics and mental health effects of psychedelic use among Japanese users, providing insights for future drug policy and mental healthcare.\n\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Japanese psychedelic users recruited via social media (X, formerly Twitter) from May 1 to June 1, 2024. Eligible participants (aged 18+, Japanese nationals) completed an online questionnaire, reporting demographic data, psychedelic use history, and mental health assessments. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales before and after psychedelic use.\n\nResults: Among 615 participants, the average age was 33.8 years. LSD was the most used psychedelic. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores after psychedelic use (PHQ-9: Z = –14.87, p &lt; .001, r = 0.59; GAD-7: Z = –14.59, p &lt; .001, r = 0.58), suggesting potential mental health benefits.\n\nDiscussion: The findings support the self-medication hypothesis, indicating that individuals may turn to psychedelics for relief from mental distress, resulting in improved symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the study’s reliance on self-reported data and lack of clinical control limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Further research should investigate the therapeutic potential and risks of psychedelic use in Japan’s cultural context. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive drug policies and continued exploration of psychedelic use outside clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "Romantic love is a near-universal human experience. However, while it transcends cultural boundaries, its intensity varies significantly across individuals and societies. We hypothesize that this variability is partly driven by socio-cultural factors, particularly individualism—a cultural orientation prioritizing personal goals over group interests. As individualism continues to rise globally, its implications for romantic relationships remain underexplored. Here, we address this by examining the link between individualism and romantic love in two large-scale cross-cultural studies. In Study 1, we collected data from a convenience sample of 61,067 partnered individuals from 81 countries. In Study 2, we selected nationally representative samples from 50 countries, with controlled distributions of gender, age, and residential area (N = 6,620). The results were consistent across both studies—as individualism increased, both men and women reported lower levels of experienced love. In Study 2, individualism was additionally linked to a lower expressed desire for love, suggesting that individualism may erode the perceived importance of love. As people become increasingly individualistic, our findings provoke questions about the future of romantic love. They also carry implications for societal challenges such as rising divorce rates, fertility issues, and depression—all of which have been linked to unfulfilled or unhappy love.",

          "abstract": "According to aesthetic cognitivism theory, art represents a source of knowledge that promotes understanding, creativity and thinking. However, it remains unclear exactly what kind of art knowledge shapes understanding and thinking. Given the important role played by the arts in acquiring knowledge and facilitating learning and understanding of human culture, this study aimed to shed light on the transformative power of knowledge acquired through art training. Via a pre-registered study, we investigated the extent to which understanding, creative inspiration, thinking, and intellectual challenge judgements are impacted by distinct types of art knowledge training (e.g., in-depth training, brief training or no training), and the extent to which each kind of training generalises to new contexts. Using a training intervention paradigm and a multi-level Bayesian modelling approach, we found that participants (N ~50 per training group) assigned higher ratings of understanding, creativity, and thinking judgements for trained rather than for untrained artworks as a function of art training type. Particularly, in-depth art knowledge training involving visual and auditory descriptions of artworks rather than no training led to greater ratings. The effects of training generalised to unseen artworks produced by the same artist but not to different artists. Compared to the no training group, these effects were most robust for in-depth than brief art training group. These findings suggest that art knowledge training promotes art understanding, creative ideas and thinking, and generalises to new settings that involve a similar artistic style. This work shines a light on the training modality and required duration of art training to shape learning and guide the generalisation effects to novel contexts.",

          "abstract": "It is intensively debated whether Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) constitute appropriate models for human vision. Here, we investigated whether DCNNs show a typical characteristic of human face perception, namely holistic processing. In Experiment 1, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between a DCNN trained on face recognition and N = 32 human participants for different types of face images: Normal faces (with intact holistic and local feature-based information), Mooney faces (with intact holistic and degraded local feature-based information), and scrambled faces (with intact local feature-based information and degraded holistic information). The DCNN showed significantly larger performance decrements for both Mooney and scrambled faces than human participants. In Experiment 2, we trained three DCNN architectures on face recognition, one with unrestricted field size and two with field sizes restricted to approximately 1/9 and 1/16 of the input image, respectively. Subsequently, we compared unfamiliar face matching performance between these DCNNs and N = 36 human participants who viewed face images either in an unrestricted fashion or through a movable spotlight- like viewing aperture covering approximately 1/9 or 1/16 of the face images. While human face matching accuracy was substantially impaired by restricting the visual input with apertures, DCNN performance was not affected by restriction of the receptive field size. These results suggest that (a) DCNNs are able to achieve high face matching accuracy without using holistic information (b) the reliance of holistic information in DCNNs depends on the specific optimization conditions under which models are trained.",

          "abstract": "The human brain rapidly detects faces, even in inanimate objects—a phenomenon known as face pareidolia. While this illusion reveals the automaticity of face detection, it also presents a paradox: how does the brain process stimuli that are simultaneously faces and objects? Here, we combined behavioral experiments with electroencephalography to track the temporal dynamics of face pareidolia processing. Using a large stimulus set of human faces, objects containing illusory faces, and matched control objects, we show that perception of face pareidolia is remarkably flexible and task dependent. When making spontaneous similarity judgments, participants perceived illusory faces as intermediate between faces and objects. However, in explicit categorization tasks, the same stimuli were predominantly classified as objects, while rating face-likeness bolstered the representation of face-like features. Neural responses tracked this perceptual flexibility: early visual processing (90-130ms) correlated with face-like judgments, while later activity (150-210ms) aligned with object categorization. This temporal progression demonstrates how the brain maintains multiple levels of representation, integrating early face detection with subsequent object recognition to support flexible behavior. Our findings demonstrate that face pareidolia exemplifies the brain's capacity to resolve perceptual ambiguity through dynamic processing, with task demands determining how competing representations contribute to perception.",

This narrative review explores relevant psychological, physiological and neuroimaging studies to discuss whether diminished inhibitory control contributes to poor balance and falls in people with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia.  Inhibitory control, a component of executive function, plays a vital role in regulating attention and suppressing inappropriate impulses. Although objective tests of inhibitory control are not routinely used in clinical settings, research suggests inhibitory control declines early, and progressively, in AD. Postural tasks that engage inhibitory control can improve the accuracy of distinguishing fallers from non-fallers beyond known factors. Neuroimaging studies link the prefrontal cortex to both inhibitory and postural control, and this region exhibits neuronal loss early in AD. Thus, emerging evidence suggests that accurately assessing inhibitory control could not only inform falls risk but also aid AD detection.",

          "abstract": "Observational coding provides a means of measuring psychotherapy processes when self-report data is unavailable. The quality of the therapeutic alliance is a robust predictor of outcome as well as the most widely studied element of psychotherapy. The current study is the first to measure the alliance using thin slicing, or nonexpert judgments formed based on brief video clips. Four archival psychotherapy sessions from 53 adults were coded by undergraduates viewing either thin slices or entire sessions. Results indicated that four to five one-minute slices were sufficient to represent a session. We provide empirically derived coding guidelines specifying the number of raters and segments needed to optimize reliability for one-minute slices and entire sessions. A novel multilevel interrater reliability approach was applied. In addition, a single slice from three therapy sessions (3 minutes of coding total) was sufficient to predict therapy outcome (r = .28), with maximal predictive power when five slices from four sessions were aggregated (r = .33). Findings support the utility of thin slicing for efficiently capturing the alliance without compromising validity. More broadly, these data highlight the potential of thin slicing for tracking elements of psychotherapy across multiple timescales; this represents a possible avenue for addressing the time- and labour-intensive nature of existing coding methods, a current bottleneck in psychotherapy research. Further applications for research and clinical training are discussed.",

The aim of this study was to segment theory of mind into component processes and examine how tDCS modulates task performance in each to clarify the role of the temporoparietal junction in social cognition. Three stimulation conditions were used: anodal, cathodal, and sham. tDCS was applied to the right temporoparietal junction whilst participants completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task, a shape association self-other distinction task, and the Wisconsin card-sorting task. Results showed no significant differences between anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS conditions, as well as no significant change in task accuracy from before tDCS was applied to during tDCS being applied (p = .05). A significant difference in task performance was found between the three tasks. Exploratory analyses showed a significant, un-corrected task by stimulation by time point interaction, which is likely driven by the difference in task difficulty. The efficacy of tDCS remains unclear, and we highlight a potential file-drawer problem in this field.",

Upon reviewing dominant theoretical models of wisdom, here we outline how expression of wisdom’s metacognitive attributes differs across situational contexts, with implications for measurement practices. Next, we posit that the temporal dimension—essential to virtually all theories of wisdom—is paradoxically neglected or misinterpreted in empirical studies. Our findings are supported by a systematic review of literature, demonstrating that many conclusions about developing wisdom or its downstream effects are based on cross-sectional, atemporal data. In response, we advocate for greater focus on the temporal bounds of empirical data in social psychology and offer tutorial-style recommendations for formalizing narrative theories to explicitly specify one’s level of analysis. Beyond wisdom, we provide case examples of temporal neglect across other clinical, social, and cultural domains. Our recommendations thus provide a template for advancing dynamic research practices across diverse fields critical to understanding psychological change.",

          "abstract": "Some spoken phrases, when heard repeatedly, seem to transform into music, in a classic finding known as the speech-to-song illusion. Repeated listening to musical phrases can also lead to changes in liking, attributed to learning-related reduction of prediction errors generated by the dopaminergic reward system. Does repeating spoken phrases also result in changes in liking? Here we tested whether repeated presentation of spoken phrases can lead to changes in liking as well as in musicality, and whether these changes might vary with reward sensitivity. We also asked whether perceptual biases towards low versus high frequencies, as assessed using the Laurel/Yanny illusion, are linked to changes in musicality and liking with repetition. Results show a general reduction in liking for spoken phrases with repetition, but less so for phrases that transition more readily into song. People who upweight low frequencies in speech perception (and so perceive Laurel rather than Yanny) are more susceptible to changes in musicality with phrase repetition and marginally less susceptible to changes in liking. Individuals with musical anhedonia still perceived the speech-to-song illusion, but liked all spoken phrases less; this did not interact with repetition. Results show a dissociation between perception and emotional sensitivity to music, and support a model of frequency-weighted internal predictions for acoustic signals that might drive the speech-to-song illusion. Rather than treating illusions as isolated curiosities, we can use them as a window into theoretical debates surrounding models of perception and emotion.",

The current study thus examines (1) the relationship between music perceptual abilities and episodic musical memory, and (2) the influence of musical behaviors, such as music listening and instrument playing, on music perception skills. Sixty-one participants (35M, 26F) completed an episodic musical memory task, adapted from the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST; Stark et al., 2015), which measures general recognition and precision memory for music. Participants also completed a music perception task (Law &amp; Zentner, 2012) and provided data on musical behaviors. Regression analyses revealed that general recognition memory for music was predicted by overall music perception proficiency. Proficiency in music perception is in turn predicted only by the extent of music instrument playing, independent of formal musical training or other musical experiences. In contrast, precision memory for music was not predicted by overall music perception proficiency, but only by melody and tempo perception, underscoring distinct links between specific musical skills and memory. These findings highlight the nuanced connections between musical habits, perceptual skills and musical memory skills, emphasizing the role of music production activities in nurturing musical competence.",

          "abstract": "Individual behavior is often shaped by observing others’ actions. The seminal and widely cited Experiment 1 by Gino, Ayal, et al. (2009) found that individuals are more likely to behave dishonestly after witnessing blatant dishonest behavior by an ingroup member than by an outgroup member. However, because there was no strict baseline condition in the original study, where participants would be exposed to the dishonesty of others without any in/outgroup signals, it remains unclear whether the original effect is driven by ingroup contagion, outgroup differentiation, or both. Furthermore, because that experiment used natural groups only, it also remains unclear if distinct properties of natural groups are necessary, or if mere categorization into arbitrary groups suffices. In this registered report, we propose to test their general hypothesis that exposure to ingroup dishonesty norms increases individual dishonest behavior more than exposure to outgroup dishonesty norms does. Using validated procedures for studying dishonesty norms, we propose a conceptual replication and extension of Gino, Ayal, et al.'s (2009) Experiment 1. We will test their general hypothesis in both minimal and natural groups with 3,600 U.S. Americans. In the treatment conditions, participants will be exposed to standardized information about others’ dishonest behavior, where we will systematically vary the group identity signals of those dishonest others, and then allow participants to cheat and double their experimental earnings. Findings will bolster understanding of how group identity-based dishonesty norms affect individual dishonesty by clarifying mechanisms and generalizability of the effect.",

This study investigated the shared beliefs of everyday love among 230 U.S. adults who had immigrated from 78 countries; participants were aged 19–72 years (M = 37.82, SD = 11.38). We aimed to (1) assess whether U.S. immigrants come to a consensus on what love means in daily life, (2) explore the details of U.S. immigrants’ shared beliefs on love while comparing those beliefs with the general U.S. population, and (3) examine the individual differences in decision-making styles. Using the Extended Condorcet Model and Bayesian psychometric methods for CCT analysis, we found that U.S. immigrants converge on a single-culture consensus on love and have similar beliefs as the general U.S. population on a set of 60 everyday love scenarios. We also found differences between immigrants and the general population for some scenarios. Lastly, we found that individual differences (personality factors, integration index, education, country of origin) were associated with people’s ability to know the consensus and guessing tendencies. While beliefs on love are mostly shared among people from both majority and immigrant populations, this research highlights how cultural background can inform nuances in shared beliefs on love.",

          "abstract": "Performance crises in professional soccer can have profound psychological and organizational impacts, influencing team cohesion, confidence, decision-making, and stakeholder satisfaction. This study aims to develop and validate three quantitative indices – Relative Position (RP), Linear Rate of Change (LRC), and Exponential Rate of Change (ERC) – to assess team performance relative to expectations and detect the onset of crises. Using data from the 2023–24 Bundesliga season, the indices were applied to analyze patterns of underperformance and their connection to managerial changes, providing insights into the psychological dynamics underlying team crises.\nThe RP index quantifies a team’s position relative to preseason expectations, while the LRC index captures cumulative performance trends over the season. The ERC index emphasizes recent performance momentum, identifying acute downturns that may trigger psychological and structural crises. Results show that the indices are effective in diagnosing both chronic and acute performance issues, with sharp declines in ERC often coinciding with coaching dismissals, reflecting the psychological tipping points of team management decisions.\nIllustrative case studies of FC Augsburg and VfL Wolfsburg demonstrated the indices’ practical utility, highlighting contrasting patterns of early versus late interventions. Across the league, teams experiencing managerial changes exhibited significant negative trends in all three indices, underscoring their reliability in identifying crises. By integrating psychological momentum, expectation management, and performance analysis, the proposed indices provide a systematic approach to monitoring team performance, understanding the psychological precursors of crises, and enabling timely interventions to mitigate performance downturns.",

          "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of climate anxiety and its associations with mental health disorders have encouraged the scientific community to explore how individuals may effectively cope with this complex phenomenon. While existing research has primarily centered on behavioral strategies, much less is known about the role of traits and strategies that may help individuals mentally cope with adversity. Hence, the present preregistered review (PROSPERO: CRD42024574449) investigated the relationship between climate anxiety, psychological resilience, and cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies. We attempted to identify quantitative studies with observational designs that report novel results pertaining to associations of interest. To do so, we searched Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, and MEDLINE for published papers and theses, along with PsyArxiv, SocArXiv, and medRxiv for preprints. Additionally, we searched the reference lists of all eligible studies and assessed the quality of articles using the Survey Studies in Psychology checklist. In the end, 13 articles that contained 15 relevant studies and 97 relevant findings met our eligibility criteria. The results showed that psychological resilience was consistently negatively associated with climate anxiety, whereas the results were rather mixed for adaptive and maladaptive CER strategies. An additional identified construct, psychological adaptation to climate change - a blend of different (mal)adaptive CER strategies - was positively associated with climate anxiety. Despite limitations, such as the small number of studies and relatively low cohesion between them, our review highlights psychological resilience as a protective factor and the complexity of the relationship between CER strategies and climate anxiety.",

          "abstract": "When girls are pearls, do they have rare gracious attributes, or are they beautiful? It is well known that not only are metaphors open to different interpretations but also that these interpretations might vary across individuals, even with the same cultural context. However, the literature lacks a description of which patterns of interpretation emerge across individuals and which factors might drive them. Previous evidence suggests that interpreters differently recruit sensorimotor and sociocognitive strategies to interpret metaphors. Here, we tested the importance of metaphor multimodality to explain individual variability. We describe participants’ interpretations according to a series of psycholinguistic variables, including affective, cognitive, and sensory processes, that mirrors psychological states and hints at different cognitive mechanisms. With an innovative method that combines i) a multidimensional semi-automated linguistic analysis, ii) IS-RDM, which allows to uncover participant-level patterns of similarity, and iii) a data-driven clustering method, we were able to identify two groups of participants based on their verbal interpretations. Results showed that there are mentalizers, who explore the semantic networks and rely on sociocognitive information (e.g. they interpret Teachers are lanterns as They are able to make others understand whatever they want to) and imagers, who reenact sensory properties and rely on the activation of mental images (e.g. they interpret Teachers are lanterns as They are luminous). Our study showed that a data-driven approach can capture different metaphor interpretative profiles from the semantic features of the words used, suggesting that: i) participants focus on sensorimotor vs. sociocognitive features according to the different processing strategies they adopt and ii) the words they produce to interpret a metaphor are cues into these cognitive mechanisms. These data allow the reconciliation of the multiplicity of theories about metaphor comprehension, which might be due to the existence of differences across individuals. There seems to be multimodal alternative routes to solving metaphorical meaning, and acknowledging individual preferences allows to open windows on the modalities with which each individual conceptualizes the world.",

          "abstract": "Background: University teachers’ well-being plays a critical role in their productivity and educational effectiveness. Apart from cross-sectional research on demographic and institutional/contextual correlates, insight into potential causes and consequences of faculty well-being is limited. This includes insight into relations between different coping strategies and well-being.\nAims: We studied the interplay of different strategies for coping with teaching-related stress with university teachers’ well-being over the course of one semester.\nSample: Participants were 489 German university teachers (age: M=41.1 years, SD=11.4) from 34 universities. Their demographics were characteristic for German university staff.\nMethods: Participants reported on their use of task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping to manage teaching-related stress and on their subjective well-being (positive and negative affect; job satisfaction) at the beginning (T1: November) and end (T2: February) of the winter 2020/2021 term. Interrelations were examined via cross-lagged panel analysis.\nResults: Task-oriented coping was positively related to the slope of changes in positive affect, and vice versa, over time. Emotion-oriented coping (rumination) was positively related to the slope of changes in negative affect, and negatively to the slope of changes in positive affect and job satisfaction. Negative affect was positively related to the slope of changes in avoidance-oriented coping.\nConclusions: The findings provide directions for further developing supportive measures for promoting well-being in university teaching staff by highlighting the relevance of different coping strategies as causes and consequences thereof. Task-oriented coping may be particularly adaptive for well-being: at the same time, interventions aiming to promote well-being may also facilitate task-oriented coping behaviors.",

This research takes a counter argument: rather than view value conversion as an occasional or isolated incident, it argues that such processes are integral to therapy. This argument is supported through a critical discourse analysis of the historic ‘Gloria Films’ featuring Carl Rogers, Albert Ellis, Fritz Perls and Gloria Szymanski. The research concludes value conversion is more prevalent and more complicated than is reflected in the existing literature and by current ethical frameworks.  However it also concludes that although such conversion processes are integral to therapy, there is less evidence to support the view that such conversions are successful.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models are powerful tools for enhancing the quantitative and theoretical rigor of cognitive neuroscience. It is thus imperative that model users—researchers who develop models, use existing models, or integrate model-based findings into their own research—understand how these tools work and what factors need to be considered when engaging with them. To this end, we developed a philosophical toolkit that address core questions about computational cognitive models in the brain and behavioral sciences. Drawing on recent advances in philosophy of modeling, we highlight the central role of model users’ reasoning goals in the application and interpretation of formal models. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by first offering a philosophical introduction to the highly popular drift diffusion model (DDM) and then providing a novel conceptual analysis of a long-standing debate about decision thresholds in the DDM. Contrary to most existing work, we suggest that the two model structures implicated in the debate offer complementary—rather than competing—explanations of speeded choice behavior. Further, by contrasting approaches to model development and comparison, we show how the explanation provided by each form of the model (parsimonious and normative) reflects the reasoning goals of the communities of users who developed them (cognitive psychometricians and formal decision scientists, respectively). We conclude our analysis by offering readers a principled heuristic for deciding which of the models to use, thus concretely demonstrating the conceptual and practical utility of philosophy for resolving meta-scientific challenges in the brain and behavioral sciences.",

          "abstract": "Effective linguistic communication depends upon many different cognitive processes working together in concert. Yet our computational models of these processes are often developed in isolation, without considering how these processes fit together. In this work, we study a simplified variant of the popular board game Codenames, which highlights the integration of two important processes: (1) lexical retrieval and (2) pragmatic reasoning. In this task, speakers must generate a \"clue\" word from their full lexicon that allows their partner to select a pair of target words from a context of distractors.  In Experiment 1, we evaluate a suite of different models on an existing corpus of production data, finding that models with both semantic search and pragmatic reasoning components significantly outperform ablated variants. Experiment 2 elicits targeted endorsements for a particularly diagnostic set of clues, providing further evidence for the pragmatic selection component in isolation. Finally, Experiments 3 and 4 elicit lists of clues that speakers are considering for a target pair in the absence and presence of the board context, respectively, providing further evidence for the way context is infused into semantic search. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the way that retrieval processes (generating promising candidates) and selection processes (evaluating the likely communicative success of these candidates) must work in tandem to support effective communication.",

          "abstract": "This is a personal reflection on why I believe the science of consciousness may be taking a pernicious turn. The primary issue lies in the continued conflation of our supposed target phenomenon—subjective experience—with general cognitive and perceptual processes. As a result, much of the current research is conceptually off-target and insufficiently constrained by the relevant empirical evidence. This confusion, about the supposed subject matter itself, allows for the overinterpretation of findings and promotion of one’s personal worldviews as being supported by science. Unlike in other disciplines, where hyperbolic media activity can be dismissed as mere ‘noise,’ in this field it significantly influences funding and editorial decisions—and, by extension, jobs, and also the peer review process. This has made meaningful research increasingly difficult, and the clarification of the said conceptual confusion increasingly unlikely. I am not optimistic that we can ever resolve these systemic issues. However, by laying out the situation in some detail, we might better navigate how to move the science of subjective experience forward.",

          "abstract": "Prior research has highlighted that brain oscillations, particularly in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, are closely linked to the sense of ownership and agency in both physical and virtual environments. Building on this foundation, the present study aimed to investigate whether participants develop a sense of ownership and agency over a physical tool or a computer mouse (termed virtual tools) during a reaching and grasping task, utilizing a well-established tool-use paradigm employed in our prior research. Additionally, we explored whether higher ratings of ownership and agency could be predicted by resting-state brain oscillations at baseline and during the tool-use training task. Twenty young adult participants took part in both physical and virtual tool-use training, completed across two blocks of active training. After each training session, participants completed a questionnaire to subjectively assess their sense of ownership and agency over both, the physical tool and the computer mouse. EEG recordings were conducted before, during, and after each tool-use training block, allowing us to assess the neural correlates of these experiences. The results showed that patterns of resting-state and task-related brain activity were linked to participants' sense of ownership and agency during tool-use training. Specifically, higher resting-state beta power in the right temporal region and alpha power in frontal areas predicted stronger feelings of ownership, while higher agency ratings were associated with alpha and beta power in the occipital region. During the task, ownership was linked to theta, alpha, and beta power across multiple brain areas, whereas agency during physical tool-use training correlated with increased frontal alpha, central and occipital beta, and theta in frontotemporal, central, and parieto-occipital regions. In virtual tool-use training, agency was associated with frontal alpha, frontal theta, and beta power in the left temporal and occipital areas. These findings suggest that both ownership and agency rely on distinct but overlapping neural mechanisms, highlighting the role of widespread oscillatory activity in integrating tools into the sensorimotor system’s adaptation to tool use. \nKeywords: Resting-state EEG, task-related EEG, sense of ownership, agency, tool-use",

          "abstract": "The ability to gauge the average of a number stream is a fundamental aspect of numeric cognition, information processing, and value-based decisions. Research on this ability has primarily focused on the integration of numerical information from a single source. Here, we examined the estimation of averages when competing sources of information are presented. We tested two theories of numeric value integration: the Compressed Mental Number Line (CMNL) predicts underestimation of averages independent of competing information; Selective Integration (SI) predicts that competing information interferes with the target information. Across three experiments, we found a significant underestimation of the averages, and a limited impact of competing information on estimation. Computational modeling shows that the CMNL (together with an explicit noise theory) provides the overall better account than SI to describe estimation behavior in our data. However, about one third of our participants were best described by SI. Among these participants, the computational mechanism of SI consisted of an underweighting of lower numbers in local sample comparisons. Overall, our findings clarify the role of competing information in average estimations, and shed light on the exact cognitive process and limitations of SI as a general theory of sequential information integration.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode A (DMA), a task-negative cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMA are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present four. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMA from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMA over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMA as follows: (1) Snowman Mouth, (2) Muted Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Penguin, (4) Kitten, and (5) You’re in Trouble. Evidence for DMA was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by phonological and semantic judgement tasks, lexical decision, and task switching. The DMA cognitive mode was inversely correlated with the language mode, and therefore showed greater deactivation when linguistic processing was required, but less deactivation when suppression of linguistic processes enhanced performance. We also provide an anatomical and functional comparison to Default Mode B (DMB).",

Mental disorders are diverse, complex and multifaceted, and co-morbidity is common. However, fragmentation across multiple services and sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision. In the context of ongoing mental health service reform in Australia. Comprehensive evaluation of the whole care system is critical for shaping policy and ensuring efficient allocation of resources. In this paper we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study that involves evaluating patterns of health, mental health, and human service use among young people in Victoria, Australia with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs.\nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort is youth aged 12-25 years during the time period January 2018 to November 2023. Data for individuals aged 5-11 and 26-53 during this period will also be included, to allow for examination of early years factors and an older adult comparison group. The data sources and data linkage methodology are described. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical characteristics of young people, their broader health and human service use behaviour and typical pathways through care, that could not be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

EMC2 implements recent developments in Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, including powerful and efficient sampling and marginal likelihood estimation algorithms, making it computationally feasible to estimate many different cognitive models and perform inference among them.

Comprehensive phenotyping and genotyping will be performed for participants in US, MX, AU, NZ, and SE using the EDGI2 questionnaire battery and participant saliva samples. In DK, case identification and genotyping will be through the National Patient Register and bloodspots archived near birth. Case-control and case-case genome-wide association studies will be conducted within EDGI2 and enhanced via meta-analysis with external data from the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED). Additional analyses will explore genetic correlations between eating disorders (EDs) and other psychiatric and metabolic traits, calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS), and leverage functional biology to evaluate clinical outcomes. Moreover, analyzing PRS for patient stratification and linking identified risk loci to clinically relevant phenotypes highlight the potential of EDGI2 for clinical translation. \nDiscussion: EDGI2 is a global expansion of the EDGI study to increase sample size, expand the numbers of participants from non-European ancestry, and to include ARFID. Inclusion of MX will be the first large-scale ED genetics study from Latin America. ED genetics research has historically lagged behind other psychiatric disorders, and EDGI2 is designed to rapidly advance the study of the genetics of the major EDs. Exploring EDs at both the diagnostic level and the symptom level will provide an unprecedented look at the genetic architecture underlying EDs.",

However, recent meta-analyses in cognitive psychology suggest that behavioral and computational measures are less stable than self-reported surveys as assessed by test-retest correlations. If extended to mental health measures, this poses a serious challenge to the computational psychiatry agenda. To start addressing this question, we leveraged a well-validated reinforcement learning framework based on a neuro-computational model. We collected data from participants who performed a multi-context reinforcement-learning (RL) task twice (~5 months apart), so as to compare the reliability of behavioral measures, computational parameters, and psychological and mental health questionnaires. Despite the remarkable replicability of population-averaged measures, the test-retest reliability of individual metrics was low-to-very-low for behavioral and computational measures, while moderate-to-strong for questionnaires. Behavioral measures were essentially correlated only among themselves, while measures from questionnaires were also correlated with mental health symptoms. Overall, these findings challenge the translational potential of computational approaches for precision psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Everyday we perform tasks that make us feel fatigued. Theoretical accounts predict that fatigue not only develops due to exertion of effort but also increases how effortful the same action will feel subsequently. However, to date there has been no formalised computational account of subjective perceptions of fatigue and effort, with few studies measuring these sensations directly or quantifying their moment-to-moment changes. Here, across three experiments, participants were required to exert different levels of physical effort (grip force below maximum capacity) to obtain rewards, rating on each trial how effortful they found exerting force (Experiment 1) or how fatigued they felt (Experiments 2 and 3). Across studies, ratings of fatigue and perception of effort increased over time, but also fluctuated on a trial-by-trial basis as a function of both effort exerted and rest. A computational model of fatigue, comprising a recoverable component (with fatigue reducing during rest) and an unrecoverable one (in which it only increases through effort exerted) successfully accounted for subjective responses. It was best able to explain momentary changes in both fatigue and effort perception. This computational model provides insights into the brain mechanisms underpinning the close, dynamic relationship between sensations of fatigue and effort.",

ILD, characterized by intensive longitudinal measurements, often exhibit excessive zeros and temporal dependencies. Neglecting zero-inflation or mishandling it can lead to biased parameter estimates and inaccurate conclusions. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Zero-Inflated Process Change multilevel AutoRegressive model (ZIP-CAR) model that incorporates zero-inflation using a Bayesian framework. We compare the performance of the proposed method with existing methods through a simulation study and demonstrate its advantages in accurately estimating parameters and improving statistical power. Additionally, we apply the ZIP-CAR model to a real intensive longitudinal dataset on problematic drinking behaviors, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing autoregressive and cross-lag effects while accounting for zero-inflation. The results underscore the importance of addressing zero-inflation in ILD analysis and provide practical recommendations for researchers. Our proposed model offers a valuable tool for analyzing ILD with zero-inflated autoregressive processes, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of dynamic behavioral changes over time.",

          "abstract": "Children are adept statistical learners, capable of parsing streams of structured input into meaningful units, but the explicit knowledge of environmental structure that they acquire through experience often differs from that of adults. To date, however, it is unclear how developmental changes in learning mechanisms influence structured knowledge acquisition. To address this question, we tested 110 children, adolescents, and adults, ages 8 - 22 years, on a predictive learning task, in which they experienced sequences of stimuli with a higher-order temporal structure. After an initial learning phase, participants’ explicit knowledge of the relations between stimuli was probed via two additional task measures. We used a recently introduced computational model to characterize participants’ response times during learning, and found that all participants relied on simple, recency-based prediction, anticipating that they would encounter stimuli they recently encountered in the past. With increasing age, however, participants demonstrated greater evidence of additionally relying on a more sophisticated learning mechanism, which captured a predictive representation of the contingent  relations between stimuli. The extent to which participants demonstrated evidence of this more complex form of predictive learning related to — and accounted for age-related improvements in — their explicit knowledge of the task’s underlying structure. Our results suggest that age-related changes in the use of different predictive learning mechanisms influences the structured knowledge that people derive from experience, providing an account for why children, adolescents, and adults form different representations of their environments from identical streams of experiences.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive control system continuously monitors actions and adapts to enhance task performance and prevent errors. More pronounced amplitudes of early neurophysiological response monitoring signals, such as error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-related negativity (CRN), have been linked to increased response caution and heightened attention to task-relevant features in subsequent trials. However, it remains unclear whether these population-level effects accurately capture adaptive processes at the individual level. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of findings, as effects significant at the population level may be driven by only a small subset of participants. Using Bayesian hierarchical drift diffusion modeling on behavioral and EEG data from four datasets, we found robust population-level associations between ERN amplitude and adaptive behaviors but also identified substantial individual variability. The relationship between ERN amplitude and response caution was highly context-dependent, varying across individuals, datasets, and conditions. In contrast, the association between ERN amplitude and attentional focus was more consistent, though influenced by traits related to negative affect. Our results emphasize the importance of considering individual differences to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior.",

The former were to become woodland-dwellers in multifemale-multimale troops with social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, which is limited mostly to mothers or female alloparents. \n \tContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (consisting of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had three consequences that would impinge on homininan evolution and differentiate it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans, namely: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any time of the year, which meant that voracious social units were necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness which, in turn, demanded ingenuity and the transmissibiity of existential information in the form of active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, by virtue of the broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan social unit and between adjoining homininan units in the landscape, which spread geographically over time as budding small-world information networks (and eventually reached Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Late (Upper) Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sometimes collaboration between social units (maybe ~4 Ma in Australopithecus anamensis), which, together with the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and together with mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners with establishment of mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby (mixed-sex philopatry), which maintained not only heterozygosity but also, most important, kinship links that favoured cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units: all of that marked a major behavioural shift away from paninan social arrangements.",

This study investigates the demographic characteristics and mental health effects of psychedelic use among Japanese users, providing insights for future drug policy and mental healthcare.\n\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Japanese psychedelic users recruited via social media (X, formerly Twitter) from May 1 to June 1, 2024. Eligible participants (aged 18+, Japanese nationals) completed an online questionnaire, reporting demographic data, psychedelic use history, and mental health assessments. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales before and after psychedelic use.\n\nResults: Among 615 participants, the average age was 33.8 years. LSD was the most used psychedelic. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores after psychedelic use (PHQ-9: Z = –14.87, p &lt; .001, r = 0.59; GAD-7: Z = –14.59, p &lt; .001, r = 0.58), suggesting potential mental health benefits.\n\nDiscussion: The findings support the self-medication hypothesis, indicating that individuals may turn to psychedelics for relief from mental distress, resulting in improved symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the study’s reliance on self-reported data and lack of clinical control limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Further research should investigate the therapeutic potential and risks of psychedelic use in Japan’s cultural context. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive drug policies and continued exploration of psychedelic use outside clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode A (DMA), a task-negative cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMA are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present four. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMA from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMA over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMA as follows: (1) Snowman Mouth, (2) Muted Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Penguin, (4) Kitten, and (5) You’re in Trouble. Evidence for DMA was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by phonological and semantic judgement tasks, lexical decision, and task switching. The DMA cognitive mode was inversely correlated with the language mode, and therefore showed greater deactivation when linguistic processing was required, but less deactivation when suppression of linguistic processes enhanced performance. We also provide an anatomical and functional comparison to Default Mode B (DMB).",

          "abstract": "Repeated assessments of cognitive performance yield rich data from which we can extract markers of cognitive performance. Computational cognitive process models are often fit to repeated cognitive assessments to quantify individual differences in terms of substantively meaningful cognitive markers and link them to other person-level variables. Most studies stop at this point, and do not test whether these cognitive markers have utility for predicting some meaningful outcomes. Here, we demonstrate a partially observable predictor modeling framework that can fill this gap. In this framework, we can simultaneously extract cognitive markers from repeated assessment data and use these together with demographic covariates for predictive modeling of a clinically interesting outcome, implemented in a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework. We describe this approach by constructing a predictive process model in which features of learning are combined with demographic variables to predict mild cognitive impairment, and demonstrate it using data from the Einstein Aging Study.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on conflict resolution, focusing on behavioral performance, neural activity, and subjective experience. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to anodal, cathodal, or sham HD-tDCS groups and completed a 30-minute flanker task during stimulation. Using a comprehensive methodological approach, including Drift-Diffusion Modeling (DDM), EEG analysis, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), we assessed the cognitive, neural, and phenomenological effects of stimulation. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in reaction times or accuracy across the stimulation groups. Similarly, DDM parameters showed no effect of HD-tDCS on cognitive processes. However, EEG data revealed a significant reduction in neural complexity, in the anodal group during resting-state, suggesting neural reorganization. Subjective experience analysis identified two distinct clusters of task-related feelings, though time spent in these experiential states did not differ between groups. Interestingly, sensation of stimulation was significantly higher for anodal stimulation than sham when analyzed as a single dimension. Despite null behavioral effects, this study provides important insights into the neural and subjective responses to HD-tDCS and emphasizes the value of advanced analytic techniques in examining brain stimulation effects. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.",

Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing gut-brain connections. Prior studies have identified associations between the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperament, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity at 2 weeks showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. We also found evidence for associations between specific genera of bacteria in infancy and negative affect. These results suggest associations between specific features of the gut microbiome and child behavior may differ based on timing of gut microbiome measurement.",

So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, reflection test order did not impact philosophical decisions. Instead, a philosophical reflection effect emerged: making philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved reflection test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

Due to the widespread application of factor models, factor loadings are fundamental to modern psychometric assessment. Recent advances in network psychometrics introduced network loadings which aim to provide network models with a metric similar to factor loadings to assess measurement quality when the data are generated from a factor model. Our study revisits and refines the original network loadings to account for properties of (regularized) partial correlation networks, such as the reduction of partial correlation size as the number of variables increase, that were not considered previously. Using a simulation study, the revised network loadings demonstrated greater congruence with the simulated factor loadings across conditions relative to the original formulation. The simulation also evaluated how well correlations between factors can be captured by scores estimated with network loadings. The results show that not only can these network scores adequately estimate the simulated correlations between factors, they can do so without the need for rotation, a standard requirement for factor loadings. The consequence is that researchers do not need to choose a rotation with the revised network loadings, reducing the analytic degrees of freedom and eliminating this common source of variability in factor analysis. We discuss the interpretation of network loadings when data are believed to be generated from a network model and how they may fit into a network theory of measurement.",

In line with a \"bright-future hypothesis\", people predicted higher levels of happiness and meaning in the future than in their historical baseline. We observed the same optimistic pattern for a 1-year as a 5-year time horizon. Rather than reflecting a past-neglecting cognitive mechanism, the evidence mostly favored a motivational explanation. First, the effect emerged both between-subjects and within-subjects: Even when people had just reported their past well-being, they still predicted future improvement. Second, predicted well-being improvement generalized to social judgments of a friend but not to an enemy, mediated by judgments of deservingness. In conclusion, people predict a bright future when they want to see one.",

In the contemporaneous network, momentary core cognitive vulnerability was associated with various momentary symptoms. In the temporal network, increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the severity of three specific symptoms – anxious mood, fear, and feeling like a failure. Interestingly, momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the perceived event negativity, but perceived event negativity did not predict subsequent increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability.\nConclusions: Our findings show that the core cognitive vulnerability is differentially associated with symptoms at the between-person and within-person levels of analysis. On a moment-to-moment basis, core cognitive vulnerability temporally precedes and influences the severity of emotional symptoms and perceived event negativity. We discuss study implications and outline directions for future research to clarify the etiology of internalizing psychopathology.",

Therefore, a central problem in psychophysics, metacognition and consciousness research is to distinguish between decisions resulting from changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. It has recently been proposed that confidence reports can be used to discriminate between changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. Here we use a Bayesian ordinal modeling framework combined with an explicit measure of subjective experience to show across two experiments and three bias manipulations that confidence during perceptual decision-making does not uniquely reflect subjective experience. Instead, non-perceptual manipulations affecting response bias ‘leak’ into perceptual confidence reports. This occurs not only for biases resulting from changes in the base-rate of stimuli (‘cognitive’ priors), but also when biasing information does not inform decision correctness (asymmetric payoff matrix).",

Here, we integrated recent research on person-environment transactions with the clinical stress generation literature to develop a process model of stress generation. This process model posits that short-term dynamics between momentary personal characteristics and daily hassles are the building blocks for established long-term stress generation effects. To evaluate this model, we conducted a systematic literature search on stress generation in daily life (43 studies, Ntotal = 9’579). Results show that both dispositional traits and dynamic states predict the occurrence of daily hassles, supporting core aspects of the process model. However, future research on stress generation in daily life using measurement burst design, multi-method assessments of momentary state variables, and comprehensive assessments of daily hassles is needed.",

Much of what people invest time, energy, and money in revolves around connecting with others. However, identifying the factors that make people feel connected or disconnected can be challenging due to individual differences in how loneliness is experienced. Studying the neural mechanisms that reflect how satisfied or lonely people feel offers a new window into this critical problem and allows us to test whether there exists a robust brain signature of loneliness. Loneliness may be associated with widespread changes in brain connectivity across multiple neural regions and systems. Here, we aim to capture this complexity by deriving a neural signature of loneliness from distributed brain patterns in resting-state functional connectivity data in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. We then demonstrated the generalizability of this neural signature in predicting individual differences in loneliness in an independent sample of young adult students",

Results show a joint effect of red and chroma to generate effects of joy, rage and negative powerless. In addition, lightness is key in generating effects of serenity, threat and a relief/stress divergence. Dominance emerged as an important dimension to understand interactions and nuances in color-emotion associations.

With a rising prevalence of the major mood disorders, recent years have seen a growing interest in the potential therapeutic value of lifestyle practises such as exercise and passive heat- or cold-treatment (e.g. sauna and ice baths). While the beneficial effects of exercise on mental health are now well documented, the potential benefits of heat- and cold therapy are less studied. Similarly to exercise, passive heat- and cold exposure may induce physiological responses which counteract the pathophysiological underpinnings of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Thus, passive heat- or cold treatment could complement exercise, or be a viable alternative for individuals hindered from doing exercise due to injuries or disability. Here, we first review physiological adaptations to passive heat- or cold treatment in the context of hypothesis for the biological pathogenesis of depression. Next, we review clinical interventions investigating effects of passive heat- or cold treatment on depressive disorder. Finally, we end with a discussion of future directions.",

          "abstract": "Economic hardship is known to shape children’s self-regulation, yet little is understood about how fluctuations in hardship unfold over time and whether different patterns of unpredictability carry unique developmental consequences. Using a socioeconomically diverse sample, we tracked families’ subjective economic hardship across 15–36 monthly assessments and applied an environmental statistics framework to quantify four indices of unpredictability: changepoints in mean, changepoints in variance, coefficient of variation, and noise. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct dimensions of economic unpredictability: systematic instability (frequent but predictable hardship fluctuations) and dynamic variability (infrequent but abrupt shifts in hardship). Economic unpredictability was disproportionately experienced by racially minoritized and lower-income families, reinforcing systemic inequities in economic resources. Relations between these indices and caregiver-reported measures of family routines and day-to-day unpredictability were weak, suggesting wide heterogeneity in the ways families adapt to economic unpredictability. Leveraging propensity score methods, we isolated the effects of unpredictability from hardship severity, finding that they predicted greater self-regulation challenges in early childhood, with the strongest effects for hardship severity. These findings underscore the importance of capturing economic hardship as a dynamic and multidimensional experience, with implications for policy efforts aimed at promoting stability in families’ access to resources.",

          "authors": "Russell Dougherty; Eric Thrailkill; Sarah Van Horn; Auny Kussad; Donna Toufexis",
          "abstract": "When making decisions under stress, organisms tend to deliberate less and rely on automatic habits. Prior investigation into the influence of stress on decision-making has primarily viewed goal-direction and habit as independent and competitive sources of control in static environments. The effects of acute stress on the integration of goal-direction and habit in hierarchical planning to solve dynamic tasks remain unclear. Here, our aim was to assess whether stress prompted the usage of habitual action sequences over the selection of discrete goal-directed actions in a serial decision task. We trained 16 female Long Evans rats in a two-stage binary choice task and performed two probe tests, one following acute restraint stress and one under control conditions, to identify how stress affected higher-level planning of behavior and intermediate action structures. We found that under both stressed and control conditions, rats exhibited goal-directed planning of habitual action sequences. However, following stress, rats showed a greater tendency to reiterate action sequences independent of reinforcement, indicating that stress may induce an aversion to exploration in action planning. Stress also increased the latency between responses – degrading action sequence integrity despite conserving their overall structure and performance. Taken together, these findings suggest that although acute stress does not disrupt the overall macrostructure of behavior in two-stage decision-making, it does alter the microstructure of goal-directed and habitual control individually. Further, these results imply that the extent to which stress impairs goal-direction in female rats may depend on the incentive structure and attentional demands of the decision environment.",

          "abstract": "Reflective reasoning often correlates with certain philosophical decisions, but it is often unclear whether reflection causes those decisions. So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, reflection test order did not impact philosophical decisions. Instead, a philosophical reflection effect emerged: making philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved reflection test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

          "abstract": "This study compared the size weight illusion (SWI) and object lifting kinematics between physical and virtual conditions, shedding light on the nuanced disparities in perception and action across different environmental mediums. We examined whether prior expectations about object weight based on size cues, which affect the experience of real-world object interactions, are different in virtual reality (VR). Employing a highly realistic virtual environment with precisely-matched visual size and haptic cues, we tested the hypothesis that VR, which may be experienced as uncertain, unfamiliar, or unpredictable, would induce a smaller SWI due to a diminished effect of prior expectations. Participants (N=25) reported the felt heaviness of lifted objects that varied in both volume and mass in physical reality and a VR environment. Reach and lift kinematics, and self-reported presence, were also recorded. Our findings showed no differences between how participants perceived the SWI between real and virtual environments, although there was a trend towards a smaller illusion in VR. Contrary to our predictions, participants who experienced more presence in VR did not experience a larger SWI, but the inverse relationship was observed. Notably, differences in reach velocities between physical and virtual conditions suggested a more controlled approach in VR. These findings highlight the intricate relationship between immersion and sensorimotor processes in virtual environments, emphasising the need for deeper exploration into the underlying mechanisms that shape human interactions with immersive technologies, particularly the prior expectations associated with virtual environments.",

          "abstract": "We present a novel framework for understanding the diverse spectrum of mental breakthrough events, ranging from problem-solving insights to profound personal transformations. We propose that these events, while varied in expression and impact, share common underlying mechanisms of representational change. We also hypothesise that the differences in phenomenological intensity can be conceptualised along a continuum. Central to our model are three core components – tension, altered salience, and enhanced flexibility – which we identify as essential prerequisites for significant cognitive restructuring. These components interact within an iterative cycle, influencing both the emergence and nature of insight experiences. Drawing on examples from different fields, we explore how a conflict between existing models can trigger this cycle, wherein mechanisms of attention allocation and relaxation of constraints work in tandem to facilitate the emergence of insights. Furthermore, we propose that the intensity of the “aha-moment” and the breadth of its impact are contingent on how central the conflict is within one's conceptual landscape and the extent to which existing mental models are challenged. Thus, the model accounts for both the subtle, momentary insights in problem-solving and the transformative realisations that reshape core beliefs and self-perception. By synthesising insights from various domains, including psychotherapy, contemplative science, and psychedelic research, we present a theoretical account with broad scope, aiming to shed light on the complex processes that can lead to a wide array of mental breakthroughs, thereby contributing to the understanding of insight phenomena across disciplines.",

          "abstract": "As humans, we often repeat previously rewarded actions without thinking, but we also possess the ability to plan ahead and simulate actions based on an internal model of the environment. These two types of control are commonly conceptualised as model-free versus model-based control. While there is a body of research on interindividual differences in using either strategy, we aimed to test whether people can also learn to regulate which strategy to use based on environmental demand. We used a two-stage decision-making task in which two different first-stage states that repeated or alternated between trials shared a deterministic transition structure where actions led to the same second-stage states with drifting reward options. We manipulated how often participants (n = 140) were exposed to alternations versus repetitions between the different first-stage states. When these states frequently repeat, there is a reduced need to consult the transition structure as it pays off to adopt model-free control and simply retake previously rewarded actions. Conversely, when first-stage states frequently alternate, it is more beneficial to adopt model-based control, considering the transition structure and generalising reward outcomes between them. In line with our hypothesis, we show that participants exposed to more first-stage state alternations were also more model-based in a later test phase compared to participants exposed to more first-stage state repetitions. These findings suggest that people learn to arbitrate between different reinforcement-learning strategies consistent with a cost-benefit analysis sensitive to environmental demands.",

Our results revealed that participants struggled to achieve high accuracy in detail-oriented memory tasks, even with extensive effort and focus. Follow-up experiments explored potential factors contributing to this limitation, shedding light on why memorizing fine details is inherently difficult.

          "abstract": "Individuals with a sexual preference for minors are subject to significant stigma in society, even in the absence of any criminal behavior, which can profoundly affect their psychological well-being. This stigma can contribute to the development of internalizing psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress), which is also recognized as dynamic risk factor for child sexual abuse. This cross-sectional questionnaire study (N = 92) aimed to examine the psychological distress experienced by this population. Specifically, we: (1) investigated the occurrence of internalizing complaints among individuals with a sexual preference for minors; (2) examined associations between cognitive processes (e.g., rumination, emotional attentional control), self-stigma, and internalizing psychopathology; and (3) explored the mediating role of rumination, specifically brooding, in linking self-stigma and internalizing psychopathology. The results indicate that individuals with a sexual preference for minors experience significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress compared to the general population. Furthermore, several hypothesized associations were confirmed, including associations between self-stigma, poor emotional attentional control, brooding and internalizing psychopathology. Mediation analyses further revealed that brooding mediates the effect of self-stigma on internalizing complaints, albeit with small effect sizes. Follow-up longitudinal studies are necessary to validate these findings and explore their implications. Ultimately, these insights aim to inform targeted interventions and support strategies for this population, which could help to prevent child sexual abuse.",

          "abstract": "Many cognitive scientists and philosophers take cases of double prevention to be one of the primary motivations for accepting causal pluralism, the view that people have multiple concepts of causation. Thanawala and Erb (2024) recently argue against Lombrozo's (2010) account of causal pluralism. They find that the temporal order of events affects people's causal judgments in double prevention cases, and they interpret this finding as showing that people use a productive concept of causation in double prevention scenarios. In contrast to this interpretation, we suggest that these new effects can be explained in terms of counterfactual reasoning. Specifically, the temporal order of events might influence the extent to which people simulate counterfactual alternatives to these events. We show that under this assumption, a recent counterfactual model of causal judgment can reproduce all qualitative effects of temporal order found in Thanawala and Erb's (2024) new work. Crucially, participants appear to preferentially simulate counterfactual alternatives to recent events, in line with work on counterfactual reasoning. Our findings complement past research that applied the counterfactual framework to temporal effects and double prevention independently, suggesting that these explanations are highly generalizable.",

This study reports a formative evaluation of bio-psycho-social impacts of a 12-week lifestyle change and weight loss intervention led by a community-based NGO in alliance with a primary healthcare organization in New Zealand’s largest city.\nMETHODS: BBM, steeped in indigenous models of holistic health, used social media to recruit 109 (predominantly Māori and Pacific) individuals living with obesity across 3 cohorts, participating in 2 days exercise and 1 day nutrition/dietary training weekly. Repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted on measures of body weight, depressive symptoms, HbA1c, blood pressure, and self-reported exercise and eating taken at the programme’s start and end. Ten Talanoa (group discussions) gathered detailed accounts of experiences in the programme.\nRESULTS: Analysis of the 57% of participants who completed pre/post assessments showed significant weight loss (7.1 kgs from 180.1 initial weight), and substantial improvements in mental health, with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) decreasing from 65% showing depressive symptoms at start to only 20% on completion. There were also statistically significant improvements in Glycated Haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure, and on self-reported fast food/soft drinks intake. Talanoa revealed that the programme provided a safe space for participants to thrive, and impacted on physical and mental wellbeing.\nCONCLUSIONS: BBM engaged participants living with obesity towards healthier lifestyles through the support of peer trainers well-versed in holistically working through ethnic minority life experiences in obesogenic environments. Community-led health interventions partnered with mainstream health professionals show promise for long-term weight loss.",

We describe results from a proof-of-concept study that examined the extent to which major underlying features of worry could be used to predict which of three common cognitive regulatory strategies (mindful acceptance; focused attention meditation; and thought suppression) would help regulate that worry. N = 40 adults selected for high trait worry (80% also met criteria for one or more DSM-5 anxiety-related diagnoses) generated and provided feature ratings for three idiographic thought topics. Participants then attempted to control each worry using each of the three strategies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a within-subjects design (k = 468 observations). We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to test preregistered hypotheses regarding the extent to which each of five empirically-derived underlying dimensions of a worry (uncontrollability; negative valence; self-focus; apprehension; and social-memory content) could be used to predict which strategy would be most efficacious for regulating that worry. We did not find support for our preregistered hypotheses; however, in exploratory analyses, we found that mindfulness-based strategies were particularly effective compared to thought suppression for thoughts rated as higher (versus lower) in uncontrollability. Future research should test these principles in larger samples, using more diverse expressions of perseverative thought.",

A identificação precoce de alunos com AH/SD é crucial para o desenvolvimento de suas potencialidades, mas enfrenta desafios como a falta de instrumentos normatizados e o desconhecimento por parte dos educadores. O objetivo deste estudo é investigar como as novas tecnologias podem contribuir para a superação desses desafios, mantendo o rigor teórico e preservando os dados coletados. O artigo explora o uso de testes e questionários online, ferramentas de avaliação multimídia e inteligência artificial (IA) como alternativas promissoras para a triagem de AH/SD. A plataforma CogniSigns, com seus assistentes virtuais V.E.R.A. e Eugênio, é apresentada como um exemplo de como a IA pode facilitar a identificação precoce e o acompanhamento de alunos com AH/SD. A triagem digital, com o apoio de tecnologias como a IA, pode auxiliar na coleta e análise de dados de forma mais precisa, na criação de sistemas de recomendação personalizados e na implementação de intervenções eficazes. A integração de dados educacionais e a capacitação de professores e estudantes são componentes essenciais para o sucesso da triagem digital, promovendo uma educação mais inclusiva e personalizada.\n\nPalavras-chave: Altas Habilidades.

          "abstract": "Reflective reasoning often correlates with certain philosophical decisions, but it is often unclear whether reflection causes those decisions. So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, no reflection test priming effects were detected. Rather, an unexpected philosophical reflection effect emerged: making the philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

We investigated the relationship between hunger and mental health in the Global School-based Student Health Survey with a sample of 410,213 adolescents from 79 countries. We used a principled multiverse analysis, systematically exploring 15,360 model specifications. Our results show a consistently stable negative relationship between hunger and adolescent mental health (worrying, median beta = .12; suicidality, median beta = .07). We find evidence of a dose-response relationship, such that more frequently experiencing hunger is associated with greater reported levels of worrying and suicidality. Overall, we provide robust evidence of the significant negative relationship between hunger and adolescent mental ill health.",

          "authors": "Amritha Harikumar; Joanne Wardell; David Keator; Daniel Amen; Sergey Plis; Vince D Calhoun",
          "abstract": "Background:\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to characterize functional brain networks in disorders ranging from depression to schizophrenia (Chatterjee &amp; Mittal, 2019; Pilmeyer et al., 2022). Like fMRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique which captures information about neurally linked blood flow activity through radioactive tracers (Davis et al., 2020). While a few SPECT studies in schizophrenia populations have been conducted (Malaspina et al., 1999) along with fMRI based studies (Steardo et al., 2020), research on SPECT data for individual subject classification is limited. We first used an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to estimate covarying SPECT networks (Harikumar et al., 2025). Results were then fed as input to a classifier model to evaluate accuracy of individual diagnostic prediction.\nMethods:\n213 subjects (137 schizophrenia patients and 76 healthy controls) were used for the analysis. Classification input was based on loading parameters generated from spatially constrained ICA using a set of network priors derived from fMRI. Fifty-three SPECT components were estimated guided by the NeuroMark fMRI 1.0 template (Du et al., 2020). We initially focused on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier given previous favorable fMRI-SVM results. We also evaluated performance of multiple classifiers post hoc.\nResults and Conclusion:\nLinear SVM classification results showed a cross-validated classifier score (area under the curve (AUC)) of 83% (SD = 0.089), significantly above chance. Auditory, subcortical and sensorimotor networks were the highest ranked features. Results provide the first cross-validated classification of individual subject diagnoses using SPECT brain networks.",

          "abstract": "Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) scans have emerged as a useful imaging modality that has been explored in the literature for the last 40 years. To date, little work has focused on studying functional network connectivity utilizing SPECT data. In this study, we present a fully automated, spatially constrained ICA (sc-ICA) approach to evaluate functional network connectivity profiles in SPECT data using the NeuroMark pipeline. We evaluate both the expression of brain networks along with the whole brain SPECT connectome to evaluate the neuroimaging links to schizophrenia. 76 healthy controls, and 137 schizophrenia patient SPECT images were acquired from Amen Clinic sites along with diagnostic information. Each patient participated in two SPECT brain scans, acquired during rest and while performing a sustained attention task across twelve clinical imaging sites. Preprocessed SPECT data were analyzed via sc-ICA using 53 spatial priors derived from functional MRI data. 15 total components were found to show differences in various brain regions after correcting for multiple comparisons. FDR corrected resting SPECT results showed stronger covariation with CC-SC, CC-AUD, and DM-AUD networks. Many components showed reduced connectivity in patients. Additionally, relationships were associated with regressing loading parameters against age, sex, hearing voices and having disjointed thoughts. For the task data, connectivity between the cognitive control – default mode network was found in rest-task data after FDR correction. Task data covariation patterns largely remained the same as the rest data. In summary, we confirm existing work highlighting large scale network disruptions noted in prior schizophrenia fMRI studies.",

          "abstract": "Background. The current study investigated relations between a broad set of postpartum depression (PPD) risk- and protective factors, their centrality and unique relations with PPD symptoms. Methods. Mixed graphical network models were estimated in cross-sectional data collected during Phase 7 (2012-2015) of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System. Half of the 57,518 women were included in exploratory model 1, the other half in model 2 for cross-validation. A broad selection of biopsychosocial factors were modelled, including sociodemographic variables, indices of maternal health (behavior), pregnancy course, support, infant variables, and stressors. Results. A densely connected network of risk- and protective factors was obtained. Pregnancy duration, infant intensive care unit placement, infertility treatment, birth weight, income, and childbirth classes were ranked amongst the most central variables in the model. Out of 35 biopsychosocial factors included in the model, 11 were robustly related with PPD across both samples. High income, pre-pregnancy physical activity, pregnancy intention, and prenatal care focusing on depression risk were related to lower depression severity. Several other variables, including prior history of depression, pre-pregnancy dieting, prenatal risk behavior, and personal stressors were uniquely related to increased depression severity. Depressive complaints reduced with increased time since delivery. Women experiencing depressive symptoms were more likely to rely on aid from health workers postpartum. Results from models 1 and 2 were largely identical. Conclusions. Although cross-sectional in nature, these findings shed light on the complex associations between key risk- and protective factors for PPD, with implications for early detection and prevention.",

          "authors": "Tadeg Quillien; Kevin O'Neill; Paul Henne",
          "abstract": "Many cognitive scientists and philosophers take cases of double prevention to be one of the primary motivations for accepting causal pluralism, the view that people have multiple concepts of causation. Thanawala and Erb (2024) recently argue against Lombrozo's (2010) account of causal pluralism. They find that the temporal order of events affects people's causal judgments in double prevention cases, and they interpret this finding as showing that people use a productive concept of causation in double prevention scenarios. In contrast to this interpretation, we suggest that these new effects can be explained in terms of counterfactual reasoning. Specifically, the temporal order of events might influence the extent to which people simulate counterfactual alternatives to these events. We show that under this assumption, a recent counterfactual model of causal judgment can reproduce all qualitative effects of temporal order found in Thanawala and Erb's (2024) new work. Crucially, participants appear to preferentially simulate counterfactual alternatives to recent events, in line with work on counterfactual reasoning. Our findings complement past research that applied the counterfactual framework to temporal effects and double prevention independently, suggesting that these explanations are highly generalizable.",

          "abstract": "Background: Anxiety is one of the most common conditions affecting young people. The onset and course of symptoms are highly variable across development and if left untreated, can lead to poor outcomes. We modelled trajectories of anxiety symptoms from childhood to early adulthood and examined associated predictors and adult outcomes. \n\nMethod: We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study, a UK-based longitudinal twin cohort (N = 13,965). Anxiety symptoms were assessed using items from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire from ages 4 to 26. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify anxiety symptom trajectories. We examined associations between trajectory class membership and genetic, early-life family environment and child characteristics, as well as adult outcomes at age 26. \n\nFindings: We identified four anxiety symptom trajectories: Low-Stable (n=9,440, 68%), Adolescent-Onset (n=2,486, 18%), Childhood-Limited (n=1,583, 11%) and Persistent (n=456, 3%). Neuroticism polygenic score, maternal depression, female sex, early conduct, and peer problems were associated with membership in all three of the smaller, higher severity, anxiety symptom classes. Female sex, conduct and peer problems distinguished these three classes from one another. The Adolescent-Onset anxiety class was additionally associated with general cognitive ability and polygenic scores for Major Depressive Disorder and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; and Persistent anxiety with polygenic score for Anxiety Disorder. In terms of outcomes, Persistent and Adolescent-Onset trajectories were associated with poor clinical and life outcomes in early adulthood.\n\nInterpretation: The developmental course of anxiety is associated with polygenic risk for psychopathology, the early family environment, and child characteristics, with some associations differing between trajectory groups. Screening for high neuroticism polygenic score, maternal depression, general cognitive ability, and conduct and peer problems may enable the early identification of those at risk of developing anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Remote physical exercise training offers a more accessible alternative for the management of chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, the effectiveness of various remote delivery methods for this population are unclear. This randomized controlled trial compared live interactive training via videoconference to individual prerecorded video training sessions in patients with CLBP. Ninety-four individuals with CLBP were randomly assigned to a waitlist or to a 12-week general exercise program delivered by a certified kinesiologist, either through live interactive or prerecorded video sessions. The training intensity for the 3 weekly one-hour sessions was adapted to each participant’s fitness level. A total of 57 patients (average age 48.4 ±12.5 years, 36 women) completed the study, with comparable rates of attrition in the three groups. Those performing exercise, irrespective of modality, experienced significant and clinically meaningful (&gt;20%) reduction in pain intensity ratings compared to waitlist. Similarly, exercise training (vs. waitlist) decreased movement-evoked pain. No differences were observed between both forms of training for pain intensity, perceived difficulty, effort, fatigue, satisfaction or pain evoked during the training sessions. The therapeutic effects of physical exercise training were moderated by sex, with women reporting less pain relief, and mediated by pain catastrophizing and functional performance (as measured by a repeated chair stand task). Altogether, these results support remote exercise training, independent of the mode of delivery, as an accessible alternative for the administration of physical exercise training for individuals with CLBP.",

This study advocates for large-scale simulations as the gold standard for evaluating active learning models in systematic review screening. \n\nTwo large-scale simulations, totaling over 29 thousand runs, assessed active learning solutions. The first study evaluated 13 combinations of classification models and feature extraction techniques using high-quality datasets from the SYNERGY dataset.

The performance gained varied across datasets, models, and screening progression, ranging from considerable to near-flawless results.\n\nThe findings demonstrate that active learning consistently outperforms random screening in systematic review tasks, offering significant efficiency gains. While the extent of improvement varies depending on the dataset, model choice, and screening stage, the overall advantage is clear. Since model performance differs, active learning systems should remain adaptable to accommodate new classifiers and feature extraction techniques.

          "abstract": "The HEXACO model describes human personality through six major domains, each one further specified by four facets. Honesty-Humility is a key component of the model, and subsumes facets sincerity, fairness, modesty, and greed-avoidance. Although established and comprehensive measurement tools of HEXACO traits and facets through sentence items exist, a comprehensive assessment of honesty-humility through adjectives has not yet been developed. We present a novel instrument, the Adjective Checklist of Honesty (ACH), designed to enhance the assessment of Honesty by incorporating lexical descriptors of its facets, developed using a systematic approach. In Study 1, we identified a broad set of potential descriptors of honesty-humility facets, and refined it through independent raters to identify candidate items. In Study 2 (N = 266), we examined the factorial structure of the candidate items and developed the final 22-item version of the ACH. In Study 3 (N = 300), we confirmed the factorial structure of the shortened ACH questionnaire and collected validity evidence for the new scale. Our studies have important implications for the assessment of Honesty-Humility, shed light on the relationships between Honesty-Humility and truthfulness and, more generally, showcase the importance of a systematic approach in constructing assessment scales in personality psychology.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, the open science movement has transformed the research landscape, though its impact has largely been confined to developed countries. Recently, researchers from developing countries have called for a redesign of open science to better align with their unique contexts. However, raising awareness alone is insufficient—practical actions are required to drive meaningful and inclusive change. In this work, we analyze the opportunities offered by the open science movement and explore the macro- and micro-level barriers researchers in developing countries face when engaging with these practices. Drawing on these insights and the experiences of researchers from developing regions, we propose a four-level guide to support their gradual engagement with open science: (1) utilizing open resources to build a solid foundation for rigorous research, (2) adopting low-cost, easily implementable practices, (3) contributing to open science communities through actionable steps, and (4) taking on leadership roles or forming local communities to foster cultural change. We conclude by discussing potential pitfalls of engaging in open science and outline concrete recommendations for future action.",

With its recent revision, the ipseity-disorder model of self-disorder explains a wider range of experiential phenomenon. This comment considers the revised model’s characterization of self-presence, finding a tension in its theoretical revision that propagates to its conceptualization of paranoia. It suggests that this tension precludes the explanation of paranoia as an instance of exaggerated self-presence. The phenomenon of paranoia may be better characterized as diminished self-presence in the context of heightened grip or hold on a perceptual reality that includes other minds.",

          "abstract": "A wave of criticisms and replication failures is currently challenging claims about the scope of unconscious perception and cognition. Such failures to find unconscious processing effects at the population level may reflect the absence of individual-level effects, or alternatively, the averaging out of individual-level effects with opposing signs. Importantly, only the first suggests that consciousness may be necessary for the tested process to take place. To arbitrate between these two possibilities, we tested previously collected data where unconscious processing effects were not found (26 effects from 470 participants), using five frequentist and Bayesian tests that are robust to individual differences in effect signs. By and large, we found no reliable evidence for unconscious effects being masked by individual differences. In contrast, when we examined 136 non-significant effects from other domains, two novel non-parametric tests did reveal effects that were hidden by opposing individual results, though as we show, some of them might be driven by design-related factors. Taken together, five analysis approaches provide strong evidence for the restricted nature of unconscious processing effects not only across participants, but also across different trials within individuals. We provide analysis code and best-practice recommendations for testing for non-directional effects.",

          "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) on conflict resolution, focusing on behavioral performance, neural activity, and subjective experience. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to anodal, cathodal, or sham HD-tDCS groups and completed a 30-minute flanker task during stimulation. Using a comprehensive methodological approach, including Drift-Diffusion Modeling (DDM), EEG analysis, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), we assessed the cognitive, neural, and phenomenological effects of stimulation. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in reaction times or accuracy across the stimulation groups. Similarly, DDM parameters showed no effect of HD-tDCS on cognitive processes. However, EEG data revealed a significant reduction in neural complexity, in the anodal group during resting-state, suggesting neural reorganization. Subjective experience analysis identified two distinct clusters of task-related feelings, though time spent in these experiential states did not differ between groups. Interestingly, sensation of stimulation was significantly higher for anodal stimulation than sham when analyzed as a single dimension. Despite null behavioral effects, this study provides important insights into the neural and subjective responses to HD-tDCS and emphasizes the value of advanced analytic techniques in examining brain stimulation effects. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.",

          "authors": "Yuki Kobayashi; Arthur G Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Computational models that explain lightness/brightness illusions have been proposed. These models have been assessed using a simplistic criterion: the number of illusions each model can correctly predict from the test set. This simple method of evaluation assumes that each illusion in the set is independent; however, since lightness illusions are not independent of each other, an unbalanced test set may distort the evaluation of models. Moreover, evaluating models with a single value obscures where the model’s strength and weakness lies. We collected illusion magnitudes of various lightness illusions through two online experiments and investigated their correlations to identify underlying factors in these illusions. Experiment 1 identified three common factors reflecting assimilation, contrast, and White’s effect. Experiment 2, with a different illusion set, identified two factors reflecting assimilation and contrast, and detected high independence of an illusion caused by remote luminance gradients. We then examined three well-known models using the outcomes of the experiments. This model test showed that the redundancy in the illusion sets does not markedly skew the evaluation of the models, but the predictions by some models have a strong bias towards the contrast effect. This study clarified that correlations of illusion magnitudes provide valuable insights into both illusions and models, and highlighted the need to assess models based on processes underlying lightness perception, rather than focusing on individual illusions.",

Therefore, this paper aims to convince the scientific community that neuroenhancement has been used since the beginning of human civilization, whether through tools, inventions, or modern technologies.

          "abstract": "Background \nMost previous research has investigated whether performing a demanding cognitive task reduces the time a person can hold a subsequent physical effort. However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

Most often, psychological theories are expressed in verbal terms and then interpreted by researchers in their operationalization. In contrast, theories can also be expressed formally in mathematical or computational terms. However, translating verbal theories of dynamical systems into formal theories, especially those represented by differential equations (DEs), often requires knowledge of physics and mathematics beyond the standard training received by psychologists. In this article, we seek to provide a roadmap for researchers who wish to build a formal theory expressed in DEs from a verbal theory. We use a running example to illustrate the various steps and end with a discussion on caveats of formalizing using DE models. Our roadmap aims at the phase of formal theory development and refinement, before a researcher collects their data.

          "authors": "REGROUP project; Michalis Moutselos",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic put public health, economic activity, and constitutionally guaranteed freedoms under severe strain. Existing research has studied the ensuing protests, predominately individuals’ likelihood to have participated and the determinants of such participation. The present paper analyzes COVID-19-related protest events across the EU-27 space and examines the observed grievances, actors, mobilization patterns, and protest frames, with protest events as the unit of analysis. Relying on an analytical distinction between economic and cultural grievances, I find that left-wing protesters contested the economic effects of the crisis, while right-wing protests mobilized around cultural concerns about freedom and the importance of science. Non-partisan actors were behind much of the observed protesting and that a “rallying” effect was small and limited to cultural protests. On the Green-Alternative-Libertarian/Traditional-Authoritarian-Nationalist (GAL-TAN) dimension, GAL actors remained relatively inactive, while TAN actors mobilized around cultural grievances. I also observe regional effects, such as the preponderance of cultural protests in Germany and the Netherlands and of economic protests in Southern Europe, and a positive association between protest incidence and centrist/technocratic governments. The paper further discusses the activation of other pre-pandemic cleavages (for instance, ethnoreligious ones) and the most pertinent repertoires of contention observed across the EU-27; a noteworthy finding concerns the diversity and, quite often, the country-specific characteristics of COVID protests. Lastly, a critical discourse and qualitative-interpretive frame analyses of press releases by protest actors in France, Cyprus, and Greece demonstrates the limits of a simultaneous activation of economic and cultural dimensions during the pandemic.",

          "authors": "David Nathan Lang; Benjamin Listyg; Brennah Ross; Anna Vinals Musquera; Zeve Sanderson",
          "abstract": "In January 2023, Louisiana enacted Act 440, requiring websites containing substantial adult content to verify users’ ages through government-issued identification or commercial verification services. Since the passing of this legislation, 17 additional states have adopted similar laws. Using Google Trends data and a preregistered synthetic control design, this paper examines the impact of these age verification requirements on digital behavior across four key dimensions: searches for the largest compliant website, the largest non-compliant website, VPN services, and adult content generally. Our analysis reveals a 46.6% reduction in searches for the dominant compliant platform, accompanied by significant increases in searches for both the dominant non-compliant platform (48.1%) and VPN services (34.2%). Through multiverse analyses that incorporate multiple specifications and control group constructions, we demonstrate the robustness of these behavioral changes. Our point estimates remain\nconsistent with our pre-registered hypotheses across 3,200 point estimates. Our findings highlight that while these regulation efforts reduce traffic to compliant firms and likely a net reduction overall to this type of content, individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification. Our methodological approach offers a framework for real-time policy evaluation in contexts with staggered treatment adoption.

          "abstract": "Programme-level data suggests that increasing numbers of claimants are subject to work-related behavioural requirements in countries like the UK. Likewise, academic qualitative research has suggested that conditionality is pervasive within the benefits system, and often felt to be unreasonable. However, there is little quantitative evidence on the extent or experience of conditionality from claimants’ perspectives. We fill this gap drawing on a purpose-collected survey of UK benefit claimants (n=3,801). We find the stated application of conditionality was evident for a surprisingly small proportion of survey participants – even lower than programme-level data suggest. Unreasonable conditionality was perceived by many of those subject to conditionality but not a majority, with e.g. 26.2% believing that work coaches do not fully take health/care-related barriers into account. Yet alongside this, a substantial minority of claimants (22.4%) not currently subject to conditionality report that conditionality has negatively affected their mental health. We argue that reconciling this complex set of evidence requires a more nuanced understanding of conditionality, which is alert to methodological assumptions, the role of time and implementation, and the need to go beyond explicit requirements to consider implicit forms of conditionality. Concluding, we recommend a deeper mixed-methods agenda for conditionality research.",

          "abstract": "Algorithms pervade our reality and promise to universally enhance our lives, but what happens when this promise is reserved for cisgender people while subjecting trans people to legacies of anti-trans violence that implicate trans liveability? Despite this key question, existing critiques engage only sparingly with the violent legacies perpetu ated by algorithms that trans people encounter, rarely go beyond notions of bias, and therefore fail to centre trans ex periences. In this article, I extend scholarship on critical algorithm studies, trans studies, and necropolitics through three accounts of lived trans experiences to show the vicious algorithmic operations on trans lives. Centrally, this art icle argues that algorithms are not neutral, distinct, or progressive. Rather, as a vicious “cis-tem” (playing on the word system), algorithms enact forms of violence towards the possibility of transness, violence that is rooted in legacies of capitalist, colonial, and cisheteronormative power that violate trans lives and radicalise transphobia. Contrasting trans voices against the algorithmic machines, this article offers a novel perspective on the entanglement between al gorithms and trans liveability through the lens of algorithmic violence. I demonstrate how algorithms embody racial ised and gendered ideals of the human that target trans people through engineered transphobic feedback-loops, cis normative default, and capitalist profit based on fear. I conclude by reimagining liberatory digital futures.",

          "authors": "James M. Zumel Dumlao; Misha Teplitskiy",
          "abstract": "Authors from low- and middle-income countries often have lower acceptance rates in academic journals, leading to their ideas receiving less attention. One hypothesized contributor to this disparity is the limited geographical diversity of peer reviewers. If reviewers favor submissions from their own country (i.e. homophily), and authors from certain countries are disproportionately reviewed by same-country reviewers, this creates a “geographical representation bias” favoring those authors. Using administrative data from the Institute of Physics Publishing (IOP), encompassing metadata on 204,718 submissions to 60 STEM journals between 2018-2022, we find strong evidence of this bias. Comparing different reviewers of the same manuscript, we find that those from the same country as the corresponding author are 4.78 percentage points more likely to review positively, and authors from countries well-represented in the reviewer pool (e.g., USA, China, India) are 8-9 times more likely to be evaluated by same-country reviewers. An instrumental variables analysis using an exogenous policy change that created variation in which submissions were anonymized shows that anonymizing submissions does not significantly reduce homophily.  These findings provide support for efforts to diversify reviewer pools, and suggest that there are no “quick fixes” for geographical representation bias.",

          "authors": "Hamid Bulut; Robin Samuel",
          "abstract": "An increasing number of countries are considering implementing domestic carbon taxes to achieve the carbon-reduction targets set in the Paris Agreement. However, introducing such taxes presents significant challenges for policymakers worldwide. Despite their effectiveness, carbon taxes remain the least popular policy instrument. Furthermore, few studies focus on public support for carbon taxation in low- and middle-income countries, a crucial area of research given the global significance of their emissions. Therefore, we conducted a pre-registered full factorial survey experiment involving more than 13,000 evaluations of policy designs in China, Germany, India, and the UK to address the most prevalent barriers to the popularity of carbon taxes, as discussed in academic research, policy analysis, and public discourse: perceived effectiveness, average household costs, the types of revenue recycling schemes implemented, and the extent of international cooperation. Our findings revealed striking differences in how the countries responded to carbon tax policies. The key findings included the following: cost transparency unexpectedly reduced support, whereas communicating the effectiveness of the policy increased \nit; preferences for revenue recycling schemes varied significantly across the four countries, highlighting the need for tailored approaches; and, surprisingly, international cooperation increased support only in Germany, challenging assumptions about global climate policy. These findings have profound implications for policymakers, suggesting that an effective carbon tax design must be carefully calibrated in the national context. This study provides a roadmap for designing carbon tax policies that are environmentally effective and politically viable for diverse global economies.",

          "abstract": "In the face of climate change, the principles of distributive social justice have become paramount in addressing the implications of resource allocation and the unequal impacts of environmental degradation. Our study explores the relationship between distributive social justice and environmental attitudes among young people in the context of climate change. Using a natural experimental design, we examine how the 2021 European Floods influenced social justice and environmental attitudes. Our results indicate significant shifts in attitudes, particularly regarding social justice, following the flooding. We found a strong and robust relationship between social justice and environmental attitudes. A causal mediation analysis revealed that floods affected environmental attitudes indirectly through social justice attitudes beyond direct effects. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating the principles of justice in addressing climate change and suggest that young people’s perspectives on social justice play a crucial role in shaping environmental policies and responses to climate crises.",

          "abstract": "In the context of ageing populations and shrinking families, the care for relatives represents a growing risk to labour market activity for many individuals in productive age, as well as for gender equality and the well-being of caregivers. The risk can be further amplified if more adult family members need assistance or when care for an adult relative collides with childcare responsibilities, which would be an accumulation of the care burden (cumulative care). As such, adult care provision might have important ramifications for the European care strategy, the EU’s strategy on gender equality, and the headline employment target that at least 78% of the population aged 20 to 64 should be in employment by 2030. Yet, we do not have a tool that would systematically monitor the amount of care family members provide to their relatives and whether or how these care responsibilities affect their working lives. We argue that there is a clear need for high-quality, comparative data on the extent and intensity of care for adult relatives or other close persons in European households. For that reason, we propose an EU-SILC ad-hoc module on ‘Care and Work’ that allows to monitor and understand the extent and intensity of care for adult relatives or other close persons. The proposed ad hoc module fits well with existing variables on employment and work intensity, as well as with variables on childcare, poverty risks and material deprivation to set the adult care in a wider context of issues such as gender employment and pay gaps, or risks of poverty and social exclusion.",

          "abstract": "Burning all the reserves of the 200 largest fossil fuel companies could generate up to 673GtCO2. We only have a 400GtCO2 emissions budget to remain under 1.5°C global warming by 2050 according to the IPCC. Rapid action is needed to cut, or as a last resort, offset these emissions. It remains unclear who will pay to offset these emissions and how to proceed. Here we show that if the cost of offsetting is above $150 per ton of CO2, all large fossil fuel companies would have a negative market value. Using the social cost of carbon to give a valuation of fossil fuel companies, we find that they have a negative value for society. Fossil fuel companies could decide to offset their emissions by afforestation (a cheaper alternative and the most used technology today). We measure how much space would be needed to offset all the emissions from current fossil fuel reserves. We show that offsetting all reserves would require covering the equivalent of the whole of North and Central America with only trees, removing all of the people and cultivated land. Afforestation, while more economical could disrupt existing ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "In this working paper, we critically analyse the trilemma between poverty reduction, social expenditure and work incentives, based on a set of simulated policy reforms designed to reduce poverty among families with children. We find that the simulated reforms demonstrated that poverty reduction is possible through increasing child benefits and social assistance. The reforms were typically associated with an increase between 1% and 3-4% of social expenditure. We found that most reforms were associated with reduced work incentives, but that the changes in the participation tax rates tended to be small: the child benefit reforms usually resulted in an increase of around a few percent. For a set of reforms, we have demonstrated the relevance of attempting to quantify this trilemma. While indeed the results indicate the existence of such trilemma, in particular the aspect of work (dis)incentives may not be an unequivocal barrier to poverty reduction.",

          "authors": "Anna Pagani; Alex Macmillan; Federico Savini; Michael Davies; Nici Zimmermann",
          "abstract": "The shortage of social housing is a crucial element of the UK housing crisis. In England, social rented housing provision significantly relies on market homes construction, with detrimental impacts on residents and the environment. Moratoria are often cited in the degrowth literature as policy tools supporting strategies to break free from growth-driven mechanisms and achieve high levels of well-being while reducing environmental pressures. However, the systemic effects of such a policy on housing and its potential drawbacks are at present understudied. This study explores the extent to which a moratorium on new construction in the housing sector would be an effective, desirable, and feasible policy to address the shortage of good quality social housing. We used existing causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to formulate qualitative hypotheses on the effects of a moratorium on the structures underpinning the construction and demolition of social housing estates. We then explored perceived obstacles or opportunities to its uptake in a workshop with four housing associations, the largest providers of social housing in England. Our CLDs suggest that a moratorium could help to address the growth-dependent mechanisms of social housing provision, with systemic benefits for both social tenants and housing associations. However, the workshop revealed that its adoption would depend on whether the maintenance, repair, and retrofit of the existing stock could offset the perceived advantages of new construction (e.g., quality, quantity, adequacy). Through the use of systems thinking tools, our findings support dialogue around alternatives to the growth-dependent paradigm undermining housing provision within planetary boundaries.",

It is found that the first democracy was born in China more than 4,000 years ago. As a result of the discovery, a practical framework called Yao-Shunism is formulated and presented. Yao-Shunism offers non-partisan politics and participatory governance. It is backed by major Chinese philosophies and provides a viable alternative to existing political practice.

The aim and contribution of the paper is to clarify when and how parameter estimates based on aggregates leads to bias and the likely degree of such bias.  It demonstrates that use of aggregate data to estimate parameters associated with a model of individual behaviour when the outcome variable is binary (e.g. a birth) is not advisable. It only ‘works’ when the independent variables do not vary at the individual level (e.g. prices or the unemployment rate).  Even then it requires prior distributional knowledge or assumptions.  When the individual model also contains variables that vary across individuals, then the analysis in the paper suggests that all parameter estimates based solely on variation in the aggregates usually understate the size of their true value, even ones associated with variables which do not vary over individuals.  Indeed, it is often the case that the 95% confidence interval of these latter parameter estimates never contains the parameter’s true value.",

          "abstract": "We argue that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.7% of the returns. The models assuming independence of the two returns show similar power in predicting T-bill returns, which can significantly simplify the formulas. We also find that the inclusion of a risk constant over maturity, which has a small value of several basis points, significantly reduces the prediction errors. The risk and the risk-free rate is the gateway to corporate the risk of various assets in the country.",
