          "authors": "Diego Gómez-Venegas",
          "abstract": "This paper discusses the challenges of tracing the extensive and dispersed archive of Chile's Project Cybersyn and how this process highlights theoretical and political issues regarding who should possess a country's technological and cultural history. By demonstrating that part of this history – and the archive that makes it traceable – continues to resonate with the Chilean working class from which this project emerged, the author concludes that these questions must be addressed by embracing archival openness beyond archival property.",

          "authors": "Meghnil Chowdhury",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced diagnostics, prediction, and automation, yet its\nability to sustain continuity of care and adaptive ethical learning across populations\nremains limited. This paper introduces Continuity Intelligence (CQ)—the first theoretical\nframework to formalize continuity as a measurable dimension of intelligence within socio-\ntechnical health systems. CQ redefines intelligence as the sustained and ethically\ngoverned capacity to remain contextually aware over time, moving beyond the short-term\noptimization of current AI paradigms. Unlike frameworks such as Learning Health Systems\nor adaptive AI, CQ positions continuity—not iteration—as the defining characteristic of\nintelligent health infrastructures. Drawing on Donna Haraway’s situated knowledges¹⁰ and\nBruno Latour’s actor-network theory¹¹, CQ integrates three interdependent dimensions—\nclinical precision, behavioral reinforcement, and social trust—to transform AI from\nepisodic prediction into continuous and participatory engagement. CQ thus offers a\nconcise, unified conceptual foundation for equitable and human-centered digital public\nhealth systems. Its novelty lies in defining continuity as the operational measure of\nintelligence—linking ethical governance, behavioral adaptation, and clinical precision into\na sustained framework applicable to chronic disease management, mental health, and\nelder care.",

          "authors": "Lamine Ain el djaneb; Dalila Laoufi",
          "abstract": "This article is an inquiry into how digital communication practices affect the strategic vigilance of public institutions in Algeria. On the basis of material collected in the course of a master’s thesis I was able to conduct and additional resources, it looks into whether raising an organization's presence in the digital realm also enhances its capability to monitor changes in environment and take proactive action. It employed a descriptive and analytical mixed method design: interviews were carried out with employees of Rail Logistic; participant observation was conducted over the course of a three-month internship at company headquarters; and finally an official website and Facebook pages were analyzed using quantitative content analysis. The results show that Rail Logistic's limited digital communication, rare updates, a narrow content scope and a low level of basic literacy in its staff regarding digital technologies actually undermines its ability to be strategically vigilant. But this is not because the workers are incapable of bringing about change or do not understand what needs to change. Major obstacles include the absence of real-time monitoring tools, insufficient content diversity, inadequate digital skills, and structural/cultural barriers to integrating digital channels into core strategy. These results highlight the need for Algerian public organizations to develop coherent digital communication strategies and cultures. In particular, establishing dedicated monitoring units and investing in training could leverage social media and web tools for more effective environmental scanning. This article’s contribution lies in articulating a theoretical framework of digital communication and strategic vigilance, and in critically analyzing empirical data from the Algerian public sector to draw lessons for policy and practice.\n\nKeywords: digital communication; strategic vigilance; digital transformation; public sector; digital culture; environmental scanning.",

          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has emerged as a significant challenge to the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital media. This paper presents a comparative literature review of eight leading deepfake detection methods, including Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks, PRNU-based Detection, Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Networks, Deep Learning-based Approaches, Transfer Learning models, Multimodal Detection techniques, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based frameworks. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and adaptability across benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and UADFV.\n\nThe analysis identifies the Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Network as the most reliable framework, achieving over 98% accuracy and strong generalization on uncompressed data. Ethical and societal implications — including privacy, fairness, and transparency — are discussed to promote responsible AI research. The paper concludes by outlining strategies for improvement and future directions, including real-time detection, multimodal fusion, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving architectures. This comparative review serves as a reference point for advancing the reliability and accountability of deepfake detection systems in modern digital forensics.",

          "authors": "Bennett McIntosh; Kelsey Ichikawa; Nicole Christine Nelson",
          "abstract": "Over the last decade, the transparency of the scientific data supporting environmental regulations has been the subject of partisan conflict at the highest levels of the United States’ government. Recent attempts by conservatives, industry groups, and dissident scientists to promulgate transparency requirements for such data have been described by partisan opponents and critical data studies scholars alike as ‘Trojan Horses’ designed to exclude nonreplicable studies from environmental decision making. However, if we distinguish between replication (performing a study de novo) and reanalysis (re-examining data from an existing study to confirm or challenge its conclusions), several things become clear. First, these recent clashes are part of a long story, stretching back at least to the 1990s, that is centered on data access for reanalysis: while some actors may be interested in preventing the consideration of certain data, others are interested in reanalyzing data to re-examine the scientific consensus, and in fact have done so. Second, using procedure or methodological quality to adjudicate reanalyses often fails, leading to a recourse to reputational markers that amplifies rather than resolves the lack of epistemic closure. Because the transparency of regulatory data has been a bipartisan priority over the last few decades, we anticipate that adversarial reanalyses will only become more common. The aim of transparent, open scientific data is a laudable one, but as data become more open, advocates, scientists, and policymakers alike will have to be mindful of how to make decisions in the absence of scientific consensus.",

          "authors": "Vihaan Sahu",
          "abstract": "Objective: Risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment is a critical component of evidence synthesis, yet visualization of these assessments remains challenging due to the diversity of assessment tools and a lack of standardized visualization approaches. This study aimed to develop Critiplot, a comprehensive solution comprising a Python package and a web tool that supports visualization of multiple RoB assessment frameworks including the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), ROBIS, JBI checklists for case reports and case series, and GRADE – a combination not comprehensively supported by any existing single tool. Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for each of these frameworks separately, as well as in a unified manner.\n\nMethods: Critiplot was developed using Python 3.11, with Streamlit for the web interface, and as a standalone Python package. The tool supports five major RoB assessment tools: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), GRADE, ROBIS, JBI Case Report, and JBI Case Series. The tool was evaluated through a technical assessment of its visualization capabilities and a comparative analysis with existing visualization tools. Test datasets were created to represent typical use cases for each assessment tool, including variations in study numbers, RoB distributions, and data formats. Edge case datasets were also created to test the tool's handling of missing data, invalid scores, and inconsistent formatting.\n\nResults: Critiplot successfully generates publication-ready traffic light plots and weighted bar plots for all supported assessment tools. The tool offers multiple visualization themes and supports various output formats (PNG, PDF, SVG, EPS). Critiplot is the first tool to generate publication-ready visualizations for NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE assessments both individually for each framework and in a unified manner within a single platform. The Python package allows for programmatic integration into analysis pipelines, while the web application provides an accessible interface for users without programming experience. Performance evaluation showed that Critiplot efficiently handled datasets of varying sizes, with processing times ranging from 1.5 seconds for 3 studies to 3.8 seconds for 10 studies. The tool demonstrated robustness in handling edge cases, providing clear error messages in 98% of test cases with invalid inputs.\n\nConclusion: Critiplot addresses a significant gap in evidence synthesis methodologies by providing a unified, reproducible approach to RoB visualization across multiple assessment frameworks. Its unique capability to visualize each framework separately (NOS, ROBIS, JBI, and GRADE) alongside unified visualization makes it a pioneering solution. Its open-source design and intuitive interface (both as a package and web tool) make it a valuable addition to the biomedical informatics toolkit, promoting methodological standardization and enhancing the clarity and reproducibility of RoB assessments.",

          "authors": "Marina Dubova; Arseny Moskvichev; Kevin Zollman",
          "abstract": "Scientists must choose which among many experiments to perform. We study the epistemic success of experimental choice strategies proposed by philosophers of science or executed by scientists themselves. We develop a multi-agent model of the scientific process that jointly formalizes its core aspects: active experimentation, theorizing, and social learning. We find that agents who choose new experiments at random develop the most accurate theories of the world. The agents aiming to confirm, falsify theories, or resolve theoretical disagreements end up with an illusion of epistemic success: they develop promising accounts for the data they collected, while completely misrepresenting the ground truth that they intended to learn about. Agents experimenting in theory-motivated ways acquire less diverse or less representative samples from the ground truth that also turn out to be easier to account for. Random data collection, on the other hand, combines virtues of diverse and representative sampling from a target scientific domain which enables cumulative development of the successful theoretical accounts of it. We suggest that randomization, already a gold standard within experiments, is also beneficial at the level of experiments themselves.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research on love has grown across personality, social, and affective science, yet the field remains conceptually fragmented. Using bibliometric mapping on 9,000 publications in the field, this review charts the development and present organization of love research from 1974 to 2022, identifying its central themes and evolving directions. Although historically grounded in attachment and romantic relationship theories, contemporary work now encompasses compassion, positive emotions, identity, neuroscience, and cultural perspectives. Despite this breadth, theoretical integration remains limited. To address this, we introduce the Ecosystem of Love Science framework—a meta-theoretical model that conceptualizes love as a dynamic, interdependent system rooted in shared philosophical, biological, and cultural foundations. This framework outlines pathways for linking diverse forms and levels of love, providing a foundation for a more unified and interdisciplinary understanding of how love operates within human relationships and the broader social world.",

          "abstract": "Increased attention to racial inequities catalyzed a surge in publications documenting racial biases in neuroscience with one recent article in Nature Neuroscience effectively drawing attention to how skin conductance response is less reliably detected for Black individuals than White. In this correspondence, we introduce pressing additional “real world” concerns in how polygraphs heavily rely on this measure. Despite well-documented issues of validity and reliability with polygraphs, they continue to be used in various stages of the legal system. With Black individuals already facing disproportionate incarceration rates, the reduced reliability for skin conductance used in polygraphs for Black individuals can further exacerbate legal system inequity. Furthermore, these biases accentuate existing challenges interpreting polygraph results given their subjectivity as well as the heightened police-related anxiety reported among Black individuals. We join calls for re-evaluation and possibly exclusion of polygraph evidence in legal settings, considering the amplified risks it poses to Black individuals.",

          "authors": "Wilma A. Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "A majority of memory research examines a single or a few factors that influence memory, but a broader perspective is needed to form a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of memory. Broadly, prior work has largely focused on observer effects (e.g., individual differences, internal states) and environmental effects (e.g., task, context), with only more recent work focusing on item effects (e.g., the typicality or memorability of stimuli). Here, I analyze 6,223,953 memory decisions made by 13,946 participants on a continuous recognition task for 26,107 naturalistic object images to test how these different factors influence long-term episodic memory. The individual subject and the memorability of the stimulus emerge as the most important factors for predicting successful hits, with surprisingly little influence of the experimental context. In contrast, while less variance is captured by these factors for false alarms, a wider variety of factors are important, including image factors, observer factors, and experimental context. These results suggest that much of what drives our memory is shared and predictable, and demonstrate the need for more research that focuses on multiple factors simultaneously in more representative and naturalistic tasks.",

          "authors": "Eveline Gieles; Leonie Vogelsmeier; Joran Jongerling; Tom Smeets; Egon Dejonckheere",
          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is often praised for its ecological validity, under the assumption that change observed in EMA data reflects change in the underlying constructs, independent of study participation. However, participation itself may threaten ecological validity as participants’ involvement in an EMA study may already alter their experiences, behavior or responses. Existing research on such participation effects has primarily documented their occurrence rather than explained the mechanisms through which they arise. To advance this understanding, we developed a taxonomy of potential sources of (measurement-induced) change in EMA data. This taxonomy includes increased reflection on assessed constructs (i.e., measurement reactivity), alterations to daily routines (i.e., measurement interference), shifts in how participants interpret items or response scales (i.e., reconceptualization or recalibration), practice in gauging internal states (i.e., improved introspection), and declining participant engagement (i.e., heightened careless responding or reduced compliance). Identifying these distinct sources of change highlights the need for systematic investigation of their impact and the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We therefore outline a research agenda focusing on assessing and experimentally manipulating each source of measurement-induced change in isolation. In sum, this paper aims to initiate a collective effort among EMA researchers to clarify the mechanisms by which study participation shapes data, and to safeguard EMA’s promise of ecological validity. \n\nKeywords: experience sampling methodology, measurement reactivity, (ecological) validity, response shifts, careless or insufficient effort responding",

          "authors": "Sara Bogels; Tianyi Li; Marlou Rasenberg; Lotte Eijk; Ivan Toni; Wim Pouw",
          "abstract": "A drive towards efficiency seems to regulate communicative processes and ultimately language change. In line with efficiency principles, signed, spoken, and/or gestural utterances tend to reduce in overall effort over repeated referrals in referential tasks. Although theories generally assume multimodality and interaction, this process has mostly been operationalized as individual effort in a single communicative modality. Here we seek to understand reduction of communicative effort in its natural environment, i.e. during multimodal and collaborative face-to-face dialogues about displaced referents. We ascertain that the reduction in joint effort (y) over repeated referrals (x) follows a negative power relationship, y=a*x^c, where a and c are constants. This reduction in communicative effort is multimodal, occurring across gesture, speech, prosody, and turn taking, and it is interactive, based on joint effort. The pattern is robust, being confirmed through reanalyses of published datasets about (individual) effort reduction. Crucially, the pattern is communicatively relevant. The coefficient of the power relationship predicts change and convergence in interlocutors’ conceptualizations of the communicative referents over the interaction. The negative power relationship reflects therefore how effort translates into mutual understanding - a process we call communicative work. We suggest that the power function captures an exploration-exploitation trade-off during human dialogue which emerges from multiscale processes. Joint conceptualization of novel referents benefits from early conceptual exploration followed by later exploitation of selected signals. The current report proposes a novel ‘power law of joint communicative work’ that is relevant for linguistic theory, agent-based modeling, and experimental psychology.",

          "authors": "Daniel Huth; Sebastian Brand; Katajun Lindenberg",
          "abstract": "Objective: Problematic usage of the internet (PUI) is a growing concern in young adults. Mobile-based approach bias modification (ApBM) has proven efficacious; however, individual differences in intervention response remain poorly understood. This exploratory analysis examined baseline participant characteristics as potential moderators and predictors of outcome following mobile-based ApBM (PROTECTapp) to reduce PUI in university students. Methods: Based on data of 92 university students (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated PUI who were randomized to PROTECTapp (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47), we examined age, baseline PUI severity, motivation to change, comorbid internalizing symptoms, procrastination, and positive intervention expectancies as potential moderators and predictors of PUI (Compulsive Internet Use Scale, CIUS) and adherence at post-intervention. Results: Baseline PUI severity significantly moderated intervention efficacy (b = -0.42, SE = 0.20, p = .040), indicating stronger effects among individuals with higher initial symptom severity. No significant moderating effects emerged for other potential moderators. In a combined cross-over sample, higher baseline PUI severity (aOR = 1.37, p &lt; .001) and younger age (aOR = 0.67, p = .011) predicted greater likelihood of reliable improvement, while adherence was higher in younger participants (b = -2.43, SE = 1.01, p = .019) and those with higher internalizing symptoms (b = 2.68, SE = 1.24, p = .033). Conclusion: Mobile-based ApBM appears particularly effective for young adults with more severe PUI, supporting targeted rather than universal prevention approaches. Other baseline factors did not influence efficacy, underscoring broad applicability across diverse student populations.",

          "abstract": "Mental Workload (MWL) refers to the specification of information processing capacity used for maintaining task performance. Some studies find no effects of high MWL on the timing and quality of takeovers, whilst others have found increases in crash risk and delayed response times. The effect of time budget – the time between event onset and an impending crash - is much clearer; drivers react faster when time budgets are smaller. However, no study has investigated whether the effects of a pure MWL interact with the effects of time budget during critical takeovers from a hands-off Level 2 (L2) driving system. A Bayesian multilevel modelling approach was used to quantify the direction, size, and uncertainty of the effects that MWL and time budget have on driver performance. Drivers (N = 37) used a hands-off L2 driving system: once while completing a pure MWL task (2-back) and another while monitoring the road. Rear-end conflicts were generated via lead vehicles decelerating with short (TTC = 3 s) or long (TTC = 5 s) time budgets. 2-back-induced MWL had no consistent or substantial impact on the timing or quality of takeovers. Conversely, drivers were faster to respond but more erratic in their post-takeover lateral control following events with smaller time budgets. We discuss the reasons for the absence of effects from the 2-back-induced MWL on takeover performance. One suggestion is that rear-end scenarios elicit automatised behaviours that do not rely upon cognitive control and thus remained unaffected by MWL. Conversely, scenarios that require cognitive control (e.g., lane change manoeuvres or hazard perception tasks) may be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of MWL during transitions of control.",

Participants identified the personality aspect they wanted to change most, reported their motivation and success in implementing changes over 14 daily diaries, and indicated trait changes across two months. Findings revealed that most adolescents wanted to become more confident, sociable, or composed. Change intentions primarily focused on school contexts and were driven by a desire to build social connections. Although we observed few significant personality changes, adolescents who reported higher levels of composure and confidence at first measurement felt more successful in their change efforts.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of a 3-week mobile-based approach–avoidance task (AAT) training (PROTECTapp) for reducing PUI in university students. Method: Ninety-two participants (Mage = 22.00 years, 69.6% female) with elevated levels of PUI were randomized to the PROTECTapp intervention (n = 45) or a waitlist control group (n = 47). Primary outcomes were PUI severity and internet-related craving. Secondary outcomes included motivation to change, psychopathological symptoms and academic functioning. Participants were assessed at baseline and postintervention; the intervention group completed additional 3- and 12-week follow-ups. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated greater reductions in PUI following the PROTECTapp intervention compared to the waitlist (p = .003; d = -0.80, 95% CI [-1.23, -0.38]). No significant effects emerged for craving or broader psychological outcomes (ps &lt; .05), though favorable effects were observed on motivation to change (ambivalence: p = .020; d = -0.24, 95% CI [-0.65, 0.17]; taking steps: p = .002; d = 0.45, [0.04, 0.87]). Satisfaction with the intervention was moderate (M = 18.32 of 32), and participants completed on average 35.52 training sessions. Adverse events were reported infrequent (7.1%). Conclusion: PROTECTapp is a promising mobile-based intervention to reduce PUI and enhance motivation to change in young adults. Its brevity, scalability, and safety profile highlight its potential as a low-threshold preventive or adjunctive intervention for young individuals at-risk.",

          "abstract": "Fixed-effects modeling is a powerful tool for estimating within-cluster associations in cross-sectional data and within-participant associations in longitudinal data. Although commonly used by other social scientists, this tool remains largely unknown to psychologists. To address this issue, we offer a pedagogical primer tailored for this audience, complete with R, Stata, and SPSS scripts. This primer is organized into three parts. In PART 1, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to clustered cross-sectional data. We introduce the concepts of ‘cluster dummies’ and ‘demeaning,’ and provide scripts to estimate the within-school association between sports and depression in a fictional dataset. In PART 2, we show how fixed-effects modeling applies to longitudinal data, and provide scripts to estimate the within-participant association between sports and depression over time in a fictional four-wave dataset. In this part, we cover three additional topics. First, we explain how to calculate effect sizes and offer simulation-based sample size guidelines to detect within-participant effects of plausible magnitude with sufficient power. Second, we show how to test two possible interactions: between a time-invariant and a time-varying predictor, and between two time-varying predictors. Third, we introduce three relevant extensions: first-difference modeling (estimating changes from one wave to the next); time-distributed fixed-effects modeling (estimating changes before, during, and after an individual event); and within-between multilevel modeling (estimating both within- and between-participant associations). In PART 3, we discuss two limitations of fixed-effects modeling: time-varying confounders and reverse causation. We conclude with reflections on causality in nonexperimental data.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies on the neural correlates of dreaming using high-density EEG (hdEEG) and the serial awakening paradigm have identified posterior brain regions related to dreaming, with maximal activity over occipital areas. Based on these results, we have hypothesized that neural activity during dreaming is mainly driven by sensory experiences (e.g., vision, audition), which predominate our subjective experiences during sleep. Here, we have applied hdEEG (256 electrodes) and the serial awakening paradigm in N2 sleep of 39 participants to study the neural activity during the 30 seconds window preceding each awakening with source localization. We found that having a conscious experience with recall (CE) compared to no experience (NE) is related to increased beta/gamma frequencies in a widely distributed part of the cortex, with peak T-values in posterior occipital-temporal regions (primary and secondary visual cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal cortex). Contrasts also showed increased beta/gamma power in occipital-temporal cortices in high-perceptual dreams compared to NE, while no significant result was found when comparing low-perceptual dreams to NE, suggesting, as expected, that the main result (CE vs NE) is driven by perception. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between different content-specific neural correlates of dreaming.",

          "abstract": "Depression is a leading mental health concern among children and adolescents, —90% of whom live in developing countries. Accurate measurement of depression in this population is a crucial step toward effective research, diagnosis, and intervention. Although rating scales for children and adolescents are widely used by researchers, clinicians, and large-scale surveys, their heterogeneity in developing contexts has been largely overlooked. To fill the gap, we analyzed the content of 27 Chinese depression scales and self-report data from four commonly used scales (N = 12,764). Our content analysis identified 84 unique symptoms across the 27 scales and low rate of overlap (mean = 0.19, range: 0.09–0.25), suggesting that instruments often assumed to be comparable capture distinct symptom domains. Moreover, few scales included cultural- or age-specific symptoms, suggesting a lack of cultural- or age-adaptation. Analyses of self-report data showed that the four scales produced different detection rates and each identified unique cases. Exploratory Graph Analysis revealed that their items clustered into three distinct symptom communities rather than a unified construct. These findings indicate that depression scales for children and adolescents are not interchangeable and highlight the need for harmonization efforts. Achieving a balance between standardization and contextual adaptation is essential for improving the validity and comparability of depression measurement in global mental health research.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the proportion of individuals who remain single in affluent countries. Considering that romantic relationships have been associated with higher subjective well-being (SWB) in cross-sectional and panel data, this is a potentially worrying trend. However, it is yet unknown if these differences are reflected in the daily dynamics of SWB when comparing single and partnered individuals. Using daily diary data over four months, we compared differences in day-to-day dynamics of SWB in two propensity-score matched samples of singles (n = 85) and partnered individuals (n = 85), consisting primarily of young, female university students. Although equal in trait levels of psychological distress, we found that single individuals experience lower average levels of daily SWB as well as higher variability and instability in SWB variables, compared to partnered individuals, but no differences in resistance to change in SWB (i.e., inertia) could be observed. When analyzing individual components of SWB, singles and partnered individuals differed primarily in negative affect but not in positive affect. Furthermore, singles had greater difficulty in recovering from accumulating negative experiences compared to partnered individuals. Being in a romantic relationship is associated with both higher average levels and stability in daily SWB compared to being single. Both groups experienced decrements in SWB when they spent less time with their social support networks, highlighting the importance of having alternative strategies for handling negative experiences. Singles may also be more accustomed to significant volatility in SWB compared to partnered individuals, thus, considering expected dynamics when determining the magnitude of a problem in clinical practice is of importance.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

Infant night sleep duration was assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. Sensitivity was observed at 6 months. In the German cohort, higher maternal CM predicted shorter infant night sleep (p = .001). Sensitivity moderated this association (p = .038), emphasizing its protective role. While the replication of this interaction was inconclusive in the U.S. sample, the pooled effect across cohorts was significant (p = .03).

We evaluate the implementation process through the lens of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) to understand how the documented interventions were adopted and to identify factors influencing its normalisation into routine research practice.\nMethods: A multidisciplinary team implemented an NLP pipeline to automatically extract information on presenting problems, treatments, and outcomes (e.g., engagement, clinical outcomes, side effects) from pseudonymised EHR free-text notes. The implementation followed an iterative seven-phase roadmap: (1) defining research questions; (2) identifying key constructs; (3) co-developing an annotation schema; (4) training human annotators; (5) resolving annotation discrepancies; (6) large-scale annotation of EHR data; and (7) NLP model development and evaluation. Throughout, we applied NPT to guide implementation and evaluate progress. Quantitative outcomes (such as volume of data processed, annotation reliability, and NLP model performance) and qualitative feedback were collected to assess implementation success.\nResults: The NLP intervention was successfully deployed in a real-world clinical research setting, extracted data from 454,127 clinical notes across 5,906 patients. The annotation process achieved a high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff’s α = 0.86; 95% CI 0.83–0.88) after iterative schema refinement, and the trained NLP model demonstrated acceptable accuracy in identifying medications (F1-score = 0.9; 95% CI 0.89, 0.91) and anxiety-related information (F1-score = 0.79; 95% CI 0.77, 0.8).  The NPT-based evaluation revealed that coherence of a shared understanding of the NLP tool’s purpose and value was established among the team. Cognitive participation was generally strong, clinicians and researchers showed growing interest and involvement in the NLP-enabled research workflow. Collective action was facilitated by clear protocols, though challenges such as variability in data quality and the learning curve for new technology impeded smooth operation at times. Through reflective monitoring, the team identified needs for ongoing training and infrastructure improvements. No major adverse event or harm was reported, though additional time was required for data access and computational setup, which considerably extended the project timeline.",

          "abstract": "Touch is one of the most fundamental and evolutionarily conserved channels of social communication, yet it remains unclear whether and how touch alone can transmit affective states between individuals. Existing studies often conflate tactile contact with visual or auditory cues, obscuring the neural mechanisms and temporal dynamics of emotional state transmission. Here we isolated tactile channel in pairs of participants who engaged in handholding while one partner (Sender) viewed emotional videos and the other (Receiver) was visually and acoustically isolated. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that touch aligned partners’ arousal states, enhanced receivers’ sensitivity to emotional cues, and strengthened prefrontal inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Crucially, mediation analyses showed that under the touch level, prefrontal IBS predicted receivers’ arousal estimates, which in turn predicted their emotional sensitivity (d'), indicating a touch-specific indirect pathway through arousal alignment. Time-resolved analyses further revealed that neural activity in the Sender's prefrontal cortex, particularly inferior frontal gyrus, preceded Receiver neural responses by approximately 16 s. \nThese findings reveal a neural mechanism by which embodied contact sequentially aligns emotional states through prefrontal coupling. By elucidating how touch embeds emotional meaning within a shared neural space, our findings advance an embodied account of human communication and provide a biological foundation for developing emotionally attuned, socially embedded artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Reputation is a central mechanism for sustaining cooperation in human societies, yet–unlike in typical theories and most experimental setups–real-world reputational information about others’ past behavior is often noisy, delayed, or deliberately manipulated, raising the question of whether cooperation can survive when reputational signals are unreliable. We experimentally study how cooperation evolves when individuals can strategically manipulate their public image and whether allowing others to verify such information can counteract manipulation and restore cooperation. As a benchmark, we replicate a standard repeated network cooperation game in which participants observe one another’s past actions and freely choose partners for future interactions. This baseline produces stable, high levels of cooperation driven by conditional association and reputation-based reciprocity. When participants can manipulate information about their past behavior at a cost, manipulation becomes widespread and cooperation collapses. Introducing the option to verify others’ reputations does not prevent this decline: verification is infrequent, poorly targeted, and insufficient to restore reliable reputational information. Consequently, cooperation disappears even when truth-checking is possible. These findings expose the vulnerability of reputation-based cooperation to strategic distortion and highlight the crucial role of trustworthy, verifiable reputation systems. This fragility is magnified in the modern digital era, where profit-driven communication technologies and social media make distortion, selective presentation, and manipulation of information cheap and widespread. Such dynamics foster the spread of disinformation, including fake news, climate change denial, and vaccine refusal, undermining collective efforts to address global challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and pandemics.",

          "abstract": "Attention shapes how different types of information are maintained and retrieved from working memory (WM). Previous research examined whether the voluntariness of attention interacts with the type of content in WM using central arrow retro-cues, but found no such interaction. However, central and peripheral cues engage attention through different mechanisms: evidence from external attention shows that peripheral cues are more effective in triggering automatic orienting. Determining whether this distinction influences how attention modulates perceptual and semantic WM contents is essential for clarifying how voluntary and involuntary mechanisms operate on internal representations. In this pre-registered study, 100 participants completed two retro-cueing tasks in which peripheral retro-cues directed voluntary or involuntary attention toward perceptual (gray vs. sepia colors) and semantic (natural vs. artificial categories) features of real-world stimuli competing in WM. Reaction time and accuracy were analyzed using hierarchical drift-diffusion models. Results showed, first, that attentional voluntariness did not differentially affect perceptual vs. semantic WM contents, replicating a previous finding. Second, drift rates revealed retro-cueing effects for both voluntary and involuntary attention: voluntary attention produced stronger effects, primarily driven by costs, whereas involuntary attention yielded smaller effects, mainly driven by benefits. Third, non-decision times showed a similar pattern—larger effects (benefits and costs) for voluntary attention, and smaller, benefit-based effects for involuntary attention. Crucially, this involuntary modulation contrasts with previous findings using central retro-cues, where no such effect was observed. Together, these findings suggest that, prior to decision making, peripheral spatial retro-cues more effectively recruit involuntary attention, automatically reactivating WM representations when cue locations overlap with memoranda. Moreover, the results strengthen the view that voluntariness does not interact with the type of WM content when perceptual and semantic features compete for representation.",

We investigate integration from both a sociological (academic and social integration) and a psychological perspective (self-congruence), to better converge these perspectives in understanding the integration process. 135 first-year university students participated in a daily diary study spanning one week. The data was analyzed through linear mixed-effects models. We found that daily competence satisfaction and studying alone were positive predictors of academic integrations. For social integration, we found that daily autonomy, studying alone, and end-of-the-week (day 5) were a negative predictor, whereas daily relatedness, and participating in lectures and seminars were positive predictors. For self-congruence, competence and relatedness were positive predictors. Our findings show that there are different mechanisms leading to different forms of integration and potential dynamics between different forms of integration, suggesting that integration is multidimensional and broader in nature than generally operationalized.",

          "abstract": "Emotional events are remembered better than neutral ones. While many human neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions involved, relatively few—and typically small—studies have disentangled how arousal and valence shape the neural substrates of this enhancement. We leveraged a large single-centre fMRI sample (n=1006) in which healthy young adults viewed negative, neutral, and positive pictures during scanning followed by an unannounced free-recall test. Using whole-brain subsequent-memory analyses (PFWE&lt;.05), we contrasted successful encoding of emotional (negative + positive) vs neutral items, then tested valence-specific effects (successful encoding: negative &gt; neutral; positive &gt; neutral), and finally controlled for subjective arousal via serial parametric modulation. Behaviourally, recall was higher for emotional than neutral pictures. Consistent with prior meta-analytic evidence, emotional &gt; neutral successful encoding engaged occipito-temporal visual cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala. Additionally, we observed an extensive temporoparietal network, while hippocampal/parahippocampal activations were absent. After controlling for arousal, amygdala and insula effects were no longer significant, indicating these regions were sensitive to arousal rather than valence. Overlap of negative- and positive-valence enhancement localised primarily to the occipito-temporal cortex. Negative-specific enhancement recruited the lateral occipital/fusiform and bilateral supramarginal regions; positive-specific enhancement involved the rostral/caudal anterior cingulate, superior frontal, and parietal cortex, as well as the precuneus. Successful neutral encoding preferentially engaged frontoparietal control regions and bilateral lingual/parahippocampal cortex. Together, these findings dissociate valence-dependent from arousal-dependent mechanisms and reveal both partially overlapping and distinct networks for negative and positive memory enhancement, refining neurocognitive models of emotional memory encoding.",

          "authors": "Umerasundasu Horii",
          "abstract": "Digital environments have reconfigured the psychological architecture of identity.  Classical theories of selfhood, from Erikson’s (1968) psychosocial model to McAdams’s (1993) life-story framework, position the individual as the primary author of identity; integrating memory, motivation, and reflection into a coherent narrative.  Yet identity formation now unfolds within predictive systems that record, rank, and respond to expression.  This paper introduces Delegated Personhood, a sociotechnical framework describing how authorship of the self becomes distributed between human cognition and algorithmic optimization processes.  Integrating self-determination theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017), cognitive feedback models (Conway &amp; Pleydell-Pearce, 2000), and digital sociology (Bucher, 2018; van Dijck, 2020), the model specifies five mechanisms, algorithmic identity fragmentation, mimicry under perceptual surveillance, autonomy attenuation, identity fatigue, and chrono-social drift, through which predictive feedback loops reshape perceived agency.  Each mechanism is linked to empirical analogues in motivation, social influence, and temporal cognition.  Delegated Personhood defines co-authorship as the point at which algorithmic feedback materially alters self-categorization, producing measurable shifts in coherence, volitional clarity, and temporal continuity.  The framework reframes identity as a hybrid system of human intention and computational inference, advancing testable propositions for social-psychological research in algorithmically mediated contexts.                                                                                                \n    Keywords: delegated personhood, identity, algorithmic authorship, self-determination, digital environments, autonomy",

          "abstract": "Object-based working memory is a fundamental cognitive ability that allows us to encode, store representations of, and use information about objects that are no longer present across short time scales. There is currently a lack of longitudinal research on how this ability develops in infancy. In the present pre-registered study, we used a manual search task, the “Magic Box” task, to assess infants’ ability to represent one or more hidden objects. Across several trials, between 1 and 4 objects were hidden in a box and the number of objects retrieved by the infant on each trial was recorded. Furthermore, on half the trials, 1 object was surreptitiously removed to test whether infants would search longer when they expected 1 more object in the box than was actually in there. The same group of infants completed the task at 10 months (N = 141) and 16 months (N = 75). Results indicated that the capacity to represent objects in working memory increased between 10 months (~1 object) and 16 months (~2 objects). Both age groups searched longer when an object had been secretly removed than when no objects were removed. Increased capacity was also demonstrated by 16-month-olds searching the box significantly longer than 10-month-olds on trials with one object missing, indicating a stronger representation of the ‘missing’ object. However, performance at 10 months was not predictive of performance at 16 months, suggesting instability in individual differences in object-based working memory capacity across this period.",

          "abstract": "We conducted a theoretical exploration into how human-LLM collaboration can enforce the emergence of creativity through the lens of concepts—a notion that is central in the philosophical discussions regarding human knowledge creation. Kant considers ‘concept’ to be an epistemological tool that transforms people’s perceptive, intuitive experiences into knowledge, while Hegel further postulates that ‘concept’ has a broader, ontological meaning: Through concepts, individuals’ experiences are socialized to a collective level, eventually becoming part of the external world which, in turn, to be experienced and learned by other individuals. Specifically, this paper first reviewed the philosophical discussions revolving around ‘concept’ and discussed how creativity is reflected in and can be facilitated through concept generation. We then reviewed the development of artificial intelligence (including LLMs) and mapped it onto the development of human intelligence based on concepts. Eventually, we identified the commonalities and unique strengths of human (providing drive to start and constraints based on their inherent embodiment) and artificial intelligence (carrying out boundless exploration of new concepts to supply potential options for reaching a creative goal) and based on which proposed a hybrid cycle of concept generation as a general framework or working approach to achieve human-AI creativity.",

          "authors": "Marcel Riehle; Jasmin Cromme; Jasmina Rahnavard; Lili Tietgens; Hannah Allmandinger",
          "abstract": "In this preregistered study, we tested competing hypotheses on how social anhedonia is related to the affective response to social interaction: i) diminished forecasting and ii) experience of positive affect, iii) increased forecasting and iv) experience of negative affect. For this, we obtained trait-level measures of social anhedonia and, as covariates, of social anxiety and suspiciousness from N = 100 young adults who engaged in k = 50 dyadic affiliative interactions. We assessed affective forecasting on a day before the interaction and the affective experience during the interaction with five intermittent ratings and via ratings obtained from participants watching replays of their interaction. Controlling for social anxiety and suspiciousness, results showed that social anhedonia was related to diminished positive, not increased negative affect, both in anticipation of and during the social interaction. Negative affect was specifically related to social anxiety. We also found an indirect effect of social anhedonia via diminished experience of positive affect on proxies of social motivation and volition. Exploratory analyses suggested an unexpected comforting effect of social anhedonia on interaction partners’ affect that warrants further inquiry. Limitations include a rather WEIRD sample and that the replay ratings were likely not a valid self-assessment of experienced affect. We conclude that social anhedonia is specifically related to diminished positive affect for social interactions whereas increased negative affect is better explained by co-present social anxiety. Future research should investigate whether these distinct affective trajectories trace back to a common etiological factor.",

          "abstract": "The integration of GenAI into academic workflows represents a fundamental shift in scientific practice. While these tools can amplify productivity, they risk eroding the cognitive foundations of expertise by simulating the very tasks through which scientific competence is developed, from synthesis to experimental design to writing. Uncritical reliance can lead to skill atrophy and AI complacency. We propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills: strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration. These constitute a new form of scientific literacy that builds on traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we show how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy. Without deliberate cultivation of these meta-skills, we risk creating the first generation of researchers who serve their tools rather than direct them.",

          "abstract": "What humans look at and do when freely viewing a scene is not well understood. We show that free-viewing fixations resemble those of observers describing scenes but differ from those of observers counting or searching for objects. Fixations are more often directed toward people and objects whose removal most alters scene interpretation, rather than toward the most salient or meaningfully judged regions (meaning maps), or objects perceived to be grasped or gazed at. Small image changes that modify scene understanding—but not salience or meaning maps—alter fixation patterns. By instructing observers to describe scenes while fixating on objects either relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we demonstrate that free-viewing eye movements are functionally important for accurate scene comprehension. Thus, an important default task during free viewing for the human brain is to comprehend scenes, reflected by frequent eye movements toward people and objects that maximize accurate scene understanding.",

          "authors": "Ellis Cain; Elizabeth Geballe; Tyler Marghetis",
          "abstract": "Many theories of cultural evolution emphasize the influence of repeated transmission. Folktales, myths, and other cultural stories offer a testbed for these theories [1, 2]. In the real world, however, the transmission of a cultural story is often confounded with large-scale changes in linguistic or cultural context, making it difficult to identify the mechanisms of cultural change and stability. Here, to unravel this theoretical tangle, we analyze an unusual natural experiment: due to a misunderstanding, a story attributed to the Russian novelist Tolstoy was translated repeatedly in a full cycle, with the first and final versions published in the same language (English), country (USA), city (Chicago), and decade (1890s) [3]. Since this cycle of cultural transmission began and ended in the same linguistic-cultural context, it offers a unique opportunity to isolate the effects of repeated transmission from the effects of changing the broader sociocultural context. We transformed each version of the story into a high-dimensional trajectory through a shared, multilingual semantic space. We find that the story’s overall shape was preserved throughout the translation cycle. Versions produced within the same linguistic-cultural context, moreover, were especially similar. Each step of the translation process, however, incrementally distorted the story; the final English version was thus more similar to the Russian and French than to the original English, despite both English versions appearing in the same language and location. These findings demonstrate how cultural transmission can preserve complex meanings while introducing incremental changes that reflect both individual-level and broader sociocultural influences. Cultural evolution is shaped both by the transmission process and the broader cultural milieu in which it occurs.",

          "authors": "Hudson Golino",
          "abstract": "Language conveys meaning through structures that range from concrete description to abstract generalization. This study introduces a computational framework for measuring linguistic depth by quantifying the algorithmic complexity of semantic networks derived from large language model embeddings. Building on Piagetian and Vygotskian theories of cognitive development, this study propose that abstraction, whether in thought, measurement, or language, reflects the compression of distributed information into coherent, generative structures. We operationalize this principle using Kolmogorov complexity, K(G), estimated via the compressed length of network edge lists. Simulation studies demonstrate that networks derived from factor-structured data exhibit significantly lower K(G) than density-matched random controls, with separation accuracy reaching 94% as factor loadings strengthen. In a controlled linguistic experiment comparing 100 pairs of abstract and concrete phrases matched for syntax and length, abstract expressions produced consistently lower algorithmic complexity (M = 726) than concrete expressions (M = 784), t(194.41) = -3.28, p = .001, d = -0.46. These findings establish that semantic abstraction manifests as network compressibility, i.e., abstract language achieves conceptual depth through structural regularity rather than elaborative detail. The framework unites psychometric network theory, complexity science, and computational linguistics under a single information-theoretic principle, offering a model-agnostic measure of abstraction applicable across psychological networks, natural language, and neural representations. By formalizing the intuition that profound expression achieves economy through structure, K(G) provides both theoretical insight into how meaning is organized and practical methodology for assessing semantic depth in text, psychological data, and artificial intelligence systems.",

Drawing from qualitative data from over 560 Black Americans’ reports of racially charged medical encounters, Dr. Amanda Almond illustrates how microaggressions rooted in racial stereotypes, size bias, and biological myths of race undermine patient trust and health outcomes. Integrating the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and Bystander Intervention Theory, the framework identifies stage-matched processes for promoting anti-racist action among healthcare providers. A new Decisional Balance Measure is introduced to assess attitudes toward DEI training and align interventions with varying levels of motivation. This readiness-based approach advances DEI beyond compliance by addressing provider ambivalence, fostering accountability, and promoting equitable systems of care rooted in validation, affirmation, and transformation.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental property of human memory is its ability to organize a continuous stream of information into discrete, searchable events. Although empirical work supports hierarchical memory representations in the brain, we lack a formal theory of how humans search this structure. Here, we present a hierarchical model of memory search that unifies a wide range of phenomena under a single framework. By tracking mental contexts at multiple levels, the model captures memory behavior across different timescales, from recalling single lists of information to navigating materials consisting of a series of lists. It explains enhanced recall at list boundaries by proposing a top-down hierarchical search: higher-level contextual cues are retrieved before activating lower-level item information. This mechanism also accounts for recall transition patterns across list boundaries, reproducing effects observed in the event memory literature. Taken together, these results provide a unified account of how humans efficiently organize and search their memories.",

          "abstract": "Early and accurate identification of students who struggle with learning to read is essential for providing timely and effective interventions. This requires universal screening tools that not only produce reliable and valid results across linguistically diverse student populations but also support scalability and allow teachers and clinicians to interpret the results meaningfully. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework for the development and evaluation of linguistically fair universal reading screening tools for use in educational settings. As part of this framework, we consider (i) classification accuracy, (ii) instructional relevance, (iii) clinical utility, and (iv) operational feasibility. We apply this framework and propose a series of reading screening algorithms that accurately predict end-of-year reading risk in English, with sensitivity exceeding 80% in kindergarten and grade 1, and 90% in grade 2. The Spanish algorithm achieves similar sensitivity levels, though kindergarten screening remains more challenging for bilingual students. Notably, the inclusion of oral language and expressive vocabulary measures enhances specificity when administered in students' first language, while these same measures may introduce systematic bias (in the form of reduced specificity) when administered in English to students classified as English learners. While very promising, these findings underscore the critical need for developing and validating reading screeners in languages beyond English, as well as creating comprehensive multilingual screening protocols that leverage students' full linguistic repertoires across all their languages.",

This study evaluates motor, autonomic, affective, and neural, responses during a drum playing task with varied music playing (improvisation vs maintaining the beat) and music accompaniment (live vs recorded) conditions, completed by sixteen survivors of stroke and sixteen neurologically normal control (NC) participants. Motor responses were characterized by total acceleration of hand movements (accelerometry) and wrist flexor activation (electromyography; EMG). Autonomic response was evaluated with tonic response of electrodermal activity (EDA). Affective responses were evaluated with 5-point Likert ratings of pleasure, physical effort, and cognitive challenge. Neural response was evaluated in a subset of eleven stroke and eleven NC participants with fMRI, using region of interest analysis in the supplementary motor area (SMA), upper limb region of the primary motor cortex (M1ul) and ventral striatum (VS). Findings demonstrate that improvisation increased total acceleration, EMG, tonic EDA, and brain activity in the SMA, M1ul and VS. Improvisation and live accompaniment increased pleasure ratings. A composite score of reward-related responses was positively associated with both total acceleration and EMG. Survivors of stroke had higher ratings of physical effort and cognitive challenge compared to NC participants. These findings support the benefit of music improvisation for improving motor response and reward among survivors of stroke. The positive association between reward and motor responses suggests an important role of reward for improving motor performance, which may be beneficial for enhancing stroke rehabilitation outcomes",

Using the context of biases favoring more over less physically attractive people, results found that each intervention was able to reduce some component of discriminatory judgment, and with effects that were similar in magnitude to prior work that tested each strategy within a single study session. These findings demonstrate the potential for such interventions to yield long-term reductions in biased judgements and provide insight into the processes that may create more effective bias-reducing strategies.",

Driving behaviors predicted both overall well-being and specific health domains beyond demographic variables. Physical and social health were most strongly associated with driving variables. Furthermore, we identified several driving signatures of health that were highly specific in their predictions. Finally, including driving variables improved out-of-sample predictive performance relative to a demographic-only model. Overall, these findings position driving behavior as a potential new source of personal sensing that can be leveraged to understand and promote health and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Debates across the behavioral sciences have long examined whether ambiguity avoidance in decision-making reflects stable preferences for certainty or uncertainty in beliefs formed through limited experience. Prior studies have commonly used the max–min expected utility (MMEU) model to interpret ambiguity-related decisions, but MMEU confounds preferences with beliefs by focusing on the range of possible probabilities rather than how individuals form them. We conducted two experiments (N = 53; N = 298) using a Linked Colored Lottery Task to test whether ambiguity avoidance reflects stable preferences or beliefs about outcome distributions. Participants first learned to associate colors with distinct outcome distributions by sampling from them and then made incentivized choices between options that varied in ambiguity. This design allowed us to observe how beliefs about distributional variance influenced decisions and to distinguish whether choices reflected belief construction versus uncertainty evaluation. We compared models based on MMEU and on subjective recursive expected utility (SREU), which explicitly separates beliefs from preferences. In both experiments, model comparison favored SREU, and participants with more dispersed inferred beliefs were more likely to avoid ambiguous options. Sampling patterns and memory for outcomes showed similar effects. Apparent age-related differences in ambiguity avoidance were also better explained by belief variance than by preferences. These results suggest that ambiguity avoidance often reflects perceived imprecision in learned beliefs rather than an inherent aversion to uncertainty, a cognitive rather than affective phenomenon, with implications for understanding decision-making across learning, memory, and uncertainty processing domains.",

Anticlustering most strongly reduced covariate imbalance, followed by rerandomization and minimization. Lower covariate imbalance increased the precision of the effect size estimate. The average statistical power of the unadjusted analysis (independent t-test) was not improved when using covariate-based assignment as compared to random assignment. However, with random assignment, the statistical power of the unadjusted analysis depended on observed covariate imbalance; with covariate-based assignment, the statistical power of the unadjusted analysis was less affected by covariate imbalance because imbalance was minimized.

However, few scientific studies have been conducted in France to quantify the level of physical literacy, especially among children. Ninety-nine fifth-grade students (Avrillé, Maine-et-Loire) were assessed using the CAPL-2 scale across the following dimensions: physical (i.e., aerobic capacity, motor skills, trunk muscle strength), behavioural (i.e., physical activity level), affective (i.e., motivation and confidence), and cognitive (i.e., knowledge and understanding). CAPL-2 total scores, combinations of CAPL-2 subscores by sex and combinations of movement behaviour metrics across physical literacy profiles (‘Beginning’, ‘Progressing’, ‘Achieving’, ‘Excelling’) were compared using nonparametric analyses. Boys appeared stochastically superior to girls for CAPL-2 total score (P = 0.002). Boys and girls differed in terms of combinations of scores related to the CAPL-2 dimensions (P = 0.005), with scores that were generally stochastically superior for boys, specifically regarding affective dimension. Physical literacy profiles differed in terms of combinations of movement behaviour metrics (P &lt; 0.001), in particular when considering step-based metrics and percentage of wear time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. These exploratory results encourage to conduct studies that would severely test sex differences in CAPL-2 scores and physical literacy profiles differences in movement behaviour metrics.",

          "abstract": "Recent meta-analyses and large-scale longitudinal studies have shown that the mean-levels and rank-orders of personality traits change throughout the lifespan. However, people differ from each other in their patterns of personality development. These individual differences in personality trait changes provide important insight into the sources and course of personality development. The present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of individual differences in personality trait changes and their fluctuation across time and age by integrating findings from 229 longitudinal studies (N = 230,492). Results indicated significant individual differences in change in all traits, with neuroticism showing the most pronounced differences, and openness and agreeableness the least. Charting effects across the lifespan, individual differences in change were most pronounced in childhood, decreased during young adulthood, but were significant across the entire lifespan. The age at which individual differences in change were smallest varied across traits, from ages 30 to 75. Finally, individual differences in personality trait changes were larger over longer assessment intervals, for facet-level traits, and among measures that were not designed to examine the Big Five taxonomy. Our findings support theoretical claims that highlight the relevance of genetic and environmental sources of personality development and suggest that individual differences in change endure, challenging the predictions of set-point models of personality development. Moreover, our results provide benchmarks for individual differences in change that can be used to compare the magnitude of differential personality development in future research.",

          "abstract": "Irritability and anhedonia are two prevalent, co-occurring, and impairing symptoms of major depression that are proposed to result from dysfunctions in reward processing. While irritability is associated with heightened sensitivity to reward receipt, anhedonia is linked to blunted sensitivity to reward receipt. Given these supposed paradoxical effects on reward sensitivity, it is noteworthy that no studies have examined how both symptoms interact to affect reward sensitivity. In a community sample of young adults (N=73, Mage=21.21±2.27, 56.16% females), we evaluated the interacting effects of dimensionally-assessed irritability and anhedonia symptoms on neural (i.e., event-related potentials and time-frequency) measures of reward and loss sensitivity during the Doors task, a well-known reward paradigm. We used univariate and multivariate (based on generalized eigendecomposition) approaches to isolate patterns of delta and theta activity in response to reward and loss. Linear-mixed models tested the unique and interacting effects of irritability and anhedonia on EEG measures of reward sensitivity (FRN/N2, theta, and delta power). Participants with above-average irritability and anhedonia displayed larger (more negative) FRN/N2 amplitudes across feedback valence, and reduced theta power following reward feedback, whereas no associations were observed at lower symptom levels. These effects remained significant when controlling for broader depressive symptoms, gender, and income. These findings provide preliminary evidence of an interactive effect of anhedonia and irritability on neural sensitivity to feedback in individuals without clinical levels of symptoms. Awaiting validation in clinical samples, our results highlight the importance of considering symptom interactions to better understand reward-related mechanisms in depression.",

This longitudinal study investigates how stress-related vulnerabilities and relationship dynamics contribute to psychological, physical, and sexual IPV victimisation in Brazil and the United Kingdom (UK). Drawing on the Vulnerability-Stress-Adaptation (VSA) model, we examined how individual differences (e.g., attachment orientation), mate-retention tactics (benefit-provisioning and cost-inflicting strategies), and COVID-19-related-stressors (e.g., impact, uncertainty) predict IPV over time (i.e., at two time points, one month apart). Findings revealed that all forms of IPV decreased over time but were more prevalent in the UK than in Brazil. COVID-19 uncertainty and the use of cost-inflicting mate-retention strategies were positively associated with IPV, particularly in the UK. Country significantly moderated several associations: avoidant attachment and cost-inflicting strategies were positively linked to IPV in Brazil, but negatively or weakly associated in the UK. Similarly, COVID-19 uncertainty predicted IPV more strongly in the UK during Wave 1, while in Brazil the associations persisted across both waves. These results highlight the need for context-sensitive IPV interventions and show how interpersonal vulnerabilities interact with societal stress to affect relationship harm across cultures.",

The present study explored this hypothesis by contrasting the effects of two conventional and two unconventional (sham) hypnotic inductions on hypnotic experiences and electrophysiological correlates. \nIn a 2x2 balanced placebo design, all participants were exposed to four conditions: conventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, conventional induction labeled as “control”, unconventional induction labeled as “hypnosis”, and unconventional induction labeled as “control”. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. We computed EEG features that were identified in previous studies as correlates of hypnosis or hypnotizability.\nConsistent with the predictions of expectancy theory, we found that one of the unconventional (sham) inductions, “white noise hypnosis”, evoked comparable hypnosis depth to the conventional hypnotic inductions. However, contrary to its predictions, “embedded hypnosis”, another unconventional induction, evoked smaller hypnosis depth reports than the other three inductions. \nMost EEG features we explored did not differ between conventional and unconventional induction conditions. A possible exception is frontal theta activity, which appeared to increase more in conventional induction trials. The change in frontal gamma power negatively correlated with hypnosis depth, and occipital theta activity positively correlated with hypnotizability in both conventional and unconventional inductions. \nOverall, our results provide partial support for the expectancy theory of hypnosis. However, our findings should be considered exploratory. Confirmatory research is required to strengthen our confidence in these effects.",

Remarkably, retention with fluent texts was similar across WMC levels, while, counterintuitively, higher WMC descriptively predicted lower comprehension. This data pattern underlying their significant interactions is noteworthy and based on a small sample. Due to researchers’ degrees of freedom in analytical decisions, we explored the replicability and analytical robustness of the primary findings by modeling different subjective choices in the analytical approach via multiverse analysis. In our (pre-registered) direct replication in the laboratory (N = 220) disfluency, WMC, and their interaction showed null effects on retention, comprehension, and transfer across all multiverse specifications, including when WMC was operationalized via OSPAN. This reflects a consistent lack of (analytical) replicability.\nKeywords: disfluency, working memory capacity, operation span task, ATI-study",

          "abstract": "Context has been theoretically proposed to exert greater impact on face emotion processing when expressions are ambiguous. However, evidence for such ‘context-weighting’ as a function of expression ambiguity is very limited. We investigated the presence of context-weighting using emotive sentence cues that provided a predictive context for a neutral face that changed expression in response. Emotional expressions were either congruent or incongruent with the sentence cue. To modulate expression ambiguity we manipulated expression intensity: low (80%-intensity) and high (20%-intensity) ambiguity in Experiments 1a/b using angry and happy faces, with medium ambiguity (50%-intensity) added in Experiment 2 using disgust and sad faces. Participants categorised the face emotion. Across all experiments error rates were lower when face expressions were congruent vs. incongruent with the predictive context; crucially congruency effects were larger when expressions were more ambiguous, thus indicating greater context-weighting. Drift Diffusion Modelling revealed that this effect was underpinned by use of predictive context to improve the efficiency of face expression evidence accumulation. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence that emotion perception is based on flexible integration of both face and prior context within a predictive processing framework, with the degree of context-weighting determined by the level of expression ambiguity.",

However, patterns of such self- and child-focused emotion regulation (ER) and their associations with parental exhaustion, children’s internalizing problems, children’s academic achievement, and parent–child relationships remain unexplored. Our preregistered three-wave online study targeted U.S. parents of sixth–ninth graders (N = 1,046; 52% mothers; Mage = 43.22). We employed latent profile analyses and latent transition analyses. Results revealed three profiles of parental self- and child-focused ER strategies, stable across a 4-month timeframe: Reappraisers (T1 ≈ 9%, T2 ≈ 7%) showed high use of self- and child-focused reappraisal, self-ruminators (T1 ≈ 25%, T2 ≈ 31%) reported high self-focused rumination and low use of other strategies, and average regulators (T1 ≈ 66%, T2 ≈ 62%) showed moderate use of all strategies. In addition, reappraisers reported the lowest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the highest parent–child relationship closeness. By contrast, self-ruminators reported the highest levels of parental exhaustion and children’s internalizing problems and the lowest parent–child relationship closeness. However, profile membership did not predict children’s academic achievement. The study provides important insights into distinct subgroups of parents on the basis of their combined use of self- and child-focused ER strategies, highlighting the differential impacts of these strategies on parental well-being and child outcomes.

          "abstract": "Adulthood is often inferred from age and the attainment of milestones such as marriage, parenthood, and career. Yet, personality traits are likely associated with whether we feel like adults and how we evaluate adulthood. Here we tested associations between personality and perceptions of adulthood in a UK sample (N = 714, age 18-77 years, MAge = 39.30). Regression analyses indicated that subjective adult status, or feeling like an adult, was predicted by low Neuroticism and high Conscientiousness. Personality independently explained 27% of variance in subjective adult status. Older age and being a parent also significantly predicted subjective adult status. Endorsement of the Markers of Adulthood scale (MoA) subscales had mixed predictors, as the role transitions, independence, and legality markers subscales were predicted by high Neuroticism and low Openness, whereas endorsement of the relative maturity subscale was predicted by high Openness and high Conscientiousness. These results illustrate the presence of individual differences in perceptions of adulthood, and that personality shapes whether we see ourselves as adults, and how we define adulthood. Findings have implications for research on perceptions of adulthood and life outcomes, arguing for the inclusion of personality as a covariate in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Presentation of an auditory click-train before a stimulus leads to the relative overestimation of stimulus duration. This is thought to be due to an increase in the rate of the pacemaker (inferred from the slope when estimates are regressed against stimulus duration) of an internal clock, said to be triggered by physiological arousal. Work with emotional stimuli suggests similar temporal dilations, and there is (mixed) evidence suggesting this effect may be due to physiological arousal. We therefore aimed to test the assertion that click trains increase duration estimates due to increased physiological arousal. We compared estimates of tone durations following negative sounds, neutral sounds, click trains, and silence, while recording pupil size and heart rate as measures of arousal. Contrary to click train literature, estimates did not significantly differ following any of the stimulation types, possibly due to large trial baseline periods. However, pupil size change was significantly higher during negative and neutral sounds than both click trains and silence, and higher during click trains than silence. Heart rate change was higher during negative sounds than click trains. Finally, while pupil size change did not correlate with estimation slopes, heart rate change correlated with estimation slopes for neutral sounds and click trains (significantly) and negative sounds and silence (moderate and anecdotal Bayes factors respectively). In conclusion, there was evidence to suggest that click trains increased physiological arousal (pupil size) compared to silence, and that higher arousal (heart rate) during click trains correlates with estimation slopes (pacemaker rate) following click trains.",

          "abstract": "Trains of auditory clicks increase subsequent judgements of stimulus duration by approximately 10%. Scalar timing theory suggests this is due to a 10% increase in pacemaker rate, a main component of the internal clock. The effect has been demonstrated in many timing tasks, including verbal estimation, temporal generalisation, and temporal bisection. However, the effect of click trains has yet to be examined on temporal sensitivity, commonly measured by temporal difference thresholds. We sought to investigate this both experimentally; where we found no significant increase in temporal sensitivity, and computationally; by modelling the temporal difference threshold task according to scalar timing theory. Our experimental null result presented three possibilities which we investigated by simulating a 10% increase in pacemaker rate in a newly-created scalar timing theory model of thresholds. We found that a 10% increase in pacemaker rate led to a significant improvement in temporal sensitivity in only 8.66% of 10,000 simulations. When a 74% increase in pacemaker rate was modelled to simulate the filled-duration illusion, temporal sensitivity was significantly improved in 55.36% of simulations. Therefore, scalar timing theory does predict improved temporal sensitivity for a faster pacemaker, but the effect of click trains (a supposed 10% increase) appears to be too small to be reliably found in the temporal difference threshold task.",

In the set of three studies, we explored how the general public (study 1) and a pro-environmentally engaged group (study 2) perceive different pro-environmental collective actions and how support for these is associated with political beliefs, including right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and environmental identification (study 3). In Study 1 conducted on a representative national sample (N = 530), we assessed perceptions of 97 diverse climate-related actions across six dimensions: general affect, non-normativity, use of violence, effectiveness, perceived legality, and willingness to engage. We identified four clusters of actions: positively assessed (e.g., publishing literature), moderately assessed (e.g., political mourning), negatively assessed (e.g., organizing demonstrations), and very negatively assessed (e.g., vandalizing artworks). In Study 2, we checked and compared how these behaviours were evaluated on the same dimensions by the environmentally engaged group (N=49). Pro-environmental sample perceived collective actions generally more favourably than the general sample on all dimensions except for effectiveness, where no significant differences were present. Study 3 (representative national sample, N = 1016) revealed that support for the most moderate actions (Cluster 1) was negatively associated with RWA and SDO and positively associated with environmental identification. Similar associations were observed for Clusters 2 and 3. In contrast, support for the most radical actions (Cluster 4) was positively associated with SDO and negatively with environmental identification, showing no significant relationship with RWA. These findings indicate that the relationships between the variables and support for radical climate actions differ significantly from those for moderate environmental actions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Social cognition is essential for forming and maintaining intimate relationships. Individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment (CM) often show impairments in interpersonal functioning, including trust and romantic attachment. The oxytocin system has been implicated in social behavior, yet the role of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression in CM-related social functioning remains insufficiently understood. This study examined the impact of CM on social cognition in a large web-based sample and explored the association between CM and OXTR gene expression in a well-characterized clinical cohort.\nMethods: Both studies were preregistered (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/KNC2X), and data and code are available at OSF (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4DZWK). Study 1 assessed the relationship between CM severity, interpersonal trust, and romantic attachment in a web-based sample (N = 252). Participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Generalized Trust Scale, a behavioral distrust game, and the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire. Study 2 analyzed OXTR gene expression in peripheral blood samples from N = 92 CM-exposed individuals and examined associations with self-reported CM severity. Exploratory analyses additionally included measures of interpersonal sensitivity, social functioning, and maladaptive personality traits.\nResults: In Study 1, greater CM severity was significantly associated with lower interpersonal trust (both self-reported and behavioral), and with higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. In Study 2, no significant association was found between CM severity and OXTR gene expression in blood. However, exploratory analyses revealed that CM severity was associated with social interaction difficulties, while OXTR gene expression was associated with the maladaptive personality trait of detachment.\nConclusions: The findings highlight robust associations between CM and impairments in trust as well as insecure romantic attachment. Although no direct link was found between CM and OXTR expression, future research should investigate gene–environment interactions using larger samples and alternative tissue sources. Interventions targeting trust and attachment processes may offer promising avenues to improve relational functioning in individuals with a history of CM.",

While extensive research has examined how memory limitations affect recall, far less is known about how these limitations influence decisions in new situations, which depend on generalizing from incomplete or distorted memories. We introduce a computational model of \"forgetful generalization\", integrating similarity-based generalization with variable-precision memory modulated by recency and asymmetric surprise. In a preregistered spatially correlated bandit experiment, we manipulated (within-subject) whether past observations remained visible (low load) or disappeared (high load). Greater memory load increased \"forgetfulness\", as captured by parameters indexing recency- and surprise-dependent decay of memory precision. These parameters also predicted individual working memory capacity and explained differences in performance and search patterns. By formalizing how generalization operates under limited memory, our model links episodic reinforcement learning to theories of adaptive memory compression and resource rationality.",

Semi-structured interviews with six Japanese adults in their 20s–40s revealed that 13 of the 21 draft-translated PBAT items required linguistic revision, and some expressions were unfamiliar to Japanese laypeople.

The 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) is widely used to measure shared decision-making (SDM) across clinical settings, but no study so far has synthesized its psychometric properties. Purpose. We systematically reviewed and synthesized psychometric evidence of the SDM-Q-9. Data Sources. MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and CINAHL. Study Selection. Original studies in English or German, providing any information on psychometric properties of the SDM-Q-9 considering all possible interpretations and constructs measured by the instrument. Data Extraction. Details on study design, sample characteristics, and any information on psychometric evidence were extracted. Data Synthesis. 83 studies were included, with 73 articles contributing evidence on validity, 46 on reliability, and 3 on fairness. We found a high amount of psychometric evidence on validity and reliability of the SDM-Q-9, interpreting the score as SDM perceived by the patient. Evidence is lacking for other interpretations and fairness. Notable is the weak association of the SDM-Q-9 with physician-rated SDM. Conclusions. The SDM-Q-9 is highly reliable and valid for the subjectively experienced level of SDM by the patient. Further research is needed on alternative interpretations, and on fairness of the measure.",

While PS is established in the inpatient setting in Switzerland, it is rarely available in outpatient settings. \n\nAim: To evaluate the implementation of PS within Swiss community mental health nursing (CMHN) teams, focusing on its content and impact, as well as the factors contributing to its successful implementation and the potential barriers.  \n\nMethod: We conducted a qualitative, participatory study using implementation research principles in three CMHN teams. Data collection included interviews with managers, peer support workers (PSW), and nurses, along with participant observations. Findings were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. This article follows SRQR guidelines.\n\nResults: Clients and staff reported high satisfaction with PSWs but PS was only implemented at the client level. Challenges included unclear job descriptions, low PSW working hours, limited understanding of PS, and financial constraints.\n\nDiscussion: There was a lack of adequate training on PS and recovery. PSW were seen somewhat external by the CMHN teams which weakened integration.  \n\nConclusion: Aligning with best practice guidelines, our findings suggest that successful implementation of PS requires standardized PSW training, financial recognition, comprehensive team training and internal efforts on PSW team integration.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The community setting represents a key environment for the provision of mental health care. Community mental health nurses (CMHNs) play a vital role in delivering person-centred care in outpatient settings. But they are not only essential providers of care but also key actors in coordinating and integrating support across fragmented systems. However, the specific tasks and contributions of CMHNs—particularly those in advanced practice roles—remain insufficiently defined in the literature.\nAim: To synthesise and thematically analyse international research on the tasks and activities of CMHNs, including those attributed to advanced practice nurses (APNs).\nMethods: An integrative review was conducted using systematic searches in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and selected publisher databases. Studies published between 2008 and 2024 in English or German were included. Thematic analysis followed Braun and Clarke’s six-step approach. The review adheres to ENTREQ guidelines and is registered with the Open Science Framework.\nResults: Thirty-seven studies were included. CMHNs perform a wide range of tasks across seven domains: direct care, care coordination, health promotion, education, leadership, management, and research. APNs were particularly active in leadership and service development. However, distinctions between generalist and advanced roles were often unclear.\nConclusion: CMHNs provide complex, person-centred care across diverse settings and contribute to integrated, interprofessional mental health care. APNs contribute additional system-level competencies. The findings support educators, policymakers, and workforce planners in understanding current nursing practices and identifying development needs especially in countries where community mental health nursing and advanced practice roles are not yet widely established.",

          "abstract": "Although terms such as neurodivergent and neurodiverse are increasingly used in policy, education, and workplace settings, little is known about whether the people these terms describe endorse these collective identities. This study examined how 740 adults with autism (n = 189), ADHD (n = 190), dyslexia (n = 179), or co-occurring Autism+ADHD (n = 182) identified with their diagnostic and broader “neurodivergent” identity. Participants completed measures of diagnostic and neurodivergent identity and provided open-text response to what a neurodiversity identity meant to them. Quantitative analyses revealed that while diagnostic and neurodivergent identities were positively related, endorsement of the superordinate identity was modest overall and uneven across groups. Autism+ADHD participants reported the strongest identification, while dyslexic participants reported the weakest. Subscale analyses reflect lower normative and comparative fit of the neurodivergent identity across groups. Qualitative findings highlighted shared understandings of neurodivergence as “difference, not deficit,” but also supported the findings of poor fit, with some participants describing the identity as overly broad, limiting relevance. For some dyslexic participants, neurodiversity described other groups (e.g., Autism, ADHD). Together, these findings suggest that while the idea of a shared neurodivergent identity offers potential for solidarity, it is not yet a widely resonant or unifying identity.",

          "authors": "Connor Spiech; Mario Gómez Martínez; Giorgio Lazzari; Virginia Penhune",
          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1). Non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and groove before and after stimulation. Following inhibitory stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the SMA may have disinhibited the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA and V1 play critical roles in embodied rhythm processing.",

          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music, termed “groove,” is thought to arise from the tension between top-down metric expectations or predictions and rhythmic complexity. Specifically, groove ratings are highest for moderately complex rhythms, balancing expectation and surprise. To test this, meter and rhythmic complexity need to be manipulated independently to assess their impact on groove. Thus, we compared Western listeners’ ratings for musical clips of varying rhythmic complexity composed in either the most common Western meter (4/4) or less common meters (e.g., 7/8). In several behavioral studies (Experiment 1, N = 143; Experiment 2, N = 120; Experiment 3, N = 120), we used Bayesian regression to show that groove is greatest for moderately complex rhythms, but only in 4/4. In non-4/4 meters, simpler rhythms elicited the greatest groove. This provides support for the theory that bottom-up rhythmic features interact with meter in a way that shapes the pleasurable urge to move to music.",

Compared to the control, all messages were equally effective at increasing belief in climate change’s impact on extreme weather, support for government action, and worry about extreme weather and climate change. However, participants were more willing to share the ‘neutral content + emotionally-delivered’ message than the same message delivered in a neutral tone.

Method: Participants completed measures of eating disorder symptoms, internal and external shame, childhood trauma, maladaptive personality, mentalisation, emotion regulation, alexithymia, and broader psychopathological domains, including anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, insomnia, psychosis, dissociation, and suicidality. Results: Moderate to severe emotional abuse was reported by 35.4% of participants, physical abuse by 21.6%, and sexual abuse by 17.8%, and participants were grouped accordingly. Across groups, internal shame, and to a lesser extent external shame, emerged as central nodes, densely interconnected with core eating disorder symptoms such as drive for thinness, bulimia, and body dissatisfaction. Emotion regulation and awareness, together with eating disorder-specific and self-concept variables, served as bridges between communities, linking eating disorder pathology with maladaptive personality traits and broader psychopathological domains. Network comparison tests indicated no significant differences in global structure, edge weights, or centrality indices across trauma groups. Discussion: These findings underscore the central role of shame in eating disorder psychopathology and suggest that trauma-informed interventions should prioritise shame reduction while strengthening emotion regulation and mentalisation capacities.",

          "abstract": "Discovering computational models that explain human cognition and behavior remains a central goal of cognitive science, yet the reliance on hand-crafted equations limits the range of cognitive mechanisms that can be uncovered. We introduce SPICE (Sparse, Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework that automates the discovery of mechanistically interpretable cognitive models directly from behavioral data. SPICE fits recurrent neural networks to capture latent cognitive dynamics and then applies sparse equation discovery to extract concise mathematical expressions describing those dynamics. Theory-guided priors make the approach data- and compute-efficient, while a hierarchical design reveals individual differences in the algorithmic structure of cognitive dynamics rather than in parameters alone. In simulations, SPICE accurately recovered the structure and parameters of known reinforcement learning models. Applied to human behavior in a two-armed bandit task, it uncovered new equations that outperformed existing models and revealed structural alterations in reinforcement learning mechanisms among participants with depression, such as a loss of nonlinear exploration dynamics regulating behavioral flexibility. This approach provides systematic insights into structural individual differences in cognitive mechanisms and establishes a foundation for automated discovery of interpretable behavioral models.",

Participants from culturally adjacent regions reported similar emotional experiences, with clear differences between culturally disparate regions such as South America, Asia, and Europe. People’s emotional experiences became more similar with age among peers but differed across generations. Women and men reported similar experiences, particularly among older groups. In contrast, the average facial expressions evoked when people reported the same experience were highly consistent across countries, sexes, and ages. Together, these findings indicate that while emotional experience is shaped by cultural and demographic factors, facial expression remains relatively conserved across populations, suggesting a shared structure for how emotions are displayed even when they are experienced differently.",

In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

          "abstract": "By exploring the boundaries of systems, we learn about their capacities and their forms. We believe that studying edge cases of what human cognition can do is an important supplement to studying prototypical human cognition. This paper describes a class of experiences we call  induced sensory experiences, which we think are (1) rare, (2) trainable, and (3) singularly effective in certain kinds of problem solving. People consistently report non-drug-induced hallucination-like experiences in religious and spiritual contexts. These sensory experiences are often induced through explicit training and practice designed, in part, to invoke them. Here, we report the results of a survey extending this phenomenon to the case of professional and highly trained mathematicians. We document the prevalence of  powerful, sensory or quasi-sensory experiences of non-physical objects.  In short, we find them to be extremely common: Individual mathematicians nearly universally describe experiences and activities that closely match the pattern of induced sensory experiences. These sensory experiences can be seen as an achievement of mathematical thinking: they tend to develop with time and experience in a domain, and many participants find them to be unique in some way to mathematical thinking. These experiences were not reported to be rare. Mathematicians reported having meaningful amounts of control over their visualization.  Finally, explicit belief in the ‘reality’ of these objects was largely unrelated to any measures of sensory vividness or control. Altogether, we believe this work demonstrates how humans are able to build complex and abstract reasoning out of sensorimotor components through extensive training.",

          "abstract": "Mental health stigma is defined by the negative attitudes, stereotyping beliefs, and discrimination affecting the social experiences of individuals facing mental health conditions. Ethnic minority communities in the United States face a disproportionately greater stigma than the majority White group. Stigma can manifest in discourse concerning mental health on social media platforms. While previous studies have used social media to explore mental health, little qualitative social media research has been conducted to gain an understanding of stigma in ethnic minorities. This study used a qualitative content analysis design to explore mental health discussion forums on Reddit. By analyzing 150 posts from three different subreddits representing three communities with varying ethnic compositions, eight themes surrounding stigma were identified. From the Asian-American subreddit, family-based prejudice, culture-based self-stigma, and stigmatization of therapy were found. Posts from the Black mental health subreddit demonstrated culture-based prejudice affecting Black males, stigma influenced by systemic biases, and religion as an influence on culture-based prejudice. Supportive community norms and depressive self-stigma were found in the last subreddit, a group without ethnic specifications. The deep understanding of ethnic mental health stigma achieved in this study can equip the development of interventions addressing this phenomenon. Future research should concern a broader array of online communities, mental illnesses, and ethnic groups.",

          "authors": "Annabel Dare Gereau; Neil Mulligan",
          "abstract": "Retrieval practice improves memory compared to strategies such as restudying and is thought to do so in at least two ways — the direct testing effect (improved memory for tested material) and the forward testing effect (improved memory for material learned after a practice test). Recent research implies that many studies of “the testing effect”, though usually defined in terms of the direct testing effect, conflate direct and forward testing effects (Mulligan et al., 2022). This motivates a new meta-analysis on testing effects with free recall that distinguishes between studies capable of isolating the direct effect of testing (direct studies) from those susceptible to both direct and forward testing effects (mixed studies). The results show that the large majority (67%) of the “testing effects” are from mixed studies, confounding direct and forward testing effects, and only 33% are from direct studies, with mixed studies producing larger testing effects than direct studies. Furthermore, the mixed studies differed in terms of whether the purported forward testing contribution should act to increase, decrease, or have an intermediate effect on the observed testing effect. The effect sizes differed across the mixed subtypes confirming this characterization of the mixed effects as a confounded mixture of forward and direct testing effects. Separate moderation analyses were conducted for the direct and mixed effects further indicating differences between the two population of effects. The literature on the testing effect is not a coherent body and does not clearly tell us about a specific memory phenomenon. Rather, it is a mixture of direct and forward testing effects, in which the forward component sometimes increases, sometimes decreases, and sometimes has an intermediate influence on the observed testing effect.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether robot interaction modality significantly affects human acceptance by analyzing 30 studies representing 1,944 participants across eight acceptance sub-dimensions. Using psychometric meta-analytic methods with corrections for sampling error and measurement unreliability, we found no significant overall effect of robot representation type on acceptance (r² = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.16, k = 25). Non-significant effects emerged across acceptance sub-dimensions including attitude, trust, social presence, intention to use, perceived enjoyment, anxiety, and actual use, with effect sizes ranging from -0.13 to 0.16. Moderator analyses examining representation type (screen-based versus virtual reality), contextual factors (field of application, human role), and measurement type (objective versus subjective) failed to explain the moderate to high heterogeneity observed across studies. Publication bias assessment revealed relative symmetry, and risk of bias evaluation indicated moderate robustness across included studies. These findings challenge the embodiment hypothesis in human-robot interaction, suggesting physical co-presence may not provide presumed advantages over virtual representations, and support investigating when rather than if differences between robot modalities emerge.",

          "abstract": "While mental imagery and music reward have each been studied extensively, their interrelationship remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether individual differences in imagery vividness are linked to the capacity to experience music as rewarding. Across 4 experiments, we examined the relationship between imagery vividness and sensitivity to music reward. Experiment 1 (N=1342) showed a significant correlation between sensitivity to musical reward and visual imagery vividness. Experiment 2 replicated the association in an independent sample (N=84). Experiment 3 compared individuals with aphantasia (inability to form mental images; N=25) to controls (N=25), finding lower sensitivity to musical reward among aphantasics. Strikingly, 44% of the aphantasics also met criteria for music anhedonia (i.e., inability to experience music reward), whereas only 12% of control participants showed similar deficits in music reward. In experiment 4 (N=19), aphantasics who were music anhedonics (N=7) reported reduced auditory imagery vividness and fewer, shorter involuntary musical imagery experiences (i.e., earworms) compared to aphantasics without music anhedonia (N=12). Moreover, all aphantasics with music anhedonia met the criteria for anauralia (i.e., inability to form auditory imagery). These results show a robust link between visual imagery vividness and sensitivity to musical reward, and suggest that auditory imagery plays a key role in the experience of music reward. As music unfolds over time, impaired auditory imagery may weaken retention of musical sequences in auditory working memory, and disrupt the formation of musical expectations, a process critical for music reward.",

          "abstract": "For decades, advancements in understanding and treating mental illness have been hindered by a categorical psychiatric nosology that fails to describe and explain how symptoms emerge and relate to one another. In response, two separate initiatives have contributed to a renewed sense of optimism for scientific and translational discovery. First, quantitative models of psychopathology improve clinical description by relying on empirical data to provide a more accurate representation of the structure of mental illness. Chief among these approaches is the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP), which organizes psychopathology based on patterns of symptom covariation observed across numerous studies. In parallel, computational psychiatry seeks to identify neurocognitive processes that give rise to psychopathology and leverage them to forecast important clinical and functional outcomes. Here, we highlight points of convergence and complementarity between HiTOP and computational psychiatry and propose further integration. HiTOP provides an empirically based approach to understanding the structure of psychopathology, but lacks strong explanations of how symptom dimensions are connected to underlying neurocognitive processes. Conversely, computational psychiatry’s emphasis on cognitive processes and multivariate prediction make it well-suited to linking lower level dynamics with symptom variability. Yet, many contemporary computational psychiatry findings lack specificity and validity as a result of a continued reliance on categorical diagnoses. We conclude by highlighting potential barriers that will need to be addressed to maximize the productivity of future collaborative efforts between these initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Because most validated personality measures were designed to capture relatively general and stable characteristics, they do not specify a particular timeframe for respondents to consider. It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widespread and can lead to deleterious societal outcomes, yet little research has examined how they are learned. In associative learning, blocking occurs when people learn less about a novel cue in the presence of another causally predictive cue. Here, blocking was examined in a conspiratorial context. In the task, participants were told about a foreign politician and a possible conspiracy: This politician had allegedly been poisoned at a given location. Participants were then presented with a set of pairing between locations and illness; the conspiracy-congruent location was always presented together with a novel location. Learning about this novel location was blocked by the conspiracy-congruent location and, on aggregate, participants endorsed the conspiracy theory. There was, however, no evidence that conspiracy theorists were more likely to demonstrate blocking in general. Conspiracies can thus be acquired and maintained through similar associative-learning processes as other beliefs.",

In recent years, researchers have expanded the study of social impression formation beyond impressions of a single individual and towards how we form impressions of multiple individuals through observing their interactions with each other. Mimicry, as a ubiquitous phenomenon of nonverbal social interaction, is very likely to play a part in the formation of such encounter-based impressions of multiple others. The mimicry and action response video library (MARVL) aims at expanding the possibilities of researchers to study third-party inferences based on observing behavioral mimicry and other nonverbal action-response patterns in dyadic interactions. It provides a set of interaction videos of multiple dyads, both male and female, addresses relevant confounds, and features movements both within and across effector systems (arm and leg movements). A planned set of studies that will be reported in following iterations of this preprint will aim to validate the MARVL and enable its use in studies on observed mimicry, action-response patterns, as well as social impression formation more generally.",

          "abstract": "This study examines emotional tone and linguistic framing in newspaper reports of violent crime, specifically in their evolution across two distinct periods (1995-2000 and 2020-2025) in the UK and USA. Using a mixed-methods design, 560 articles were analysed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool, followed by critical discursive psychology (CDP) on a stratified subset of the data (N = 12). An exploratory factor analysis identified three linguistic factors: Social Moral Framing (SM), Evaluative Structure (ES), and Personal Expressiveness (PE) which were used to predict emotional tone through cross-temporal hierarchical regression. Quantitative results showed ES and PE to consistently predict emotional tone in both timeframes, whereas SM to be the strongest predictor only in the contemporary/later time frame. The qualitative analysis highlighted that recent reporting prioritises moralised and emotionally-charged narratives, with the origin country and political leaning influencing both the style and framing of information. The findings show a shift towards personalised and empathetic coverage from the earlier to the later time periods, providing implications for support regarding rehabilitation, public perceptions of crime, and punitive attitudes. Thus, the dual role of media is prevalent, as an informer and influencer, emphasising the need for ethically responsible reporting that considers psychological and societal impacts of violent crime narratives.",

          "abstract": "Background: Community Mental Health Nursing (CMHN) has gained importance in Switzerland as part of a broader shift toward community-based psychiatric care. While CMHN services are increasingly implemented, empirical evidence on their effectiveness in reducing psychiatric hospitalisations remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the effect of CMHN on psychiatric hospitalisations and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation during CMHN care.\nMethods: We conducted a naturalistic observational study using data from two linked national databases: the HomeCareData register and the Medical Statistics of hospitals. The study included adults who were admitted to CMHN services between January 2020 and December 2022 and whose data was documented in HomeCareData. With mirror-image methods we compared psychiatric hospitalisation rates in equally long pre-index and post-index periods, defined by each individual’s duration of CMHN care, with each participant serving as their own control. The start of CMHN care was defined as the index date. For a sensitivity analysis individuals hospitalized within 60 days before start of CMHN were excluded to address potential regression to the mean effects. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors of hospitalisation during CMHN care.\nResults: The study sample comprised 5,252 individuals with a mean age of 52 years; 66% were female. The primary mirror-image analysis revealed a significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalisations following the start of CMHN (unadjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.60; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.55–0.65). No significant effect was observed in the sensitivity analysis (unadjusted Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.97; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.87–1.09). Multivariable logistic regression identified previous psychiatric hospitalisations and compulsory admissions as significant risk factors of hospitalisation during CMHN care. Sociodemographic and diagnostic variables showed no significant associations.\nConclusions: This is the first study to show a reduction of psychiatric hospitalisations after participation in CMHN services in Switzerland. However, this effect was not confirmed in the sensitivity analysis which may suggest a regression-to-the mean effect. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using linked routine data to evaluate real-world mental health interventions and underscores the need for broader data coverage and improved documentation to strengthen future research.",

The unprecedented scale and reliance on information disseminated through these systems substantially expand the scope of information-based influence that can both enable and undermine sound decision-making. Consequently, understanding and protecting decision-making today faces growing challenges, as individuals and organizations must navigate evolving opportunities and information-based threats across varied domains and information environments. While these risks are widely recognized, research remains fragmented: work evaluating information-based threat phenomena has progressed largely in isolation from foundational studies of human information processing. In this review, we synthesize insights from both domains to identify shared cognitive mechanisms that mediate vulnerability to information-based threats and shape behavioral outcomes. Finally, we outline directions for future research aimed at integrating these perspectives, emphasizing the importance of such integration for mitigating human vulnerabilities and aligning human-machine representations.",

          "abstract": "Cognition is not a static process but is subject to substantial and meaningful variation within individuals over time. This has led to an increase in studies that aim to describe cognition in daily life by sampling participants repeatedly and remotely. Such studies, which we call high-frequency cognitive assessment or HFCA, tend to use a limited number of brief cognitive tests. This focus on a small number of tests leaves open questions concerning the psychometric characteristics of a wide array of cognitive tasks useful for HFCA that can guide researchers on appropriate task selection. We developed the Cognitive Variability Battery (CVB) a series of 9 cognitive tests clustered into three distinct cognitive domains, attentional control, processing speed, and episodic memory. CVB was administered to participants 3 times per day for 3 weeks. Cognitive tests were rotated to reduce the length of any single testing session. Each test was administered up to 60 times. We provide detailed descriptions of the performance of each task including variability, skew, and reliability statistics using intraclass correlations. We examine the sensitivity of each test to several contextual factors including stress, affect and social interactions. Finally, we provide power analyses on each cognitive test to determine how many assessments and participants are needed to detect effects of interest. These analyses will be essential to anyone seeking to implement HFCA testing in their own research programs by providing guidance on which cognitive tests to select and how many participants and observations may be needed.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety represents a significant burden to well-being and is characterized by enhanced negative affect in social situations. Affective processes in anxiety are usually investigated as a single response that represents the overall magnitude of affect elicited by an event. However, social events and the emotions that they elicit unfold over time. Importantly, individual differences in temporal dynamics of affect within fear-relevant situations might explain differences in social anxiety symptoms. The first aim of this study was to develop a paradigm to quantify individual differences in within-situation affect dynamics. The second aim was to test whether affect dynamics were associated with social anxiety symptoms. 84 young adults with low to high social anxiety symptoms viewed movie clips of negative, positive, and neutral social situations. They continuously rated their affect while viewing the scenes, and we measured their negative and positive facial expressions over time with facial electromyography (fEMG). Consequently, we could quantify subjective and expressed affect dynamics in terms of intensity, variability, instability, and inertia. Our results showed that affect dynamics unfolded on the timescale of seconds and differed between positive, negative, and neutral situations. Crucially, individuals differed in subjective and expressed dynamics even when viewing the exact same situation. In contrast to our expectations, only intensity but no other affect dynamics was associated with social anxiety. We argue that for comprehensive insights into the affective processes that underlie social anxiety, future research should investigate affect dynamics within fear-relevant situations on short timescales and distinguish between different types of anxiety.",

To quantify the changes, we tracked the adoption of Bayesian inference and open science practices across 15,634 empirical articles from six leading psychology journals over a twenty-year period (2004–2024). Human (50%) and LLM-assisted (50%) full-text coding revealed that in 2024, about 1 in every 4 articles (26%) reported a Bayesian analysis, about 2 in every 5 articles (40%) included a preregistration, and about 3 in every 4 articles (73%) provided open data. From 2004 to 2012, these practices were virtually nonexistent. Application of a Bayesian logistic growth model suggests these practices will continue to rise in the future, although the extent of their growth remains uncertain. In addition, our review revealed that mixed-effects models have become more prevalent; software reporting has improved, with growing use of R alongside a relative decline of SPSS; and that estimation-focused reporting showed only modest gains. Despite considerable heterogeneity between journals, our results present a detailed account of the ways in which articles from 2024 differ methodologically from those that were published only a decade before.",

We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses. We then apply the model to empirical judgments of verbal quantifiers.",

To overcome these weaknesses, we analysed data from a uniquely large and longitudinal dataset containing 191 verbs, collected via an educational online platform from 38,550 Dutch-speaking children aged 8-12 years old, an age range in which errors are still present. We examined whether form-frequency, phonological neighbourhood density (PND), their interaction and telicity predict the verb-specific difficulty of past tense forms in Dutch.  Our findings suggest a key role for form-frequency in the simple past and present perfect, while there is no evidence for PND and telicity.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a distressing subjective experience reflecting a lack of fulfilling social\nconnections.

We addressed these gaps in a meta-analysis of bivariate correlations\nbetween loneliness and attachment orientations, using random-effects robust variance\nestimation. Across 91 publications, 108 independent samples, and 441 effect sizes, we found\na strong and robust association: individuals with higher attachment-related anxiety or\navoidance reported higher levels of loneliness (overall r = .38). Moderator analyses and\nrobustness checks revealed that this association holds across various populations and study\ncharacteristics, including age, gender, relationship status, and sample type. However, the\nstrength of the association varied depending on socio-cultural context and the attachment\nfigures considered. Moreover, we observed differences between loneliness facets and\nattachment dimensions, though these may also reflect scale characteristics rather than to\ngenuine conceptual distinctions. Overall, these findings highlight a substantial association\nbetween attachment insecurity and loneliness and suggest that targeting attachment-related\nvulnerabilities could be crucial for preventing or reducing loneliness.",

Examining how inner speech varies in BPD can therefore clarify its role in self-knowledge and metacognition, the sense of self, and self-regulation. We propose that specific dimensions of inner speech—such as egocentricity, intrusiveness, and valence—are systematically altered in BPD. Such alterations may both arise from, and in turn exacerbate, BPD symptoms. This perspective yields testable predictions and opens new avenues for understanding the role of inner speech in cognitive architecture.",

          "abstract": "In social interactions, we constantly need to keep track of both, our own affective states and the affective states of others. We therefore employ mechanisms to distinguish between the mental representations of our own and others’ affective states, which is called affective self-other distinction. Affective self-other distinction may be less effective, leading to an emotional egocentricity bias or an emotional altercentric bias. Deficits in affective self-other distinction are characteristic of several psychopathologies, highlighting the need for reliable and valid measures to understand its cognitive, affective and neural basis. Here, we present a novel paradigm, which uses short videos of the other’s facial expressions, allowing for a direct perception of the other’s feelings, presumably challenging self-other distinction. In a series of studies (including in total n = 125 participants), we show that the paradigm successfully elicits emotional ego- and altercentric biases. Interindividual differences in the emotional egocentricity bias were stable over time, demonstrating that the paradigm can be used to reliably study interindividual differences in affective self-other distinction. The results also indicate that self-salience should be taken into account when interpreting interindividual differences in emotional biases. All paradigm materials are openly available, which will hopefully facilitate future research on affective self-other distinction. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on affective self-other distinction and expand it by elucidating the psychometric properties of emotional ego- and altercentric biases.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ favorite media actors (e.g., influencers, celebrities or sports stars) are known to share political opinions on their social media accounts amid their entertainment and lifestyle content. Through engaging political posts, these actors have the potential to empower the political self-efficacy beliefs of their (young) audiences, but research on such effects is missing. The effects of political content by mediated role models (short: MRMs) on adolescents’ political self-efficacy may further depend on the source (comparing influencers and celebrities/athletes) and users’ level of elaborate political information processing on social media. However, knowledge of these potential boundary conditions is lacking. A three-wave panel study among 648 French adolescents (Mage = 15.21, SDage = 1.89, 56.6% girls) in 2021-22 addressed these research gaps. The between-person results from the random-intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that higher trait-like levels of exposure to the political content of a favorite role model were significantly related to higher trait-like levels of political self-efficacy. None of the explored reciprocal relationships emerged on the within-person level, and neither the type of role model nor the elaborate processing of political information moderated the relationships.",

We use AI-driven tools to track children's physical proximity and their corresponding referential expressions. Quantitative analyses reveal that when children are closer together, they tend to use less explicit referential forms, whereas greater distance is associated with more explicit lexical forms. The relationship between distance and referential form usage is highly dynamic, with distinct patterns emerging at different developmental stages. The linear mixed-effects models reveal that children employ both stable, context-dependent usage patterns across all ages, and that some of these patterns undergo significant developmental change. This study demonstrates the power of integrating motion analysis with corpus-based linguistics to unravel the multimodal fabric of early peer interaction, illuminating how synchronized interaction evolves in parallel with communicative skills and underlying cognitive development.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

          "abstract": "Personality is highly consequential for important life outcomes, and many people are motivated to change aspects of their personality. This implies a high potential for volitional personality change interventions, which are on the rise. However, their effect sizes tend to be small and heterogeneous. A key reason may be that intervention designs remain largely disconnected from current work on dynamics relevant to personality change. We argue that personality interventions should be enriched by work on personality dynamics, which focuses on momentary states and their patterns (mean-level, variability, state-state associations, situational contingencies, temporal dynamics). We outline three opportunities for more effective personality interventions incorporating personality dynamics. First, dynamics can serve as novel targets of intervention, representing key mechanisms underlying personality change (e.g., decreasing stress reactivity in neuroticism interventions). Second, dynamics can be used to personalize interventions at a between-person level (e.g., promoting person-specific activities associated with desired states). Third, dynamics can be used as momentary within-person triggers of adaptive interventions (e.g., encouraging the planning of social activities following a day with little social contact). Key advantages of the proposed approach include potentially more effective, safer, and more inclusive interventions with stronger downstream effects on life outcomes. We provide guidance on the methodological implementation and discuss limitations and future directions. Ultimately, leveraging personality dynamics could enable a novel generation of personality interventions.",

          "abstract": "Parental burnout, which includes emotional exhaustion, emotional distance, and feeling fed up with parenting, is a chronic and potentially debilitating stress condition that has become highly prevalent in Western countries. Yet uncertainty remains about parents’ daily experience of burnout and how their experiences interact with their family environment. In this study, we surveyed a sample of 40 parents (who felt overwhelmed and exhausted by parenting) daily for eight weeks about their experiences of parental burnout, interactions with their children, and family environment, yielding 1541 total observations; main analyses focus on 36 mothers. We estimated a multilevel vector autoregressive model and created three distinct graphical networks to best reveal the dynamics of these interactions. All models point to interactions with children as a key determinant in the parent’s daily experience of parental burnout—particularly predicting emotional distance and feeling fed up. At the temporal level, parental burnout symptoms were characterized by strong self-prediction (autoregression). In addition, the severity of parental burnout was negatively correlated with daily variation of parental burnout features. Together, these results suggest that mothers in a severe state of burnout are less sensitive to their context, with the exception of interactions with their children.",

This study utilizes a divergent thinking task based on children's drawings, combined with the Large Language Model (LLM) and BERT semantic algorithm, to propose a metric measurement method for DT. The results showed that: ① The themes distribution of student DT tends to follow a power-law distribution; ② The semantic similarity (SS) quartiles of divergent thinking are generally consistent, but there are significant fluctuations in the outlier value region, which may indicate that the so-called \"Divergent\" of DT is more reflected on the outlier value side; ③ The fluctuation of SS is mainly influenced by the number of theme topics, and is not significantly affected by the sample size.",

          "abstract": "Developing expertise when learning a motor sequence involves optimization of bodily movement. Although there is understanding of the stages of learning development from reactive responses to accurate and well-represented sequence performance, very little is known about the contribution of movement variability for learning. Fractal scaling can quantify the complexity of variability in learning behavior, yet motor sequence learning studies have not applied it. These results could offer valuable insights for profiling learners in real-world settings. The aim of this study was to understand fractal scaling differences in movement kinematics between learners of different expertise levels performing the Dance Discrete Sequence Performance task. We recorded Centre of Mass accelerations using a lower-body seven sensor setup with the Movella Xsens MVN Awinda and extracted Hurst Exponents of the accelerations as a representation of fractal complexity, between 11 High and 11 Low expertise learners (top 50% versus bottom 50% percentile). The results of the mixed effects models showed significant differences with increased fractal scaling during preparation, but decreased scaling during movement periods for the High expertise group. Our findings show that differences in fractal scaling can quantify motor learning expertise and their contribution to learning for different phases of the task.",

This editorial synthesizes expert discussions from the First Theoretical and Applied Advances in Motor Learning Conference to address key issues impeding further progress. We are hampered by the science of averages, characterized by an over-reliance on data from homogenous, Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) populations and a flawed assumption of cognitive uniformity. This approach masks critical individual differences, limiting the translational potential of our science and leading to one-size-fits-all enhancement strategies. We propose a multi-tiered roadmap for the maturation of our field. The foundational priorities are structural: embracing co-creation with diverse communities, moving beyond WEIRD science, and implementing structured mentorship and active sponsorship to empower a new generation of scholars. Building on this, we advocate for technology-driven individualisation like using advanced Mobile Brain/Body Imaging techniques for the development of neurophenotypes, to fulfill the potential of Brain-Computer Interfaces. Finally, we call for a precision enhancement framework, shifting from learning boosters to a diagnostic-to-prescriptive model that targets specific, identified bottlenecks. This roadmap allows our field to build upon its foundational principles to create a more effective, accessible, and equitable motor learning science for all.",

          "abstract": "Importance. The literature on paediatric gender-affirming care has paid little attention to non-binary young people’s clinical presentations, including their desires for gender-affirming interventions.\n\nObjective. To describe the gender-related presentation of non-binary children and adolescents first attending a paediatric gender clinic, exploring differences based on birth-registered sex and between young people with non-binary and binary identities.\n\nDesign. In this cross-sectional study, young people and a parent/caregiver completed online questionnaires prior to their first appointment between Feb 2017-Dec 2023. Analyses were conducted in January 2025.\n\nSetting. Multidisciplinary gender clinic at a public children’s hospital in Victoria, Australia. \nParticipants. Of those attending an initial appointment (n=2,303), those included in the analytic sample had available questionnaire data (n=2,138) and reported a gender identity that discorded with their birth-registered sex (n=1,745). \n\nMain Outcomes and Measures. Validated measures assessed gender dysphoria, body image, embodiment goals, gender-diverse behaviour, voice dysphoria and chest dysphoria. Gender identity was assessed on the Gender Slider, and social transition via reported changes to presentation, name and pronouns.\n\nResults. The ratio of non-binary to binary young people increased over time, from 1:6 in 2017 to 1:1.6 in 2023. The non-binary group exhibited high levels of body dissatisfaction (m=3.3; 95% CI=3.3,3.4) and gender dysphoria (m=42.0; 95% CI=41.2,42.8). They reported similar levels of gender dysphoria to binary young people (m diff=0.3; 95% CI=-2.3,2.9) and slightly less body dissatisfaction (m diff=-0.3; 95% CI=-0.4,-0.2). Among non-binary people, medical/surgical change to breasts was desired most frequently of all body characteristics (90.1%, n=263). Fewer non-binary than binary individuals reported desires to medically/surgically change their body characteristics [e.g. breasts (% diff=-7.5; 95% CI=-11.1,-3.9)]. Some differences were also observed between non-binary young people assigned female at birth and assigned male at birth [e.g., desire to change body hair (% diff=-39.1; 95% CI= -51.7,-26.5)]. Further between-group differences were observed regarding gender-diverse behaviour and social transition.\n\nConclusions and Relevance. Non-binary children and adolescents accessing gender-affirming care experience significant gender dysphoria, body dissatisfaction and desires for medical/surgical affirmation. While it is important for clinicians to be aware of potential differences in clinical presentation based on gender identity, an individualized, person-centered approach remains priority.",

Here, we show that large\nlanguage models (LLMs) exhibit similar sensitivities to framing manipulations,\nincluding the magnitude, sign, and hidden-zero effects. Unlike humans, LLMs\ndiscount delayed rewards exponentially rather than hyperbolically and do not\nexhibit a decimal effect, suggesting their behavior does not simply reflect\nknowledge of published decision-making phenomena learned during training.\nAnalysis of LLM embedding spaces, which encode semantic knowledge,\nrevealed that large monetary amounts are represented more closely to words\nrelated to delay and the future. This suggests that framing manipulations bias\nLLM choices through semantic proximity to words linked to the present or future.\nTogether, these results introduce a conceptual framework whereby linguistic\nstructure shapes decisions, suggesting that human decision-making biases may\nemerge, in part, from the organization of choice options in semantic space.",

Passive sensing offers opportunities for timely detection and intervention, yet most prior work has emphasized trait-level anxiety, with limited success in predicting intra-day fluctuations in state anxiety. To address this gap, we studied 72 socially anxious students who used our smartwatch–smartphone system for an average of nine days. The smartwatch collected multimodal physiological and behavioral signals (e.g., heart rate, movement), while the smartphone delivered seven randomly timed ecological momentary assessments per day to capture state anxiety. These multimodal data formed the basis for anxiety modeling. We present a weakly supervised multimodal framework that trains a base model on a public dataset, then transfers learning and personalizes predictions via meta-learning. Our model outperformed baselines, achieving 72.1% balanced accuracy on our dataset and 66.9% on an external dataset, demonstrating potential to support just-in-time-adaptive interventions.",

We also developed methods for efficient standardization, built and scaled robust data analysis pipelines and\naddressed challenges faced by open science efforts. Two major strategies we implemented to help achieve our\ngoals were a shared, non-hierarchical governance structure, and the creation of (and support for) a professional\ncore staff who help integrate the collaboration and maintain the IBL infrastructure.

          "abstract": "Collective punishment has been applied to sanction and mitigate unethical or illegal behavior. While the use of this controversial mode of punishment might be justifiable from a consequentialist perspective, its effectiveness as well as factors affecting individuals’ endorsement of its use are largely unexplored. Focusing on dishonesty and rule breaking as two prominent examples of unethical and often illegal behavior, we herein address these gaps by testing the effectiveness and endorsement of collective punishment across six preregistered experiments and survey studies with samples from three countries (overall N = 11,020). Exploring the role of inter-individual differences, we tested whether the HEXACO dimensions and the Dark Factor of Personality (D) interact with the implementation of collective punishment in predicting dishonesty and relate to the endorsement of collective punishment (in context of the COVID-19 pandemic). Our results provide substantive evidence for the effectiveness of collective punishment. Further, both honesty-humility and D predicted dishonesty irrespective of the presence of collective punishment, while individuals high (vs. low) in emotionality reacted more to the implementation of collective punishment and more strongly endorsed its use. Combined, these results provide important implications for the evaluation and consideration of collective punishment, including the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "This article advances the debate on artificial intelligence (AI) use in education by moving beyond the mechanistic notion of prompt engineering and the human-centered focus of prevailing AI-literacy frameworks. We introduce prompting (l)iteracy, a sociotechnical capacity that is simultaneously iterative (built through cycles of prompt revision and reflection) and critical (attuned to the economic logics, linguistic hierarchies, and distributed agencies that shape AI dialogue). Four theoretical lenses scaffold the concept: (1) post-Fordist political economy explains how each prompt exploits commodified linguistic labor embedded in large language models; (2) Bourdieu’s linguistic-capital thesis illuminates the social inequities likely reproduced by differential prompting proficiency; (3) Latour’s actor-network theory highlights non-human agency, as humans do not only prompt AI, but they are also prompted by AI; and (4) de Certeau’s tactics foreground users’ creative appropriations and resistances. Vignettes of AI interactions illustrate these dimensions and expose the twin pitfalls of techno-solutionism and techno-pessimism. We argue that future research must abandon self-report surveys in favor of authentic, trace-centered mixed methods that record authentic prompt–response logs and machine telemetry. Prompting (l)iteracy thus offers a richer analytic lens for understanding, and ultimately mitigating, AI-mediated educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "Attentional bias to drug-related cues is widely considered a core feature of addiction, yet its empirical detection is highly sensitive to task design and stimulus selection. In this study, we used a computer mouse-tracking paradigm to examine attentional bias toward cigarette-related, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images in 96 participants (49 smokers, 47 nonsmokers). Trajectory deviation, measured via maximum absolute deviation (MAD), served as an index of attentional bias. Both groups showed stronger bias for emotionally salient distractors, especially pleasant images, highlighting how the inclusion of emotionally matched control stimuli could reveal overlooked confounds in addiction research. Contrary to expectations, smokers did not exhibit greater attentional bias to cigarette cues than nonsmokers. Prior work has identified individual differences in cue reactivity among smokers. To investigate whether similar differences were present here, we applied k-means clustering to the MAD data. This analysis revealed two subgroups of smokers: one selectively biased toward cigarette cues, and another more reactive to pleasant stimuli. We replicated these results in an independent sample of 85 smokers. This dissociation aligns with prior neuroimaging findings, and suggests that the mouse-tracking paradigm may serve as a scalable, cost-effective tool for detecting reliable individual differences in reactivity to drug-related and non-drug-related pleasant stimuli.",

Using an online survey, a total of 686 Canadian university students provided comprehensive data on their reality TV consumption patterns, sexual attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Our results replicated several findings from Fogel and Kovalenko (2013), such that participants who reported engaging in one-night stands within the past year demonstrated higher scores on measures of sexual empowerment, sexual permissiveness, and perceived realism of reality show content. Demographic factors such as ethnicity and relationship status were also associated with one-night stand engagement. Additionally, compared to viewers of dating reality TV, viewers of sexual reality TV reported stronger parasocial connections, greater interest in characters, and perceived the show as more realistic. Our results suggest that while reality TV consumption is associated with one-night stand engagement, there are additional factors associated with this outcome and the causal relationship cannot yet be established. We conclude that a broader perspective is needed when assessing reality TV viewership that includes individual and contextual factors.\n\nKeywords: reality television, sexual behaviors, replication, open science",

PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched from inception until September 2024. Peer-reviewed English publications were included if they reported on PA or diet and TDF constructs in relation to the menstrual cycle in biological female populations of reproductive age currently not suffering from conditions impairing PA or diet. Of 9,247 screened records, 36 were included, comprising 28 primary studies and 9 reviews. The TDF component of emotions was the most explored in both diet and PA studies, although the latter investigated a broader range of constructs (e.g., social influences, attention). The menstrual phase, pain and bleeding impaired PA and performance. The results on diet remained inconclusive. Small samples, cross-sectional designs, heterogeneity of menstrual cycle assessments and a lack of explicit sex-based recruitment limit generalizability. Gaps include several TDF constructs (e.g., self-efficacy). Longitudinal designs and objective assessments of the menstrual cycle and behaviours in larger heterogeneous samples are needed.",

          "abstract": "The number of available response options is a central design feature in any experimental psychology paradigm, with binary response paradigms restricting the range of behavioural responses into staying or shifting. Participants (n = 72) played nine blocks of a novel zero-sum game, Dice Dual, while we parametrically manipulated the different number of response options (2, 4, 6) against an unexploitable computerized opponent. When the number of responses exceeded two, this allowed us to identify two types of shift behaviours: between-category shifts relevant to mental model exploitation, and, within-category shifts reflective of random exploration. Between-category shifts were sensitive to outcome valence, exhibiting an increased shift rate when more response options were available after-win, while shift rates were independent of response availability after-loss. In contrast, within-category shifts were only sensitive to response availability, with increased shift rates when more response options were available, irrespective of outcome valence. Identifying multiple, functionally different classes of shift behaviour using non-binary response paradigms allows us to more easily separate attempts at exploitation and exploration. The data also offer more general models of performance regarding sub-optimal decision-making, where negative outcomes constrict the range of factors considered in future mental model updates.",

          "abstract": "Efficient manual interactions rely on predictive cues to object weight. While familiar cues (e.g., size) readily support motor planning, it is unclear whether newly learned cues can enhance performance in demanding tasks. Understanding the predictive utility of novel cues has implications for sensory augmentation. We investigated this using a goal-directed hitting task, where participants earned a performance-based reward for squashing virtual bugs. Targets appeared briefly at unpredictable locations on a touchscreen, and participants used light and heavy containers to squash the bugs. Container weight was signaled with a familiar (visual volume), novel (checkerboard patterns), or no cue (identical containers). The number of bugs hit was highest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and smallest with no cue. Response time followed a corresponding pattern: movements were fastest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and slowest with no cue. No differences were found in precision, but constant bias was highest with the novel cue, followed by no cue, and smallest with the familiar cue. These findings demonstrate that novel cues, though less effective than familiar ones, can be rapidly integrated to guide efficient motor behavior, suggesting their potential for augmenting human performance in real-world tasks.",

          "abstract": "Personality pathology often emerges in adolescence—a period marked by increasing autonomy and complex peer dynamics —but its moment-to-moment interpersonal expression remains poorly understood. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female; ages 12–21) across 13,190 real-world interactions over 14 days. Using the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we examined how maladaptive traits (Criterion B) relate to interpersonal functioning (Criterion A), operationalized via momentary reports of mentalizing, enacted warmth and dominance, and perceptions of others’ warmth and dominance. Multilevel structural equation modeling revealed that self-reported maladaptive traits predicted lower perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, trait pathology was unrelated to average mentalizing but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Different pathological traits were associated with distinct patterns in how moment\nto-moment mentalizing related to interpersonal behavior, with some traits strengthening rather than weakening these associations. These domain-specific patterns indicate that personality pathology affects not only overall interpersonal functioning but also shows distinct coordination patterns between social cognition and behavior. Our findings illustrate how adolescent personality pathology manifests in everyday social interactions, highlighting the need for interventions that target both mean levels and variability in social processes to stabilize momentary social cognition and promote affiliation over control.",

Regression analyses revealed few differences in mental health severity and barriers to accessing campus services between most REM subgroups and white students. Most REM subgroups reported lower rates of substance use, greater awareness of campus services, and found services more helpful relative to white students. Sexually minoritized students reported greater severity of mental health symptoms and more barriers to accessing campus services relative to heterosexual students.

          "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates an association between social isolation and psychosis risk. In this perspective, we attempt to account for why that is. Drawing from work in social psychology, social neuroscience, and clinical psychological science, we present two frameworks for understanding the association between social isolation and psychosis risk: the social needs framework and the social processing framework. Social needs states that due to people’s inherent social needs, isolation produces increased social attention, perception, and thought to fill the social void, resulting in the perception of anomalous social information and social meaning. Social processing states that the lack of exposure to social stimuli during isolation diminishes social processing (i.e., social thought, social perceptions), and may lead isolated individuals to turn their attention inwards, blurring internal and external worlds in a way that creates reality monitoring disturbances and anomalous self-experiences. Conveniently, these frameworks can be empirically arbitrated. We review the literature connecting social isolation to psychosis, the frameworks, their empirical support, and the predictions they make. Ultimately, a better accounting of isolation’s pro-psychotic effects might lead to better efforts at psychosis prevention.",

          "abstract": "Slowing down one’s response speed following an error, also known as post-error slowing (PES), is a common phenomenon that has been observed in both adults and children as young as 3 to 4 years of age. Despite the pervasive nature of PES, its functional significance, developmental trajectory, and relation with error processing in middle childhood are still debated. This study examined how PES changes throughout middle childhood and relates to neural markers of error processing, Pe amplitude and midfrontal theta (MFT) power. Participants aged 5-12 years (n = 182, 41.8% = female) completed a task-switching paradigm where response times (RTs) and electrophysiological (EEG) data were collected. PES increased with age, primarily on repeat trials. Pe increased after errors in 11-12-year-olds, but not younger children, whereas MFT was elevated post-error across all age groups. MFT power modestly correlated with Pe and, importantly, predicted PES. Greater PES and more efficient error processing with age suggest that PES reflects adaptive adjustment of cognitive control. \nKeywords: Post-error slowing (PES), error monitoring, cognitive control, Pe, midfrontal theta power, middle childhood.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically characterized by executive dysfunction, yet emerging evidence points to spatially asymmetrical features of cognition. We examined whether transsaccadic working memory (tWM), the mechanism that integrates visual and motor signals across eye movements, shows directional vulnerability in ADHD. Participants with ADHD completed a spatial tWM task in which memory arrays (one or three items) were presented before leftward, rightward, or fixation trials, and repositioned a probe to the remembered target location. For comparison, data from a previously tested neurotypical sample were included in group-level analyses. Errors were decomposed into systematic and unsystematic components. Compared to controls, ADHD participants showed a modest but reliable rightward-saccade disadvantage, with greater systematic distortions after rightward than leftward eye movements. Saccades disrupted working memory in both groups, but the typical load-dependent increase in unsystematic error observed in neurotypical participants was absent in ADHD. Two complementary interpretations may account for this asymmetry. The integration-imbalance hypothesis attributes it to weakened right-hemisphere contributions to spatial working memory, which impair integration of left-hemisphere oculomotor and right-hemisphere spatial signals during rightward saccades. Alternatively, the anchoring-disruption hypothesis suggests that rightward eye movements destabilize the spatial scaffold anchoring remembered locations, producing geometric distortions without increased error. Together, these findings identify a direction-specific fragility of visuomotor-cognitive coupling in ADHD not explained by general capacity limits. More broadly, they reveal a partial neglect-like pattern of transsaccadic vulnerability: selective impairment for rightward saccades without a left-field deficit—highlighting the utility of oculomotor paradigms for revealing hidden spatial asymmetries in neurocognitive function.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Aphasia rehabilitation increasingly emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and ingredients underlying behavioral interventions. Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is a commonly-used intervention for anomia in aphasia but there is little evidence directly examining its active ingredients. Using within-trial responses during SFA, we sought to explore how generating semantic features might facilitate naming improvements. \n\nMethod: A retrospective analysis evaluated data collected from a clinical trial focused on intensive SFA treatment for individuals with chronic aphasia. The study included 44 adults with chronic aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. A pre-trained semantic model was used to estimate the semantic relatedness between  features and targets.\n\nResults: Participants were 2.6 (95% CI: [2.16, 3.12]) times more likely to correctly name target words after engaging in feature generation. Each additional feature generated was associated with a three percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4]) in the probability of a correct response at the end of the trial; a one standard deviation increase in semantic similarity (i.e., feature quality) was associated with a six percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.4, 0.10]). Model comparison favored semantic similarity over feature generation count in predicting final response accuracy.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide converging evidence that semantic feature generation is an active ingredient in SFA treatment, emphasizing the importance of feature quantity and semantic quality, consistent with a spreading activation account of SFA’s benefits. Further research is warranted to validate relatedness values from semantic model embeddings, and to explore the relationship between within-trial feature generation and generalization to semantically related but untreated words.",

          "abstract": "Aims: It is generally believed that the younger the age of first alcohol consumption, the higher the risk of developing physical/psychosocial alcohol related problems, but not all studies support this association. Differences among findings may stem from heterogeneity in the definitions of alcohol initiation and its operationalization. This problem has already been recognized in the literature, but it is unclear whether recent studies have taken steps to improve this issue. In this context, we investigate current practices in inquiring about alcohol initiation. Methods: Our goal was to obtain a representative sample of recent publications and to review the questions used to assess alcohol initiation in studies with children/adolescents. To that aim, we searched PubMed for empirical studies published between 2018 and 2024 on early alcohol use and which claimed to have assessed alcohol initiation. Findings: Our search returned a total of 523 documents, of which 59 met our eligibility criteria. Overall, the questions used to assess what constituted alcohol initiation varied widely in terms of the quantity of alcohol consumed, from just one or a few sips to at least a full drink, with some studies having no definition of alcohol initiation and many failing to define alcohol and/or doses. Only 17 studies enquired about context of use, focusing on excluding drinking in religious ceremonies and parental consent. Conclusion: Definitions of alcohol initiation remain highly heterogeneous and sub-optimal in terms of clarity in respect of the quantity/context of alcohol consumption. We suggest a comprehensive and standardized set of questions to change this state of affairs.",

This study introduces and supports the Flourishing Fit Model, a multi-level framework proposing that well-being reflects coherence across behavioral, motivational, and dispositional levels of functioning. Using both person (N=392) and activity (N=1,179) level data, preregistered analyses tested whether hedonic and eudaimonic well-being emerge from alignment among these systems rather than from their independent effects. Type of activity engaged in showed no significant main effects (ps &gt; .15), whereas hedonic and eudaimonic motives were associated with corresponding forms of well-being (βs = .34–.59, ps &lt; .001). We found a motive–orientation congruence interaction for social well-being (β = .14, p = .015), and four small but interpretable personality–motive interactions (βs = ±.03–.09, ps &lt; .05) indicated that traits such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism calibrate motivational benefits. Collectively, the findings suggest that motivational coherence may represent a particularly consistent pathway to flourishing, advancing an understanding of well-being that sets the stage for further longitudinal tests of flourishing fit.",

We found discrepant decreasing and increasing prospective effects and a meta-analytic aggregation of these discrepant effects did not differ significantly from zero. Moreover, a good fit of the spurious prospective associations model (SPAM) indicated that the meta-analytic data may have been generated without any direct effects between peer relationships and internet addiction. Hence, we conclude that the meta-analytic data does not support conclusions of decreasing prospective effects between peer relationships and internet addiction.

          "abstract": "People’s choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as gains or losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched (in terms of good and bad outcomes) in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N \"=\" 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the effect’s relevance to situations where it was thought to be absent. Among several theory specifications, only a new rescaled version of the explicated valence account explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

Additionally, we found that participants' rating of a sentence's perceived rhythmicity predicted response times to the sentence. Our studies offer evidence for the special role of rhythmicity in its different aspects for coordinating and speeding up the turn transfer in communication.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and wearable devices afford opportunities to collect real-time data on events experienced in daily life. Examples of event-based data in the psychological and behavioral sciences include smoking a cigarette, experiencing a stressor, having a disruption to sleep, experiencing a depressive or manic episode, drinking an alcoholic beverage, or engaging in a bout of exercise. The increasing availability of dense sampling approaches allows for the measurement of such events at relatively fast time-scales (e.g., occurring across minutes, hours, days, or weeks), expanding the possibilities for how time can be conceptualized and modeled. Survival analysis is a modeling approach that allows researchers to address scientific questions regarding whether and when events occur in time. Although not often applied to EMA data, there are myriad research questions relevant to psychosocial and behavioral scientists which can be addressed using survival analysis. This article provides an overview of survival analysis, describes several time-based considerations for modeling event-based EMA data using survival analysis, and provides several illustrative examples of the different time-based considerations. Altogether, the goals of this article are to enhance knowledge of the types of research questions that can be examined using survival analysis, to illustrate nuances of applying the method to EMA data, and to spark ideas for future empirical and methodological research.",

This study therefore qualitatively explored maternal cognitive changes through the lens of matrescence as an adaptive developmental process, without a deficit-focus. Eight mothers took part in one-to-one audio recorded semi-structured online interviews, in the United Kingdom, during December 2024. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to examine participants’ lived experiences, resulting in three overarching themes (1) the overloaded brain (2) thinking beyond the self (3) solidarity. The findings highlight that maternal cognition cannot be fully understood through objective measures alone. Societal expectations and the availability of meaningful support inform how mothers makes sense of their experiences, making cognitive changes inseparable from their social context.",

Consequently, we’ve iteratively developed a variation of Heyman and Vanpaemel’s model in which students choose their own effect/dataset for an individual multiverse capstone project. \nObjective: To evaluate student-led individual multiverse capstone projects. \nMethod: One cohort of five project students qualitatively reflected on designing, running, and reporting an individual multiverse project in a small group supervision context. We thematically analysed these reflections.\nFindings: Two themes captured (a) the factors promoting project success (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual) and (b) the outcomes of a multiverse capstone project (the range of skills developed and multiverse’s potential contributions to psychology).\nConclusion: Individual multiverse projects are a meaningful, desk-based alternative to traditional capstone projects, and address many key undergraduate research methods learning outcomes.\nTeaching Implications: We propose an evidence-based ‘recipe’ for successful individual multiverse projects.

The results showed that, although most speech acts were classified as civil, the prevalence of political incivility in Dutch televised election debates did increase in the second half of the investigated time period. In addition, incivility was associated with the speaker’s party’s populism, but not gender and incumbency status, and was more likely when a previous comment had been uncivil. Finally, incivility was more prevalent in debates or debate segments featuring only two, rather than three or more, politicians. Potential causes of the increase of incivility in recent years, such as the rise of populism, are discussed.",

This international multi-lab study tests four basic hypotheses derived from core assumptions of CLT and explores potential moderators and boundary conditions of the effects. Participants (N = 11,775) from 27 countries and regions were randomly assigned to one of four experimental protocols focused on different types of psychological distance (temporal, spatial, social, or likelihood), and each experiment manipulated psychological distance (close vs. distant). The protocols for temporal distance (N = 2,941) and spatial distance (N = 2,973) were direct replications of Liberman and Trope (1998, Study 1) and Fujita et al. (2006, Study 1), respectively. The remaining two protocols were paradigmatic replications, applying to social distance (N = 2,926) and likelihood (N = 2,936). The effects of psychological distance on construal level for the four present studies were (original effects within parentheses; positive effects are consistent with hypotheses): dtemporal = 0.08, 95% CI [0.003, 0.16] (cf. d = 0.92); dspatial = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.11] (cf. d = 0.55); dsocial = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.19]; and dlikelihood = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.11]. Pretests indicated that valence and abstraction were confounded in response options on the outcome measure. Controlling for this confound eliminated the hypothesis-inconsistent effect of social distance, d = 0.006, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.07]. These findings provide limited evidence for the predictions of the theory and present a critical challenge for CLT.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Mental health concerns are rising, particularly among post-secondary students, who may lack access to traditional therapeutic resources due to barriers like long wait times and high costs. To help address these challenges, we explored the potential of large language model-based chatbots for supporting mental health and wellbeing in student populations.\n\nMethods: We conducted two studies, lasting one week and four weeks, to examine the effectiveness of chatbot interventions over different durations. Both studies compared two chatbot interventions—one mindfulness-focused and one value-focused—against an active check-in-only control condition. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in wellbeing through the mindfulness-to-meaning (MM) pathway, a process in which enhanced decentering, the ability to see one’s experience from a wider perspective, leads to improved positive reappraisal, the ability to find constructive and empowered interpretations of experience.\n\nResults: All conditions showed evidence of stress reduction. However, compared to the active control group, both intervention styles at both durations resulted in improved wellbeing via the MM pathway. This effect was primarily driven by significant improvements in decentering. For the longer duration only, we also observed enhanced reappraisal. \n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the potential of chatbot-based interventions to support the development of regulatory skills by leveraging the MM pathway to enhance mental health. Educational institutions and mental health providers might consider integrating such tools into scalable and accessible student support systems, addressing a broader and more diverse audience while promoting sustained wellbeing through skills development.",

It is currently unknown whether daily deviations in cognitive performance have implications for real-world behaviors or merely reflect short-term change of limited scope, perhaps due to assessment artifacts. Daily driving behavior was captured in a group of adults using GPS tracking and participants also completed daily repeated assessments of high frequency cognitive testing. Multilevel negative binomial models were constructed to relate daily cognitive performance to adverse driving events (e.g., speeding or hard braking). Results indicate that on days when cognition is poor relative to the participants’ average functioning, incidence of adverse events increased. Global cognitive ability did not predict driving behavior. These results show that deviations in cognitive performance are not merely “noise”, as they have measurable implications on real-world outcomes that may have implications for driver safety.",

Some programs such as 4-H and FFA center around youth interacting with animals, potentially enhancing youth development. Mueller (2014) investigated whether these interactions and attitudes about animals influenced measures of positive youth development. The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened emotionality. Past research indicated that the biased interpretation of social situations (i.e., interpretation bias) might contribute to these aberrant affect dynamics in adolescents’ daily life. Social situations are, however, constantly changing. Therefore, the ability to flexibly revise social interpretations (i.e., interpretation flexibility) might be equally important as interpretation biases for explaining affective outcomes during adolescence. The present study examined whether interpretation bias and inflexibility predicted two major affect dynamics features (i.e., mean and standard deviation) in children and adolescents. At baseline, N = 154 children and adolescents (M = 12.81 years; 48.70% female; 49.35% male; 1.95% non-binary; 72.08% White) completed a task assessing bias and inflexibility in interpreting social situations. Then, for 28 days, participants rated their positive and negative affect. Results showed that inflexibility in revising positive and negative interpretations in light of disconfirming evidence predicted higher intensity of negative affect. When controlling for interpretation inflexibility, positive interpretation bias predicted higher positive affect, whereas negative interpretation bias was associated with more variable negative affect. The results emphasize the predictive utility of interpretation biases and inflexibility for daily affective experiences in youths.",

The present study uses longitudinal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to characterize different NPS trajectories, their association with cognitive impairment, and white matter microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles as a possible biomarker of NPS progression. \nMETHODS: We assessed the association of different trajectories of NPS identified though growth mixture models with cognitive decline and white matter microstructure changes over the course of two years. \nRESULTS: Four classes of NPS trajectories were identified in 785 individuals. These classes predicted cognitive decline over time but were unrelated to changes in the microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles in a subsample of 60 individuals for whom sufficient longitudinal neuroimaging data was available. \nDISCUSSION: There are substantial individual differences in NPS trajectories. Distinguishing classes of NPS trajectories is important to predict cognitive decline.",

Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals\ntoo slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons.\nA popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback\nfrom higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields.\nThis paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings:\nthe conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly\nwith the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual\ninfluences.

Given the multiple modalities available in these videos, understanding how design choices impact learning is essential for optimising educational practices.    \nAims: This study aims to explore how the instructor’s use of gestures as well as student motivation and allocation of visual attention influence learning from instructional videos. Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. \nSample: Participants were 135 Undergraduate Psychology students.  \nMethods: Participants completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. They were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Self-reported motivation was measured.  \nResults: Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation differed depending on whether gestures were present: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning gains primarily when they also reported higher motivation to study further, whereas the presence of gestures was associated with more consistent learning gains across motivation levels. \nConclusion: These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks achieve impressive success in many vision tasks. Nevertheless, previous work has suggested that their representation of geometric shapes only partially captures the representations found in humans, who additionally require a symbolic “language of geometry”. In this study, we evaluate the progress in this area by systematically comparing human performance in three geometric shape perception tests, with the predictions of recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, varying in size, training datasets and training methods, to recognize and process geometric shapes and compare these representations to the ones found in humans. In two tasks probing quadrilateral and geometric shape perception, introduced by Sable-Meyer et al. (2022, 2025), recent neural networks exhibit representations similar to humans and predict human performance better than a symbolic model. In a third task, involving geometric drawings, the networks still fell short of human performance. Across the three experiments, the main factor driving similarity between human and neural network representations was the size of the training dataset, rather than a specific architecture or the number of parameters of the model. Together, our results show that a massive scaling-up of the training data helps neural networks approximate human-like representations of geometric shapes, but that they still fall short of fully capturing the human representations of geometric shape.",

          "abstract": "Screening abstracts is a crucial yet labor-intensive step in research synthesis projects such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise an opportunity to streamline and automate this process. However, there is currently little experience or practical insight into how such automated workflows can be implemented in research practice. In this article, we illustrate an LLM-based abstract screening workflow using a set of human-rated abstracts from a recent meta-analysis. We describe how we developed and evaluated different prompting strategies and structured output formats, compared the performance of multiple LLMs, quantified model uncertainty, and automated the entire workflow within the R environment. We also provide R scripts and implementation guidance to support psychological researchers in adopting LLM-based workflows for research synthesis. Our comparisons show how different types of LLMs vary in accuracy relative to human raters, and how prompting strategies and hyperparameter settings affect model performance and uncertainty. We demonstrate that LLM-assisted screening can substantially reduce the time and cost of review preparation while maintaining accuracy comparable to human raters. At the same time, we emphasize that this work represents an initial step, and that continued refinement and validation are essential as LLM technologies and their applications continue to evolve rapidly.",

          "abstract": "Games offer a unique way to study human behavior by extending traditional lab-based research into more complex, naturalistic, yet highly controllable settings. A key feature of games is their potential to reframe failure as a learning opportunity, supposedly leading to persistent engagement and competence. This study empirically tested this idea by developing a platformer game in two versions: one with regular checkpoints (resulting in less negative consequences of failure) and one without (resulting in more negative consequences of failure, i.e., having to restart the level). Among 172 participants, those randomly assigned to the checkpoint condition completed more levels of the game on average, but were less committed to individual reward opportunities within each level. Importantly, they also reported significantly lower frustration and higher perceived competence, an essential predictor of intrinsic motivation, compared to participants in the condition without checkpoints. Subjective frustration of the basic need for competence partially mediated game-induced frustration, suggesting that reducing negative consequences of failure facilitates reframing failure as a learning opportunity. These findings illustrate how game design can reduce frustration and enhance motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

In two experiments (preregistered; N=1320), we investigated how incidental character information influence moral and causal judgments. Participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more causal, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that moral character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments, challenging the view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act influence blame.",

These issues are considered in the context of previous research, with renewed attention to the perceived distinctions between different types of services.\nThe data were collected through questionnaires adapted from previous studies, in which participants evaluated statements on a five-point Likert scale, where 5 indicated the highest level of agreement.\nThe findings of the study demonstrate high reliability across all measurement indicators. In the second experiment, age was negatively associated with attitudes toward online shopping, while showing a positive association with attitudes toward shopping in physical stores. The third experiment revealed a negative correlation between attitudes toward online and in-store shopping, consistent with prior research and reinforcing the stability of the assessment instruments employed in this study.",

In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates intelligence-related differences in the adjustment of brain activity and connectivity to varying cognitive demands, testing for a moderation of an association between intelligence and neural efficiency by task difficulty. In 72 young adults (34 female, 38 male), fMRI brain activity changes during a decision-making task with five levels of difficulty were related to intelligence scores from a non-verbal matrix reasoning test. In fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions activated during task processing, we observed smaller increases in brain activity in more intelligent participants – independent of task difficulty. However, in two regions of the default mode network, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and left angular gyrus (AG), more intelligent participants showed greater decreases in activity with increasing task difficulty. Furthermore, with increasing difficulty, more intelligent participants showed greater increases in functional connectivity of DMPFC and AG. These findings suggest a more dynamic adjustment of neural processing to varying cognitive demands in more intelligent individuals. Particularly when it comes to more difficult tasks, more intelligent people seem to be better able to down-regulate activity in the brain's default mode network. Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings must be considered preliminary. While their interpretation should therefore be treated with caution, they suggest conceptually new avenues for replication in larger samples. As far as the observed processes reflect the suppression of task-unrelated neural processing and a better focus on the task at hand, they can potentially explain the general performance advantage of more intelligent individuals across various cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Reliability is a key concept in psychology that has been broadly studied since the introduction of Cronbach's alpha, which is a measure of the internal consistency of a test. Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data.

          "authors": "Mienke Mari Steytler; Douglas A. Parry",
          "abstract": "Debates about adolescent online risks often overlook the lived realities of young people navigating structural adversity and digital inequality. This qualitative study explores how 20 adolescents in a low-income, semi-rural South African community navigate the double-edged nature of social media. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we show how offline violence, gendered power dynamics, and structural inequalities are entangled with online experiences, creating overlapping risks that amplify existing vulnerabilities. At the same time, social media is a source of entertainment, belonging, and glimpses of alternative futures, particularly for adolescents with personal smartphone access. Digital literacy in this context is largely informal and reactive, shaped by peers and trusted adults rather than formal education. These findings contribute to debates on adolescent online risks and digital inequality by showing how local contexts structure both the benefits and harms of social media as well as the forms of digital competence that develop. We argue that understanding adolescent digital life requires attention to structural adversity, everyday social dynamics, and the interdependence of online and offline worlds.",

          "abstract": "Despite their wide application, designing Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies remains challenging partly due to complex and interdependent methodological decisions, such as sampling schedules, response formats, and technological platforms. The existing literature provides valuable frameworks but often mentions methodological options without concrete examples; this article aims to bridge this gap in practical guidance. Informed by the existing ESM literature, we illustrate our decision-making process while designing an ESM study on the temporal associations between momentary life meaning, eating disorder symptoms, and negative affect. While grounded in our specific research questions, this paper provides practical guidelines on how to decide among various methodological options for researchers across psychological fields. We outline key decisions, practical considerations, and challenges encountered during the study’s development. Our paper provides a practical checklist to support researchers in designing ESM studies from scratch and in reporting essential aspects in their manuscripts, promoting transparency and replicability. By illustrating a real-life example of setting up our own study, we aim to guide researchers in navigating the complexities of ESM design.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated barriers and facilitators to implementing, delivering, and participating in an enhanced smoking cessation service for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The service, delivered across four pilot sites in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) of England between April 2023 and March 2024, used a primary care referral model and a 20-week ‘cut down to quit’ approach combining behavioural and pharmacological support.\nMethods: A mixed methods approach was used, including analysis of aggregated recruitment and outcome data, coding documents for Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), a quantitative survey with purposively recruited service providers (n = 20), and qualitative interviews with service providers (n = 14) and service users (n = 4). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behaviour (COM-B) model informed survey and interview design and analysis. A purposively recruited Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) (n = 6) contributed to protocol development, study materials, and interpretation of findings.\nResults: In Pilot Sites A and B, nearly half of service users who set a quit plan had quit smoking at 28 days (~45%). Documentary analysis found the most common BCTs were pharmacological support, adding objects to the environment, and restructuring the environment. Survey findings indicated that providers had the capability, opportunity, motivation, and intention to deliver the service and found it acceptable, though perceptions of required effort varied. Interview findings showed that facilitators for service implementation were primarily linked to motivation (e.g., positive user feedback, staff motivation), whereas barriers were linked to capability (e.g., data recording) and opportunity (e.g., primary care links). For service delivery and participation, facilitators linked to capability (e.g., tailoring support, understanding social determinants) and motivation (e.g., benefits of quitting, goal setting).\nConclusions: Service delivery was perceived as effective due to flexibility and tailored support. Recommendations for improving service implementation should focus on strengthening primary care engagement and referral pathways, enhancing training and skills development for Stop Smoking Advisors, and improving data management systems and evidence gathering early in implementation. Future research should engage more service users and referrers to better understand barriers to service implementation and participation.",

Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength. The findings further suggest that faith development and religiosity may follow different pathways, underscoring the need for future qualitative inquiry into the diverse biographical trajectories of faith development.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relations are fundamental in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal aspects of the social self can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. We hypothesized that individual differences in sociality, in particular friendships and loneliness, depend not only on interpersonal factors, but also on intrapersonal personality features. We administered a comprehensive set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Relational outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis confirmed the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results showed that intrapersonal traits exert a critical influence on friendships and loneliness of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and COVID-19 pandemic effects. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. Our study empirically supports a central role of self-concept in individual sociality. These findings provide a novel perspective on low social life quality combined with possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. The results also offer potential contributions to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Background. Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that is robustly linked to emotional disorders yet remains underexplored in multiple sclerosis (MS), with no studies to date addressing individual differences in emotion regulation difficulties in this population. To address this gap, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of emotion regulation difficulties in an MS sample. \n\nMethods. Participants were 259 people with MS (Mage = 42.79, 78.8% female). Participants completed an online survey measuring emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation was specified as the indicator variable in the LPA, with the additional measures of depression and anxiety utilised to validate the identified profiles.\n\nResults. Three emotion regulation profiles were identified: low impairment (n = 66, 25.48%) characterised by minimal difficulties regulating negative emotions across all domains; global dysregulation (n = 71, 27.41%) characterised by pronounced difficulties in all domains; and goal-impaired regulators (n = 122, 47.10%) characterised by distinct challenges maintaining goal-directed behaviours. Individuals in the global dysregulation profile endorsed the greatest symptom severity on measures of depression and PTSD but reported comparable levels of GAD and health anxiety relative to the goal-impaired regulators.\n\nConclusion. People with MS exhibit distinct emotion regulation profiles, revealing critical subgroups with varying psychological needs. Tailoring psychological assessments and treatments to these profiles can enhance the management of depression and anxiety and potentially improve disease outcomes in people with MS.",

However, research findings on this topic are sometimes inconsistent or conflicting, probably due to diverse conceptualisations of social support components and heterogeneous measures of social support. This narrative review identifies and describes core types of functional social support relevant to mental health and wellbeing. Three literature searches across three databases were used to select papers reporting taxonomies of social support, social support questionnaires, and reviews of social support. A taxonomy of social support types was constructed using inductive qualitative synthesis. Five core types of social support were identified and described: (1) emotional support, (2) social contact and companionship, (3) belonging support, (4) information and guidance support, and (5) tangible support. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently identified. Core elements of emotional support are opportunities for confiding provided by sympathetic listening and caring, which included affectionate support and esteem support. These five types of social support provide a robust set of criteria for informing the development of social support interventions and assessing the adequacy of social support measures.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

This mixed-methods study combines two survey datasets (N₁ = 69; N₂ = 44) with fifteen expert interviews to examine the cognitive, affective, and professional determinants of AI trust. Quantitative analyses indicate that prior AI experience, perceived transparency, and emotional comfort predict willingness to trust AI-assisted decision-making, while accountability is consistently attributed to humans. Qualitative analysis identifies seven recurring themes: emotional reasoning, meta-cognition, AI-augmented creativity and innovation, algorithms codifying injustice, radical skepticism, heuristics and cognitive biases, and algorithmic transparency. Experts emphasized that AI functions as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment. Together, these findings highlight that trust in AI emerges through interactional, cognitive, and affective processes, underscoring the importance of explainable, ethically aligned, and human-centered AI design.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 Haredi Attitudes Survey presents a comprehensive empirical portrait of contemporary ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) society in Israel, exploring how its members navigate the tension between religious identity and civic belonging. Conducted among 429 respondents from all major Haredi subgroups, the survey examined attitudes toward education, employment, military service, political representation, and collective identity. Findings depict a society marked by bounded pragmatism: gradual behavioral adaptation without ideological rupture. Economic participation and professional education are increasingly accepted, driven by necessity rather than by ideological change. Core studies and male academic education remain sensitive identity boundaries, while female higher education has become normatively accepted. Opposition to military conscription remains widespread and morally grounded, viewing Torah study as an equivalent national contribution. Support for adapted service is highly limited, mainly to younger, modern, and more integrated respondents, with rabbinic authority continuing to define permissible compromise. In the domain of identity and belonging, most respondents define themselves as conservative yet acknowledge collective change towards moderna. A large segment locates itself between conservatism and modernity, signaling hybrid identities that reinterpret change as continuity. Political attitudes mirror this moral logic—trust in existing parties is moderate, but there is cautious openness to new “national Haredi” frameworks. Together, the data illustrate a community balancing adaptation and preservation through meaning reconstruction rather than ideological reversal. The Haredi public does not deny change—it reframes it as fidelity. In doing so, it offers a vivid case of collective moral regulation under social pressure, exemplifying how identity systems sustain coherence through reinterpretation rather than transformation.",

Statistical analyses were conducted to examine moderating roles of therapeutic context and support on presumed links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes. \nResults:\tData generally supported theorized associations among stressful life events, challenging psychedelic experiences, therapeutic context/support, and psychological outcomes. Therapeutic context mitigated associations of stressful life events with challenging experiences and of challenging experiences with coping, but not other associations. Interaction effects indicated that degree of therapeutic support moderated the association of challenging experiences with valence, impact on coping, and impact on well-being. In other regression models, therapeutic support maintained significant independent effects, but interaction effects were not found.  \nConclusion:\tTherapeutic context and degree of therapeutic support was found to moderate links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes.

This class-randomized, posttest-only trial (two intact sections) compared Project-Based Learning and Standards-Based Learning in a three-session budgeting unit delivered via Nearpod®. Sixth-grade students designed a class-trip budget (Project-Based Learning) or received structured lectures with practice activities (Standards-Based Learning). A 12-item posttest (7 multiple-choice + 5 open-ended) assessed vocabulary knowledge and applied reasoning. Project-Based Learning outperformed Standards-Based Learning on the combined score: Project-Based Learning n = 23, M = 6.65, SD = 1.40; Standards-Based Learning n = 25, M = 5.64, SD = 1.13; Welch’s t(42.39) = 2.74, p = .009; Hedges’ g = 0.78, 95% CI [0.19, 1.36]. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = .22) indicated notable class-level clustering, so student-level inferences are interpreted as exploratory. Findings provide causal evidence that even a brief, decision-focused Project-Based Learning intervention enhances comprehension and application of budgeting concepts more effectively than traditional instruction, highlighting the potential of project-based curricula as authentic and scalable approaches to strengthening middle-school financial literacy.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive dysfunction and emotional symptoms frequently co-occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the mechanisms linking these domains have yet to be clearly defined. One proposed pathway involves differences in emotion regulation (ER) strategy use, which may vary as a function of cognitive capacity.\nObjectives: To examine whether task-based executive functioning (EF) and self-reported functional cognitive impairment (FCI) are associated with anxiety, depression, and mental wellbeing in PD, and whether these relationships are mediated or moderated by ER strategies.\nMethods: 103 individuals with PD completed EF tasks, as well as self-report measures of FCI, ER strategy use, and mental health. Principal component analysis was used to derive EF components. Mediation and moderation analyses examined whether cognitive functioning predicted mental health through or in interaction with ER strategy use.\nResults: Worse FCI was directly associated with poorer mental health and linked to greater use of maladaptive strategies. Better task-based EF was indirectly associated with better mental health outcomes via increased use of adaptive ER strategies. The association between regulation strategies and mental health varied depending on cognitive capacity, suggesting that the effectiveness of specific strategies is contingent on underlying cognitive functioning.\nConclusions: These findings identify cognitive capacity as a key underpinning of ER and its relationship to mental health outcomes in PD. By delineating distinct contributions of functional and task-based cognition, this study advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying affective symptom expression in PD and highlights the cognitive context in which non-motor symptoms emerge.",

Using both person (N=392) and activity (N=1,179) level data, preregistered analyses tested whether hedonic and eudaimonic well-being emerge from alignment among these systems rather than from their independent effects. Type of activity engaged in showed no significant main effects (ps &gt; .15), whereas hedonic and eudaimonic motives were associated with corresponding forms of well-being (βs = .34–.59, ps &lt; .001). We found a motive–orientation congruence interaction for social well-being (β = .14, p = .015), and four small but interpretable personality–motive interactions (βs = ±.03–.09, ps &lt; .05) indicated that traits such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism calibrate motivational benefits.

Building on this legacy, the present study investigates how workers in a petrochemical facility navigate written procedures during everyday operations. Using head-mounted video recordings, we analyzed 1,422 procedural steps across 40 operations, comparing paper-based and digital procedures. A Skip-Order-Action (SOA) Framework is introduced to investigate deviations between WAI and WAD, moving beyond binary notions of compliance and non-compliance. Results showed that approximately one-third of steps deviated from prescribed methods, yet all tasks were completed successfully, underscoring the adaptive role of procedural variation. Analyses further revealed that the type of procedural variation (Skip, Order, Action) changed significantly depending on the operational phase. Crucially, variability was driven primarily by contextual factors, such as operational phase and procedural medium, rather than individual worker differences, emphasizing the systemic nature of adaptation. These findings provide empirical support for Hollnagel’s call to understand why work succeeds and demonstrate how procedural variability can be conceptualized as functional adaptation rather than error. By operationalizing Safety-II concepts through the SOA Framework, this study extends Hollnagel’s vision of safety as an emergent property of everyday work.",

          "authors": "Leon Patrick Wendt; Steffen Müller",
          "abstract": "The construct validity of psychometric measures is a foundation of credible psychological science, ensuring that measures reflect their intended theoretical constructs rather than unintended ones. Yet many conventional construct validation practices produce weak, uninformative evidence and fall short of the strong, risk-bearing tests emphasized by validity theorists. As a result, the available evidence is often insufficient to support meaningful claims about construct validity. To address this issue, we introduce a framework based on Meehl’s logic of hypothesis testing that can be used to evaluate the evidential value (or quality) of construct validation efforts. We define evidential value as the extent to which conducting a test of construct validity can shift confidence in the proposed construct interpretation of a measure over plausible alternative interpretations. Using this framework, we identify three conventional practices that contribute to low evidential value in construct validation: (a) treating theoretical constructs as conceptual placeholders, (b) relying on generic psychometric methods, and (c) performing post hoc revisions to the nomological network (i.e., employing the Lakatosian defense). This article demonstrates how using these practices allows virtually any psychometric measure to be portrayed as “validated”, while providing only nominal evidence of construct validity. We offer recommendations to help researchers design construct validation studies of high evidential value.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychedelic-assisted therapies show promise for MDD, PTSD, and addiction, yet mechanisms are often framed as 5-HT2A-centric, despite evidence of GABAergic pathology in these conditions.\nHypothesis (Author Perspective): As a chemist examining psychedelic pharmacology, I propose that inhibitory-circuit modulation acts as a necessary systems-level gate converting transient 5-HT2A activation into acute phenomenology and sustained plasticity.\nEvidence: (i) Provisional 1H-MRS indicates coordinated mPFC GABA-glutamate recalibration (GABA+ denotes macromolecule-containing edited signal; interpretation requires harmonized pipelines); (ii) critical-period reopening (2 days-4 weeks) outlasts receptor occupancy, implicating downstream gating; (iii) target disorders show robust GABAergic deficits.\nPredictions: This framework suggests ΔGABA+ should couple to network and gamma changes; post-acute GABA_A positive allosteric modulation (PAM) potentiation should truncate plasticity windows; baseline GABA+ may stratify response.\nImplications: This perspective suggests treating GABA as a potential gate, not the origin, and encourages integrating 7T MRS, PET, TMS-EEG, and pharmacological challenges.\nDisconfirmers: The hypothesis would be challenged by an absence of ΔGABA+-network coupling; failure of post-acute GABA_A PAMS to truncate plasticity windows; or no prognostic value of baseline GABA+ after harmonized analysis.\n\nNote: This hypothesis paper presents a cross-disciplinary perspective intended to stimulate neuroscience research. Empirical validation by systems neuroscience experts is required.",

People consistently map information across sensory modalities and conceptual domains. Such cross-sensory and cross-conceptual mappings have tended to be studied separately. We argue here that these mappings share underlying mechanisms and are more interconnected than previously thought. We present evidence that these mappings arise from a combination of statistical learning, magnitude matching, valence matching, and semantic mediation, involving an interplay between perception and conception. By bringing cross-sensory and cross-conceptual mappings into a common framework, we offer new insights into how people represent similarity and highlight promising avenues for understanding how humans discover and create connections across seemingly disparate domains.",

Constructs from self-regulatory and metacognitive models of rumination appeared among the most intervenable variables. Promotion focus and Negative beliefs about rumination had the greatest simulated impact. Negative beliefs also showed broad reach in its impact. Simulated intervention effects remained focal, and intervention order did not affect outcomes. We observed substantial individual variability in treatment response.\nConclusion. Control Theory offers a promising framework for identifying intervention targets. Findings underscore the importance of individual differences in rumination dynamics.",

Only 4.1% of tests (157 / 3,760) supported significant sex-differentiated manifestations of ADHD or its individual symptoms. ADHD and some of its symptoms (e.g., inattentive, impulsive, hyperactive) were more strongly associated with externalizing in boys than girls, but ADHD and other symptoms (i.e., inattentive, acted young) were also more associated with internalizing and thought problems in boys than girls. Most observed sex-differentiated manifestations were very small to small in magnitude, with only a handful emerging as large, suggesting sex-differentiated manifestations of ADHD may be the exception rather than the rule.",

          "authors": "Sixbert Sangwa",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Background: Traditional programmes across Sub-Saharan Africa have struggled to cultivate the agency and work-ready competences graduates need to meaningfully address the continent’s development priorities. Purpose: This study critically examines African Leadership University’s mission-driven, hybrid model, asking whether organising learning around personally defined “missions” rather than disciplinary majors measurably enhances student agency and post-graduation impact. Design/methodology/approach: A secondary, mixed-methods evaluation triangulated (i) ALU’s alumni-outcomes dataset covering 1,741 graduates from 2017-2024, (ii) continental statistics from UNESCO, Afrobarometer and the World Bank, and (iii) a systematic literature and policy review. Quantitative indicators were juxtaposed with thematic analysis of policy texts to assess alignment between institutional practice and regional reform agendas. Findings: ALU graduates achieved a 75% placement rate within six months (continental median ≈ 65 %), with 25–33 % founding ventures that collectively [i.e including students] generated more than 52,317 jobs—an estimated 121:1 job-creation multiplier. Ninety-five percent of employed alumni remained on the continent, countering “brain drain”. Qualitative evidence reveals heightened autonomy, intrinsic motivation and leadership competence attributable to a learning design that blends online mastery modules with mentored, real-world projects. Originality/value: By integrating Self-Determination Theory with the emergent Mission-Driven Learning Theory, the paper offers a falsifiable conceptual model in which mission clarity and mission-competence alignment jointly mediate the link between autonomy-supportive environments and graduate impact. The findings provide policy-relevant evidence that flexible accreditation “sandboxes” could mainstream mission-driven pedagogy and accelerate Africa’s skills revolution. For students who explicitly anchor their life missions in discipleship, success is defined as faithful stewardship and fruitfulness under God’s will rather than credential accumulation. Our analysis therefore treats alignment to a discerned vocation as both a motivational mechanism and a normative success criterion, consistent with Christian Scripture and with the model’s values-based element. Practical implications: Universities can embed mission-definition modules, mandatory internships and portfolio-based assessment to replicate key elements of the model, while governments should create regulatory space for purpose-centred curricular innovation.",

          "authors": "Johanna Prugger; Simone Kühn",
          "abstract": "Environmental psychology has extensively documented the restorative effects of nature: the recovery of cognitive resources and emotional well-being following stress or fatigue. Yet, the field may have overlooked instorative effects, where nature enhances functioning from a neutral baseline without prior depletion. We reviewed 54 studies (61 experiments, 19962024) investigating nature versus urban exposure effects on cognition, affect, and perceived restoration. Studies were categorized as explicit stressor (deliberate pre-exposure stress induction), implicit stressor (pre-exposure assessments likely inducing fatigue), or instorative (no prior stressor/assessment). Using an iterative, data-driven approach inspired by Grounded Theory, we analyzed study characteristics, exposure types, and the proportion reporting beneficial effects. Restorative studies vastly outnumbered instorative studies (45 vs. 8), revealing substantial research bias. Despite limited representation, instorative studies demonstrated high success rates: all cognition studies reported positive effects, while two-thirds examining affect showed benefits. Explicit stressor studies showed stronger effects than implicit stressor studies, suggesting dose-response relationships. Differentiating between instorative and restorative effects remains difficult, as no validated tools specifically assess instoration. The widely used Perceived Restorativeness Scale primarily measures general environmental benefits, conflating restoration and instoration. Studies predominantly employed young, Western samples and brief laboratory exposures, limiting ecological validity. The capacity of nature to enhance, rather than merely restore, functioning is underexplored. Future research should investigate instorative effects using ecologically valid paradigms with neutral baselines, refined theoretical models, standardized terminology, and appropriate questionnaires that distinguish between instorative and restorative effects.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

Identifying the most effective treatment for each individual is crucial to optimizing scarce resources.  \nAims\nTo evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a precision treatment trial comparing psychotherapy based on behavioral activation (the Healthy Activity Program) with antidepressant medication (fluoxetine) in adults with depression in primary care settings in India. \nMethods\nSingle-blind, two-arm randomized pilot trial in eight primary healthcare centers with adults (≥18 years) with moderate-severe depression (PHQ-9≥10). Primary outcomes assessed recruitment, retention, treatment adherence/fidelity, assessment completion, and safety procedures. Secondary outcomes included changes in depressive symptoms, remission, and patient-reported improvement at 3 months.\nResults\nOf 578 screened individuals, 76/180 eligible (42%) enrolled. Retention was 82% at 3 months. Psychotherapy participants attended 5.6/6-8 sessions, while medication participants consumed 57.9% of prescribed doses. Although assessment completion was high (72-100%), some measures proved burdensome, prompting refinements. Depressive symptoms improved across both arms, with 45.2% achieving remission. However, treatment responses varied substantially within each arm (psychotherapy: –9.1 [SD=6.5]; medication: –7.6 [SD=6.9]), indicating marked individual heterogeneity.\nConclusions\nThis pilot demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a precision treatment trial for depression in Indian primary care and identified refinements to optimize procedures for the main trial.

          "abstract": "Interpreting whether someone is showing romantic or sexual interest can be challenging, particularly when cues are ambiguous or when attention is influenced by visceral states such as physiological or emotional arousal. Building on previous findings linking sexual arousal to men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) when assessing women’s flirtatious intent, the present preregistered online study examined whether a similar cue-based judgment bias would emerge under nonsexual arousal. Using a key-press paradigm, heterosexual men (N = 275) completed a two-stage selection task in which they chose which of two women appeared more likely to be flirting with them. Stimuli were drawn from a validated image set and varied in global sexual (clothing style) and specific affective (facial expression) cues. Cue combinations were either congruent, potentially facilitating selection, or incongruent, thereby increasing selection difficulty. Between the two measurements, participants listened to a vividly narrated audio recording designed to elicit positively valenced nonsexual arousal. Reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) served as behavioral indicators of OGC. Consistent with previous research, participants showed longer RTs and higher ERs in incongruent compared to congruent trials, indicating higher selection difficulty in ambiguous contexts. However, nonsexual arousal did not reproduce the pronounced behavioral response pattern that had been observed under sexual arousal. The findings suggest that sexual arousal exerts unique effects on cue weighting in social judgments, highlighting the importance of specifying boundary conditions under which arousal alters cognitive processing.",

Participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse as the most preferred, least offensive, and most acceptable, whereas neurominority and neurospicy were least endorsed. The overall order of preferences was largely consistent across diagnostic groups, gender identities, and countries, though group-level differences emerged for specific terms. Dyslexic participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse less positively than other groups, while the Autism+ADHD group expressed the strongest endorsement of neurodivergent. Participants reported infrequent self-use of these labels, suggesting that while certain terms are broadly acceptable, they may not yet serve as primary identity markers.

Drawing on metascientific principles, we synthesize practical guidance for reviewers, editors, and authors, including the use of structured review prompts, explicit checks for analytic flexibility and adequacy of power, attention to sampling frames and context, and expectations for sharing data, code, and materials when ethically feasible. We also outline editorial policies that realign incentives toward inclusion and rigor, such as adopting formats that foreground methods and transparency, implementing calibrated decision criteria, and providing developmental feedback that supports authors at different stages and from diverse settings. Finally, we propose concrete steps for training, recognition, and accountability in review, along with indicators that departments, journals, and societies can track to monitor progress.

          "abstract": "Psychology faces crises of theory and measurement, where poorly specified constructs hinder the validity of measurement instruments. This article turns prior pleas to transparently explicate comprehensive construct definitions and accompanying measurement instructions into practice, using self-efficacy as an exemplary case. Drawing primarily on Bandura’s conceptualization, we explicate the key elements distinguishing self-efficacy from related constructs and examine implications for measurement. More importantly, this is the first time to introduce Narrative Response Models (NRMs) as a tool to describe and study how hypothesized processes that need to occur allow inferences about a psychological construct from the registered responses to an item used to assess that construct (in this case self-efficacy). Without this, there is no reason to assume the responses can tell anything about the construct: the item is invalid. Because NRMs as a tool were developed to justify confidence in the validity of an item, they explicate many underlying assumptions that warrant further investigation. In the case of self-efficacy, for example, the retrieval of gist traces and the simulation of what it takes to engage in the behaviour of interest. As such, NRMs provide scaffolding for the systematic study of a measurement instrument’s validity.",

In the future, it may be possible to develop hearing aids that monitor brain activity in real-time and adapt their output to the volitions of the user. In music, this could mean selectively amplifying the sound of the instrument the listener wants to hear. The first steps in this research is to determine whether machine learning can be used to identify which instrument an individual is listening to based only on a brief EEG signal. In this work, participants were presented with a series of brief tones that varied in timbre (Trombone, Clarinet, Cello, Piano and Pure Tone) while their ongoing EEG was recorded from 73 electrodes. To distinguish between EEG responses to the five different musical instruments, we investigated the use of three different classifiers – Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gradient Boosting (GB), and k-NN, and four different sets of features – raw EEG, ERP-based features, harmonics-based features and regularity-based features. N1 and P2 components of the ERP were analyzed for differences between instruments. All three classifiers performed significantly above chance (i.e., approximately 20% for 5 classes) when trained using the raw EEG features (LDA: 37%, GB: 35%, k-NN: 26%). It may be possible to improve these results with more advanced classification algorithms or different transformations of features. Statistical analysis found the Cello to have contributed to the largest P2 amplitude and Pure Tone to the smallest, and for Cello to have contributed to the earliest N1 latency and Clarinet the latest.",

Little is known about how concurrent instrument tones are processed subcortically, so that they can be perceptually segregated. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to understand how the timbre of one instrument impacts subsequent processing of that same instrument when combined with a second instrument, using the frequency following response (FFRs). Participants were presented with sequences that consisted of a priming tone that was either a guitar or a piano tone, immediately followed by a composite tone consisting of both instruments.  EEG data was averaged into two separate FFRs.  Both FFRs were evoked by the combined piano and guitar tone; the only difference between the two FFRs was which tone came first: guitar or piano. The FFR was analyzed using the strength of stimulus-to-response correlation (SRC) to both instrument tones in isolation and spectral power analyses at harmonic frequencies for each instrument in isolation. Results suggest instrument-specific neural priming. Guitar primed FFRs correlated more strongly with the guitar tone compared to the piano tone, (p&lt;.001, d=1.54). Guitar priming enhanced SRC between combined-tone responses and guitar stimuli compared to piano-primed conditions (p&lt;.001, d=0.76). Piano priming showed no significant SRC enhancement (p=0.29). Spectral analysis revealed instrument-specific enhancements: guitar priming increased spectral power at the harmonics in the guitar tone, while piano priming enhanced power at the harmonics in the piano, both p&lt;.001. These findings demonstrate timbre-based priming influences on the FFR and highlighting context sensitivity in early auditory processing.",

          "abstract": "Scientists, practitioners, journalists, and laypeople have expressed concerns about misinformation produced with generative artificial intelligence (AI), because AI can produce misinformation that appears more credible than misinformation produced by humans. Yet, little is known about how AI compares to humans in detecting misinformation. To address this question, two preregistered studies compared 15 major AI chatbots to human participants (N = 2,461) with regards to three factors (i.e., truth discernment, acceptance threshold, slant bias) in the detection of political misinformation (Exp. 1) and misinformation about vaccines (Exp. 2). The results show that, for both topics, AI chatbots discerned true from false information with much greater accuracy than U.S. Democrats and Republicans (political misinformation, Exp. 1) and human participants with favorable, unfavorable, or neutral vaccine attitudes (vaccine misinformation, Exp. 2). AI chatbots also outperformed the “wisdom of crowds”, an approach that has been shown to approximate veracity judgments of professional fact-checkers. At the same time, many AI chatbots showed large biases comparable to those of human participants, showing tendencies to accept or reject information regardless of veracity and tendencies to favor information with a certain slant. Overall, AI chatbots showed large variation in all three factors of misinformation detection. The results challenge conceptions of AI chatbots as hallucinating lie-machines, while drawing attention to biases and large differences between chatbots.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAnxiety and depression are the most common mental health conditions for children and young people (CYP). However, recommendations for treatment approaches vary. We aimed to identify the most effective interventions for treating CYP with anxiety and depression through an umbrella synthesis of recent literature.\n\nMethods\nFor this umbrella review (meta-analysis of meta-analyses) we conducted a search of five electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, PsycInfo, Web of Science, ASSIA) from 1 October 2017 to 1 October 2022. Eligible meta-analyses reported on interventions for CYP (≤18 years) with anxiety or depression and/or associated symptoms; prevention or risk studies were excluded. Summary data were manually extracted, and standardized effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were compared across interventions at different levels of specificity.\n\nFindings\nWe identified 42 meta-analyses (520 effect sizes); of these, 37 meta-analyses (378 effects) were included in statistical analyses. For anxiety, psychosocial (d = -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.57, -0.47], p &lt; 0.001) and pharmacological interventions (d = -0.60, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.45], p &lt; 0.001) were equally effective (t(17.00) = -1.58, p = 0.133). For depression, physical (d =  -0.50, CI [-0.61, -0.39], p &lt; 0.001) and psychosocial (d =  -0.35, CI [-0.39, -0.32], p &lt; 0.001) interventions were most effective, followed by pharmacological (d = -0.17, CI [-0.20, -0.15], p &lt; 0.001), (F(2, 32.3) = 41.0, p &lt; 0.001). Most interventions were more effective at treating CYP with anxiety than depression, including psychosocial (MD = -0.17, CI [-0.24, -0.09], t(295.29) = -4.29, p &lt; 0.001) and pharmacological interventions (MD = -0.66, CI [-1.04, -0.28], t(16.23) = -3.65, p = 0.002).\n\nInterpretation\nIn addition to psychosocial therapies, pharmacological interventions could be a first-line treatment for CYP with anxiety. The effectiveness of physical interventions for depression is a significant emerging finding, as is the comparatively limited effectiveness of pharmacological treatments; both should be reflected in practice guidelines. Future research should focus on understanding, developing, and providing more effective interventions for CYP with depression.\n\nFunding\nGates Cambridge Trust [#OPP1144].",

          "authors": "Ze Hong",
          "abstract": "The cognitive science of religion has predominantly framed ritual as goal-demoted and causally opaque, serving primarily affiliative functions. This paper challenges this dominant framework, arguing that it fails to account for magical rituals, which are explicitly goal-oriented from the practitioner's perspective. I propose the \"folk-technology model,\" which treats magic not as symbolic or opaque action but as an instrumental, problem-solving practice. The paper critiques the concept of \"irresolvable causal opacity\" by presenting three lines of evidence: first, the natural/supernatural dichotomy that underpins the concept of irresolvability is a modern Western construct often absent in the societies in question; second, many magical practices are underpinned by detailed, if scientifically inaccurate, causal theories; and third, the apparent lack of articulated theory among laypeople often reflects practical knowledge and a social distribution of expertise rather than inherent opacity. The folk-technology model is further supported by widespread ethnographic evidence of instrumental tinkering, efficacy testing, and pragmatic adaptation in practices ranging from Azande oracles and Melanesian cargo cults to contemporary AI divination. This reframing challenges classic dichotomies between technical and performative action, generates novel, testable predictions about the structure of magical systems, and revitalizes intellectualist theories of magic within a modern cognitive and (cultural) evolutionary context.",

          "authors": "Chun Ho Choi; Sin Man Kwan",
          "abstract": "Advanced societies face a paradox: unprecedented abundance coincides with declining motivation, fertility, and social engagement (Easterlin, 1995). Conventional explanations—economic stress, education, gender equality, and value shifts—describe outcomes but not the underlying regulatory mechanism linking individual motivation to civilizational trends. Existing theories remain siloed: neuroscience explains reward processing in individual brains, while demography documents population-level changes, yet no framework connects these scales of analysis (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Schultz, 2016).\nWe propose Chois’ Theory of Evolutionary Homeostasis (CTEH), which positions dopamine as the necessary starting point for modeling motivational transmission. This is not a reductionist claim, but a recognition that any theory of motivation must begin with the neurochemical that encodes the question, “Is this worth the effort?” (Volkow et al., 2011). CTEH’s eight tenets describe how dopaminergic adaptation to abundance propagates through cultural learning to produce civilizational cycles of motivation, fertility, and renewal.\nThe framework’s key innovation lies in defining the cultural–neurobiological interface of how individual reward sensitivity scales to population patterns through social learning and institutional amplification (Montague et al., 2006). Sustained abundance elevates dopamine baselines, dulling reward sensitivity and shifting behavior from effort-based striving to passive consumption and artificial stimulation (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016). As desensitization spreads, motivation wanes, fertility declines, and crisis restores contrast and renewal (Becker et al., 2023).\nWe validate this multi-scale model using fertility as the primary gateway, owing to robust demographic data and its direct neuroendocrine linkage to reward systems (Eisenegger et al., 2011; Elson et al., 2024). However, the same regulatory principles extend to disengagement in work, education, and relationships. Ultimately, this framework reframes societal decline as a predictable process of homeostatic regulation, suggesting that interventions should focus on restoring motivational contrast, not merely increasing material resources.",

          "abstract": "Many experiments in psychology involve deceiving participants about aspects of the study. Researchers who employ deception sometimes administer post-experiment suspicion probes and exclude participants from analysis if their responses indicate that they were not successfully deceived. However, several studies have found that their suspicious participants behave as if they were deceived as intended. One explanation is that participants infer that they were deceived upon being presented with a suspicion probe, which biases them to overreport being suspicious. We tested whether post-experiment beliefs about deception can indeed induce such biases by manipulating whether we admitted to using deception before administering suspicion probes. Admitting to deception did not increase the amount of suspicion reported (Experiment 1), nor did the content of participants’ suspicions reflect the content of our admission (Experiment 2). Results suggest that it is unlikely that suspicion probes ‘tip off’ participants in a way that causes them to overreport suspicion.",

In two experiments (total N = 186), we test this account by utilising methods and theory of metacognition – which also describes a second-order process that regulates the operation of first-order cognition. We analyse which internal cues influence confidence and accuracy, and how the consistency of cues influences confidence, accuracy, and participants changing their answers. Confidence judgements were not sensitive to belief-logic conflict when other cues were accounted for, contrary to prior research. Instead, overall cue consistency was more important for determining confidence and response changes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current dual process accounts of reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 10-20% of U.S. adolescents report past-year cannabis use (CU). Although regular CU beginning in adolescence is expected to have a blunting effect on the dopamine system, safety concerns about methods like positron emission tomography have precluded testing this hypothesis in adolescents. However, dopamine neurophysiology can be noninvasively indexed via subcortical tissue iron measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examined adolescent CU quantity, frequency, and problems in relation to tissue iron in regions with high dopamine activity, hypothesizing an inverse relationship to reflect the aforementioned blunting effect. Adolescents (n=81) aged 14-17 who reported either fewer than 5 lifetime cannabis episodes (n=47) or more than 11 episodes (n=34), with limited alcohol and nicotine use and no other illicit substance use, completed substance use assessments and an MRI. We calculated the inverse of the normalized T2* measurement (1/nT2*; lower values indicate less tissue iron) from preprocessed resting-state functional scans by assessing relative T2* decay. Tissue iron levels were estimated for the ventral tegmental area (VTA), bilateral thalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and pallidum using subcortical masks. Lower tissue iron was associated with increased daily concentrate hits and hours high, CU sessions, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) severity in linear mixed models. Post-hoc analyses highlighted the VTA as a key region. Our results align with findings of blunted dopamine neurophysiology associated with CU in adult and animal samples, and have implications for understanding adolescent CUD development. Measuring brain tissue iron offers an innovative, non-invasive method to index dopamine neurophysiology in adolescent CU.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The US is facing a well-documented caregiving crisis, with more aging adults requiring informal caregiving at home and fewer young people available to support them. This paper estimates the current economic value of care provided by unpaid adolescents (ages 10 to 17) to family members who are chronically ill, disabled, or facing aging-related decline.\nMethods: We leverage large-scale, national datasets to estimate the economic value of informal caregiving provided by adolescents nationally and at the state level. \nResults: We estimate that adolescents provide by $15.01 billion (range = $5.38 to $41.63 billion) worth of informal caregiving work nationally. These estimates correspond to up to 8.86% of the $470 billion value of informal unpaid caregiving by adults, and up to 1.09% of the US total health care expenditure. State-specific estimates show substantial variability. \nDiscussion: Adolescents contribute substantially to the annual US economy by providing informal unpaid caregiving for their families. This information can inform the design of targeted polices and programs to support adolescents’ health and the health of the family members they care for. \nImplications and Contribution. This study highlights the substantial informal family caregiving adolescents provide to the US economy. We estimate adolescents contribute $15.01B in annual caregiving services, with implications for public health. Supporting caregiving adolescents and their families is crucial given the scope and impact of their work, and the shortage of family caregivers in the US.",

A key concern is that norm-violating candidates at lower levels may ascend to higher office, posing broader risks to democratic stability. This study examines whether voters are more or less likely to defect from co-partisan norm violators at lower levels of office. Across two preregistered survey experiments with 5,000 U.S. respondents, we find that defection rates remain consistent across local, state, and federal races, regardless of the number or type of violations. These findings suggest two interpretations: optimistically, voters are not more forgiving of norm violations in lower-level elections; pessimistically, even where the stakes appear lower, voters are also no more likely to hold norm violators accountable. Our results are consistent with the nationalization of voting behavior and the risk of a candidate pipeline that enables norm violators to rise unchecked.",

          "abstract": "Context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice are pervasive and yet, paradoxically, elusive at the same time. For example, simple changes to the spatial layout of alternatives on the screen can nullify or reverse the effects. Despite the success of dynamic decision models in explaining the occurrence of context effects, a coherent theory for understanding their elusiveness is currently lacking. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that relies on attention modulated comparisons to explain the elusive nature of context effects. We show via simulation that our model produces the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects simply by assuming that more time is spent comparing alternatives that are more similar. However, when more time is spent comparing dissimilar alternatives, model simulations reveal a reversal of the attraction and compromise effects. The empirical support for this model-based prediction is assessed by manipulating similarity-based attention in separate experiments for the three context effects (total N = 887). Further, by allowing the spatial organization of information to constrain the attention process, the model can explain changes in context effects induced by display layout. We show that the model's spatial attention mechanism allows it to capture presentation order effects in a reanalysis of previously published data. Finally, we develop a continuous approximation of the full model that permits fitting of choices and response times. In summary, the proposed framework provides a new tool for understanding not only the existence of context effects in choice, but also the attentional factors that lead to null or reversed context effects.",

Sentence completions were collected in two online studies in which participants completed sentence beginnings with a single-word response after either hearing (auditory sample, N = 133) or reading (visual sample, N = 98) the sentence beginning. All responses were manually preprocessed to correct typos and spelling mistakes and to label grammatical errors, proper nouns, and singular and plural variants of the same response. In addition to the sentence norms, we provide trial-level data with participant-level demographic information and subclinical autistic and schizotypal trait measures. Together with open access R-Scripts or our webtool, this allows for tailoring the cleaning and norming steps to integrate individual difference measures. For a subset of 479 sentence beginnings, the database also includes professional audio recordings of sentence beginnings which can be flexibly combined with 531 recordings of unique sentence-final words and implemented in auditory language paradigms.

Previous literature shows that such phonetic learning is often speaker-specific for certain speech sounds (e.g., fricatives) --- it does not transfer to novel speakers, possibly because fricatives contain spectral properties that cue speaker identity. However, recent research shows that  transfer to a novel sound contrast can occur within a single speaker, suggesting that there is room for transfer of learning to a novel speaker with a sufficiently similar pronunciation. This study examines the transfer of phonetic learning for an atypical fricative pronunciation to novel speakers, focusing on the mechanisms that underlie such perceptual adaptation. Results of a series of experiments show that transfer of phonetic learning can occur to both novel speakers and novel phonetic contrasts. Results suggest that listeners may use a more targeted mechanism when generalizing learning to novel speakers, with acoustic similarity being a possible predictor of learning transfer.",

          "authors": "Dave Kenneth Tayao Cayado; Kathleen Rastle",
          "abstract": "The majority of words across the world’s languages are composed of smaller meaningful units called morphemes (e.g., mis-trust-ful-ness). Research over the past 50 years has shown that such words are processed through morphological analysis—the decomposition of complex words into their meaningful subparts. While psycholinguistics has made significant progress in understanding this process during reading, most evidence comes from a narrow range of languages and morphological types. In this paper, we quantify linguistic and typological diversity in morphological processing and acquisition research from 1975 to 2025. Articles were coded for language(s), morphological type(s), participant type, and publication year. Our survey revealed that about 40% of the studies come from English and about 74% come from Indo-European languages (e.g., French, Spanish, German). We also found that about 53% of the studies focused on suffixation, the most frequent morphological process in English. We argue that this narrow scope limits theoretical progress. Many languages form complex words through reduplication, infixation, circumfixation or nonlinear morphology that differ structurally from English suffixation, and that pose learning and processing challenges that would not arise in English. We conclude that expanding linguistic diversity is necessary for building a more comprehensive account of morphological learning and processing.",

          "authors": "Ashish Kumar Sahoo; Steven Marc Weisberg",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation requires learning environments larger than what can be perceived at one time, requiring the integration of distinct episodes into one representation. Modern theories postulate hierarchical models of space, in which environments are mentally segmented, allowing more precise navigation within subregions and less precise strategies across them. But how does space become segmented into subregions? Segmentation, a component of many domains in human cognition, is the process by which a continuous stream of input is divided into chunks. In spatial navigation, segmentation often leverages natural divisions, like rivers or highways. Here, we hypothesize that temporal segmentation, a powerful organizer of information thought to support event cognition (Zacks &amp; Swallow, 2007), could play a role in segmenting space as well. To test this hypothesis, in a carefully controlled virtual environment experiment, participants learned landmarks around a square virtual environment in two temporally separated sessions designed to elicit temporal divisions during learning while controlling other factors. We then queried participants’ spatial (and non-spatial) memories for evidence of temporal segmentation across multiple behavioral measures. We found a gradient of temporal segmentation effects: measures more likely to depend on time, like free recall and distance judgments, were more affected by temporal segmentation, while measures more likely to depend on space (pointing judgments and maps) were less affected. Results support the notion that temporal segmentation is task-dependent, with variable effects on spatial memory. We interpret our findings in the context of theories of hippocampal encoding of space and time.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the association between structural properties of the human brain and individual differences in behavior is an ongoing endeavor, challenged by the brain’s complexity. Past approaches, limited by simplistic neural structure measures like brain volume or cortical thickness, have given way to more advanced modeling approaches. Empirical evidence using these simpler metrics occasionally shows that hippocampal structure relates to individual variation in spatial navigation ability, particularly for older individuals or for expert navigators (like London taxi drivers). Yet high-powered, pre-registered studies in typical younger adults revealed no association between hippocampal volume and navigation ability. Here, we follow a data-driven approach developing and comparing deep learning methods (graph convolution neural networks, GCNN; 3DCNN) to analyze whether complex aspects of brain structure predict spatial navigation ability in young populations. To that end, we trained GCNNs and 3DCNNs on a T1 MRI dataset (N=90) to predict navigational ability as measured by an objective virtual reality test of spatial memory in which participants created as accurate a map as they could of a highly realistic virtual environment. Across all approaches, we found weak predictive value in held-out test data, despite good fits to training data. These results could indicate the need for much larger datasets, including more comprehensive behavioral measures (as this study was limited to one measure) to improve predictability but may also support the notion that hippocampal structural features may not be a primary factor associated with navigation ability in healthy younger adults.",

          "abstract": "Can exposure to forgiving behavior improve cooperative outcomes, and does Rejection Sensitivity (RS) moderate this\neffect? This randomized controlled experiment explores these questions using a novel approach with Hidden Markov\nModel (HMM)-based artificial agents in repeated trust games (RTGs). Participants (N = 206), pre-screened for high\nor low RS, interacted with either consistently behaving or more forgiving co-players, which were in reality HMM\nagents. Unexpectedly, exposure to forgiving agents led to reduced cooperation in subsequent interactions. Control\ngroup participants maintained consistent behavior. RS levels influenced perceptions of the agent’s cooperativeness but\ndid not significantly affect behavioral outcomes, revealing a perception-behavior dissociation. These findings challenge\nassumptions about fostering cooperation through simple exposure to positive interactions and highlight the importance\nof accounting for negative contrast effects when designing such interventions. They also demonstrate the potential of\nHMM-based artificial agents for studying interactive social dynamics, offering a methodological advancement for future\nresearch.",

          "authors": "Steven Verheyen; Tom Heyman",
          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

While school-based mindfulness training (SBMT) offers a scalable prevention approach with broad reach, evidence of its effectiveness is mixed, and there is a compelling case for a more personalized approach to prevention.\n\nObjective: To develop a data-driven algorithm from baseline characteristics to predict which adolescents are most likely to benefit from SBMT.\n\nDesign: Secondary analysis of the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) cluster randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016-2018. School-level nested cross-validation was used to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting individualized benefit from SBMT.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included. Students had to be enrolled in participating schools with parental consent and student assent. The sample was 55% female, 76% White ethnicity, with mean age 12.2 years.\n\nInterventions: SBMT teaching core mindfulness skills through psychoeducation, class discussion, and practices, compared to standard social-emotional learning (teaching-as-usual; TAU).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Change in depressive symptoms from pre- to post-intervention measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Causal forest (CF) and elastic net regression (ENR) models computed Personalized Advantage Index scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: CF showed acceptable calibration (mean Best Linear Predictor slope = 0.78, SE = 0.15), while ENR demonstrated modest predictive performance (r = 0.29; R² = 0.09; RMSE = 10.3). Both the CF and ENR models identified a subset of adolescents predicted to benefit from SBMT, but group differences in outcomes were negligible (CF: d = 0.07, p = .007; ENR: d = 0.08, p = .004). Top predictive features from the CF model were symptom severity (e.g., low-to-moderate depression and anxiety predicted greater SBMT benefit) and several school factors with non-linear patterns. ENR emphasized school-level characteristics with minimal differentiation.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning identified a subgroup with statistically detectable but clinically trivial differential intervention response. These findings highlight the substantial challenges in achieving clinically useful personalization in universal school-based prevention programs.",

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with nearly 5 billion users worldwide. Its ubiquity has sparked concerns about the potential effects on sleep, particularly among young people. Previous research has generally shown that greater social media engagement is associated with poorer sleep outcomes, such as later bedtimes and longer sleep onset latency. However, most evidence is cross-sectional, limiting causal claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal studies published in the last five years examining the impact of social media use on subsequent sleep in young people. In accordance with cross-sectional findings, the majority of studies (~70%) provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use, including at bedtime. These findings inform professional recommendations, including strategies to reduce problematic use to improve sleep outcomes in youth. Yet implementation may be challenging, as adolescents often resist device restrictions and family contexts vary widely, highlighting the need for flexible approaches. Methodological limitations of the reviewed studies further constrain conclusions. Many studies rely on self-reports and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep. Future studies should employ validated measures and move beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how content, patterns of problematic use, and the timing of social media use influence sleep longitudinally. Studies must also address the complexity of this relationship and consider bidirectional pathways and interactions with other key variables such as neurodiversity, socioeconomic status and mental health.",

          "authors": "Haoyu Zhou; Fabienne Chetail; Louisa Bogaerts",
          "abstract": "Our language environment is rich in statistical structure. It is therefore natural to hypothesize that statistical learning (SL) —the ability to detect regularities in the environmental input— contributes to the efficient processing of written text and supports literacy skills. Some prior studies reported correlations between SL as a general ability and reading, while others found null effects. We propose that this link may be better revealed by measuring individuals’ learning of orthographic statistical patterns, a type of regularity more directly relevant to literacy. This study examined how sensitivity to bigram frequency in participants’ first language (L1, French) and the ability to learn novel bigrams through exposure relate to literacy outcomes. The measures showed moderate to good reliability (L1 sensitivity: r = .60; novel orthographic learning: r = .84) and were significantly associated with spelling, but not reading. Notably, sensitivity to bigram frequency was not significantly associated with orthographic learning performance and did not mediate the link between orthographic learning and spelling. These findings suggest that different aspects of sensitivity to existing and newly acquired orthographic patterns independently support spelling abilities in French, without extending to reading performance.",

We note challenges of transdermal assessment, together with recent performance gains from updated devices and analytic tools, including machine learning. We indicate unanswered questions for transdermal technology, including whether devices might ultimately produce fine-grained drinking quantity estimates and device longevity. We further identify factors that can impede development of new objective measures, including the tendency to judge new tools against an implicit ideal and consider scientific findings divorced from methodological details. Finally, in evaluating transdermal and other objective measurement tools, we argue for consideration of the specific error type (random vs systematic) generally linked with novel vs existing tools, identifying measurement diversification as a priority for clinical psychology moving forward.",

The study included two experiments. Each paid a treatment group a two-pound reward if they increased their performance on a subsequent IQ test after an initial test. The estimated effects of effort were not significantly different from zero in either experiment.\n\nI argue that this conclusion commits the statistical non-significance fallacy—just because an effect size is not significantly different from zero does not mean that the effect really is zero. Confidence intervals reported in the study are too large for strong inferences to be made. This is in part because the sample size (1,737) and financial incentives offered are too small. I estimate the study would need a sample size around four times larger, at 6,500 participants, to have 80% power to reject the null, if the true effect of effort were moderate in size. Nevertheless, I find that by incorporating sensible control variables (such as IQ from the initial test) or by pooling data with a prior study (Bates &amp; Gignac, 2022), a significant effect of effort can be found. Confidence intervals in my re-analysis are very large, making the magnitude of the effect of effort uncertain.",

The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

Statistical Learning (SL) supports speech segmentation through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables, and individual differences in SL ability were found predictive of further language development. The current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; the ability to perceive the beat and infer the meter in a rhythmic stimulus auditory input) correlated with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm in a quadruple meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with entrainment to the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed behavioral tasks measuring their RA and were asked about their engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a correlation between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This correlation was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting similarity between processing items at hierarchically corresponding levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appeared to have a positive effect on infant RA.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we present Radical Embodied Memory (REM), a new theory of memory grounded in the\ncommitments and concepts of radical embodiment. First, we distinguish between the conceptual\nfoundations of mainstream cognitive neuroscience and radical embodied cognitive neuroscience and\ndescribe what it means for a theory of memory to be “radically embodied”. Specifically, we argue that\nREM is radically embodied insofar as it explains memory using the conceptual resources of neural reuse,\nneural resonance, environmental coordination, and dynamical systems theory instead of the mainstream\nmemory concepts of stimulus, encoding, storage and retrieval. Using the sorts of models proposed in\ndynamical systems theory, REM posits that memories are previously traversed locations in the state space\nof the brain-body-environment system. The activity of remembering is then that system’s dynamics\nmoving back to those locations. We then survey key findings from the memory neuroscience literature\nand reinterpret the results through the lens of REM. Namely, we explain the role of the hippocampus and\ncortico-hippocampal interactions, amnesia, relational memory, and memory consolidation using this new\nframework. We end with a discussion on the practical implications of modelling memory as distributed\nacross the brain-body-environment system, including new hypotheses and considerations for experimental\ndesign. In doing so, we hope to provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the cognitive\nneuroscientist interested in studying memory as radically embodied.",

This study aimed to explore perspectives on HIVST, identify barriers and facilitators to HIVST uptake, and provide recommendations to inform effective implementation among a diverse group of 26 SSAM and 13 key informants in the Netherlands through semi-structured interviews. Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants’ perspectives on HIVST centered on three themes: enhanced autonomy in decision-making and testing processes; navigating autonomy and support for self-testing and care linkage; and HIVST within the Dutch context and prevention landscape. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was subsequently employed as a post-hoc interpretive framework to map study findings within a broader implementation context. Factors potentially influencing successful uptake and implementation were identified across multiple CFIR domains, including perceived relative advantage over facility/clinic-based testing, evidence on reliability, and procedural complexity (Innovation Characteristics); low self-efficacy, self-testing and linkage to care support needs (Individual Characteristics); HIV stigma, limited awareness and low visibility of HIVST (Outer Setting); and perceived incompatibility with existing healthcare systems (Inner Setting). Although HIVST can address key testing barriers among SSAM, targeted implementation strategies are needed to guarantee equitable access, proper use, and optimal outcomes. These include enhanced dissemination of HIVST information, normalization of HIV testing and self-testing, provision of person-centered support, and establishing clear pathways for timely care linkage when required.",

Methods: We collected our data through an online survey. Adults’ social media users could participate in our study. We conducted a cross-sectional study during July 2024 in Greece. We gauged personality with the Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI‐10), and social media addiction with the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to eliminate confounding. Results: The personality trait “extraversion” was related with increased social media addiction (adjusted beta = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.69, p-value = 0.005). Moreover, the personality trait “agreeableness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.62, 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.32, p-value &lt; 0.001). In addition, the personality trait “conscientiousness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.80, 95% CI = -1.04 to -0.57, p-value &lt; 0.001). Levels of social media addiction was higher among females (adjusted beta = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.07 to 3.36, p-value &lt; 0.001). Decreased age was associated with increased social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.09, 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.04, p-value = 0.001). Conclusion: We found a positive relationship between the personality trait “extraversion” and social media addiction. On the contrary, we found a negative relationship between the personality traits “agreeableness” and “conscientiousness” with social media addiction. Personality traits affect levels of social media addiction among individuals, and therefore policy makers and healthcare professionals in mental health should take into their consideration the personality of social media users.",

However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

          "abstract": "While prevailing theories suggest social interaction difficulties are inherent to autism, the theory of the double empathy problem (DEP) proposes these difficulties arise from a mismatch between different neurotypes. The theory predicts more challenging communication between individuals with and without autism, but better communication among individuals with autism. While individuals with autism indeed report better communication, experimental studies testing the theory are largely lacking. In this study, 106 adults (55 with autism) completed an empathic accuracy task in which they watched video clips of an interaction between an individual with and without autism and inferred the individuals’ thoughts. Contrary to our hypothesis, adults with autism were not better at estimating the thoughts of other adults with autism. Instead, they were generally less accurate than adults without autism. Individuals with autism were also perceived as more difficult to estimate. In conclusion, this study did not find support for the DEP theory. Further research is needed to understand the reported ease of communication among individuals with autism.",

          "abstract": "Interoception, the processing of internal bodily states, contributes to human behaviour through multiple cognitive and affective processes, including emotional regulation and decision-making. It also constitutes a key variable in a range of psychopathological processes. Yet, its core phenomenological dimension, namely how bodily sensations are subjectively experienced, remains understudied. Bodily mapping offers a promising method to address this gap, but existing tools do not allow for a fine-grained assessment of the various dimensions of bodily sensations. Here, we introduce InteroMap, an open-access, open-source tool that enables rigorous and comprehensive assessment of self-reported interoceptive phenomenology. InteroMap comprises (1) a precise drawing interface that combines valence and intensity ratings, (2) front and back views of the body, (3) clear anatomical landmarks for accurate localization, (4) a correction feature, and (5) a post-processing platform to support data visualization and standardization. In a preregistered study (N = 654), we compared InteroMap with the tool most used to assess bodily sensations: emBODY. Our findings show that InteroMap has strong construct validity and outperformed emBODY on convergent, concurrent, and response process validity, as well as on several user experience metrics. InteroMap therefore represents significant progress in the study of interoceptive phenomenology. This tool opens new avenues for testing theoretical models that posit a central role for bodily sensations in healthy and pathological psychological functioning.",

The public’s marked interest in this issue prompted us to look at social representations of peace in Cameroon through the prism of religious commitment. Adopting a structural approach to social representations, we conducted a study among respondents with different levels of religious commitment (N = 156). Data collected via free association and characterization questionnaires were submitted to hierarchical and Q-sort analyses. Results indicated that unity is the factor that best characterizes peace. A comparative analysis of the organization of representations between groups with different levels of religious commitment failed to reveal any major differences. Based on the elements identifed by participants, we argue that proximity to the object is the main factor underlying the construction of social representations of peace in Cameroon.",

          "abstract": "Successful task-switching performance is thought to rely on inhibitory mechanisms suppressing no-longer-relevant tasks, indexed by the n–2 repetition cost. Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "Serial dependence is a phenomenon in which current perception is attracted to the immediately preceding perception and is thought to reflect a mechanism for stabilizing perception by integrating information over successive moments. It has been demonstrated across a variety of stimuli and has also been observed in the numerosity perception. A previous study suggested that cross-modal serial dependence in numerosity perception from audition to vision did not occur. However, differences in the stimulus presentation format might have prevented serial dependence from emerging. Therefore, we employed a standardized temporal presentation format consisting of sequences of white noise and visual flashes. As a result, we observed bidirectional cross-modal serial dependence between audition and vision. This result highlights the critical role of presentation format in cross-modal serial dependence. Furthermore, this effect was still observed when inducer stimuli was presented at different spatial positions, in contrast to previous studies on serial dependence within the visual modality. These findings suggest the involvement of a higher-level processing stage. Specifically, a representation that is not selective to specific modality or strictly tied to spatial position, although it remains selective to presentation format, may be involved in the observed effect.",

          "abstract": "Young children are often faced with referentially ambiguous situations, where they hear a novel word and are uncertain about the intended referent in the cluttered visual scenes they encounter daily. In the current study, we examined the extent to which children infer that a novel label refers to an object of greater interest to them relative to an object of lesser interest. Thirty-four 30- to 36-month-old children participated in an eyetracking task. First, we examined children’s interest in objects from four semantic categories using three measures of interest: the relative amount of time children spent looking at the novel objects from the different categories, pupillary arousal to familiar objects from the different categories, and pupillary arousal to the novel objects. We then measured children’s target looking in a following test phase. We found that children’s interest in a novel object – as indexed by the looking time – predicted children’ mapping of a novel label with this object. Children mapped the previously heard novel label to their object of interest, and showed a different pattern of looking when presented with a supernovel label. Furthermore, parents’ evaluation of children’s interest in the category to which the object belonged modulated children’s word-object mapping, highlighting the interplay between children’s situational interest in a novel object and their individual interest in the category of the object. We consider the social environment in which such a hit-and-miss strategy could yield successful learning in early development, highlighting the role of children’s interests in driving vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nAlthough major depressive disorder (MDD) is known to have a high societal burden, little is known about the costs associated with the remission phase. Many individuals in remission experience residual symptoms that may impact functioning, productivity, and healthcare use. This study aimed to estimate the societal cost of individuals in remission from MDD in Belgium.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 138 adults in remission from MDD completed questionnaires assessing healthcare use (iMCQ) and productivity loss (WPAI:GH) over the past three months. Unit costs were applied to estimate annual costs. Descriptive analyses with bias-corrected bootstrap intervals were used. Generalized linear models with a log-link function and Tweedie distribution examined predictors of total, direct and indirect costs.\n\nResults\n\nMean annual societal cost per person was €5388.43 (BCa 95% CI: €3563–8875.05), including €1767.84 (BCa 95% CI: 1148.18–3927.78) in direct costs and €3620.59 (BCa 95% CI: €2142.32–6581.60) in indirect costs. In the final model predicting total societal costs, older age was associated with higher costs (+4.50% per year, p = .001). Sex and education were not significant predictors. Remission duration over 12 months was linked to lower total costs (–67.95%, p = .01) compared to less than 6 months.\n\nConclusions\n\nRemission from MDD continues to impose substantial societal costs, mostly due to reduced work participation. These findings highlight that remission does not equate to full recovery, emphasizing the need for future research into the cost-effectiveness of maintenance and relapse prevention strategies in remitted depression",

The present study experimentally investigated the perception of criticism in French, and examined the role of social distance, power, and of ranking of imposition using a Discourse Evaluation Test in the form of a judgment task. Participants rated short discourse stimuli on Likert scales assessing perceived politeness, perceived offense and disposition to change the behavior criticized. In Experiment 1, we investigated how participants judged bare direct criticisms versus direct criticisms with a marker of positive politeness. In Experiment 2, we compared judgments of bare direct criticisms and indirect criticisms. We also evaluated the impact of the interindividual variables of age, empathy and gender. Results from both experiments confirmed that ranking of imposition was a crucial factor for the perception of criticism. They also indicated that the gender of participants impacted their perception of criticism, as did their level of empathy. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the factors shaping the perception of criticism, in particular on the role of ranking of imposition, thus contributing to broaden our perspective on this crucial speech act.",

          "authors": "Guy Hochman",
          "abstract": "Why do intelligent, well-informed individuals persist in biased reasoning and polarization? Rather than viewing these phenomena as cognitive failures, this paper proposes that rationalization serves an adaptive regulatory function, a form of cognitive homeostasis that maintains psychological coherence when beliefs, emotions, and identity collide. The Homobiasos framework reconceptualizes bias as part of a homeostatic system analogous to physiological regulation, balancing stability and adaptation across cognitive and affective domains.\nDrawing on evidence from decision science, moral psychology, and affective neuroscience, Homobiasos proposes three recursive processes: (1) conflict detection, where dissonant information triggers affective discomfort; (2) regulatory integration, where intuitive and deliberative processes collaborate to restore equilibrium; and (3) narrative consolidation, where reinterpretation stabilizes coherence even at the cost of accuracy. This model predicts that deliberation amplifies rather than corrects bias under identity threat, cognitive sophistication facilitates motivated reasoning, and interventions targeting affective regulation (e.g., self-affirmation, trust-building) outperform accuracy incentives.\nBeyond human cognition, parallels with machine learning systems suggest that homeostatic regulation may constitute a general principle of adaptive intelligence. Reframing rationalization as cognitive homeostasis shifts the question from “why do people deviate from rationality?” to “how do people regulate trade-offs between competing economic, emotional, and identity utilities?” Bias, under this view, is not a flaw to eliminate but a mechanism sustaining psychological integrity amid complexity and uncertainty.",

Participants self-reported transitions from coldness, fatigue, and pain to sensations of warmth, calmness, and relaxation. Although uncontrolled and qualitative in nature, these observations complement findings from laboratory studies showing the influence of low-frequency vibratory and chanting exposures on heart rate variability, brain hemodynamics, and subjective stress.

          "abstract": "Many common conceptualizations of emotion assume that hedonic tone and motivations to approach or avoid are tightly coupled. Though this view has strong heuristic value, it can fail to differentiate classes of emotion that have similar valence but differing behavioral goals. Threats to personal safety may reliably elicit escape or avoidance. By contrast, cues of suffering in others can elicit competing or mixed motivational states, including prosocial approach. We characterized patterns of valence and motivational direction in response to images of suffering, threat, and interpersonal harm, as well as positive images with and without social content. Participants were 229 undergraduate students who reported their reactions using unipolar dimensions of felt positivity, negativity, approach, and avoidance. In comparison to threat (r = .77), we found that suffering (r = .31) elicited a weaker correlation between valence and motivational direction, and more pronounced coactivation of approach–avoidance states, despite similar levels of negative valence. Images of harm, which combined visual elements of suffering and threat, showed intermediate patterns of avoidance motivation. Across participants, higher trait empathy was associated with greater approach to suffering, while empathy and agreeableness were associated with more extreme valence responses across images. These findings offer novel evidence that motivational direction and valence are separable features of emotional experience and highlight the role of person–situation interactions in shaping the dimensional structure of affect.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "Cultural exchange has been a hallmark of human history, yet it is not always positively received. In particular, people sometimes express strong disapproval toward other groups' use of cultural elements they consider their own—a reaction commonly referred to as cultural appropriation. Prior research attributes such responses to power asymmetries or concerns about identity distinctiveness. However, we argue that such derogation can also arise in the context of shared culture, and is not fully explained by these group-based factors. Instead, we propose that a set of lay beliefs known as cultural essentialism—the belief that culture is inherent, stable, and exclusive—plays a critical role. Across four studies (total N = 3,371) conducted in East Asian cultural contexts, we show that cultural essentialism is associated with (Studies 1–2) and causally increases (Studies 3–4) negative evaluations of outgroup engagement with shared cultural practices. This effect is mediated by collective psychological ownership threat and further amplified when the outgroup is perceived as culturally similar (Studies 2 and 4). Importantly, the effect of cultural essentialism persists above and beyond the influence of ingroup identification, outgroup attitude, and distinctiveness threat. Studies 3–4 additionally demonstrate that cultural essentialism promotes more exclusive cultural behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that cultural essentialism contributes to intergroup cultural tension by activating ownership-related concerns, independent of cultural identity or power asymmetry.",

In response to this challenge, deliberative democracy, which emphasizes civil and diverse discussions that empower individuals to make well-informed decisions by critically evaluating competing arguments, has garnered increasing attention. Existing literature initially supports deliberative democracy as a societal norm capable of addressing affective polarization. We further propose that deliberative democracy as a set of lay beliefs may also mitigate outgroup derogations on public issues. Through four studies conducted in the Chinese context (N = 1634), we first developed a measurement of beliefs in deliberative democracy, then got support for our main propositions, verified opinion extremity as boundary conditions, and receptiveness to opposing views as a partial mediation. The findings highlight the potential of reshaping public beliefs through education and policy interventions to cultivate a healthier and more inclusive democracy.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising cost-effective alternative for assessing public opinion. However, most prior research has focused on simulating individual personas using past surveys, leaving it unclear whether LLMs can accurately estimate out-of-sample public opinion at the societal level. We address this gap with three studies that systematically evaluate the accuracy, bias, and variability of commercial and non-commercial LLMs in inferring societal-level public opinion. First, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four recent Pew Research Centre polls, finding that both models outperformed traditional baseline methods, with GPT-4 showing higher accuracy, with an error rate ranging from 4% to 9%. Notably, GPT-3.5 produced overly uniform responses characterized by lower variance and higher entropy compared to actual human data, whereas GPT-4’s predictions more closely mirrored real response patterns. Both models, however, exhibited partisan skew, aligning more strongly with Democratic perspectives and underrepresenting Republican viewpoints. Second, we assessed the generalisability of these findings by testing various models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3) on three additional Pew surveys. These models demonstrated similar predictive accuracy and a continued tendency toward less varied responses, though partisan bias was less pronounced in the latest models. Third, we examined the robustness of our findings through ablation studies of prompt design by varying parameters such as temperature, role, and input format and found that the results were consistent across these conditions. Importantly, collective-level estimation consistently outperformed averaged individual-level simulation, which suffered from greater homogeneity bias. Overall, LLMs show strong potential for public opinion estimation, though their inherent biases and methodological limitations warrant careful consideration.",

In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

          "authors": "Wei Zhang; Meghan Clayards; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Native speakers imitate F0 contours that vary between two lexical tones non-linearly–they do not precisely reproduce the presented F0 features but instead cluster them toward tonal categories, the so-called contrast mediation effect. However, less is known whether non-native speakers who lack the lexical tone phonology will show linear imitation of F0 contours. Addressing this question will deepen our understanding of whether F0 imitation is solely influenced by lexical tone contrasts or also shaped by other sources of non-linearity beyond phonological contrasts. To investigate this, the current study examined the categorization and imitation of a Mandarin flat-falling tonal continuum by both Mandarin speakers and English speakers who were naïve to tonal languages. Imitation distributions were analyzed by comparing two models: a linear regression model, which assumes participants linearly track phonetic cues, and a mixture regression model, which assumes imitation reflects underlying categories. The mixture regression model fit the data better for the Mandarin speakers while the reverse was true for the English speakers, suggesting that Mandarin speakers imitated the F0 contours more categorically than English speakers. However, for both groups, the data was best fit using a weighted combination of both models. For the Mandarin group this result along with additional analyses of duration, F1 and intensity suggest that tone categories involve both phonological and phonetic information and imitation taps both, possibly via hyper- and hypo-articulation. For English participants, the evidence for categorical mediation suggests that imitation is mediated by factors other than lexically contrastive linguistic categories, although the exact nature of the factors is unclear.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation is widely recognized as a critical factor in offender rehabilitation and recidivism reduction. However, empirical research has not yet clarified how distinct patterns of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) relate to recidivism across different types of criminal offenses. We therefore constructed a Bayesian network to model the probabilistic relationships between CERS and recidivism, conditioning on offense type. To obtain a practical, parsimonious network, we first derived interpretable summary indexes from multiple CERS indicators using convex generalized structured component analysis. These indexes were then used as network nodes. The resulting network suggests that CERS differ systematically across offense types and are differentially associated with the likelihood of recidivism. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both individual CERS profiles and offense type into the design of correctional interventions aimed at reducing recidivism.",

          "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a variety of public health measures aimed at decreasing transmission between people sharing public spaces, including social distancing and the use of face masks. However the behavioral consequences of these policies on human navigation are mostly unknown. Using virtual reality, we investigated how some common preventive measures influenced how people navigate near other people. Participants (N=29) traversed virtual rooms containing virtual people\n(“agents”) while we manipulated their mask status, the mask status of the agents, and the perceived environmental safety (high/low community vaccination rates). We found that initial path selection was primarily determined by agent mask-wearing, with participants more likely to pass in front of masked than unmasked agents. The perception of environmental safety predominantly governed subsequent interpersonal distance, with closer proximity maintained in high-vaccination contexts. The participants’ own mask status was the least influential, suggesting that navigational choices were driven by external risk assessment rather than personal protection. We observed clear risk compensation: subjects generally reduced interpersonal distance in safer conditions (whether environmental, agent masking, or personal masking). Bayesian model comparisons favored a three-factor additive model, indicating independent rather than interactive influences on behavior. These findings reveal the interplay of decisions underlying pandemic-era social navigation, and highlight the importance of accounting for risk compensation in public health interventions.",

          "abstract": "Background\nVisual distortions (VDs) represent key markers of psychosis emergence and are highly prevalent amongst patients with psychosis. Existing instruments for VDs depend on verbal descriptions and concurrently assess other perceptual disturbances. A measure exclusively assessing VDs grounded in visual representations could enhance the consistency with which these experiences are probed and sensitivity to such subtle phenomena.\n\nMethods\nWe developed the Visual Distortion Screener (VDS), a video-based instrument for screening the presence of six patient-endorsed VDs: changes to perception of brightness, colors, shadows, depth, movement, and patterns. The VDS was administered online to 229 general population participants along with the Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS) and Revised-Green Paranoid Thought Scale (R-GPTS).\n\nResults\n25.4% of participants endorsed at least one VD, most commonly depth or pattern changes. Among individuals endorsing visual disturbances, 19.1% were detected by the VDS but not by the CAPS. VDS total scores, the number of VDs endorsed, correlated with CAPS total scores (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001) and with the R-GPTS persecution subscale while controlling for the CAPS (r = 0.22, p &lt; 0.005). Independent of VDS total scores, distress ratings on the VDS were uniquely associated with both R-GPTS subscales (reference: r = 0.17, p &lt; 0.05; persecution: r = 0.16, p &lt; 0.05).\n\nConclusions\nThe VDS demonstrates preliminary construct validity and may provide additive predictive value beyond the CAPS while capturing additional details about patient experiences.

          "abstract": "It is well known that the way monolingual listeners discriminate speech  sounds is strongly influenced by their native (L1) sound system (Best, McRoberts, &amp; Goodell, 2001; Best &amp; Strange, 1992; Werker, Gilbert, &amp; Humphrey, 1981). Such perceptual constraints are not limited to monolinguals: multiple studies have found evidence of language-specificity in bilingual speech perception (Antoniou, Best, &amp; Tyler, 2013; Sebastián-Gallés &amp; Soto-Faraco, 1999). However, the question of whether bilinguals have simultaneous access to both of their phonologies during non-native contrast discrimination has not been systematically examined. Namely, very few studies of bilinguals have specifically examined cases where a non-native contrast pair straddles the boundary between two sound systems, with one sound corresponding to a sound in the L1, and the other to a sound in the L2, but with neither the L1 nor the L2 containing both. The current study aimed to do so by comparing the ability of early bilinguals to discriminate non-native phonetic contrasts consisting of sounds that exist in either their L1 or L2, but not in both. A forced-choice perception task was designed to compare two listener groups—Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals—on their perception of Nepali dental-alveolar stop contrasts. Results showed that despite displaying some sensitivity to phonetic differences within each contrast pair, the bilingual group was unable to discriminate such “cross-language contrasts” significantly better than the monolingual English control group.",

          "abstract": "Housing dynamics in the United States were racialized by decades of State-sponsored racist policy. Exposure to particular neighborhoods yields benefits and harms that are vastly different across racialized populations. One outcome of that association is an ideology of racialized space that could both naturalize and perpetuate spatial racial inequality. Using 500k listings from the rental platform Craigslist spanning five years and 16 U.S. metropolitan areas, I show that descriptions of neighborhoods reflect the legacy of more traditional forms of neighborhood racialization, but are also the site of counter-narratives that resist that legacy. Advertisements tend to describe Asian and White neighborhoods more positively than other neighborhoods, while failing to positively describe Latino and Black areas, though that difference is less for Latino neighborhoods when accounting for socioeconomic status. In contrast, even high-income Black neighborhoods are not described as positively as poor White neighborhoods. Black and White neighborhoods are recognized for being historic, but, even accounting for housing stock age, Asian neighborhoods are not, reflecting the ‘permanent foreigner’ stereotype.",

This article integrates cleavage theory with meta-perceptions—beliefs about the political attitudes of social groups—to examine how people cognitively map political divides. Using original survey data from Germany and focusing on immigration as a key issue in the socio-cultural cleavage, we theorize and test three cognitive biases: egocentrism, conservatism, and false polarization. Results show that citizens project their views onto others, overestimate societal negativity toward immigration, and exaggerate group polarization. These biases are unevenly distributed across cleavage groups, reflecting the structure of political conflict. Moreover, their interaction produces distinct misperception patterns: biases reinforce each other among anti-immigration individuals and offset each other among pro-immigration individuals. The findings suggest that meta-perceptions are shaped by both psychological biases and social divisions, providing new insights into the cognitive foundations of political conflict.",

These theories suggest hypotheses that exposure to protests, hate crimes, and hate groups increases ingroup solidarity, raising support for the focal identity group. Analyzing panel data from the American National Election Surveys conducted in 2016 and 2020, this research examines shifts in attitudes toward four distinct identity groups: Black, Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual, Transgender, and Jewish individuals. Contrary to expectations, peaceful protests by identity groups did not affect their levels of support.

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how the German public perceives Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) amid escalating geopolitical tensions and deepening China–EU economic interdependence, complemented by evidence on Chinese perceptions of German FDI. We combine data from a large-scale survey experiment embedded in the 2023 German Socio-Economic Panel Innovation Sample (N = 2,365) with a descriptive survey in China (N = 2,000). German respondents substantially overestimate the scale of Chinese investment—believing it accounts for about 30% of total inward FDI, compared to an actual share of roughly 1%—and evaluate it significantly less favorably than investment from other EU countries or the United States. In contrast, Chinese respondents express consistently positive views of German FDI, revealing a pronounced asymmetry in mutual perceptions. To probe the origins and malleability of these views, we implement three randomized interventions in Germany: a factual correction of actual FDI shares and two narrative framings emphasizing either positive or negative aspects of Chinese investment. While factual information modestly improves perceptions of FDI’s economic benefits, none of the treatments meaningfully shift deeper, ideologically anchored attitudes toward Chinese investment. Quantile treatment effect analyses indicate, however, that these interventions reduce anti-China biases among respondents who are initially more receptive to Chinese FDI. Taken together, the results—consistent across direct evaluations, conjoint choice experiments, and Willingness-to-Accept (WTA) measures—underscore the limits of informational interventions in reshaping entrenched geopolitical or identity-based biases toward foreign investment.

          "abstract": "Cultural markets are characterized by uncertainty, prompting consumers to rely on various forms of social information. Personal recommendations, particularly from close networks, stand out as an important component. However, in different social settings, consumers may encounter recommendations from advisors outside their close network. Focusing on the movie market, this study investigates how different characteristics of such movie advisors influence the value placed on their recommendations. A factorial survey among students is employed to investigate the role of gender, migration background, socio-economic position (SEP), and patterns of movie consumption (voraciousness) in drawing the intentions to watch movies in three genres – action, comedy, and drama. The results show that recommendations from women and individuals extensively involved in movie watching hold higher value. There is a lack of evidence supporting gender-essentialist beliefs about advisors, since genre-based differences remain minimal. In-group favoritism is observed among women, whereas men are found to be indifferent. This study underlines the importance of advisors’ characteristics in predicting the weight of recommendations.",

          "authors": "Viktor Decker; Marco Seegers",
          "abstract": "The relative merits of vocational and general education remain central to debates on sustainable careers. Vocational pathways facilitate smoother school-to-work transitions but rely on occupation-specific skills that may become obsolete, whereas general education yields weaker entry prospects but greater adaptability to changing demands. A key question is whether further training can offset these trade-offs. This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.",

We scoped 64 studies that involved and/or engaged humans and non-humans as stakeholders and classified methods and tools across three more-than-human modes: co design with living entities, through human representation of non-human perspectives, and for more than human outcomes. Reported outcomes for humans included increased environmental awareness, empathy, mental wellbeing and community cohesion. Outcomes for non-human were less frequently measured but included prototypes, spatial planning and, in a few cases, direct welfare gains. We discuss both ethical and methodological barriers and facilitators. The recuring barriers and challenges include recognising non-human agency without anthropocentrism, specifying indicators of non-human wellbeing and flourishing, and achieving genuine and high-quality participation. We also highlight potential facilitators, such as triangulating ethology, sensors and creative tools, longitudinal research and interdisciplinary teams, and propose standards for reporting primary non-human outcomes. Positioned alongside One Health, EcoHealth and Planetary Health, more-than-human co-design provides participatory infrastructures for multispecies justice in urban sustainability and climate change adaptation.

          "abstract": "Background\nUnder-registration of vital statistics is common in low- and middle-income countries, espe-\ncially among under-privileged groups. We examine the level of completeness of death counts\nin the Colombian vital registration records relative to those in the Census 2018. Our aim is to\nestimate the bias caused by under-registration of deaths, and how this bias varies across age\nand ethnicity.\n\nMethods\nWe use data from the 2018 National Population Census and 2017 Vital Registration System\nfrom Colombia. Under-registered deaths by ethnic groups were estimated using two methods.\nFirst, we compared the number of deaths in the census with those in the mortality records.\nSecond, we fitted a logistic regression model to estimate the relationship between mortal-\nity under-registration and ethnicity, using a census variable indicating whether a death in the\nhousehold was registered or not.\n\nResults\nA comparison of census and vital registration data indicates that the majority of deaths to\nboth Indigenous and Afro-descendent households were not registered. Indigenous under-\nregistration was considerably higher, with 77.8% of deaths reported in the census not captured\nin the vital registration system. The probability of under-registration remains high among the\nIndigenous and Afro-descendent population, even after adjusting for household characteristics.\n\nConclusions\nVital registration data in Colombia severely underestimate the deaths to Indigenous and Afro-\ndescendants, reinforced by a clear geospatial patterning which correlates with the distribution\nof ethnic populations.\n\nContribution\nThis study is the first to quantify the magnitude of under-registration of deaths among ethnic\ngroups in Colombia using census micro-data and vital registration data.",

          "title": "Young, Progressive, Female - The Gender Gap in Socio-Cultural Attitudes Across Cohorts",
          "authors": "Katja Schmidt",
          "abstract": "Recent reports have drawn attention to a growing ideological divide between young men and women in Western societies, with women becoming more progressive while men lean increasingly conservative. Yet, empirical evidence and theoretical grounding for this phenomenon remain limited. This study is the first to examine this divide in the German context, drawing on original survey data collected in 2022. It compares socio-cultural attitudes across cohorts and explores mechanisms underlying these gender gaps. The results reveal that gaps are substantially larger among the youngest and middle cohorts – roughly twice as pronounced as among older ones. While young women (16–29) emerge as the most progressive group, men aged 30–49 hold the most conservative views, each diverging sharply from their female or male peers. These findings align with modernization theory on the one hand, and with gender threat perspectives on the other, suggesting that men, in part, perceive emancipative progress as a challenge to their social position. Linking these perceptions to broader shifts in socialization, the study contributes to theorizing the mechanisms behind gendered attitudinal gaps in Western societies. Although the cross-sectional design precludes causal claims, the findings highlight a distinctive cohort pattern with implications for social and political cohesion.",

          "authors": "Dulce Manzano Espinosa; Hector Cebolla-Boado",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes that, under specific conditions, wars can shift family investments decisions toward more portable and less susceptible-to-confiscation assets, such as education. To test our theory, we examine the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), a violent conflict that did not specifically disrupted family dynamics or targeted children or educational infrastructure. We compare the educational attainment of individuals exposed to the war with that of cohorts from preceding and subsequent periods. Using a regression discontinuity approach, our results reveal that individuals who reached school age during the conflict exhibited higher completion rates for both primary and secondary education. The benefits were especially pronounced for individuals whose parents were less-educated, utterly impacting the allocation of educational opportunities. These findings support a new framework for exploring educational gains in conflicts where violence is not targeted indiscriminately at entire social groups including children and the destruction of civil and educational infrastructures is relatively contained. Beyond our historical case, our framework is particularly relevant for studying contemporary, lower-intensity conflicts (excess of mortality not concentrating on children or women) that may foster long-term educational benefits across generations.",

          "abstract": "Southern Africa possesses a deep archaeological record, spanning more than a million years, which has attracted over a century of research. As a result, it offers one of the densest and most detailed pictures of Stone Age occupation history in Africa. However, certain time periods and regions have featured more prominently in research, particularly the later Middle Stone Age of the coastal and mountain zones. Moreover, the modern emphasis on absolute dating and well-resolved chronologies often excludes open-air and surface sites from reviews and syntheses, meaning that environments lacking deep, stratified rock shelters remain underrepresented.\nTo address this, the Southern African Stone Age Site Index (SASSI) provides a centralised, openly accessible resource for archaeological research, featuring 485 reported Earlier, Middle and Later Stone Age sites from South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini and Namibia. It includes both dated and undated sites, and encompasses diverse contexts. The database integrates spatial, chronological, cultural and contextual information, following FAIR data principles. While previous synthetic datasets have emphasised chronology and systematics, SASSI instead prioritises spatial coverage, offering a foundation for new perspectives on demography, settlement patterns, and landscape use in southern Africa’s past.",

          "abstract": "This chapter explores Herbert Marcuse’s contribution to the Frankfurt School’s research into the authoritarian personality, in a political context where, because he is now an official enemy figure of the forthcoming Trump incumbency, the legacy of Marcuse has become more important than ever. Although Marcuse never contributed directly to the formulation of Theodor Adorno’s The Authoritarian Personality (1951), his research into the ideological roots of arbitrary authority is central to its findings. Marcuse’s supplement to the social psychology of authoritarian politics is presented in Eros and Civilization (1964), through the theories of surplus repression and regressive de-sublimation, which explain how discontent with civilization can be mobilized by authoritarian personalities to wider their support base. These theories supply the key to understanding the rancorous atmosphere of rightwing populism, authoritarian resentment and aversive prejudice now politically resurgent around the world on the Far Right. Marcuse anticipated the political events today unfolding in the USA in a crucial essay on the “Historical Fate of Bourgeois Democracy” (1972), which provides an analysis of the objective and subjective preconditions for the rise of the authoritarian personality. Bringing together the strands of Marcuse’s analysis of the relation between crisis dynamics, authoritarian regimes and the authoritarian personality, this chapter develops a Marcusean analysis of the extremely dangerous conjuncture unfolding in America (and beyond).",

          "abstract": "Religiously-inspired fictions have played an important role in contemporary Far-Right politics in the USA, making a significant contribution to the project of constructing cultural and ideological support for a “post-liberal” regime. Since the 1970s, such fictions have provided imaginative representations of anti-liberal theologies and the customary-rights-based way of life that belongs to Christian fundamentalism. The development of a fundamentalist counter-public sphere, including Christian fiction, provided the cultural substructure for the politicization of American fundamentalism into the Christian Right. In turn, this politicization, culminating in Christian nationalism, has been reflected in the political redirection of religiously-inspired fiction towards millenarian themes. Doctrinaire fictions of “spiritual warfare” and “tribulation insurgency” have radicalized Christian literature in America, militarizing spiritual revenge fantasies into representations of terrorist violence. These aggressive fictions are forms of anti-Enlightenment and anti-democratic ideological propaganda, which promote the rightwing authoritarian social attitudes and aversive prejudices of today’s Christian nationalism.",

          "abstract": "Recent advancements in the availability and sophistication of generative artificial intelligence has been accompanied by widespread concerns regarding the ability for the public to navigate the digital information environment, especially during social and political events. A growing consensus across policymakers, academics, and industry leaders has emerged around the need for applying labels communicating whether AI was used in content creation. Labeling as a media literacy strategy and policy intervention has gained momentum, but what impacts do synthetic content labels have on the public? We run two online experiments to measure the effect of content labeling on perceptions of political images—their perceived provenance, veracity, and engagement intention. We find that AI labels effectively communicate content provenance, significantly reducing perceived human involvement in image creation regardless of whether images were actually AI-generated. At the same time, labels have no impact on perceived veracity or self-reported engagement intentions. In a follow on study, we find limited evidence of the \"implied authenticity effect,\" whereby exposure to labeled synthetic images increases the perceived human provenance of subsequent unlabeled synthetic images. However, we show that the near-zero total effect is the result of two offsetting pathways: exposure to labeled synthetic images implies subsequent unlabeled synthetic images are more authentic, but this effect is countered by an increased skepticism caused by prior exposure to labeled content. Taken together, our research contributes to the growing academic literature on content labeling as a media literacy intervention, as well as to ongoing efforts to develop evidence-based strategies to mitigate the harmful political effects of generative AI.",

To assist with this, I introduce a typology of emergency regimes of the capitalist state that is influenced by the work of Nicos Poulantzas and use it to locate the various assessments. I discuss Marxist assessments of Trump 2.0’s evolution in terms of arguments for Illiberal Democratic (ID-type), Bonapartist (B-type), Neofascist (NF-type) and new authoritarian Presidential Despotism (PD-type) classifications of the regime-type. The aim here is not scholastic categorization of a political process but understanding where empirical reality forces an argument to deviate from theoretical predictions. In this light, the second thing I do in this article is to present the case that the fourth camp, the PD-type argument, is on the right track. I locate this argument in relation to discussions of authoritarian neoliberalism and consider the kinds of evidence that make this argument the most plausible candidate amongst current evaluations.",

Using nationally representative data from the 2013 and 2015 China Household Financial Surveys, we find a clear and persistent wealth premium among public-sector employees that remains significant after controlling for education, occupation, and other characteristics. The results point to three reinforcing mechanisms: redistributive power through party membership and cadre hierarchy, market power through firm listing and industry position, and behavioral differences in income, debt, and expenditure. These findings suggest that the public sector functions as a hybrid institution combining administrative protection with partial market participation. Unlike the Eastern European cases where privatization eroded state influence, China’s public sector continues to organize wealth accumulation through employment and credit access. The enduring wealth advantage of public employment shows that the “hand of the state” remains active in shaping post-socialist inequality.",

          "abstract": "Using a new database on the net worth and self-reported cognitive impairment for almost two million adults, this paper provides the first large-scale evidence linking community wealth to age-related cognitive decline. This assessment is timely as widening geographic wealth gaps in the USA fuel disparities in access to public goods and amenities, positioning community wealth as a critical determinant of cognitive health. Conditioning on personal wealth and other risk factors, we find that a standard deviation increase in community wealth is associated with a 6.7% relative risk reduction in cognitive impairment across the national population of older adults, rising to 13.7% for those residing in the poorest fifth of communities. Community wealth matters more than relative inequality, and its associated protective effects are larger for non-white, non-college educated, and low net worth householders. This is plausibly because these individuals rely more on the public goods and services underwritten by local affluence. The economic fragmentation of American communities thus poses a growing threat to the cognitive health of Americans, especially among those from socially vulnerable and marginalized backgrounds",

This paper presents an empirical analysis of five CS pilots addressing urban sustainability challenges, conducted within or in close collaboration with six GLAMs. In Barcelona, a university partnered with a public library to assess heat exposure in public spaces. In Delft, children’s perceptions of urban spaces were collected and discussed through a collaboration between a university and a public library. In Tallinn, a community museum supported the testing of a digital visualization tool to enhance citizens’ feedback in urban planning. In Vienna, an urban research institute and an academic library co-designed two pilots addressing urban heat and the transformation of public spaces. Findings draw on GLAMs’ distinct contributions, the structural organization of the pilots, and the perceptions of librarians and researchers, collected through surveys, interviews, and collective writing processes. A strong community-oriented focus and the engagement of underrepresented citizen groups were common features across all pilots, though organizational structures and actor typologies varied by city. GLAMs consistently acted as powerful connectors between researchers, citizens, and local stakeholders. Embedding CS initiatives within social and community-oriented venues helps mitigate power imbalances and foster horizontal, mutual learning between academics and GLAM staff. GLAM can also provide the crucial social infrastructure to significantly embed sustainability challenges-related CS initiatives in many knowledge ecosystems, over different countries and cities.",

This study aims to understand the individual and contextual factors that may moderate the short-term decline in mental health and recovery in the medium-term associated with widowhood.  Data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe are applied to between-within random-effects linear regressions to estimate average within-individual change in mental health following spousal death across fifteen countries. Rather than a summary score of depressive symptoms, this study focuses on affective suffering and changes in motivation.  This allows us to differentiate between depressive symptoms that manifest in the course of bereavement (affective suffering) and symptoms that indicate a more severe depressive episode (changes in motivation). In addition, we consider the role of institutional, social and compositional differences between countries to account for cross-national variation.  Widowhood is associated with higher affective suffering in the short-term and recovery in the medium-term across all countries. However, there is more cross-national variation in the appearance of changes in motivation following spousal loss. Findings suggest that compositional differences, specifically the mean age of widowhood and the gender composition of the widowed population, account for cross-national heterogeneities in the consequences of widowhood for affective suffering and motivation.",

Phase 1 (2025-2027) focuses on facilitating gradual transitions into existing residence categories, which will strength integration and reduce the risks of institutionalised temporariness. Phase 2 (from 2027 onwards) underscores voluntary, safe and dignified return, where possible, in addition to residual protection for those who cannot be repatriated.

          "abstract": "Normative fertility reflects broader societal trends but curiously changed little despite shifts in families. Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

          "abstract": "State Public Service Commissions face complex decisions when utilities incur extraordinary costs\nfrom disasters, fuel price spikes, or emergency infrastructure repairs. This paper examines five\nprimary cost recovery methods, i.e., immediate pass-through, short-term amortization, rate base\ninclusion, securitization, and deferral, analyzing their distinct impacts on utility financial stability,\ncustomer affordability, and regulatory transparency. Drawing on a literature review of utility\nregulation theory, financial mechanisms, and empirical evidence, the study synthesizes theoretical\nfoundations including natural monopoly theory and the regulatory compact with practical regulatory\nconsiderations. A detailed hypothetical case study included as appendix demonstrates how a $25\nmillion extraordinary cost would be recovered under each method, providing complete mathematical\ncalculations, customer bill impacts across residential, commercial, and industrial classes, and total\ncost comparisons over recovery periods ranging from three months to twenty years. The analysis\nreveals fundamental trade-offs: immediate recovery minimizes total costs but creates severe bill\nshock, while securitization offers the lowest monthly impact but highest total cost due to extended\ninterest payments. The paper emphasizes that transparent modeling, reproducible calculations, and\nmeaningful public engagement are essential for regulatory legitimacy. It concludes with best practice\nrecommendations for regulators, utilities, and consumer advocates, arguing that method selection\nmust be context-dependent, balancing cost magnitude, customer economic conditions, utility\nfinancial health, and regulatory precedent to achieve equitable and sustainable outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that certain sanctioning institutions can play an essential role in maintaining human cooperation in public goods experiments. However, in reality, the outcome of sanctions can be subject to stochasticity. In a public goods experiment with peer punishment, we investigated the comparative advantage of certain versus uncertain sanctioning institutions by allowing participants to repeatedly choose between the two. In one institution, sanctions issued by individuals were multiplied by three, while in another, the consequences of sanctions were multiplied by a random factor between 0 and 6. Initially, the uncertain institution was the majority choice, but it eventually tended to become the minority choice. We found less punishment, due to less antisocial punishment, in a certain institution, leading to higher contributions and payoffs. Hence, when participants learned about the difference in payoffs, they chose a certain sanctioning institution more often. Especially, prosocial and risk-averse individuals with strong contribution norms were more likely to choose certainty. Additionally, we investigated the motives that may influence pro- and antisocial punishment, as they influence an institution's success.

          "abstract": "Switzerland activated temporary collective protection (Status S) in March 2022 to respond to the large-scale displacement caused by the war in Ukraine. This exceptional measure, aligned with the European Union’s Temporary Protection Directive, provided immediate access to residence, employment, education and social support, while deliberately remaining temporary in nature. However, the ongoing and protracted nature of the conflict requires consideration of future steps beyond temporary protection. This article develops a conceptual two-stage model adapted to Swiss context. Phase 1 (2025-2027) focuses on facilitating gradual transitions into existing residence categories, which will strength integration and reduce the risks of institutionalised temporariness. Phase 2 (from 2027 onwards) underscores voluntary, safe and dignified return, where possible, in addition to residual protection for those who cannot be repatriated. The proposed framework aims to reconcile humanitarian obligations, integration policies and long-term sustainability.",

          "authors": "Yoav Roll",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, right-wing populism has steadily risen to prominence across the world. Yet a crucial socio-economic context for its development - the household and its underlying gender dynamics - remains under-explored in research on right-wing populism. This study investigates how the income, level of education, and class within cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, shape their support for right-wing populism through three diverse predictors, ranging from behavioural to attitudinal: voting for right-wing populist [RWP] parties, aim to vote for RWP parties, and sympathy towards RWP parties. Four models are tested to explain these relationships: male dominance, sharing, individual, and economic dominance models. Based on previous studies focusing on non-RWP parties, I expected the individual model for men and the sharing model for women to provide the best fit. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences, this paper utilises diagonal reference models [DRM], for men and women separately, to trace the relative influence of the respondent and their partner on their RWP support. As far as I know, DRM has never been used to predict support for RWP parties. As expected, gender differences are evident. However, the data show, contrary to expectation, that the sharing model provides the best fit for men, while the individual model provides the best fit for women when it comes to income and education. Regarding class, as expected, the sharing model provides the best fit for women. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the diverse characteristics of the economic standing predictors and the different facets of RWP support tested. As women increasingly join the workforce and occupy diverse roles, the ways in which men and women perceive their economic circumstances - particularly within households - diverge significantly. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for household context and gender dynamics in understanding the rise of right-wing populism in developed democracies such as the Netherlands.",

          "abstract": "Scientific advice from the social and behavioural sciences (SBS) can help make public health policies more effective and mitigate the societal impact of major infectious disease outbreaks. This study critically examines the quality of policy briefs from European SBS advisory bodies written during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently scored 117 policy briefs from 4 countries using the newly-developed 25-item Policy Brief Checklist. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results. We found considerable heterogeneity in the quality of policy briefs. Key items like the summary, aim, policy problem addressed, and actionability of the recommendations were adequate in 34% to 59% of policy briefs. Policy briefs containing urgent advice scored better than less urgent briefs on some items (e.g. clear aim) but worse on others (e.g. explication of the policy problem). Hence, although challenging in the high-pressure context of a pandemic, the impact of SBS policy advice during a major infectious disease outbreak could potentially be enhanced if advisory bodies improve the quality of their policy briefs. We recommend that SBS advisory body develop crisis-specific policy brief templates that meet the needs of the advisory body and policymakers, and invest in training so that scientific insights are presented more effectively.",

While previous research has explored various associations between specific aspects of religiosity, such as frequency of prayer or religious service attendance, with flourishing and health, this study makes a distinct contribution by analyzing the effects of an innovative concept of religiosity by Stefan Huber –centrality of religiosity– on a multidimensional human flourishing scale. The analysis is based on survey-weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models, allowing for population-representative estimates across the six countries studied (analytic N =84,399). The findings show that although all forms of religiosity are associated with higher flourishing outcomes, the highly religious benefit the most. Among the dimensions of human flourishing, centrality of religiosity is especially strongly associated with meaning and purpose across all countries. Effect sizes differ substantially between the analyzed countries, suggesting that the religious context and culture shape how religiosity influences flourishing and health. In light of the rapidly progressing secularization in Europe, the results invite a reconsideration of the value placed on of peripheral and central religiosity.",

          "authors": "Nicklas Neuman; Katarina Boye",
          "abstract": "In this natural experiment, we study the effects of added years of school and different exposures to Home Economics (HE) on adult men's self-reported time spent on housework. Using data from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey (LNU), we run difference-in-differences analyses and a cohort analysis. The first test the effect of the Swedish nine-year elementary school reform and its preceding assessment period, with more added years of HE that included teaching of practical housework. The second compares birth cohorts before and after an important curricular change, for the first time adding HE for boys, in Swedish schools 1955/56. The data confirm previous findings about Swedish men’s housework: a general increase over time, mainly driven by more time spent on foodwork (e.g., food shopping, cooking, after-meal clean-up). We also confirm that men’s housework participation is positively associated with their educational level. However, the overarching picture of the study is a null result, except for an effect on time spent on laundry. Thus, while it is clear from previous findings that men in Sweden have increased their time spent on routine housework, especially foodwork, it is difficult to pinpoint any particular policy effect from the statistical noise of reforms and cultural transformation. Our study design could, in theory, identify the causal effect of school reform, focusing both on educational duration and curricular content, yet the findings suggest no such specific effect, indicating instead that other social factors have driven this development.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines how the far right in Germany and Austria responded to Russia’s full-\nscale invasion of Ukraine of February 2022 by societalizing the ensuing energy crisis. Rather\nthan addressing the war as a breach to European values, and a fundamental realignment of\nrelations between Eastern and Western Europe, far-right actors depicted rising energy prices\nand inflation as breaches to national values, in particular industrial power in Germany and\nneutrality in Austria. Through a process of societalization – the dramatization of institutional\nproblems into moral crises threatening society at large –, economic strain was transformed into\na collective moral grievance, allowing far right actors to redirect public anxiety away from\nUkraine and toward domestic narratives of decline. The chapter demonstrates how the relevant\nparties mobilized existing cultural codes of economic power, national independence, and anti-\nEU sentiment to delegitimize support for Ukraine. It argues that civil sphere theory must more\ndirectly engage with the cultural framing of economic crises, especially in times of polycrisis,\nwhere certain actors infuse material disruptions with symbolic meaning to undermine\ndemocratic cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Objective. This study aims to propose the Internationality Index (IdI) and test its applicability in a case study, revealing critical gaps in institutional data availability of a Research Center (RC), the \"Dr. Eduardo J. Usunoff\" Plain River Hydrology Institute (IHLLA) in Argentina, from 2010 to 2018. It introduces and applies the composite Internationality Index (IdI) to assess institutional performance across education, publication, and financing dimensions.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach. The research employed a documentary analysis using IHLLA’s annual institutional reports (2010–2018) and publicly available data. The IdI was constructed from three subindices: International Education Index (IEI), International Publication Index (PI), and International Financing Index (IFI). Due to limitations in explicit reporting, the final analysis relied on adjusted budget figures for financing, raw publication counts, and formal foreign degree attainment among research personnel for education.\nResults/Discussion. Data analysis revealed moderate international engagement in terms of research personnel training, with 41% of scholars and researchers holding a foreign degree. However, inconsistent reporting, a lack of systematic documentation on short-term mobility, and the absence of journal quartile classification in institutional reports constrained a complete longitudinal IdI calculation. The findings underscore the gap between the need for robust evaluation tools and the availability of standardized institutional data.\nConclusions. The IdI is a viable tool for longitudinal analysis and strategic decision-making, but its effectiveness is severely limited by inconsistent institutional reporting of international variables. RCs must adopt systematic metrics to accurately capture internationality, particularly in international short-term training, international financing and publication quality, to enable effective monitoring and strategic improvement.\nOriginality/Value. This study pioneers the application of the IdI as a synoptic measure to assess internationality specifically within Research Centers, distinguishing it from traditional HEI-focused models. It provides empirical evidence on an Ibero-American RC, contributing to the development of robust evaluation frameworks for science policy.",

In case of ESG analysts in responsible investing, their professional logic is subject to pressures from both activist and market logics. We conceptualise mandate slippage – the drift of an occupation’s mandate toward either competing logic – as a threat to the coherence of an occupational mandate and professional jurisdiction. Drawing on extensive interviews and archival data, we show that occupational members rely on a number of governance mechanisms to counteract the slippages and sustain a coherent professional logic: (1) practicing professional neutrality, (2) seeking professional autonomy, (3) acquiring and developing logic-bridging expertise, and (4) engaging with peer networks. Combined, these mechanisms both help sustain the occupation’s mandate and jurisdiction, and guide ESG analysts in reconciling competing logics. This study addresses recent critiques that governance is a critical yet understudied dimension of institutional logics research.",

The rapid adoption of digital innovations by consumers, coupled with their heightened expectations from every business interaction, has rendered digital transformation a necessity. Businesses that fail to successfully implement this transformation will face the threat of extinction sooner than predicted. This disruptive effect has already begun to show its impact on various sectors. In the digital transformation process, businesses’ main goal should be to ensure that all new applications provide added value to their existing or future customers. This study examines changes in customer expectations and behavior in the digital age from a marketing perspective. It states that businesses need to update their marketing mixes to appeal to consumers’ emotions and support their self-expression, while also considering the effort and change required from them and ensuring accessibility anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the concepts of personalization, access instead of ownership (sharing economy), and omnichannel, which have emerged as new trends to meet the expectations of digital customers, are addressed.",

We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another.

Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

The empirical literature has overlooked the need for a definition of causality. The definition used when applying IVs is the potential outcomes framework. This framework requires clear definitions of the active and control treatments because the causal effect is defined as the difference in outcome between the groups undergoing these two treatments. Previous research using twin birth IVs has failed to provide clear and accurate definitions of the treatments, making it impossible to accurately interpret the estimated effects or assess the validity of the study design and IVs.",

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Background:\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic imposes a persistent and disproportionate economic burden on payers and communities, driven by complex interactions among clinical utilization, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) policies, and social determinants of health (SDOH). Despite extensive research on overdose and prescribing risk, few studies have quantified the cost burden of opioid use or examined how policy and community-level factors jointly shape it.\n\nObjective:\nThis study develops an interpretable, machine-learning framework integrating PBM cost levers and SDOH indicators to predict and explain county-level variation in opioid-related spending from 2013–2023. The goal is to identify structural drivers of cost, simulate potential savings under policy and social interventions, and support data-driven resource allocation.\n\nMethods:\nUsing CMS Medicare Part D data linked with County Health Rankings and U.S. Census indicators, a Random Forest regression model was trained on ten years of county-level data (≈3,000 counties, 2013–2023). Key predictors included unemployment, income ratio, obesity, smoking, provider density, and PBM variables such as cost per claim and opioid prescribing rate. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis and policy simulations testing both PBM and SDOH interventions.\n\nResults:\nThe model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97), explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. SHAP analysis revealed unemployment, mental-health-provider density, and income inequality as dominant drivers, while provider access and preventive-care variables exerted cost-mitigating effects. Simulated PBM levers (e.g., formulary tightening, utilization management) reduced predicted costs by 4–6%, while integrated SDOH improvements (e.g., +20% behavioral-health access, +10% primary care) achieved up to 17% savings—equivalent to approximately $23 billion nationally. The combined model demonstrated both statistical robustness and policy relevance.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reframes the opioid crisis through an economic and structural lens, demonstrating that predictive modeling can translate public-health and PBM data into actionable fiscal insights. The proposed PBM–SDOH integration provides a scalable, transparent framework for targeting interventions in high-burden counties, optimizing healthcare spending, and informing evidence-based opioid policy.\n\nKeywords:\nOpioid costs, pharmacy benefit management, social determinants of health, Medicare Part D, machine learning, SHAP, predictive modeling, public health economics, health policy",

The method used is a descriptive quantitative approach with financial ratio analysis techniques, including effectiveness ratio, growth ratio, and independence ratio. The data used comes from the APBG realization report collected directly from the village office. The results of the study show that the effectiveness of village fund management is relatively high, with an average effectiveness reaching 98%. The income growth ratio shows a positive trend with an average of above 90% per year. However, the village financial independence ratio is very low, which is 0.30%, indicating that the village is still very dependent on central government transfer funds. This finding shows that although the village is able to manage the budget effectively, it has not succeeded in increasing its fiscal independence.\n\nKeywords\nFinancial Performance ; Effectiveness Ratio ; Growth Ratio ; Independence Ratio ; Village ; Fund Allocation",

Using a quantitative approach with panel data and the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) regression method, the results show that economic growth (measured by GRDP per capita) has a positive and significant effect on crime rates, indicating that uneven growth can increase social tension. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on crime, possibly due to the strong role of social networks, government assistance, and the dominance of the informal sector in Aceh. Income inequality (measured by the Gini Ratio) was found to have no significant effect on crime levels. These findings provide critical insights for designing more inclusive, equitable, and context-specific development policies. By strengthening social capital, expanding access to decent employment, and ensuring equitable development outcomes, the results of this study offer a strategic foundation for reducing crime rates while improving the quality of life in Aceh through enhanced public safety, social stability, and sustainable well-being.\n\nKeywords\nCrime ; Economic Growth ; Unemployment ; Income Inequality ; Social Paradox",

          "abstract": "This study examines the influence of education level and poverty on crime rates in Aceh Province during the 2020–2024 period using a quantitative approach and panel data analysis through the Fixed Effects Model (FEM). Based on data from 23 regencies/municipalities, the findings reveal that both education and poverty jointly have a significant effect on crime. However, only poverty shows a statistically significant partial effect (p = 0.0524), with a negative coefficient, while education does not have a statistically significant influence (p = 0.9654). The adjusted R² value of 63.64% indicates that the model provides a strong explanation of the variance in regional crime rates. The counterintuitive result regarding poverty suggests that in the context of Aceh, strong social cohesion and religious norms may mitigate the criminogenic effects of economic hardship. These findings imply that crime prevention strategies must go beyond economic indicators and incorporate local socio-cultural dynamics. Policy recommendations include implementing context-based educational reforms, promoting community-driven poverty alleviation programs, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among education, social welfare, and public security stakeholders.\n\nCrime Rate ; Education ; Poverty ; Panel Data ; Aceh ; Fixed Effects Model (FEM)",

          "abstract": "This article advances dual-process theory (DPT) by developing a pragmatist framework for the study of reflective cognition. While dual-process models were introduced to sociology via Bourdieusian practice theory, Bourdieusian DPT has proven inadequate for theorizing reflective cognition and action, with sociologists looking to pragmatism as an alternative. To support these efforts, I provide a synthetic, elemental account of the pragmatist theory of reflection, delineating reflective cognition’s defining characteristics, core components, its relationship with non-reflective cognition, and its interindividual variation. I then outline the merits of the pragmatist theory of reflection for dual-process research, arguing that it addresses major limitations of Bourdieusian DPT, has broad interdisciplinary support, provides advantages in terms of conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement, and offers sociology a novel research agenda. Overall, I argue that pragmatism provides a robust framework to enhance the study of reflective cognition and is a valuable, if not superior, theoretical alternative for dual-process research. I conclude by discussing the implications of this framework for research on discrimination, inequality, and culture.",

          "abstract": "In diverse societies, how do individuals form views about different groups? We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another. Empirically, we study the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a moment that spurred reckoning with violence against Black Americans. Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

This \nreproduction, which is based on unequal relations in the wider world economy, explains the \nphenomenon of ‘brain drain.’ In accordance with that, the possibility of political \ninterventions within the individual states of the (semi)periphery, which would significantly \ndisrupt the current systemic processes of reproduction, is viewed as pessimistically \ninadequate.",

The analysis demonstrates how the interplay \nbetween global capital and national governments frequently results in the \nmarginalisation of local communities, thereby exacerbating social tensions and \nenvironmental degradation. The work elucidates the contrasting definitions of \nextractivism and neo-extractivism, underscoring the persistent exploitation and \ncentralisation of wealth. By focusing on the socio-political dynamics and ownership \nstructures in these regions, the paper emphasises the necessity for sustainable \nand equitable resource management practices.

          "authors": "Aleksandar Korolija",
          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the American boycott of British goods between 1764 and 1770 through the lens of Herbert Marcuse’s theory of false needs and consumer society, in dialogue with Timothy Breen’s notion of the marketplace of revolution. While Breen emphasizes the transformative role of consumer resistance in forging colonial political identity, this article questions the depth and sincerity of anti-consumerist sentiment during the boycott. It argues that the boycott was pri-marily a tactical reaction to British coercion, rather than a strategic rejection of consumerism. Drawing on secondary sources and historiography, the analysis reveals sharp class contradictions in the organization, enforcement, and symbolic meaning of boycotts across regions and social groups. The article contends that neither Breen nor Marcuse adequately integrate class struggle into their interpretations. By incorporating class analysis, it highlights the different motives of merchants, artisans, planters, and lower classes, showing that the boycott often reproduced existing inequalities. The study concludes that the ephemeral nature of anti-consumerist discourse and the rapid return to consumption following British concessions suggest that marketplace resistance was limited in ideological and political depth and largely failed to really challenge the underlying capitalist logic",

          "abstract": "Background: Creativity is the process of generating contextually useful new outcomes by uniquely reconfiguring existing knowledge and information. While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. \nMethods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure.\nResults: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity.\nConclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.",

          "abstract": "The replication of microscopic surface features on stone tool edges using molds and casts is the only way to carry out use-wear analyses on certain lithic artifacts which cannot fit under a microscope or leave a museum. They are also very important for preserving wear stages in sequential experiments aiming to understand wear formation processes. However, the reliability of these methods for replicating micro-topographic features remains insufficiently explored. This study assesses the fidelity of three impression materials—Genie, President, and Affinis—on chert, dacite, obsidian, and quartzite tools, focusing on surface roughness replication for high-resolution analytical techniques such as confocal microscopy.\nUsing Sensofar S-Neox microscopy, ceramic bead georeferencing, and Number of ISO 25178-based roughness parameters, we evaluated the precision and consistency of each material. Statistical analyses demonstrate that Genie replicated surface features with greater fidelity on dacite and obsidian, while President performed similarly on flint and quartzite. Among the evaluated parameters, Str (Texture aspect ratio), Smr1 (Peak material portion), and Sal (Autocorrelation length) varied the least and thus offered the highest replication quality.\nThis research highlights the importance of selecting replication materials suited to the specific properties of the analyzed artifacts and the requirements of the applied analytical techniques. By providing a systematic framework for evaluating replication fidelity, this study contributes to improving methodological precision in use-wear studies and facilitates the application of advanced imaging technologies to archaeological research.",

          "abstract": "In this contribution, I focus on the shifting assemblages of evidencing that become visible during the public court cases and in the verdicts of Dutch women returnees from Syria. Evidencing emerged as a particularly salient problem, since in the large majority of cases there was not even a suspicion that these women had participated in violent acts. What soon appeared was what I call, following one of the lawyers, the doctrine of the common household. Engaging in housework and childcare for men who were IS-fighters became a ground for conviction for participation in a terrorist organization and/or for involvement in preparatory acts enabling terrorism. These men were, as it were, tried in absentia.\n\nAs the doctrine of the common household was a new legal invention, judges were often inconsistent in how they considered such “evidence.” What, then, was running a common household evidence of, and what counted as evidence of running a common household? How did this focus of attention emerge and develop, and what was left outside the frame? How did the courts deal with IS doctrine on housework and childcare, and with women’s own accounts as evidence? How did these positions intersect with particular turns in public opinion?\n\nThese various issues also raise questions of temporality, not only in terms of how sequencing is taken to imply causality, but also in terms of how a particular historical moment matters, with judges developing, and in appeal cases often rejecting, such new interpretations.",

          "abstract": "Studying teacher career paths offers valuable insights into how teachers´ career decisons impact\neducational inequality. However knowledge on teachers´ career paths across long time horizons is scarce.\nIn this study, I investigate how teachers’ teachers transition between schools in which students have\ndifferent levels of SES, or opt out of teaching, and how these transitions shape teachers career paths\nacross 35 years. Using Danish register data 13283 teachers who graduated between 1980 and 1985, I\nemploy sequence analysis and cluster analysis to map out teacher career paths over 35 years. The main\nfinding of the paper concerns the identification of four distinct types of career paths: 1) Teachers working\nalmost exclusively outside of public elementary schools, 2) Teachers primarily working in schools serving\nless affluent students, 3) Teachers primarily working in schools serving affluent students and 4) Teachers\nworking in schools serving middle-class students. Further, the analysis reveals that teacher career paths\nare highly stable. Once teachers begin their careers in a particular type of school, they tend to remain\nin that type throughout their careers. This contradicts the theoretical expectation that teachers would\nswitch schools or types of schools as they gain experience. Lastly, teacher characteristics such as high\nschool GPA, gender, and age at graduation show weak associations with the type of career path teachers\nfollow. The paper contributes to the literature on teacher sorting by providing a long-term view of teacher\ncareers, emphasizing early career decisions’ lasting effects.

We document a large rise of human capital expenditure (as % of GDP) in all parts of the world in the long run, but with enormous and persistent inequality between regions. Public education expenditure per school-age individual in Sub-Saharan Africa is about 3% of the level observed in Europe and North America in 2025 in PPP terms (versus 6% in 1980 and 4% in 1950). We also find a large impact of human capital expenditure on productivity growth over the 1800–2025 period, especially for public education and for poor countries. Estimated returns using our macro-historical database are around 10% or more, in line with micro studies. Finally, we present simulations based on alternative human capital expenditure trajectories over the 2025–2100 period. In particular, we analyze the conditions under which convergence in human capital expenditure could lead to global productivity convergence by 2100 (around 100€ per hour in all regions in our benchmark scenario).

          "abstract": "Research on partisan expressive responding suggests that the beliefs people express in surveys are more partisan than their underlying perceptions. This article examines expressive responding's scope and importance through a meta-reanalysis of 44 studies from 25 articles. On average, treatments designed to reduce expressive responding shrink measured partisan bias by about 25 percent. Across the 242 survey questions in the data, treatments increase the correlation between the average Democrat and Republican from 0.81 to 0.86. Contrary to expectations derived from the two leading theories of expressive responding, misreporting (''cheerleading'') and congenial inference, there is no evidence that expressive responding increases in partisan identity strength or educational attainment. As research on expressive responding enters its third decade, greater emphasis on design-based tests of mechanisms may help build a firmer understanding of expressive responding’s nature and substantive importance---namely, whether the forces that produce expressive responding in surveys also shape real-world political judgments.",

          "abstract": "This research examines the practice of marital surname change as a site where identity, autonomy, and tradition intersect. While often dismissed as a personal choice, the act carries cultural and psycho-political weight. This study specifically draws attention to Indian society and its practices regarding surname change. Existing studies have largely talk about the emotional and social aspects of surname change practices and fail to focus on the real-life consequences that people face when met with such a choice. To address this gap, a mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 301 respondents with two qualitative interviews. The findings reveal that surname change is seldom a neutral act; instead reflecting enduring patriarchal expectations that define legitimacy and belonging. Yet, younger participants demonstrate emerging alternatives, with hyphenated, dual, or invented surnames that challenge conventional lineage models. By analysing these evolving practices, this study argues that the politics of naming remain a mirror of social hierarchies while also offering new ways for achieving some degree of equality and self-definition in contemporary cultural and familial life through a chain of uncomfortable questioning.",

          "abstract": "This teaching note presents a pedagogical framework for integrating Large Language\nModel (LLM)-powered role-playing tools into social work education that moves beyond skills-\nfocused approaches to incorporate relational and embodied dimensions of practice. Using\nSWAT:Role Play, a text-based simulation tool where students engage with simulated service\nuser personas, we propose pedagogical design considerations for LLM role-playing. While\nfeatures like unlimited practice opportunities, immediate feedback, and systematic assessment\nalign with Deliberate Practice models, student testing revealed recognition of the absent \"human\ntouch\" essential to professional practice. Drawing on concepts of technology-driven moral\ndeskilling (Wong, 2024), we argue that designing simulation tools primarily around skill\nacquisition risks fragmenting social work practice into isolated components, negating the\nstructured immersion into holistic professional practice that social work demands. To address\nthis challenge, we propose \"ritualizing the machine\" through intentional design principles that\ndevelop students' \"ritual fluency,\" their ability to navigate complete client encounters with\nappropriate relational and contextual responsiveness. We suggest teaching strategies including\npre-session visual context and ritual preparation, during-session temporal pressure and boundary\nchallenges, and post-session reflection on relational impact. These recommendations help social\nwork educators use LLMs to simulate role-playing that effectively integrates technical\ncompetence with relational sensitivity",

          "title": "Predicting Rates of Food Insecurity in the United States  in the Absence of Official Data Collection",
          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "authors": "Kerstin Ostermann; Sebastian Bähr",
          "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between $1\\times1$ kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most direct for native neighborhood women. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that gendered neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

          "authors": "Matthias Penker; Rebecca Wardana",
          "abstract": "Monitoring social change at the national level is a crucial aspect of international comparative studies. The environmental module of the International Social Survey Program, conducted four times, provides the opportunity to explore long-term changes in pro environmental attitudes and behaviours across a broad range of societies from 1993 to 2022. Based on data from 24 European countries, this study offers a fresh longitudinal perspective. First, we investigate long-term trends in environmental attitudes (willingness to pay, environmental risk perception) and environmentally significant behaviours (recycling and public sphere behaviours) across various European societies. Second, by applying multi-level within-between random effects models (REWB), we test whether changes in national affluence impact pro environmental attitudes and behaviours, thereby evaluating the affluence thesis for Europe from a longitudinal perspective. Our main findings indicate that since 2010, environmental attitudes and behaviours have been on an upward trend. This suggests an increased awareness of the topic of climate change in Europe and a possible recovery from the negative impacts of the global economic crisis in 2008. Additionally, we can link the affluence thesis to several other dimensions of environmental attitudes and behaviours, contributing to a critical examination of this hypothesis.",

          "authors": "Annika Aebli; Fabienne Silberstein-Bamford; Joshua Silberstein Bamford",
          "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems are designed to enable decentralised coordination and open participation, yet large self-organising crypto communities face persistent organisational challenges. In these complex socio-technical systems, tensions emerge around how to coordinate collective action without hierarchy, balance technical rigour with social connection, and sustain engagement amid constant information overload and competition for attention. We argue that participation depends not only on technical proficiency or economic incentives but equally on the social and organisational mechanisms that enable authentic interaction, trust-building, and social cohesion within crypto communities. Drawing on the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews with retail crypto investors, we explore how participants experience the inherent organisational tensions embedded in their crypto community. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational demands rooted in modes of communication, decision-making, and community growth—each reflecting the dual nature of crypto as both a technical protocol and a social system. Our findings suggest that maintaining balance across these tensions, rather than resolving them, is essential for meaningful participation and long-term platform sustainability. The study contributes a user-centred perspective to debates on governance and collective organisation in decentralized, attention-driven ecosystems.",

          "authors": "Guido Salza; Robin Samuel",
          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital technologies has created both opportunities and risks for young people. Previous research shows that their digital engagement is often driven by educational or informational needs, social interaction, and entertainment. However, many practitioners and scholars warn of youth-specific risks. Moreover, pre-existing socioeconomic advantages shape not only access but also young people’s digital motivation, mastery, and patterns of engagement. Adopting an inclusive approach that encompasses a wide range of methodologies, we conduct a scoping review to explore the impact of digital engagement on young people's life outcomes, with a particular focus on the role of socioeconomic resources. We selected relevant studies from a systematic search of the Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences. We then categorized the empirical evidence based on its relevance to our topic and analyzed each study's results, determining whether it showed benefit or harm based on the observed direction of the effect. Findings from 57 empirical studies suggest that digital activities are not inherently harmful or beneficial but depend on the specific task in focus and the domain of life outcomes considered. While digital engagement tends to have a positive impact on academic outcomes, its effects on wellbeing are mixed. Socioeconomic resources generally give young people an additional advantage in using digital devices and activities for more positive life outcomes and in balancing online opportunities and risks. However, more research is needed to analyze the channels through which this advantage is realized.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Jinjia Gui; Yitong Zou",
          "abstract": "This study explores how embodiment shapes user perceptions of AI pets through social media text mining. Comparing Fuzozo (an embodied robotic companion for adult women) and Havivi (a minimally embodied plush toy with an external AI module for children), we analyze user-generated content on Rednote using topic modeling, semantic networks, and sentiment analysis. Results show that Fuzozo elicits emotionally rich, relational discourse—often framed as companionship—but also triggers disappointment when emotional expectations are unmet. In contrast, Havivi generates fragmented, utility-focused comments centered on play, familiarity, and practicality. Network analysis reveals a cohesive, affective community around Fuzozo versus scattered, functional mentions for Havivi. These findings suggest that embodiment transforms AI from a functional accessory into a perceived social entity, fundamentally influencing how users relate to and evaluate AI companions.",
