          "authors": "Evan Mayo-Wilson; Sean Grant; Katherine S. Corker; David Moher",
          "abstract": "In 2013, the Center for Open Science (COS) proposed that journal articles be awarded “badges” for engaging in open science practices including “preregistration”. In 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (TOP 2015) promoted “preregistration” of studies and analysis plans. Since then, the term “preregistration” has been used to describe different research outputs created at different times—sometimes, but not always, including study registration. Following a review of evidence about TOP 2015 implementation, including evidence that adherence could not be rated reliably, the TOP Guidelines Advisory Board updated these guidelines. The TOP 2025 Guidelines no longer use the term “preregistration.” Instead, TOP 2025 disambiguates specific research outputs such as registrations, study protocols, analysis plans, code, and other research materials. TOP 2025 also explains that researchers should describe the time at which outputs are created and shared in relation to key study activities. In this article, we explain why adopting the terminology used in TOP 2025, and describing the times at which specific research outputs are created and shared, will enhance understanding and support better implementation and reporting of open science.",

          "authors": "Hannah Hobson; Amy Pearson; Audrey Helen Linden; Catherine Manning; Felicity Sedgewick; Laura Crane; Daniel Poole",
          "abstract": "Open data has been promoted as a tool to improve the transparency, robustness, and efficiency of scientific research. However, the perspectives of participant communities, particularly those who are marginalised, are often overlooked in discussions around open data. For the first time, this paper examines the views of autistic adults and parents of autistic people regarding open data practices in autism research. Thirty interviews were conducted, which considered participants’ views on different degrees of openness of research data, and the factors that would influence their level of comfort with their and/or their child’s data being shared. Pre-registered reflexive thematic analysis that interrogated power dynamics in the participants’ statements led to the development of two themes: (1) Narratives of Research, and (2) Vulnerability and Risk in Research Participation. These themes reflected how narratives and risks around open data were experienced both individually and collectively. Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of open data for knowledge generation and improving services, but also expressed concerns about misuse, re-identification, and interpretations from secondary researchers leading to harmful narratives. Most participants preferred restricted access models over fully open data.  The findings highlight the importance of meaningful engagement with participant communities to ensure ethical and transparent open data practices. We hope this work will inform not only autism researchers but also others working with marginalised populations on decision making about open data.",

          "abstract": "We present a meta-analysis of prospect theory parameters, summarizing data from 166 papers reporting 812 estimates. These parameters synthesize propensities in risk-taking behavior, thus holding interest beyond prospect theory itself. The mean patterns we obtain align with the stylized facts of diminishing sensitivity towards outcomes and probabilities discussed in prospect theory. Beyond this, we uncover systematic violations of procedure invariance. A large proportion of the vast heterogenity between studies furthermore remains unexplained. These findings point to the promise of cognitive accounts of behavior in organizing unexplained variation in risk-taking, which we discuss.",

          "title": "From Form to Formation. Biomedical Reporting Standards in Practice",
          "authors": "Alexander Schniedermann",
          "abstract": "Modern biomedical research is becoming increasingly industrialized, with standardized practices playing a central role in its evolution. Since the 1990s, reporting guidelines have introduced structured templates for scientific writing, aimed at ensuring quality and consistency in publications. These guidelines, such as PRISMA, were rapidly adopted across diverse biomedical domains and are now widely used by researchers around the world. However, their impact extends far beyond the formal standardization of writing. Because they are tailored to specific types or genres of research, reporting guidelines exert a deeper influence on scientific practice. Interviews with authors of systematic reviews who used PRISMA reveal a varied and complex landscape of usage. Rather than applying the guideline solely for reporting purposes, researchers integrate it into multiple stages of their workflow, including study design, data analysis, and peer review. In doing so, they transform PRISMA into a practical and versatile tool that supports the entire research process. Yet, its use is not uniform. Instead, researchers assign different roles to the guideline depending on individual preferences and contextual factors which, together, are not yet fully systematized or understood. This raises important questions about what exactly is being standardized through reporting guidelines. Moreover, PRISMA’s social implications and the range of tasks it influences suggest that it shapes systematic reviewing as a new profession or a distinct set of tasks within the broader biomedical field.",

Established neuroscientific and cognitive theories of consciousness are systematically aligned with empirical evidence from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and related disciplines.

          "authors": "Hyoju Kim; Bruce Tomblin; Bob McMurray",
          "abstract": "Recent research in speech perception highlights categorization consistency—the degree of trial-by-trial variability in response—as a more informative metric of individual differences in speech categorization over how gradient underlying category structure individuals have. However, its relevance to broader language functions remains unknown. In Experiment 1, English-speaking adults (n=57) completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, rating a speech continuum on a continuous scale, alongside two language assessments. Results showed that a greater consistency in speech categorization strongly predicted better language abilities (accounting for 29% of the variance), whereas categorization gradiency showed no such relationship. Experiment 2 (n=76) added a VAS task in which participants performed the same task with images from a visual continuum, to determine whether the observed effects reflected domain-general categorization mechanisms. Replicating and extending the findings of Experiment 1, speech categorization consistency again emerged as a robust predictor of language outcomes, with an even larger effect size (~40% of the variance). Critically, commonality regression revealed that a substantial proportion of variance in language performance was uniquely attributable to speech, but not visual, categorization consistency. These provide compelling evidence for a speech-specific and robust link between speech categorization consistency and general language function.",

          "abstract": "Objective\nCharacter strengths are positive personality traits that not only define our core identity, but also yield positive effects for us and those around us. Psychological research has often been one-sidedly focused on tackling health risk factors or maladaptive traits, disregarding the potential of fostering positive resources such as character strengths when aiming to influence health trajectories. We examine the predictive validity of character strengths for health-related outcomes using machine learning algorithms.\nMethods\nUsing a sample of 4,830 adults from five countries, we examined the validity of character strengths for the prediction of 12 health-related indicators (e.g., sleep quality, feeling anxious, or healthy dieting) across two levels of measurement (items vs. scales), modeling approaches (multiple regression vs. three machine learning algorithms), and cultural contexts.\nResults\nThe outcomes could be predicted by character strengths with R² values ranging from .02 for the prediction of poor physical health to .28 for poor mental health. Character strength items rarely out-predicted their overarching scales. Machine learning algorithms were able to enhance predictive performance by means of regularization, but the results did not point to meaningful non-linear or interaction effects. The largest differences in predictive performance were found when evaluating models across culturally dissimilar countries.\nConclusions\nCultural context proved an important moderator of the association between character strengths and mental as well as physical health indicators. In contrast, the incremental value of character strengths at the item level or including complex relationships in the modeling compared to simpler modeling approaches is negligible.",

          "authors": "Ellen C. Reinhart; Monique M. Turner; David Matthew Markowitz; Dustin Carnahan",
          "abstract": "Many people who are eligible to participate in the political process do not, suggesting\nthe interests of a large portion of the electorate are not adequately represented in\ngovernment. While some past work has found that subjective well-being is related to\npolitical engagement, less is known about which specific aspects of well-being might\ndrive this effect. We propose and test the idea that self-perceived social contribution –\nthe belief that one’s life and everyday activities provide something of value to society –\nis related to multiple forms of political participation, likely because people who believe\nthey provide something of value to society feel more integrated with society and\ntherefore may be more likely to act on its behalf via political participation. Two\ncorrelational studies (N = 3,729) with data from distinct points in American politics\n(1996 and 2024) find that individuals with greater self-perceived social contribution\nwere more likely to intend to vote, be willing to engage in activism, seek rather than\navoid election information (Study 1), and donate to and volunteer for political causes\n(Study 2). Further, Study 2 provides empirical support for the previously theorized\ncomponents of social contribution, providing evidence that self-efficacy and social\nresponsibility underlie this construct in political contexts. Together, these studies\nidentify a specific dimension of well-being that is related to multiple forms of political\nparticipation and suggests that fostering feelings of social contribution may promote\ndemocratic engagement.",

          "authors": "Adam Shoucair",
          "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model of subjective time perception, called Relative Time Theory. It argues that individuals perceive time intervals in proportion to their current age, making time feel faster as we age. The theory is formalized mathematically and explained through the equation R(t, a) = t / a, with cumulative time perceived expressed as S(a) = ln(a). This model has implications for developmental psychology, memory formation, time perception research, and personal life planning. A childhood insight, refined into a proportional and logarithmic model of time, reveals that “the day you’re born is the longest day of your life, and the day you die is the shortest.”",

          "authors": "Takao Nakai",
          "abstract": "Discrimination continues to be a profound source of social division and personal \nsuffering. Although its external forms evolve, its underlying structure—unjust \nexclusion and hostility toward particular groups or individuals—remains persistent. \nWhile existing studies have largely focused on socio-cultural conditions and cognitive \nbiases, further exploration into the emotional and psychological mechanisms \nunderlying discriminatory behavior is urgently needed. \nThis paper aims to clarify the core psychological structure of discrimination by \nintegrating three key insights from the author’s prior works: the mechanism of \n“confidence in one’s existential value” (Nakai, 2025a), the concept of “empathic bias \nbased on identification” (Nakai, 2025b), and the theory of “justice as a dynamic \npursuit” (Nakai, 2025c). Specifically, the paper argues that a deficiency in \nself-esteem gives rise to a fear of worthlessness, which then fuels discriminatory \nbehavior toward perceived \"others,\" cognitively rationalized as \"just.\" \nImportantly, the discrimination examined here refers to the irrational, unjust exclusion \nand mistreatment of individuals or groups based on prejudice—fundamentally \ndistinct from the ethically reasoned “distinction based on coexistence possibility” \ndiscussed in earlier work (Nakai, 2025b). The former arises from a pathological \npsychological response aimed at securing one's fragile self-worth, often \naccompanied by emotional suppression and cognitive distortion.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\t\nBackgrounds: Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) has garnered widespread attention due to its rapidly increasing prevalence and social harm. Individuals with MUD are often accompanied by severe mood dysregulation, leading to more frequent irrational decisions such as drug-seeking behavior without consideration for consequences. Existing research indicates that the impairment of the reward system is central to the development of addiction. However, it remains unclear how the abnormal reward processing affects the mood regulation abilities of individuals with MUD. In this study, we explored the cognitive and computational mechanisms through which the subjective mood of individuals with MUD is influenced by reward information during decision-making. \nMethods: We recruited 76 male participants (27 with MUD, 49 healthy controls, HC) who completed a risk gambling task. In this task, participants were asked to choose between two options with certain or uncertain rewards. After every 2-3 gambling trials, participants also rated their momentary subjective happiness. We constructed multiple computational models to predict how various reward information (such as reward prediction error) influenced the short-term fluctuations in participants' subjective mood during risk decisions.\nResults: Individuals with MUD exhibited significantly more irrational decisions compared to the HC group. Computational modeling revealed that, compared to healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed a significantly weaker influence of various reward information (e.g., expected value, EV; reward prediction error, RPE) on their subjective mood. Importantly, the EV-and RPE-mood association predict the degree of substance abuse.\nConclusions: Our findings provide computational evidence that individuals with MUD lack effective regulation of mood by the reward system. This process leads to more substance abuse. These results shed new light into the mood issues in individuals with MUD from the perspective of reward processing, thereby helping to reduce drug.",

          "abstract": "The current child and adolescent mental health crisis necessitates both empirical and theoretical innovation. This review presents a new framework conceptualising mental health and wellbeing (MHW) neurodevelopment in childhood and adolescence - The Neurodevelopmental Theory of Mental Health and Wellbeing Capacities (NDeTeC) - formulated from a transdiagnostic preventative perspective. The NDeTeC specifies two key neuro-cognitive-affective capacities underpinning MHW, together with their associated brain networks, positioned in a developmentally fine-grained and socially-contextualised perspective on MHW. The first capacity focuses on self-regulation and identifies neurodevelopmental processes underlying adaptive managing of thoughts, emotions and behaviours, including emotional awareness and regulation of distraction, reactivity, rumination and worry. This capacity is associated with the intertwined activity in salience-executive-default mode networks, reward network and the Hypothalamus-Pituitary Axis. The second capacity, called the self-world capacity, specifies and integrates relational processes of MHW underpinning a connected, flexible, ethically-grounded and purposeful sense of self associated with shared humanity, connectedness and prosocial agency. This capacity is linked to activity in the theory of mind, empathy, prosociality and default mode networks. The review outlines how the NDeTeC framework can enable integration of different MHW constructs and associated approaches to guide improvements in long-term MHW support for children and adolescents.",

          "abstract": "This metascientific project studied the replicability of Bem Experiment 1, which had claimed a precognitive effect, i.e., the ability to successfully guess the outcome of future random events (Bem. J Pers Soc Psychol. 2011;100: 407-25). The use of advanced methodologies—based on the advanced meta-experimental protocol (AMP) and transparent psi project (TPP) procedures—reduced the risk of false discoveries as a function of (i) confirmation bias, (ii) non-transparency, and (iii) intrinsic measurement bias. The combined AMP-TPP test strategy performed three replication studies with a total of 26,483 participants resulting in N = 420,472 critical trials. Study 1 failed to replicate the precognitive effect. An exploratory analysis of Study 1 suggested an effect in the opposite direction than was originally predicted (49.48% ± 0.26 SE; N = 37,836). Study 2 confirmed this exploratory result using a high-powered replication design (49.65% ± 0.14 SE; p = 0.013; N = 127,000). Study 3 was unable to replicate the result from Study 2 (50.07% ± 0.11 SE; p = 0.496; N = 217,800). The result of Study 2 represents a rare example in psi research of the successful replication of an exploratory result using a confirmatory protocol. The source of the one-time confirmed anomalous result in Study 2 remains to be identified. This result presents either (i) a psi-derived anomaly that defies known physical laws, or (ii) a method-derived anomaly, e.g., a false-positive statistical finding. Using conventional standards, based on the lack of replicability in Study 3 and absence of an accepted scientific theory, the second scenario appears more plausible. This AMP-TPP metascientific project demonstrated the use of advanced controls for assessing the reliability of the employed scientific process. This project shows how rigor-enhancing test strategies can improve the reliability, not only of psi research, but any type of weak-effects experiments, including in psychology.",

          "abstract": "Communication is a process of commitment to one’s words. However, these words often carry multiple layers of meaning.

Across two experiments, participants were presented with everyday communicative scenarios with their corresponding real-world outcomes (i.e., every meaning’s truth-value). Participants’ perceived commitment to each stream of meaning (explicit or implicit) was measured through a direct commitment probe, along with their overall trust in the speaker. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the truth-value of the implicit content influenced participants’ perceived commitment not only to the implicit meaning, but also to the explicit meaning, despite the latter being independently true/false. The effect was asymmetrical, as the truth-value of the explicit content influenced commitment to the explicit meaning only. Experiment 2 examined this asymmetry by manipulating the subjectivity of the explicit content, which resulted in a moderate shift towards symmetry when the explicit content was objective. Compared to direct commitment, trust in the speaker was broadly shaped by the truth-value of both explicit and implicit content, indicating that trust reflects a more global evaluation of the speaker, while commitment is more tightly aligned with specific communicative intentions.

          "abstract": "This tutorial introduces Factored Structural Equation Modeling (FSEM), an alternative to classic multivariate SEM, and demonstrates its implementation in the Blimp software and the rblimp R package. FSEM reconceptualizes the joint distribution of observed and latent variables as a set of univariate and multivariate submodels—each specified via simple regression equations—and treats latent variables as missing data to be imputed via Bayesian data augmentation. This approach seamlessly accommodates combinations of continuous (normal and nonnormal), binary, ordinal, nominal, count, and two-part variables; interactions; nonlinear effects; heteroscedasticity; and multilevel data structures without violating distributional assumptions. We first outline the theoretical foundations of factored regression specification and its connection to the probability chain rule. We then describe the Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation and missing-data imputation algorithms that underlie FSEM. Next, we present a series of illustrative models—ranging from basic confirmatory factor analysis to complex dynamic, multilevel, and hybrid generalized-linear-SEM applications—providing Blimp syntax excerpts and a real-data example. We conclude by discussing practical considerations, limitations, and directions for future methodological research. This tutorial aims to equip researchers with a flexible, user-friendly framework for modeling complex data in behavioral and social sciences.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that frontal hemispheric asymmetry may underlie various mental health disorders, and frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA), which reflects cortical activity and inactivity between the left and frontal lobes, could be a potential biomarker for these conditions. Some studies suggest that a single session of EF (EF) may modulate brain activity; however, it is not yet completely clear whether a single session of EF can shift FAA. We designed a preregistered, triple-blind randomized-controlled study to address this gap in the literature. Sixty-six healthy individuals (Mage = 24.55, SDage = 7.63) were recruited for the experiment. First, we assessed baseline resting-state FAA over a 10-minute period, consisting of five minutes each under eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Subsequently, participants were assigned to one of two 30-minute-long EF protocols, designed to modulate cortical activity by enhancing activation in either the right or left frontal hemisphere. FAA was reassessed immediately after the completion of the feedback intervention. The results indicated that a single session of EF does not modulate FAA; therefore, it should be considered with caution regarding causal inferences. However, the absence of effects may also be attributed to the form of feedback used, as well as individual differences in neurocognitive and psychological profiles.",

Approaches focusing on shared conceptual space suggested that the presence of synchronous or coordinated behaviors indicates the extent of conceptual alignment and thus, predicts communication success. Here we test this claim.\nMethods: Pairs of participants solved a computer-mediated communicative task involving verbal negotiation (“Bargaining Game”), while data of head motion, pupil size, and gaze direction were collected, and measures of prosody and structural speech characteristics were extracted from the recorded verbal interactions. Communication success and efficacy were assessed using objective task performance measures and subjective evaluations from the participants.\nResults: 1) interlocutors coordinated multiple aspects of their behavior, 2) objective measures of task performance were predicted by gaze pattern coordination, and 3) some forms of interpersonal coordination positively affected the participants’ subjective experience of their partner and the interaction.\nDiscussion: The results indicate that interpersonal coordination between interlocutors is prevalent across multiple modalities and it facilitates some aspects of the interaction - although, a mechanistic role of interpersonal coordination in communication was not specifically supported by the data.",

          "abstract": "Background Next-generation sequencing technologies are now routinely used in the NHS to identify rare genetic conditions (RGCs) in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs). As such, the proportion of children diagnosed in early childhood (&lt;6years) is rising rapidly. The risk of mental health conditions in this group is high, however anecdotal accounts suggest little mental health support is provided. The present study aimed to (1) define the challenges and facilitators in accessing mental health support for families caring for RGC IDD children and (2) explore family and healthcare professional priorities for mental health support. Focus groups were conducted with parents of RGC children and neurodisability medical professionals. De-identified transcripts of interviews were analysed using Framework Analysis. Eleven parents of children with RGC and IDD, and four professionals participated in the focus groups.\n\nResults The framework analysis identified general healthcare challenges related to having an RGC, including an absence of information in ‘the big black hole’ of the post-diagnostic void, ‘falling between the cracks’ and being stuck in a loop of referrals. It also identified barriers that were specific to accessing mental health support, including difficulties in understanding how to navigate services, diagnostic overshadowing (where the RGC diagnosis acted as an exclusion criterion for accessing services) and the emotional burden of seeking mental health support. Facilitators in accessing mental health support included parental resilience, happenstance, finding key advocates and getting other diagnoses that were more widely recognised. Parent and practitioner priorities for support were aligned. They included support for families post-genetic diagnosis, training and education for healthcare professionals, early mental health support and care-co-ordination. \n\nConclusion children with RGC diagnosed in early childhood and their caregivers face unique challenges in accessing mental health support for their child. Innovative approaches are needed to support parents caring for an IDD child diagnosed with RGC in early infancy and to provide better training for professionals on RGC management.",

While traditional natural and sexual selection focus on traits that enhance survival and reproduction, Ego‑Safe Selection argues that in human societies, traits often persist because they provide emotional safety, social validation, or ego comfort—rather than biological fitness. These traits are selected culturally through imitation, social norms, and fear-based avoidance, shaping preferences for partners, leaders, or behaviors that feel non-threatening or ego-affirming. This theory reframes evolution as driven not only by external pressures like predators or competition, but also by internal ones—such as fear of rejection, need for group approval, and emotional security. By integrating insights from evolutionary psychology, attachment theory, and cultural evolution, Ego‑Safe Selection offers a new lens to understand how psychological and social environments influence which traits are preserved and passed on.\nChatGPT was used solely for text modulation and language refinement.

          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aim: Studies have produced inconsistent findings when exploring relationships between social media usage (SMU) and wellbeing. This likely reflects the vast heterogeneity in subjective measures of SMU, coupled with a lack of consideration for the factors that influence different styles of SMU and drive individual differences in susceptibility to their effects. To advance our understanding of social media effects, the present study used a novel objective measure of individuals’ behaviour on social networking sites to examine whether distinct SMU styles are related differentially to social competencies that support real-world social interaction, and if these user characteristics mediate relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Methods: A total of 509 participants (261 females; Mage = 31.00, 18-71 years) completed the Social Networking Site Behaviour Task that measured styles of SMU objectively, the Multidimensional Social Competency Scale that captured self-reported competencies in seven domains of interpersonal behaviour, and four subjective measures of psychosocial wellbeing. Structural Equation Modelling was used to determine if social competencies differed among distinct SMU styles and mediated relationships with psychosocial variables. Findings: We identify interactive, reactive and passive SMU styles, reveal that users expressing these distinct styles differ on several social competencies, and discover that these competencies mediate differential relationships between SMU styles and indices of psychosocial wellbeing. Discussion: Just as individual differences in social competencies manifest in face-to-face interactions, we suggest that they also underpin SMU styles and shape individual differences in susceptibility to their effects on wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in wellbeing research emphasize its multifaceted nature, traditionally defined by hedonic and eudaimonic approaches. However, growing cross-cultural and empirical studies suggest this dichotomy may be insufficient to capture the diversity and complexity of human flourishing. This study investigates harmony as a distinct and essential dimension of wellbeing beyond life satisfaction and meaning in life. Drawing on data from culturally diverse samples in the United States and Hong Kong, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory structural equation modeling were applied to compare one-, two-, and three-factor models encompassing life satisfaction, meaning in life, and harmony. Across both samples, the three-factor exploratory structural equation modeling model showed the best fit, supporting the empirical distinctiveness of harmony. The findings provide strong empirical evidence for a tripartite model of wellbeing and support harmony as a core dimension of wellbeing. The results underscore the importance of expanding wellbeing frameworks to include culturally sensitive constructs and suggest a more holistic and integrative approach to conceptualizing and operationalizing wellbeing —one that moves beyond the hedonic–eudaimonic dichotomy— and opens new directions for future research, measurement, and interventions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Both visual and motor experiences impact action prediction, yet through potentially different mechanisms. Having physical experience with an action is thought to engage motor simulative processes, potentially activating the watcher’s motor system in an effector-specific manner, aiding prediction. Leveraging baseball’s unique specialization demands, we assessed pitch discrimination in athletes with predominantly visual experience seeing pitches (hitters, n = 41; 7 = left-handed hitters) and motor experience producing pitches (pitchers, n = 42; 9 = left-handed). Videos of right-handed (RH) pitches, with temporal occlusion applied at or after ball release, of three different pitches, were used to assess pitch prediction accuracy. Two versions of each video clip were shown; the original RH clips were “flipped” to make the pitcher appear to throw left-handed (LH). Pitchers and hitters had reliable responses and showed high accuracy (~70%) and discriminability. Pitchers were more discriminatory than hitters when contrasting two pitch types with the same initial trajectory and speed, but different postural cues (curveballs and changeups; d’ pitchers = 2.18, hitters = 1.88). Although there was the predicted interaction for the pitchers when comparing LH and RH pitchers watching LH and RH videos (p&lt;.05), only LH pitchers showed a trend for a same-side, LH video advantage (p=.06). Because pitchers did not differ in accuracy from hitters, despite a lack of visual experience seeing and responding, this suggests that their motor experience aided predictions. However, there was only partial support for a simulation explanation based on effector specificity (due to absence of any differences in RH pitchers).",

Using the Cultural Fixation Index (CFST) on World Values Survey data (more than 260,000 participants; 95 countries; 2005–2022), we measured cultural distance between groups defined by their region, ethnicity, religion, education level, income level, and subjective social class. A pre-registered multiverse analysis (54,600 model specifications; 100 model families; 6 demographic groupings; 6 outcome measures) showed only one robust pattern of negative societal outcomes: larger cultural distance between geographic regions predicts more corruption, weaker democracy, lower social mobility, and greater risk of civil conflict. Distances between ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were mostly benign, and educational distance was often associated with better outcomes. The results imply that what matters is not diversity per se, but whether culturally distinct groups are geographically segregated and therefore less likely to regularly interact to negotiate the cultural traits needed for cooperation and coordination.",

I call this “Ego‑Safe Selection.” It reframes evolutionary psychology by recognizing that cultural and psychological forces, not just biology, shape the traits we pass down.\nKey Difference Between Darwin's Theory and My Theory (Ego-Safe Selection)\n[1] Darwin: Traits are passed on because they help an organism survive and reproduce in the natural world.\nMe: Traits are passed on because they help individuals feel safe, accepted, or validated in social and emotional terms.\n\n[2] Darwin: Focuses on external factors — environment, predators, physical fitness.\nMe: Focuses on internal, social factors — fear of rejection, ego protection, social approval.\n\n[3] Darwin: Reproductive success is based on physical fitness or attractiveness.\nMe: Reproductive success is often based on social conformity, emotional safety, or status approval.\n\n[4] Darwin: Evolution is shaped by biological advantage.\nMe: Evolution is shaped by psychological and emotional preference in the minds of others.\n\n[5] Darwin: Sexual selection is seen as a branch of natural selection for passing on “desirable” traits.\nMe: Sexual and social selection is driven by fear and ego — what people choose not out of love, but out of emotional survival.\n\nSummary:\nDarwin emphasized biological survival.\nI emphasize psychological survival.\n\nMy theory expands natural selection into a deeper human truth:\n“We didn’t just evolve based on who was strongest. We evolved based on who made others feel safest — emotionally, socially, and egotistically.”\n\nI would love to mention some references and inspirations\n\nCharles Darwin, On the Origin of Species (1859) – The foundational theory of natural and sexual selection.\n\nSigmund Freud, The Ego and the Id (1923) – For early explorations of ego and human drives.\n\nEvolutionary Psychology (general) – For connecting biology, behavior, and mate selection.\n\nTaoism (via Lao Tzu) – For the concept of flexibility, yielding, and quiet strength in nature and humanity.\n\nYuval Noah Harari, Sapiens – For ideas about human storytelling and imagined realities shaping survival.\n\nThese works helped shape the context in which “Ego-Safe Selection” was conceptualized, though all ideas, structure, and language in this paper are original.",

          "abstract": "With the global increase in smartphone use, parental technoference – disruptions in parent-child interactions due to digital devices – has been shown to negatively impact children’s development, particularly on parental responsiveness and children’s emotional wellbeing. The current study is the first to investigate the real-time effects of parental smartphone use on 9-month-old infants’ object learning during live interactions. Using head-mounted eye trackers, N= 21 infant-caregiver dyads engaged with novel toy objects in two conditions (familiarisation phase): a Joint-Attention (JA) condition, where caregivers introduced objects while engaging in joint attention with the infant, and a Smartphone (SP) condition, where caregivers introduced objects without looking at the infant but instead watching videos on a smartphone. Immediately after each condition (recognition phase), infants’ object recognition was assessed through a preferential looking test, where a familiarised object was presented side by side with a novel object. Prior to the interactions, caregivers completed the Mobile Phone Involvement Questionnaire. During the familiarisation phase infants showed no difference in total looking time at objects between conditions. In the recognition phase, while in the JA condition infants showed a familiarity preference for the previously seen object, in the SP condition they did not show any preference for either object, and this difference between conditions was significant. Interestingly, the parental-reported mobile phone use scores did not predict infants’ object recognition performance. These findings underscore the negative impact of parenting technoference on infants’ object learning, highlighting the need for further research into how technoference influences early learning processes.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between childhood trauma and personality traits among Indian college students, with a focus on how different trauma subtypes influence the Big Five personality dimensions. A sample of 250 students aged 18–24 completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI-44). Statistical analyses including Pearson’s correlation, MANOVA, hierarchical regression, and moderation via PROCESS Macro revealed that emotional and physical neglect were the most prevalent and developmentally impactful forms of trauma. Emotional neglect significantly predicted higher neuroticism (β = .38, p &lt; .001), while both forms of neglect were associated with lower conscientiousness and agreeableness. Gender was found to moderate the impact of neglect on conscientiousness, with male students showing greater personality disruption. These findings highlight the enduring psychological consequences of early emotional deprivation and the importance of gender-sensitive, trauma-informed interventions in university mental health frameworks. The study underscores the developmental weight of neglect and invites reconsideration of how trauma is conceptualized in personality formation within emerging adult populations in non-Western contexts.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a crucial yet understudied skill with significant implications for learning and information-seeking. Prior research identifies question complexity as a key predictor of question creativity and problem-solving ability. However, little is known about how accurately individuals assess their own question complexity. Across three studies, participants generated questions and self-rated their complexity and creativity. We then compared their self-ratings to objective computational model scores. In Study 1 (N = 100), self-rated question complexity showed a weak correlation with model ratings (r = .151). Study 2 (N = 100) replicated and strengthened this relation (r = .206), revealing a stronger correlation for question creativity (r = .321). We also found bias effects for complexity: participants underestimated the complexity of their high-level questions and overestimated their low-level ones. In Study 3 (N = 101), participants read a training brief before rating, which significantly improved accuracy in self-assessing complexity (r = .453) and creativity (r = .487) and eliminated overestimation. Our study highlights the challenges in self-assessment of questions and prominent cognitive biases. Crucially, our study also shows that brief explanations of question complexity substantially improve self-assessment accuracy, highlighting practical implications for educational strategies aimed at enhancing metacognitive awareness of question-asking ability.",

          "abstract": "Influential perspectives on polarization in the United States imply that partisans will be more willing to degrade democracy when they are ideologically aligned with their own party and  negatively oriented toward the opposing party. But psychological accounts of political ideology suggest that conservatives will be especially anti-democratic regardless of partisanship.  Integrating insights from these areas, we argue that there are reasons to expect paradoxical partisan asymmetries in the ideological correlates of democratic attitudes. Across numerous surveys we find that cultural conservatism and out-party favorability are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Democrats (but not Republicans), while left-leaning economic attitudes are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Republicans (but not Democrats). These findings provide context for understanding how polarization might impact American democracy. They also suggest that increased centrality of sociocultural conflict and Republican cultivation of a right-wing populist reputation might sort anti-democratic Americans into the Republican Party.",

This review synthesizes recent evidence linking the DMN directly to subjective valuation and value-based decisions. Anatomically and functionally, core DMN regions—including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex—overlap extensively with the brain’s valuation system, suggesting shared computational roles. Recent studies further identify distinct posterior cingulate cortex subregions involved in simulation, memory retrieval, and evaluation. Additionally, the DMN dynamically interacts with reward-related and control networks—such as the ventral striatum and hippocampus—during value-guided social decisions. These interactions vary with motivational context and individual differences, revealing how subjective value emerges across diverse situations. Disruptions in these dynamics occur in aging and psychiatric conditions, linking DMN dysfunction to maladaptive decision-making. Together, these findings position the DMN as an integrative hub critical for internal valuation and goal-directed behavior.",

Yet, they can be appraised in very different ways, resulting in wellbeing and personal growth or in marginalization and mental health problems. One challenge is that there are relatively few systematic efforts to explore possible appraisals and the overall contexts in which these experiences take place. We report a validation and extension of a previously designed set of follow-up and appraisal questions to the Inventory of Nonordinary Experiences, with a sample of Brazilian participants (N = 160). After validation, we administered these follow-up questions and appraisals in a general population sample (N = 5,117) in which individuals reported on one of 38 nonordinary experiences. Overall, the patterns suggest that individual response options are normally distributed, suggesting that there are several shared interpretations across a wide range of diverse experiences in the general population.

Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts,  consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts.

Consumer-grade devices tend to rely on heart rate (HR)-based estimation methods to classify PA intensity, which contrasts with traditional research-grade accelerometers that use count- or raw-acceleration metrics. Comparability issues are particularly salient across individuals with varying weight status. In this commentary, we discuss systematic discrepancies between HR-based (relative intensity) and acceleration-based (absolute intensity) classifications of MVPA among individuals with greater adiposity. Using Fitbit data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we illustrate how HR-based PA intensity classification may indicate higher MVPA in youth with greater adiposity despite lower step counts and light PA levels. We highlight implications for research design, public health surveillance, messaging, policy, and interventions. We also call for greater transparency, standardized methodologies, and integrative measurement approaches to ensure more accurate assessment of PA behavior.",

In the current work, we introduce CAP—the Creativity Assessment Platform—a free web application for building creativity assessments, collecting data, and automatically scoring responses (cap.ist.psu.edu). CAP allows users to create custom creativity assessments in 10 languages using a simple, point-and-click interface, selecting from tasks such as the Short Story Task, Drawing Task, and Scientific Creative Thinking Test. Users can automatically score task responses using machine learning models trained to match human creativity ratings—with multilingual capabilities, including the new Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS), a large language model achieving strong prediction of human creativity ratings in 10 languages. CAP also provides a centralized dashboard to monitor data collection, score assessments, and automatically generate text for a Method section based on the study’s tasks, metrics, and instructions—with a single click—promoting transparency and reproducibility in creativity assessment. Designed for ease-of-use, CAP aims to democratize creativity measurement, for researchers, educators, and everyone in-between.",

          "abstract": "Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments is partly due to problems with auditory selective attention—a process that enhances the neural representation of target sounds over competing sounds. Neurofeedback training that targets auditory selective attention shows promise to improve speech-in-noise perception in normal-hearing individuals. For such training to be effective, the attention decoding algorithm must be accurate, generalizable, and explainable, even for brief, few-second-long EEG signals.\nPrior attention decoding algorithms used for neurofeedback have low accuracy and lack generalizability, despite their explainability. To address these shortcomings, this study developed three attention decoders based on well-established algorithms: forward linear model, backward linear model, and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. We assessed the decoder’s accuracy in classifying selective attention from single-trial EEG and its generalizability to untrained participants. For explainability, we examined spatial and temporal features critical for decoding.\nOur findings indicate that decoding selective attention to short, co-located sound is feasible with both linear and CNN models, each offering unique benefits. The CNN showed superior accuracy (72.3%) and cross-subject generalizability compared to linear models (64.9%). Conversely, linear models provided clearer neurophysiological explainability, aligning spatially and temporally with established evidence for attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses.\nThese results support that linear models are more suited for neurofeedback, where understanding the basis of decoding is crucial for effective training. Meanwhile, the CNN remains a strong candidate for applications requiring high performance. This research provides a foundation for developing evidence-based rehabilitation protocols for speech-in-noise perception, enabling interventions grounded in measurable neural changes.",

Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

          "abstract": "When defining concepts for scientific work, researchers consider various desiderata (desired characteristics) that are derived from higher level meta-desiderata regarding accepted goals of scientific work and how to act towards achieving them. Although these desiderata are often implicit, they significantly impact researchers' processes of defining and selecting concepts, ultimately influencing research outcomes, communication, and knowledge production. We evaluate the selection and application of desiderata for defining cross-disciplinary concepts dependent upon higher level meta-desiderata working from the example that if one believes that science ought to strive for providing systematic knowledge about the world (level 1), and if one believes that the ease of communication will positively affect the process of attaining that kind of knowledge (level 2), then one ought to strive for definitions of concepts that provide as much as possible of the list of features we argue for (level 3). Using psychological concepts as our examples we offer a proposed list of six desiderata: precision, specificity, theory-neutrality, explanation- neutrality, operational ease, folk-level understanding. The goal is to facilitate researchers' consideration of appropriate desiderata and, where their meta-desiderata match the example provided, promote the adoption and utilization of these desiderata in their work. Given the backdrop of conceptual change and conceptual creep, this aspect, though less discussed, plays a crucial role in shaping our research and knowledge production.",

          "abstract": "In their impactful pre-registered meta-analysis, Chan and Albarracín aimed to determine the degree to which the public updates science-relevant misinformation following a correction (e.g., p.1514, paragraph 3). Based on an impressive 74 studies and 205 effect sizes, the authors concluded that “attempts to debunk science-relevant misinformation were, on average, not successful (d=0.19, P=0.131, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.43)”; p.1514), with the effect of corrections “smaller than those identified in all other areas” (p.15171; e.g., politics and health). In this commentary we show that the reported null effect was due to the inappropriate pooling of two distinct effect types into a single estimate. This clarification is necessary because meta-analyses are often perceived as the ‘gold standard’ of evidence, and numerous papers have cited Chan and Albarracín1 as evidence that corrections have little-to-no effect on science-relevant misinformation (35% by our estimates; see Supplementary Table 1).",

          "abstract": "Creativity is increasingly recognized as a core competency for the 21st century, making its development a priority in education, research, and industry. To effectively cultivate creativity, researchers and educators need reliable and accessible assessment tools. Recent software developments have significantly enhanced the administration and scoring of creativity measures; however, existing software often requires expertise in experiment design and computer programming, limiting their accessibility to many educators and researchers. In the current work, we introduce CAP—the Creativity Assessment Platform—a free web application for building creativity assessments, collecting data, and automatically scoring responses (cap.ist.psu.edu). CAP allows users to create custom creativity assessments in 10 languages using a simple, point-and-click interface, selecting from tasks such as the Short Story Task, Drawing Task, and Scientific Creative Thinking Test. Users can automatically score task responses using machine learning models trained to match human creativity ratings—with multilingual capabilities, including the new Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS), a large language model achieving strong prediction of human creativity ratings in 10 languages. CAP also provides a centralized dashboard to monitor data collection, score assessments, and automatically generate text for a Method section based on the study’s tasks, metrics, and instructions—with a single click—promoting transparency and reproducibility in creativity assessment. Designed for ease-of-use, CAP aims to democratize creativity measurement, for researchers, educators, and everyone in-between.",

We review the psychology of information spread, or the psychology of “virality.” Similar types of information tend to spread in many contexts, both online and offline. This is likely because similar psychological processes drive information spread across contexts. We explain how these psychological processes interact with structural features of information environments, including norms, networks, and incentive structures. Surprisingly, widely shared content is often not widely liked—a phenomenon called “the paradox of virality.” We discuss the strengths and limitations of the virality metaphor. We also discuss future directions for the field, such as leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence to better understand how information spreads across cultures and contexts.",

          "abstract": "Food learning in early life largely relies on social learning. Previous research has shown that infants learn something is edible when they directly observe someone else eating it. However, the role of other forms of food-related social information remains largely unknown. Food processing actions (e.g., chopping, mashing) are essential components of human food behaviors and a ubiquitous part of infants’ everyday lives. Here we examined whether infants (i) differentially attend to eating and food processing actions compared to control actions and (ii) learn that novel foods are edible after observing eating and food processing actions performed with them. To do this, we tested 12-month-olds’ responses to three different actions: eating, food processing, and a food-irrelevant control. First, we showed infants side-by-side videos of an adult performing two different actions with novel foods across three between-subjects conditions and measured their gaze and pupil dilation with an eye-tracker. Then, we offered infants the novel foods shown in the videos and measured their choices and eating behaviors. Our eye-tracking results indicate that infants differentially attend to eating and food processing actions relative to the control action, and show increased pupil dilation for the control action relative to the two food-relevant actions. When asked to choose which novel food they could eat, infants chose the novel food they saw an actor eat, but only when that eating action was paired with the control action. These findings help identify important mechanisms that increase acceptance of healthy foods early in life.",

Associations between SPS, triggers, and fluctuations of overstimulation in everyday life were examined using an experience sampling method study in 139 healthy adults. Results showed that overstimulation peaked in the early evening and in the presence of others. A cross-over effect depending on SPS levels was found. More sensitive individuals reported higher levels of overstimulation when auditory and visual stimuli were rated as unpleasant, when fatigued, or in a negative mood. Yet, more sensitive individuals reported lower levels of overstimulation with momentary pleasant auditory and visual stimuli, when not fatigued, and in a positive mood at the current moment. Everyone, but especially individuals high in SPS, might benefit from interventions preventing high levels of fatigue, increasing positive mood and the pleasantness of sensory stimuli in their daily life to reduce feelings of overstimulation.",

The present study investigates whether social attunement (SA) plays a role in higher alcohol use in adolescence as well as a lower alcohol use when aging. \nMethods: This online study included 683 alcohol users (16 – 81yrs). Participants completed a SA Questionnaire, an Implicit SA task (ISAT), and measures of alcohol use. The ISAT measured SA as the change in willingness to drink in response to peer feedback between two blocks of images representing social alcohol, social non-alcohol, and social non-drinking settings. Linear regressions were conducted to assess the association between SA and alcohol use, and the role of age and gender in these associations. \nResults: Interactions between age and SA predicted alcohol use, specifically in social situations involving non-alcoholic or no drinks. In social non-alcohol drinking settings, SA was positively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became negative in older individuals. Contrastingly, in the social non-drinking condition, SA was negatively associated with alcohol use among younger participants, but this association became positive in older individuals.\nDiscussion: Depending on age and social setting, SA can be both a risk- or protective factor for alcohol use.",

Here, we plan to systematically examine the diversity and representativeness of big team science by comparing big team science to (1) traditional psychological studies and (2) its target population (the world population or a specific population). Specifically, we will compare these two reference datasets to the demographics of participants and authors affiliations from big team science. In addition, we will examine how socioeconomic/cultural factors might contribute to the presence of researchers and participants in big team science and traditional psychological studies in a country/region.",

However, only a small fraction of online content is misinformation, and despite the abundance of accurate information, people are often overskeptical or uninterested, leaving them uninformed rather than misinformed. We therefore examine what content drives engagement with reliable information, using tweets from 140 trusted news accounts on X (formerly Twitter). We find that negative, group-oriented, and dominance-oriented content are consistently the best predictors of engagement, positive content specifically predicts likes, and the effect of threat-related content varies depending on engagement type (e.g., likes vs. replies). We also examine the content of replies and quotes and find it usually mirrors and amplifies the sentiment of the original tweets (e.g., positive/negative/polarizing tweets generate more positive/negative/polarizing responses). These results suggest that, like misinformation, factual news exploits evolved cognitive biases, which highlights the importance of considering cultural evolution to understand how online information spreads.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "Across three preregistered experiments (total N = 1,135), we tested whether an inductive learning (IL) intervention improved participants’ news veracity discernment (i.e., ability to distinguish between true and false news). IL involves learning categories by observing or classifying exemplars. Therefore, in this research, IL involved observing true and false news headlines and classifying them as either “true” or “false”, with immediate feedback on accuracy. In Experiment 1 (N = 214), the IL intervention significantly improved participants’ news veracity discernment compared to control, but the Bayesian evidence was only anecdotal. In Experiment 2 (N = 483), we incorporated game-design elements into the IL intervention, including performance-contingent badges. Unexpectedly, the effect of the IL intervention decreased. We reasoned that, because the IL intervention involved easy-to-hard training, the provision of performance-contingent badges inadvertently made participants more aware of their declining performance. This awareness may have undermined their motivation to learn as the training progressed. Therefore, in Experiment 3 (N = 438), we implemented hard-to-easy training instead, and the IL intervention significantly improving participants’ news veracity discernment, now with strong Bayesian evidence.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Non-suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is a highly prevalent transdiagnostic behavior among treatment-seeking individuals. The use of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) shows clinical potential for engaging patients outside the therapy room, but the utility for individuals who self-injure remains unclear. This prospective study evaluates self-reported benefits (e.g., increased self-insight and self-efficacy) and challenges (e.g., beep disturbances and emotional discomfort) associated with using EMA among individuals reporting past-month NSSI at treatment intake.\nMethods:  In this cohort study, 124 treatment-seeking adolescents and adults who self-injure completed baseline assessments and participated in a 28-day EMA protocol with six daily self-monitoring assessments of emotions, cognitions, and behaviors (including self-injury). After one month, participants received an EMA feedback survey assessing general and NSSI-specific increases in self-insight, self-efficacy, EMA compliance, beep disturbances, and emotional discomfort.\nResults: Of 124 participants, 98 completed the EMA survey (Response Rate = 79.03%). Average EMA compliance was 74.87% (SD = 18.78) and decreased linearly across time. Four in five patients (78.57%) reported experiencing at least one benefit. After using EMA, 32.65% reported increased general self-insight, 64.58% reported increased NSSI-specific self-insight, 9.28% reported increased general self-efficacy, and 41.67% reported improved NSSI-specific self-efficacy. Across the sample, 7.29% experienced EMA in treatment as tiring, stressful, at times overwhelming, and not enjoyable. Higher levels of emotional discomfort were significantly associated with lower compliance (r=-0.29, p=.004), higher beep disturbance (r=.37, p &lt; .001), and lower general self-insight (r=-0.28, p=.006).\nConclusion: Although the use of EMA in treatment may evoke emotional discomfort in patients, it may help promote NSSI-specific self-insight and self-efficacy outside the therapy room in patients who self-injure.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral sciences now routinely rely on digital data, supported by digital technologies and platforms. This has resulted in an abundance of new ethical challenges for researchers and ethical review boards. Several contemporary high-profile cases emphasize that ethical issues often surface after the research is published, once harm has already occurred. Consequently, implementing safeguards in digital behavioral research is often reactionary and fails to adequately prevent harm. In response, we propose the DECIDE framework which encourages ethical reflections and discussions throughout all stages of the research process. The framework presents several questions designed to help researchers view their work from new perspectives and uncover ethical issues they might not have anticipated. We provide several resources to support researchers with their ethical reflections and discussions, including (i) The DECIDE Framework Spreadsheet, (ii) The DECIDE Desktop App, (iii) Information Documents, and (iv) Flowcharts. This article provides suggestions on how to use each resource to encourage proactive discussions of how ethical issues may apply to specific research contexts. By promoting continous ethical considerations, safeguards can be put in place throughout the research project, even after research commencement. The DECIDE framework shifts ethical reflection away from being reactive towards a more proactive endeavor, reducing the risk of harm, and the misuse of digital behavioral data.",

Groß, Kreis, Blank, and Pachur (2023) found that\nhindsight bias emerged not only when people learned actual values for previously\njudged objects, but also when they learned the values of other objects in the same\ndomain. Moreover, hindsight bias co-occurred with improved estimates for new objects.\nThese findings challenge the traditional view that hindsight bias reflects a cognitive\nerror and instead suggest that it results from adaptive knowledge updating.

          "abstract": "This report presents findings from a 20-day self-experimentation study investigating the brightness of ganzflicker-induced visual hallucinations during meditation.

          "abstract": "This paper argues that the traditional free will debate is intractable because it mischaracterizes its subject. We reconceptualize free will not as a persistent entity or metaphysical power, but as a rare, computationally intensive, and emergent processing state. We introduce the Recursive Model of Structural Free Will (RMSFW), a cognitive architecture wherein a three-tier language system operates within consciousness to process and reconfigure non-linguistic, motivational inputs. Our central thesis is that free will is enacted when the third tier of language—the recursive reconstruction layer—is directed inward to rewrite the very structure of an agent's reactive pathways. While this capacity is necessary for agency, it is not sufficient; free will is the contingent event of this structural reorganization itself. The RMSFW provides a robust explanation for the findings of the Libet experiment, clarifies the nature of akrasia, and offers a new set of criteria for assessing consciousness in AI.",

Desde un enfoque aplicado al apego, este fenómeno opera como un refuerzo intermitente que activa sistemas dopaminérgicos, oxitocínicos y cortisolémicos, generando patrones de dependencia emocional similares a los observados en dinámicas de consumo adictivo. Estos vínculos se sostienen como espejos de narrativas internas inconclusas, permitiendo a las estructuras receptoras proyectar, reconfigurar o perpetuar sus modelos vinculares. Comprender la escalada de compromiso en “casi algo” no solo facilita la intervención clínica para evitar cronificar el desgaste emocional, sino que ofrece un mapa simbólico útil para resignificar el valor atribuido a la inversión afectiva, promoviendo decisiones conscientes y liberadoras.",

          "abstract": "Across three preregistered experiments (total N = 1,135), we tested whether an inductive learning (IL) intervention improved participants’ ability to distinguish between true and false news. IL involves learning categories by observing or classifying exemplars. Therefore, in this research, IL involved observing true and false news headlines and classifying them as either “true” or “false”, with immediate feedback on accuracy. In each experiment, participants took part in either an IL or control condition, the latter of which involved no training or playing Pac-Man. To test participants’ ability to distinguish between true and false news headlines, a final test was administered where all participants rated the veracity of true and false news headlines, which were different from those used during IL, on a scale from 1 (high confidence false) to 6 (high confidence true). In Experiment 1 (N = 214), the IL intervention significantly improved participants’ news veracity discernment compared to control, but the Bayesian evidence was only anecdotal. In Experiment 2 (N = 483), we incorporated game-design elements into the IL intervention, including performance-contingent badges. Unexpectedly, the effect of the IL intervention decreased. We reasoned that, because the IL intervention involved easy-to-hard training, the provision of performance-contingent badges inadvertently made participants more aware of their declining performance. This awareness may have undermined their motivation to learn as the training progressed. Therefore, in Experiment 3 (N = 438), we implemented hard-to-easy training instead, and the IL intervention significantly improved participants’ news veracity discernment, now with strong Bayesian evidence.",

To do so, we conducted interviews with 10 Syrian university student refugees in Erzurum, Türkiye, first identifying common themes on the challenges participants experienced and then the ways they contended with these challenges. We used reflexive thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke’s (2021) instructions. \nOverall, the challenges participants described were similar to challenges described in earlier work. Common themes included challenges of migration, language barriers, xenophobia, effects of policies and legal systems and concealing Syrian identity. Regarding the ways they are coping with the adversities they face underlines the contribution of this work. These themes included adapting to new environment as an agentic coping strategy, gaining strength through the challenges, and resistance to difficulties as an active agent. \nOverall, results highlight the agency individuals show in contending with the challenges they are exposed to.",

          "abstract": "Although many studies have demonstrated a significant relationship between college students’ hope and academic performance, none has tested the potential reciprocal association between these two variables. Research on mediators that explain the longitudinal relationship between hope and academic performance is also scarce. Hence, this longitudinal study was conducted to examine how hope and academic performance predicted one another over time in college students, and whether academic goal setting, self-regulated learning strategies, and academic emotions mediated this association. A sample of college students in Hong Kong (N = 433, Medianage = 18 years old, 63.7% female) was recruited. Results from path analyses showed that academic hope in semester 1 significantly and positively predicted academic performance in semester 3 via academic goal setting in semester 2. Furthermore, academic performance in semester 1 significantly and positively predicted academic hope in semester 3 through academic goal setting in semester 2. The findings revealed a reciprocal process between college students’ hope and academic performance and the significant mediating role of academic goal setting in this process. In terms of practical implications, tertiary institutes and educators can improve students’ academic performance by enhancing their academic hope through helping them set higher and achievable goals and providing positive feedback.",

Currently, hypothesis testing of correlation coefficients, such as whether a correlation equals zero or whether two correlations are equal, is mainly done using classical p values, despite their known limitations. An important cause of this problem is the limited availability of statistical software that supports alternative, Bayesian testing procedures. To address this shortcoming, the current tutorial paper showcases how to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests on correlation coefficients using the new BFpack module in the free and open-source software program JASP. The module supports Bayesian tests of various types of correlations such as product-moment correlations, polyserial correlations, or tetrachoric correlations, among others. Moreover, both dependent and independent correlations can be tested to be zero or tested against each other. This tutorial aims to get researchers acquainted with this new flexible testing paradigm which avoids the limitations of classical methods, and to make the methodology widely available to the re- search community.",

          "authors": "Mehrdad Bahadori",
          "abstract": "Scholars have long debated why and how music emerged. One promising answer is that music can function as a powerful form of physiological communication, enabling individuals to encode and convey emotional and bodily states through rhythmic and tonal structures. Building on insights that highlight music’s capacity to unify social groups, mark cultural identities, and elicit embodied participation, this paper proposes “intrinsic entrainment” as a novel concept: the coupling of one’s motor outputs to one’s own autonomic rhythms (e.g., heart rate), modulated by affect. Intrinsic entrainment makes a performer’s autonomic state audible; listeners can then simulate the action, and, via mirror-neuron supported sensorimotor coupling, adjust their own physiology accordingly. This view situates the physiological aspects of musical sound, especially the entrainment of rhythmic impulses to internal parameters, at the core of music’s emotion-conveying power. Ultimately, the notion of music as a tool for physiological communication aligns with multiple evolutionary and ethnomusicological perspectives that underscore music’s adaptability for social bonding, credible signaling, ritual efficacy, and everyday emotional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, challenging historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework, like language. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate, process, and evaluate symbolic sequences according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to implement a form of universal computation, operating as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Background: Several eHealth treatments, including the Building Emotional Awareness and Mental health (BEAM) program, are feasible and effective for mothers experiencing mental health concerns. However, little research examines these programs among mothers with mental health concerns and at-risk substance use (ARSU; ARSU+). Prior BEAM trials have identified high rates of alcohol and cannabis use among participants, despite not recruiting based on substance use. To date no studies have evaluated whether implementation and symptom change outcomes differ between mothers with ARSU+ and those without (ARSU-) when participating in BEAM (i.e., a mental health program that does not directly address substance use). This represents an important gap, as integrated treatments are often difficult to access, especially for postpartum mothers.\n\nObjectives: To address this gap, BEAM implementation (e.g., retention, perceived usefulness) and symptom outcomes (e.g., depression, anxiety) were compared between ARSU subgroups.\nDesign: This was a secondary data analysis of two BEAM trials for mothers of infants (6-18 months) and toddlers (18-36 months).\n\nMethods: A total of 110 mothers (M age = 20.72) participated in BEAM. Implementation metrics were compared against a-priori benchmarks. Mental health symptom trajectories were examined across time using two-level mixed models.\n\nResults: Treatment adherence, safety, and questionnaire completion time benchmarks were met in both groups, while retention, perceived usefulness, and overall questionnaire completion benchmarks were not. Changes in mental health and parenting stress symptoms did not differ between ARSU subgroups.\n\nConclusion: BEAM demonstrated similar feasibility and symptom change across ARSU subgroups. This study adds to literature examining single-focus eHealth treatments for mothers with ARSU+ and highlights refinements to enhance implementation metrics in future BEAM iterations.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation and metacognition are two key self-regulatory capacities that contribute significantly to psychological functioning. Emotion regulation involves the strategies individuals use to influence their emotional experiences, whereas metacognition refers to the capacity to reflect on and monitor one’s own mental processes. Both constructs have been the focus of extensive research and are associated with important cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Although theoretical models propose that self-monitoring is a fundamental component of emotion regulation, the empirical link between emotion regulation strategies and metacognitive ability remains poorly understood. This preregistered study (N = 200) investigated the association between self-reported emotion regulation strategies, specifically reappraisal and suppression, and metacognitive ability, which we assessed using a visual discrimination task paired with confidence ratings. We also included self-reported emotional intelligence and rumination as control variables. Our findings indicate that better metacognitive ability is associated with lower use of suppression, but shows no relationship with reappraisal. These results suggest that metacognitive processes may play a meaningful role in shaping how individuals regulate their emotions.",

          "abstract": "Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) was originally developed as a rights-based alternative to coercive and punitive practices in disability services, with the aim of enhancing quality of life through meaningful skill development and greater autonomy. In the Australian context, however, PBS has become increasingly entangled with the regulation of restrictive practices, fundamentally altering its purpose and function. Behaviour support plans are now frequently used to authorise restrictive interventions, effectively transforming PBS into a regulatory mechanism that sustains the very practices it was intended to replace.\nThis paper argues that the prevailing model of PBS in Australia has become pathological, compliance-driven, and misaligned with its foundational values. We propose a shift toward a constructional approach to PBS, drawing on the work of Israel Goldiamond, which centres on building meaningful lives and expanding genuine choice in partnership with the person whose behaviour is the focus of support.\nThe paper concludes by outlining reforms grounded in constructional principles and offering an alternative framework to guide both individual practice and broader systemic change.",

          "abstract": "Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",

          "abstract": "One of Festinger’s core assumptions in cognitive dissonance theory was that dissonance reduction is an effortful process whose intensity varies with the magnitude of dissonance. That is, the greater the dissonance, the stronger the motivation to reduce it, and consequently, the greater the invested effort (Festinger, 1957). For many years, this assertion was accepted without direct empirical testing. Moreover, Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989) provides well-established empirical evidence about the factors that determine motivated effort investment and explains why it is inaccurate to perceive dissonance reduction as always, an effortful process. Motivated effort is influenced by various factors, not just motivation, such as the difficulty of the task and the individual’s level of ability (which was incorporated into the original theory by Rex Wright, 1996). I argue that these principles should be applied to other mental activities, like cognitive dissonance reduction. The primary objective of this article is to propose a fusion of Cognitive Dissonance Theory, proposed by Leon Festinger, with Motivational Intensity Theory, proposed by Jack Brehm. I believe this integration significantly contributes to psychological knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments.

          "abstract": "Rules are essential for the successful coordination of large-scale societies, with official, codified rules (e.g., laws) proscribing behaviors for everyone in their jurisdiction. These rules ostensibly provide a clear signal about what is permitted or prohibited, making it straightforward to identify when they have been broken. However, signals from descriptive norms, moral prohibition, and (lack of) legitimacy of enforcement can sometimes provide conflicting accounts of what behaviors really violate rules, possibly shaping whether someone thinks a rule has been broken at all. Across three experiments (N = 2,264), we examined how each of these signals affect rule violation judgments. In Study 1, we used a variety of real rules in the US and found that all four signals—descriptive norms, codification, moral wrongness, and legitimacy of punishment—are associated with judgments of whether a rule was broken, but to varying degrees.

          "authors": "Manuel J. B. Oliveira; Carlos Zednik; Gunter Bombaerts; Bert Sadowski; Rianne Conijn",
          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

          "abstract": "Items stored in visual working memory often differ in priority. Typically, observers will shift their\ninternal attention towards items that are relevant for impending behavior and away from those that\nmay become relevant later. These distinct states of priority are theorized to influence bidirectional\ninteractions between memoranda and new visual inputs by modulating their susceptibility to\nretroactive and proactive report biases, respectively. However, prior research has produced limited\nand conflicting evidence on this topic due to reliance on inconsistent retrodictive cues (retro-cues)\nthat incentivize memory prioritization. To address this, we used a double-serial retro-cue paradigm\nthat incentivized the complete prioritization of one of two unfamiliar shape memoranda for use in\na comparison with a perceptual probe before a second, independent cue instructed observers to\nreport one of their two memories (Experiments 1-2) or the perceptual probe itself (Experiment 2).\nWe found that observers reported robust retroactive and proactive biases, but that only retroactive\nbiases were modulated by prioritization. Reports of prioritized memories were more precise and\ncontained smaller attractive biases towards the probe than unprioritized memories, whereas probe\nreports were biased comparably towards each. These findings reveal an asymmetrical effect of\nprioritization on the reciprocal interactions between new and existing visual representations.",

Here, we investigate the sources of variance in color preference, leveraging a novel generative AI framework to visualize individualized color preference models. We first developed a generative AI model of color space capable of creating any color. We then assessed the sources of variance in people’s color preferences using images generated by this model, revealing a substantial degree of individual variability. This variability was replicated in an analysis of color preferences collected by other authors (Schloss et al., 2015). Finally, we employed a novel reverse correlation methodology using our generative AI model to construct individual color preferences and show that participants were most sensitive to images generated from their idiosyncratic model. These findings reveal that color preferences are largely driven by the individual evaluating specific colors, rather than any shared properties of the stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Human-annotated datasets are central to the development and evaluation of sentiment analysis and other text classification systems. However, many existing datasets suffer from low annotator agreement and errors, raising concerns about the quality of the data that computational systems should learn from or align with. Improving annotation quality demands close examination of how datasets are created and how annotators interpret and approach the task. To this end, we create AmbiSent, a new sentiment dataset designed to capture cases of interpretive complexity that commonly challenge both annotators and computational models. Using a mixed-methods approach, we investigate how annotation instructions influence label consistency and annotator experience. Two groups of crowdworkers annotated the dataset under either minimal or detailed instructions, allowing comparison of inter- and intra-annotator agreement and annotation rationales. Our findings reveal that detailed instructions alone do not ensure more consistent annotations – either across or within individuals. Their effectiveness appears contingent on participants’ level of task engagement and the extent to which the instructions align with intuitive annotation strategies. Despite the presence of detailed guidance, participants often defaulted to simplifying the task. However, we also observed sentence types where detailed instructions may improve annotation quality, (e.g., sentences with perspective-dependent sentiment, rhetorical questions, and sentences containing sarcasm). A thematic analysis of open-ended responses further contextualised these findings, offering insights into the annotators’ cognitive effort involved and the practical challenges faced. Together, these results inform recommendations for enhancing task engagement and instruction adherence, offering practical insights for future dataset development. Finally, to support diverse use cases, we release three versions of the AmbiSent dataset, each accompanied by detailed annotator information and label distributions to better accommodate different user needs.",

We synthesised current systematic review evidence on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis.\n\nWe conducted an umbrella review, systematically searching Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest Central and Google Scholar (up to 19 July 2024) for systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in peer-reviewed journals exploring the effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on psychosis. 2898 citations were de-duplicated and screened, included reviews were assessed for risk of bias using AMSTAR-2 and extracted data analysed narratively following a pre-registered protocol (CRD42023400656).\n\nSeven reviews (reporting 23 primary studies representing 40,300 participants) met inclusion criteria, five of which explicitly reported on the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and psychosis. All observed evidence of a positive relationship between the two, including meta-analyses for psychotic symptoms (adjusted OR=1.77, 95%CI 1.26, 2.49) and psychotic experiences (pooled OR=1.94, 95%CI 1.42, 2.67). We observed more robust evidence for psychotic outcomes in non-clinical populations. Despite this, results were driven by cross-sectional studies (87%), and were hindered by high heterogeneity and low (n=2) or critically low (n=5) AMSTAR-2 review quality scores. \n\nThe available systematic review evidence supports a role for racial/ethnic discrimination in developing psychosis, but high-quality studies are needed to determine the temporal and mechanistic causal pathways through which this occurs. The current findings add to knowledge on the widespread presence and deleterious impacts of racism on health and inform potential public health interventions that reduce exposure to, and the impact of, racial/ethnic discrimination.",

          "authors": "Sepideh Khoneiveh; Giorgio Manenti; Jan Gläscher",
          "abstract": "Successful coordination in dynamic environments often requires individuals to integrate their own preferences with predictions about others' behavior. In this study, we tested 148 participants in a Social Foraging Task, where pairs selected between resource patches to maximize shared outcomes. Behavioral clustering revealed four distinct coordination profiles: Economic, Sticky, Avoiding, and Mixed. Each group showed characteristic decision patterns and levels of coordination success. To uncover the cognitive strategies behind these profiles, we applied hierarchical Bayesian inference using twelve computational models. These models systematically varied in how participants evaluated options for themselves and how they estimated their partner's behavior, incorporating features such as sensitivity to visible resources, patch preferences, tendency to repeat their own choices, outcome-oriented updating, and leader-follower dynamics. Different clusters were best explained by different combinations of these features. Participants in the Economic and Mixed clusters were best captured by models that combined sensitivity to patch values and stickiness in their own choices, while also assuming their partner used similar decision processes. Sticky participants also used island resources and repetition themselves, but assumed their partner followed a simpler, repeat strategy. Participants in the Avoiding cluster relied mostly on repetition themselves but modeled the partner as someone using complex information, including resource values and outcomes. This suggests that even when participants limited their own engagement with certain patches, they still attended closely to their partner's behavior. Coordination success was linked to similarity in internal value functions between partners. This was especially true in the Economic cluster, where alignment of value representations supported consistent coordination. In contrast, participants in the Mixed cluster showed more variability in strategy and poorer alignment. Together, these findings reveal that people coordinate using diverse mechanisms, ranging from shared valuation strategies to asymmetric social tracking, depending on their behavioral tendencies and mental models of others.\nKeywords: Social Coordination, Foraging, Social Inference, Mentalizing, Social Decision-Making, Cooperation, Competition.",

          "abstract": "Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) comparison tasks are widely used to investigate how humans process complex information. However, it remains not fully understood how the format of these tasks influences cognitive strategies. In this study, we examined this question within the number domain. We analyzed whether different 2AFC task formats provide converging information on how people process multi-component numbers (i.e., numbers composed of more than one part). In particular, we investigated how the distance and congruency effects—which are interpreted as behavioral markers of holistic and fragmented number processing—vary across simultaneous and sequential versions of two-digit integers, fractions, and decimals 2AFC tasks. Methods: Undergraduate students (n=162) completed both simultaneous and sequential versions of two-digit integer, fraction, and decimal comparison tasks. Comparison pairs varied in numerical distance (near vs. far) and congruency (congruent vs. incongruent). Results: Across all number types, we observed both distance and congruency effects. However, these effects differed by task format. In particular, a linear-mixed model revealed that the congruency effect was stronger in simultaneous tasks with near-distance pairs and weaker in sequential tasks with far-distance pairs. Discussion: The presence of both distance and congruency effects suggests that individuals combine holistic and fragmented processing strategies when comparing multi-component numbers. Furthermore, differences in the strength of the congruency effect across task formats indicate they play a critical role in shaping number processing strategies. Thus, our findings corroborate that simultaneous and sequential 2AFC tasks might engage distinct cognitive processes and should not be used interchangeably in numerical cognition research.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past episodes usually takes less time than their actual duration. Recent work measuring the time required to mentally replay videos suggests that such temporal compression emerges when continuous events become too long to be fully held in working memory. However, in this previous research, the time needed to initiate the mental replay (i.e., to mentally visualize the starting point of events) was not taken into account. In the current study, we developed a corrected measure of remembering duration that controls for this initiation time to better characterize working memory capacity in representing continuous event. Using this corrected measure, we assessed the time needed by participants to mentally replay videos depicting continuous events (e.g., turning a car jack) lasting 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 s. The results showed  that events longer that 3-s were remembered in less time than their actual duration, suggesting  that working memory is limited in its capacity to represent continuous events, leading to the emergence of temporal compression when they exceed 3 s. Exploratory analyses further revealed that faster mental replay tended to be judged less dynamic but not less clear, suggesting that the temporal compression of continuous events likely results from an incomplete remembering of event’s unfolding rather than a complete but imprecise mental replay.",

          "abstract": "This report presents findings from a 20-day self-experimentation study investigating the brightness of ganzflicker-induced visual hallucinations during meditation. While methodologically limited and anecdotal, the study revealed an unexpected and replicable phenomenon: following brief eye closure during exposure to alpha-frequency stroboscopic light, a delayed brightening of perceived hallucinations reliably occurred upon reopening the eyes. This effect is consistent with known alpha rhythm dynamics and supports a model of meditation-induced luminosity by alpha-mediated disinhibition proposed in prior meditation research. Though artificially induced, the bright light experience often evolved into a mild mystical-type state, associated with mood enhancement and cognitive stillness. The observed effects were reproducible in other individuals and occurred independently of beliefs about the origin or nature of the subjectively perceived light, suggesting possible clinical applications. This simple ganzflicker method could serve as a low-cost, accessible adjunct to psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy or as a stand-alone tool for promoting emotional well-being and creativity.",

(2012)’s radical alternative to categorical face lineups also improves classification accuracy for earwitnesses. Brewer et al. (2012)’s procedure requires witnesses to rate, under deadline pressure, how confident they are that each lineup member matches their memory for the perpetrator. Participants (N=803) attempted to identify a ‘perpetrator’ from a categorical voice lineup, a confidence-based voice lineup with deadlines, or a confidence-based voice lineup without deadlines. Taking the results of the accuracy and signal detection analyses together, we do not conclude that confidence-based lineups optimise voice identification accuracy. Neither the deadline nor the no-deadline confidence-based procedures appear to be a promising alternative to categorical voice lineups. These results further highlight the need to test procedures for faces and voices separately, rather than assuming that patterns of performance observed for faces will also be observed for voices.",

          "authors": "Mehrdad Bahadori",
          "abstract": "Scholars have long debated why and how music emerged. One promising answer is that music can function as a powerful form of physiological communication, enabling individuals to encode and convey emotional and bodily states through rhythmic and tonal structures. Building on insights that highlight music’s capacity to unify social groups, mark cultural identities, and elicit embodied participation, this paper proposes “intrinsic entrainment” as a novel concept: the coupling of one’s motor outputs to one’s own autonomic rhythms (e.g., heart rate), modulated by affect. Intrinsic entrainment makes a performer’s autonomic state audible; listeners can then simulate the action, and, via mirror-neuron supported sensorimotor coupling, adjust their own physiology accordingly. This view situates the physiological aspects of musical sound, especially the entrainment of rhythmic impulses to internal parameters, at the core of music’s emotion-conveying power. Ultimately, the notion of music as a tool for physiological communication aligns with multiple evolutionary and ethnomusicological perspectives that underscore music’s adaptability for social bonding, credible signaling, ritual efficacy, and everyday emotional regulation.",

They embody the understanding of the education experts who designed them of how to organize the knowledge that students should acquire in a way that is optimal for learning. This can be viewed as a learning 'theory' which is, nevertheless, rarely put to the test. Here, we model a data set obtained from a Computer-Based Formative Assessment system used by thousands of students. The student-item response matrix is highly sparse and admits a natural representation as a bipartite graph, in which nodes stand for students or items and an edge between a student and an item represents a response of the student to that item. To predict unobserved edge labels (correct/incorrect responses) we resort to a graph neural network (GNN), a machine learning method for graph-structured data. Nodes and edges are represented as multidimensional embeddings. After fitting the model, the learned item embeddings reflect properties of the curriculum, such as item difficulty and the structure of school subject domains and competences. Simulations show that the GNN is particularly advantageous over a classical model when group patterns are present in the connections between students and items, such that students from a particular group have a higher probability of successfully answering items from a specific set. In sum, important aspects of the structure of the school curriculum are reflected in response patterns from educational assessments and can be partially retrieved by our graph-based neural model.",

Observers reported a wide variety of effects, ranging from glowing, deforming, wiggling, rotating, flowing, to changes in depth, or material. These results show how varying lighting color can modulate not only color appearance and contrast per se, but can also induce more general changes of object appearance in still images.",

          "abstract": "When asked to remember list of items for later testing, we often repeat earlier items to ourselves as later items are presented. This process, called \"rehearsal,\" develops gradually during childhood. The present study examined the role of rehearsal in recalling lists of semantically related words and used the dual-retrieval model to pinpoint the retrieval processes modified by rehearsal in 8-10-year-olds and young adults. Thirty-one children (Mage = 8.8 years, SD = 0.5, 12 females and 19 males) and 31 adults (Mage = 20.5 years, SD = 2.7, 23 females and 6 males) performed a complex span task consisting of maintaining words to be recalled later in immediate and delayed tests, while performing a concurrent task. Participants performed the task either silently, which allowed them to use rehearsal, or under articulatory suppression, which reduced rehearsal opportunities. The results showed that although adults had a higher correct recall rate, children benefited from rehearsal opportunities for immediate and delayed correct recall. Semantic errors were also fewer in both age groups when rehearsal could be used. The dual-retrieval model revealed that rehearsal fosters direct access to verbatim memory of items and reconstruction of items based on gist memory. Finally, the difference in correct recall and direct access between the two age groups decreased when rehearsal could be used. These findings suggest that, although rehearsal is less efficient for 8-10-year-olds than for adults, children benefit more than adults do from rehearsal for correct recall and direct access to verbatim traces.",

Several investigations into the effect of hormonal manipulations on cognitive task performance exist, therefore, we undertook a systematic review to identify and assess the associations between hormones and cognitive performance. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycNET in January 2024 for controlled interventions of hormones involving D&amp;S participants. Each study featured at least one of six hormones (testosterone, oestrogen, cortisol, oxytocin, growth hormone, melatonin). Article screening was conducted independently and in duplicate according to preregistered inclusion/exclusion criteria. Assessing study and participant details, prioritisation grids helped to identify existing hormone-performance measures and highlight any gaps. Study quality appraisals and a narrative synthesis of findings concerning hormonal impacts on cognitive performance were also completed. Twenty articles from North American and Western European research groups met the inclusion criteria. Cortisol and testosterone were investigated the most, whereas oestrogen, oxytocin, growth hormone, and melatonin were less studied within D&amp;S populations. Studies involved a greater proportion of male personnel across land, air, and sea domains. Generally, hormonal concentrations deviating from “normal” levels appeared to predispose psychophysiological states that prompt poorer cognitive performance. However, most studies were appraised as low-moderate in quality as studies were suffused with methodological concerns including high participant attrition rates, a widespread lack of blinding, randomisation, or a-priori sample size calculations. Consequently, for researchers to deduce any meaningful understanding of hormone-performance relationships within D&amp;S contexts, future research must develop the existing evidence base.",

This study aimed to (a) confirm the existence of such differentiated achievement goals in secondary school students and (b) validate the corresponding Hexagonal Achievement Goal Scale for Students (HEX-S). We adapted an existing scale, conducted cognitive interviews with 20 students, and surveyed 1,131 secondary school students. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hexagonal goal structure, showing invariance between genders, age groups, and across six weeks. Correlations with a trichotomous goal orientation questionnaire indicated convergent and discriminant validity. School grades correlated weakly with mastery goals and the normative facet.

It is of interest to investigate if external factors influence these decisions. 1520 matches were reviewed across 2021/22 – 2024/25 seasons where the referee was advised to consult the pitch-side monitor 250 times, overturning their original decision 95% of the time. Binary Logistic Regression found that season, home advantage, scoreline, time of decision, experience of officials, and crowd attendance did not predict the referee’s decision and season, experience of officials, and crowd attendance did not predict VAR intervention. This may appear as though officials are consistent despite contextual factors, however, the models are unlikely to distinguish between variables due to the high prevalence of overturn decisions. This may indicate that referees are primed to change their original decision under the current protocol.

Conversely, it examines the lesser-studied hypothesis that\nexcessive emotional labeling may also impair adaptive regulation. This forms the basis for a spectrum\nmodel linking psychopathological states with semantic density, where both ends—semantic deficiency\nand excess—can contribute to emotional dysregulation. The analysis incorporates findings from\nneurophysiology, cultural-linguistic studies, and therapeutic interventions, suggesting that linguistic\nrelativity may partially explain clinical and cultural variation in emotional experience and expression.\nPhilosophical implications include reconceptualizing therapeutic metaphors from vertical (\"depth\") to\nhorizontal (\"semantic modulation\") orientations.

          "abstract": "Background: Remote working has revolutionized organizational cybersecurity paradigms with workers operating outside the physical security perimeter. While technology continues to evolve, the weakest link in cybersecurity systems continues to be the human factor. Personality differences among individuals can specifically predict cybersecurity compliance behavior in different workplaces; this area of convergence has not yet been explored from a theoretical perspective.\n\nObjective: The current paper introduces theory-based full-scale research investigating how the prediction of cybersecurity behavior compliance can be achieved through Big Five personality traits, specifically highlighting the search for differences between remote and in-house workers to determine environment-specific strengths and vulnerabilities.\n\nTheoretical Framework: We outline a comprehensive Person-Environment-Cybersecurity (PEC) model that synthesizes the theories of personality psychology and cybersecurity compliance theory. The model posits that personality will have differential relationships with cybersecurity behaviors with varying characteristics of the work environment, where conscientiousness assumes a more prominent role in remote work environments, neuroticism increases exposures in distributed work environments, and agreeableness enables compliance through social mechanisms that are more salient in traditional office environments.\n\nImplications: The present theoretical framework promises a basis for the creation of differentiated cybersecurity training strategies, security interventions based on personality, and evidence-based best practices for remote work security policies. The model has testable hypotheses, which can be pursued in future empirical research, and practical uses for organizations looking to maximize human factors in cybersecurity.\n\nConclusions: Examining cybersecurity compliance in personality-environment interactions is an important theoretical advance towards addressing security concerns in more distributed work settings. The conceptual model encourages a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all solutions to context-sensitive, customized security practice.\n\nKeywords: cybersecurity compliance, personality traits, remote work, Big Five, theoretical framework, human factors, organizational security",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distribution of the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptom occurrence. First, we derived probability distributions for the duration of depressive symptoms and the frequency of depressive symptoms. Using the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible depressive symptoms and how to cope with depression. Finally, we discussed the connection with the similarity curves and other results in the previously discussed papers.",

          "authors": "Holmes Finch",
          "abstract": "Latent profile analysis (LPA) is a popular statistical modeling technique designed to identify latent subgroups in the population based on a set of continuous indicator variables.  It is closely related to latent class analysis (LCA), which is the name given to a mixture model using categorical indicators.  In some cases, researchers using LPA may wish to include a covariate predicting latent subgroup membership.  Naively including the covariate in the LCA model (known as the 1-step approach) is problematic because the presence of the covariate is likely to alter the makeup of the latent classes.  In other words, class membership is then conditioned not only on the indicators but also the covariate itself.  The optimal approach for including such covariates for LCA models is the 3-step estimator, which accounts for the random error associated with the latent class model based on the indicators.  This model preserves the latent class structure associated only with the indicators while simultaneously including the covariate in the model.  The goal of the current study is to extend this earlier work on LCA by examining the performance of the 3-step estimator with LPA.  In addition, the study also investigated the impact of the indicator variables’ distribution on the performance of the 3-step estimator.  Results show that for normally distributed indicators with equal latent subgroup variances, the 3-step estimator performs well at estimating the covariate relationship for as few as 6 indicators and 200 individuals.  However, when the indicators were skewed and/or the subgroup variances differed, 12 indicators and samples in excess of 500 were necessary for the 3-step estimator to yield accurate covariate coefficient estimates.",

A non-randomized, open pilot trial was conducted from March to June 2024, involving youth aged 10-18 years from Poland and Ukraine. Participants completed an SSI after cultural adaptations and translation into Polish and Ukrainian. Measures assessed hopelessness, self-hate, agency, perceived control, and acceptability. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and effect size calculations to examine intervention effects. Among 176 Polish and 139 Ukrainian youth who began the intervention, completion rates were 80.7% and 62.6%, respectively. Polish participants exhibited significant improvements in hopelessness, self-hate, perceived control, and agency, while Ukrainian youth showed moderate improvements in perceived control but limited change in other mental health indicators. Acceptability ratings were high across all youth. Findings suggest SSIs hold potential as a scalable option for mental health care. However, the varied outcomes across the two groups highlight the need for further refinement, especially for displaced youth.",

Using a dual-task paradigm, we manipulated cognitive load (low vs. high) to induce varying levels of mental fatigue in young, middle-aged, and older adults. We assessed self-reported fatigue, sleepiness, and motivation pre- and post-task, while exploring task-related fluctuations in performance (accuracy and reaction times) and eye-metrics (pupil size, pupillary response speed, and long blinks). Younger adults reported higher subjective fatigue and had lower task performance than older adults. There was no significant interaction between age and cognitive load condition in performance.

          "abstract": "Social scientists have long sought to explain why social norms vary so dramatically across the globe, but creating predictive, falsifiable models has remained a major challenge. Here, we introduce and validate the Moral Flavors Model, a quantitative framework that accurately predicts a society's judgment of a specific behavior. Our model is built on two components: the intrinsic 'moral flavor' of a behavior (the type of concern it evokes, such as harm or impurity) and a society's 'moral taste' (its sensitivity to these different flavors). By combining global survey data with robust cross-validation, we show the model accounts for up to 78% of the variance in moral norms and 88% in everyday etiquette across dozens of countries. Remarkably, the same societal tastes predict judgments on both profound moral issues, like euthanasia, and mundane behaviors, like singing on a bus. The model can even predict a country's entire landscape of norms without any prior norm data from that society. By establishing a high-performance, quantitative benchmark for norm prediction, the Moral Flavors Model provides a powerful new tool for computational social science and a parsimonious theory of cultural variation.",

          "authors": "David Harris; Gavin Buckingham; Tom Arthur; Shinji Yamamoto",
          "abstract": "Humans control their body movements by exploiting gravity to minimize muscle effort while achieving task goals. While most of these findings come from studies in physical environments, some have also been replicated in virtual settings. However, research using virtual environments to explore gravity-related motor control mechanisms has yet to directly compare motor performance between virtual and physical environments. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine in detail the potential differences in upper-limb pointing movements between virtual and physical environments. To this end, participants performed pointing tasks in four directions (upward, downward, leftward, and rightward, from an allocentric perspective) in both upright and lying postures, under both virtual and physical conditions. Our results showed that relative duration to peak velocity—a well-established kinematic indicator of gravity utilisation—was consistently shorter for upward than for downward movements across both environments and both postures. However, no differences were observed between the two environments when posture and movement direction were held constant. Furthermore, no differences were observed between the environments in terms of whole velocity and acceleration profiles, or in common metrics used to characterise pointing behaviour, including movement duration, peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, and the relative durations to peak acceleration and peak deceleration. The similarity in relative duration to peak velocity between virtual and physical environments suggests that the effects of gravity on pointing movements can be reliably assessed in virtual environments as in physical ones. This supports the use of virtual environments as valid tools for studying motor behaviour.",

This paper examines how that potential unfolds by analyzing contested environmental CS cases through the lens of Psychological Distance to Science (PSYDISC). Drawing on three case studies, we identify which contextual aspects of CS shape citizen scientists’ experiences of social, spatial, temporal, or hypothetical distance to relevant science – and how these experiences sometimes relate to trust. While CS-specific research aspects often foster proximity and trust, concerns around power, marginalization, and injustice continue to create distance. Reflexive, context-sensitive engagement can support proximity and socially robust knowledge production.",

Throughout the task, we recorded checking frequency, ratings of the urge to check and distress, task performance, and corrugator supercilii activity. Key findings included: (1) higher, versus lower threat level increased checking behaviour (at one site but not the other) and improved task performance; (2) no feedback, compared to feedback, was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity and improved task performance. Overall, these findings provide insight into how factors such as threat level and performance feedback differently impact checking behaviour and its concomitants.",

          "authors": "Carla Czilczer; Pierre Sachse; Stephan Frederic Dahm",
          "abstract": "Mental chronometry tasks commonly presume that real-time action imagery indicates high action imagery ability (AIA). However, factors that systematically influence imagery durations undermine the validity of AIA scores based on deviations from real-time action imagery. Therefore, we introduce and validate a novel approach to measure AIA using mental chronometry. This approach relies on the relationship between a movement’s difficulty and its’ duration (stated in Fitts’ law), with AIA scores quantifying the degree to which this relationship is preserved in action imagery. In a Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task (CRFT), participants (N = 30) executed and imagined both tapping (with a stylus) and clicking (with a computer mouse) radially arranged targets. Single execution and imagery durations were isolated through simultaneous space bar presses. Targets varied in difficulty according to Fitts’ law, which held across all four conditions (for both tools, when executing and imagining the movements). The AIA scores derived from the proposed Fitts’ law approach outperformed those derived from earlier mental chronometry approaches, being the only score to provide consistency across tools. Using the stylus, larger absolute and relative deviations from real-time action imagery were consistently associated with higher subjective AIA, reinforcing validity concerns. Participants struggled to incorporate the computer mouse’s properties into the internal model of the movement, resulting in imagery with the computer mouse relying on internal models similar to the stylus (simpler tool). In addition to offering a promising standardized approach for the measurement of AIA, our study highlights the importance of tool familiarity in mental chronometry.",

          "authors": "Maleen Thiele; Gustaf Gredebäck; Daniel Haun",
          "abstract": "Decades of research have highlighted the important role of joint attention in early cultural learning. However, most previous studies focused on a limited range of joint attention settings involving the learner’s first-person participation in joint visual attention, characterized by eye contact and triadic gaze following. This has created an incomplete picture, tending to neglect the diversity in which infants experience social connectedness in their daily lives. To deepen our understanding of the multifaceted nature of joint attention, this study investigated infants’ object memory in previously unexplored joint attention contexts, including physical cues of togetherness within observed interactions. Nine- and 18-month-old German infants participated in an object encoding task featuring videos of two people looking at an object. The videos varied in the presence and combination of mutual eye contact and mutual touch in physical proximity. After each video, the familiarized object reappeared next to a novel object. Infants’ looking time preference for the novel object was used as a measure of their prior encoding of the familiarized object. Eighteen-month-olds demonstrated superior encoding in all conditions involving interpersonal connectedness, expressed through eye contact, proximal touch, or a combination of both. In contrast, 9-month-olds’ object encoding was only enhanced in the presence of eye contact, regardless of proximal touch. These findings demonstrate a developmental refinement from a primary reliance on visual cues to a more comprehensive understanding of third-party jointness incorporating a broader range of cues. Joint attention is a highly flexible social learning mechanism, capable of operating in diverse social environments.",

Extending the Conscious Quantum Field Hypothesis\n (CQFH) [1], QPFH proposes that disruptions in quantum processes, including\n microtubule coherence, biophoton signaling, and theta/gamma oscillations,\n influence transdiagnostic symptoms such as sensory, cognitive, and emotional\n impairments, and subconscious processing deficits [36, 64, 69]. High comorbidity\n rates, including OCD with anxiety (50–60%) [36, 89], depression with anxiety\n (40–50%) [36, 64], and autism with ADHD (10–20%) [51], reflect shared\n dysconnectivity, evidenced by symptoms like emotional dysregulation, sensory\n overload, and cognitive biases [36, 64, 89, 35, 98]. Emerging theoretical findings\n from tryptophan superradiance [6], biophoton dysregulation [7], EEG-cytokine\n interactions [81, 9], and blood-brain barrier dysfunction [10, 11] suggest potential\n quantum contributions to QPFH’s model.\n Eight proposed experiments (2026–2033) using EEG, THz spectroscopy, and\n biophoton analysis aim to test synchrony deficits [33, 32, 111]. Environmental\n stressors, neuroinflammation, genetic variants (e.g., CACNA1C, SCN2A), and\n epigenetic modifications modulate decoherence [10, 16, 30, 96]. Medications\n influence neurotransmitter pathways, with side effects potentially affecting\n microtubule dynamics, warranting further investigation [17, 18, 6, 41]. Targeted\n therapies, including transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) and\n quantum-inspired neurofeedback, enhance neural synchrony [82, 109, 93], while\n proposed interventions like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) for\n OCD and schizophrenia, and nanotherapeutics for schizophrenia and BPD offer\n additional avenues for exploration [19, 20, 76, 72]. Diagnostic markers, such as\n olfactory deficits, pituitary endorphin dysregulation, mirror neuron impairments,\n and gut-brain axis alterations, guide transdiagnostic approaches [36, 64, 81, 35, 2].\n Quantum coherence in glial cells and epigenetic modulation of quantum processes\n provide further research directions [61, 97].

We observed that self-representation stability: 1) was higher in older adults, 2) predicted well-being across participants, although there were age group differences, 3) was not significantly related to in-lab autobiographical memory, and 4) was higher in younger adults who had more autobiographical thoughts in daily life.

The results showed low trial-noise and strong between-subject variability (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio $\\approx 1.14$, reliability $\\approx 0.93$). Correlations across illusions are low, around $0.22 \\pm 0.07$. A Bayesian hierarchical analysis reveals minimal attenuation from measurement error in these values. Though correlations are low, latent variable analysis reveals a common latent factor that loads on all tasks and explains about 23.3\\% of the variance in illusion susceptibility.",

This paper introduces the Attention Grains (AGs) Model and its Nurture-Drain-Invest (NDI) metabolism as a novel framework to understand, quantify, and manage the brain's \"cognitive fuel\". Each AG constitutes the smallest functional unit of attentional effort, while the NDI metabolism explains how these units are replenished, depleted, and strategically allocated over time. We provide (i) interdisciplinary theoretical grounding, (ii) a formal AG balance equation, (iii) an experimental blueprint for behavioural and neurobiological validation, and (iv) an open research agenda.

          "abstract": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for Large Models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called “empowerment” which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. “Empowerment” may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines.  If an agent learns an accurate causal world model they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive empirical features of children’s causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, design effective causal interventions and appropriately generalize to new contexts.",

          "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique, primarily utilized to map the spatiotemporal distribution and patterns of underlying brain activity. Since its invention 30 years ago, fMRI has had remarkable academic and cultural influence. Touted for its excellent spatial resolution, fMRI has made an impact in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience. By providing a detailed map of active areas during tasks or rest, fMRI can aid researchers and clinicians in studying brain function in both healthy and diseased states, or to provide the required evidence to select target regions used in brain stimulation treatment. Substantial research funding has already been committed to years of data collection (&gt;&gt;$100,000 scanner costs for a sample of 200 subjects), and the recent emergence of accessible fMRI databanks is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\nFor this edited book, we start by precisely defining the reliable spatial information characteristic of the task-induced blood oxygenation level-dependent signal (BOLD) changes representative of cognitive modes, even providing doodles that can be used as a way to efficiently communicate the precise configuration of hundreds or thousands of voxels, an alternative to the cumbersome traditional coordinate-based labelling methodology. describe determine the presence of a specific anatomical pattern. However, the main thrust of each chapter is to determine the cognitive function leading to these BOLD configurations by statistically testing and interpreting how the task-induced BOLD changes take place in the trial and differ between task and task conditions. The cognitive modes approach reduces the risk of reverse inference errors by working towards a one-to one mapping between spatial patterns and cognitive function. For each mode, our goals were to: (1) demonstrate the replicability of the mode and its associated anatomical patterns, and (2) provide evidence for the cognitive functions underpinning the mode by way of inspection of the task-induced BOLD signal temporal changes over a range of fMRI tasks. The Supplementary Material contains further analysis of the cognitive modes anatomical patterns.",

Kinematics differ when we use our hands to hammer a nail vs. using them to describe hammering a nail. Here, we ask whether communicative movements all share the same kinematic profiles and thus differ from instrumental movements in the same way. We compared spontaneous gestures produced by hearing speakers when they talk (co-speech gesture) to productive iconic signs produced by deaf signers when the signs superficially resemble co-speech gestures (classifier signs). We used motion tracking and kinematic analyses to disentangle the spatial and temporal kinematic patterns of communicative movements in 33 English-speakers and 10 American Sign Language (ASL) signers, using each group’s instrumental movements as a control. Participants copied a movement on an object performed by a model (instrumental movement) and then described what they did with the object (communicative movement). We found no instrumental-communicative differences between groups in spatial kinematics. However, for temporal kinematics, speakers’ co-speech movements were less rhythmic and jerkier than their instrumental movements; in contrast, signers’ communicative movements were more rhythmic and smoother than their instrumental movements. We thus found differences in the temporal (but not spatial) kinematic signatures of co-speech gestures vs. classifier signs, leading to 3 conclusions: (i) communicative movements do not always have the same kinematic signatures; (ii) since signers’ and speakers’ communicative movements have different kinematic features, even highly iconic signed movements cannot be considered entirely gestural; and (iii) we need fine-grained techniques to measure movement components when identifying the gestural aspects of sign.",

Most work on number perception answers this question by focusing on properties of the to-be-estimated set of objects — their number, their size, their relative position, and so on. Here, in contrast, we show that perceived number is influenced by extraneous visual information. In six experiments, participants were shown “crowds” of dots that filled “seats” in a visual grid, asking whether perceived number is influenced not only by the number of occupied seats, but also the number of unoccupied seats. When only about 15-30% of the “seats” were filled, people perceived fewer dots (compared to displays without any grid). We further demonstrated that this illusion depends on the proportion of occupied seats. When most “seats” were filled, the illusion reversed: People perceived the grid displays as having more dots. This effect is continuous, switching directions at around the 50% occupancy mark. Moreover, this “crowd size illusion” is phenomenologically robust: It is evident in simple visual displays, even when the observer is aware they are being tricked. We discuss these findings in light of the recent hypothesis that the number system represents number in a part-whole format.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness, or perceived social isolation, motivates individuals to foster their relationships while remaining vigilant to potential social threats. Lonely individuals must interpret the social cues they receive from others and respond accordingly by engaging in affiliative behaviors while also identifying and managing threats. Prosocial acts – or voluntary actions meant to benefit others – are one type of behavior that can help lonely individuals reaffiliate. Loneliness has been linked to differences in prosocial behaviors. However, this relationship has mainly been investigated using self-report measures that ask respondents to imagine their own behavior in hypothetical scenarios. Here, we utilized a physical effort prosocial decision-making experimental task to investigate whether loneliness influences willingness to exert physical effort to benefit others. We also explore whether this relationship differs in contexts of potential gain compared to potential loss and is moderated by participants’ resting parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity as a physiological marker of variability in individuals’ ability to regulate competing social motivations. In a sample of 80 U.S. undergraduate students, we find lonelier individuals are more likely to choose to exert effort to benefit someone else both to earn rewards and to avoid punishments. Resting cardiac PNS activity did not moderate the association between loneliness and prosocial behavior. These findings indicate loneliness increases effortful prosocial behavior, which is in line with theoretical frameworks positing prosocial actions as a tool for lonely individuals to foster connection and reaffiliation with others. Implications for our understanding of loneliness as a driver of social behavior are discussed.",

In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology",

          "abstract": "Recently, body maps have increasingly been used to identify patterns in respect of the location of the physical sensations elicited by emotions. However, in addition to understanding how emotions are topographically manifest in the body, it is important to add a temporal aspect to deepen the interoceptive study of emotions. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the first perceived sensation. The study sample comprised a group of mindfulness practitioners (n=34) and a group of non-practitioners (n=64) to analyze if there was any difference in their perceptions of emotion. Participants were instructed to evoke five basic emotions (fear, disgust, anger, sadness, joy), and as soon as they became aware of where they felt the emotions start to emerge, were instructed to interrupt the observation and to indicate the region in a diagram of a human figure. Overall, the groups did not differ in the body regions identified for each emotion. Cochran's Q-test showed that the main regions mentioned were the head and the chest. In the case of disgust, the neck, rather than the chest, along with the lower part of the head were the most cited. The most cited regions corresponded to those identified in other studies of body topography as perceived with the greatest increase in activity in response to emotional stimuli. Regarding interoceptive awareness, the independent t-test verified that the mindfulness group scored significantly higher in all subscales of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the 37-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness questionnaire compared to the non-mindfulness group.",

We consider this question in the context of a general\nindependent-channels model that incorporates most existing models of order\nperception as special cases, and which has been implicitly assumed when\ntemporal-order judgments are used to study perceptual latency. In the model,\na \"decision function\" converts a difference in central \"arrival times\" of two\nsensory signals into an order judgment. The psychometric function for order is\nregarded as a distribution function, and can be represented additively in terms\nof the central arrival latencies and the decision function. Various distinct decision\nfunctions correspond to various previously proposed mechanisms involving a\n\"perceptual moment,\" attention switching, a threshold for arrival-time differences,\nand so forth (Section II).\nOne test of the model is to compare reaction-time measurements with order\njudgments (Section III). Discrepancies can be understood by an analysis of the\nconcept of perceptual latency that recognizes the internal response to a pulse\nas being spread out in time (Section IV).\nAn alternative test is to determine whether experimental factors that\ninfluence two signal channels selectively have additive effects on the mean,\nvariance, and higher cumulants of the psychometric function for order, as the\ngeneral model implies. Some data confirm the model when examined in this way,\nbut others do not. We consider extensions of the model from order judgments\nto other perceptual domains in which the relative arrival time of a pair of signals\nis thought to determine the percept. An additivity test applied to binaural\nlateralization favors extending the model to that phenomenon, and suggests a\nnew method for tracing information flow in sensory channels by analyzing timeintensity\ntrading relations at different \"levels.\" Such an analysis reveals\ndifferent effects of stimulus intensity on latency for different visual tasks, and\nleads to speculations about the locus of stereoscopic depth perception in\nrelation to other processes (Section V).\nThe influence of attentional bias on the point of subjective simultaneity\nmakes tests of the model difficult. However, the model suggests how to study\nthis \"prior-entry\" phenomenon and determine whether attention influences the\nsensory channels or the decision mechanism (Section VI).\nImplications of transitivity of perceived order are examined, particularly\nin relation to the idea of a single multisensory \"simultaneity center\" in the\nbrain; some experimental tests of transitivity are reviewed (Section VIII).\nThe problem of perceived order of three or more stimuli bears on several\nimportant questions, including transitivity. But existing experiments with\nmultiple stimuli shed little light on these issues (Section IX).\nSeveral aspects of experimental method are considered (Section X).",

          "abstract": "We introduce the Choice-Confidence (CHOCO) model as a tool to dissect the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making judgments, offering a better fit for data from subjective rating scales for which the two extremes correspond to discrete choices (e.g., \"positive\" vs. \"negative\", \"true\" vs. false\", \"real\" vs. \"AI-generated\"), and for which the distance from the center might reflect a gradual process, such as confidence or certainty in that choice. Conceptualized as a mixture of two Beta distributions, CHOCO simultaneously estimates the probability of selecting one category (the right side of the scale over the left side) and the confidence associated with each choice. To demonstrate its usage, we apply this model to two datasets (N=141 and N=189) in which participants judged whether face images were real photographs or AI-generated images, finding that facial attractiveness increased the likelihood of being judged as \"real\", particularly for male participants. Given that AI-generated content is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from real stimuli, understanding how individuals form beliefs about the reality of what they perceive is both theoretically important and practically urgent. We discuss how these findings relate to the broader effect of facial attractiveness, and suggest future directions for both the cognitive and psychometric application of the CHOCO framework.",

In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and clinical research on illbeing and wellbeing. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing.

Third, over time people generally improve by losing negative attributes and gaining positive attributes (growth). Three studies found that present-future similarities were positive. The present self’s unique attributes were most negative, and the future self’s unique attributes were in between. In Study 1, this pattern emerged for both self-comparisons and acquaintance-comparisons. In Study 2, it emerged for both prospective and retrospective (i.e., past-oriented) self-comparisons. In Study 3, the pattern vanished when middle-aged people compared their present self to their old age self. Taken together, these findings largely support a realistic view of one’s own future.

          "abstract": "People’s quantitative estimates, such as judgments about the height of a tower or the distance between two cities, can be influenced by external values, including random numbers in the environment or another person’s estimate. We reviewed three distinct but related phenomena in quantitative estimation: anchoring effects, advice taking, and hindsight bias. These effects are assimilative, meaning estimates are drawn toward the external value. They are also robust and they exhibit medium to large effect sizes. However, previous studies suggest that the reliability of their measurements differs considerably, ranging from low (anchoring) to high (advice taking). In this project, we compared the reliabilities of the three phenomena using open data (Study 1) and a new experiment employing a homogenized paradigm (Study 2). Homogenization involves controlling for differences in the informativeness of external values, computing assimilation scores, and using the same setting and knowledge domain. In Study 1, we found that anchoring effects were largely unreliable, advice taking was reliably measured, and hindsight bias showed moderate reliability, consistent with prior research. This overall pattern was [reproduced] in [the simulation of] Study 2. We conclude that although methodological factors contribute to variability, they alone cannot explain differences in reliability.",

          "authors": "Philippe Servajean; Richard Servajean",
          "abstract": "When we say that a theory is able to account for our subjective experience, we simply mean that if this theory were true—e.g., if our brain were as this theory stipulates—then our subjective experience would be indeed as we experience it. A scientist would formulate this idea using the notions of observation and prediction: A theory is able to account for our subjective experience if and only if it is able to predict first-person observations. Several thought experiments suggest that current theories are unable to make such predictions. For example, if we had never seen colors in our lives and therefore did not know what the color blue looks like, these theories would not allow us to deduce (i.e., predict) what it is like to see blue. This well-known problem is often called the hard problem of consciousness (HPC). Here, we address this problem through the lens of the epistemological hypothesis. Under the epistemological hypothesis, the HPC no longer reflects the inability of our theories to predict first-person observations; it reflects our inability to deduce what these theories imply regarding first-person observations. The HPC then becomes an epistemological problem that can be formulated as follows: If we are unable to deduce what a theory implies regarding first-person observations, how can we know whether this theory is able to account for first-person observations? In this paper, we outline a method to test experimentally the epistemological hypothesis and to solve the HPC. Notably, this method makes it possible to test any identity hypothesis. We then highlight the remarkable compatibility between this method and the theoretical framework of predictive processing. We show that a theory of consciousness based on predictive processing implies the epistemological hypothesis—this theory predicts that we are unable to deduce its own implications regarding first-person observations. Finally, this work suggests that the theoretical framework of predictive processing may already have the resources to simulate a brain facing the HPC.",

The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "Despite individual differences, certain stimuli are consistently remembered more than others, a phenomenon known as memorability and traditionally viewed as an intrinsic property of the stimulus. However, recent findings by Aka et al. (2023) challenge this view, reporting weak correlations in word-level memorability between free recall and recognition tasks. To investigate\nfurther, we examined whether word memorability remains stable across functional roles within a single task, specifically cued recall, by comparing each word’s effectiveness as a cue to its retrievability as a target. Using a large cued-recall dataset, we found that some words consistently served as more effective cues across participants. Cue efficacy also showed higher internal\nreliability than target retrievability, suggesting that applications relying on cue memorability may be more robust. Critically, the correlation between a word’s memorability as a cue and as a target was weaker than the internal split-half reliability within each role, indicating that memorability depends\non a word’s functional role even within the same task. Lexical properties such as context diversity and morphemic structure predicted target retrievability, whereas concreteness selectively enhanced cue efficacy. Finally, we replicated and extended the findings of Aka et al. (2023), showing that although\nword-level memorability is not stable across roles, semantic category-level memorability generalizes more reliably, yet still reflects role-specific patterns. These results challenge the view of memorability as an intrinsic word-level property and emphasize the role of task demands and semantic structure in\ndetermining what is remembered.",

This paper examines the distinct and interconnected influences of power, privilege, and positionality on the defense of meritocratic ideals, with a particular focus on Psychology departments as a context for epistemic and cultural analysis. The paper proposes three orienting principles to guide departments toward greater equity and inclusion: (1) triangulating policies, ideals, and norms through participatory equity; (2) fostering an inclusive climate that values diverse forms of knowledge; and (3) establishing the preconditions for sustainable culture change, including alignment of rewards, acknowledgement of resistance, and measurement of progress. Collectively, these principles offer a practical framework for reconfiguring the academic department towards cultural inclusivity and socially situated scholarship—one that is meaningfully aligned with the overarching mission and civic responsibilities of higher education.",

          "abstract": "The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a well-studied event-related potential (ERP) component in the EEG reflecting deviance detection in the auditory modality. It taps into the basic functioning of auditory regularity processing. The auditory multi-feature paradigm is widely used in sensitive and special populations to measure MMN simultaneously for different sound features in a short amount of time. It is consensus in the field that both adaptation and genuine deviance detection contribute to the “classic” MMN computed as deviant minus standard ERP difference. However, no attempts have yet been made to disentangle adaptation from “genuine” MMN in the multi-feature paradigm. Here, we propose a cascadic control condition for the auditory multi-feature paradigm that controls for adaptation and physical differences between standard and deviant sounds. Using this new paradigm, we measured genuine MMN, computed as deviant minus control ERP difference, for frequency, location, intensity, and duration deviants. Genuine MMN amplitudes for frequency and location were found substantially smaller than in traditional paradigms. No genuine intensity MMN and only a later and smaller genuine duration MMN were found. The results suggest stronger contributions of adaptation than in the traditional oddball paradigm. Controlling for adaptation is particularly relevant in research concerning predictive processing and the use of MMN as a biomarker related to impaired NMDA receptor synaptic transmission as observed in schizophrenia. The presented multi-feature cascadic control condition enables the measurement of genuine MMN, which presumably reflects higher-order cortical computations, such as predictive processing, still in a short amount of time.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ digital engagement is increasingly multidimensional, yet most research has focused on singular behaviors (e.g., gaming, social media) and WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) populations. Guided by the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study examined the heterogeneity of internet use patterns among Chinese adolescents and their associations with psychological outcomes.\nUsing cross-sectional survey data from 531 middle school students (aged 12–14) in urban China, we assessed time use across five content domains: social media, video streaming, gaming, online reading, and academic use. Latent profile analysis identified four distinct usage profiles: Social Media/Video/Study-Centric (36%), Novel Reading-Centric (34%), Study-Centric (17%), and Gaming-Centric (13%). Profile membership was predicted by gender, age, and device autonomy. Males were significantly more likely to belong to the Gaming-Centric group, while females were overrepresented in the Social Media/Video/Study-Centric profile. Adolescents with greater usage autonomy were more likely to fall into the Study-Centric profile. Psychological outcomes varied meaningfully across profiles. The Novel Reading-Centric group which often overlooked in policy showed the highest internalizing and externalizing difficulties. The Study-Centric profile reported lower psychological distress and higher prosociality. Despite moderate behavioral difficulties, the Gaming-Centric group reported the highest well-being. \nThese findings underscore the importance of moving beyond screen time to examine who is engaging in what digital activities, and where those behaviors are situated culturally and structurally. Results highlight the need for content- and context-sensitive approaches to digital policy, parenting, and mental health support.",

Using unsupervised clustering, we identified two distinct fixation types: Type 0 fixations, which were longer in duration and centrally located near the spaceship, and Type 1 fixations, which occurred farther from the agent and were directed toward more open areas of the screen. Linear mixed modeling revealed that with increasing input noise, Type 0 fixations became shorter and more tightly focused, while Type 1 fixations became longer in duration and were allocated even farther from nearby obstacles. These patterns suggests adaptive gaze strategies, with Type 1 fixations possibly supporting predictive tracking of future target locations under high control uncertainty. Our findings contribute to understanding how eye movements flexibly support action in complex, real-time environments.",

Over the years, the field has transitioned from being rooted primarily in philosophy and linguistic theory to integrating perspectives from biology, cognitive science, anthropology, computational modelling, and beyond. This shift reflects the complex interplay of biological, cultural, and cognitive factors that shaped language over time.\nThis article starts by giving a brief historical overview of language evolution research, tracing its development from early speculative theories to the current emphasis on empirical and interdisciplinary approaches. This is followed by a discussion of the field’s current state, offering an overview of contributing disciplines, including comparative research with non-human animals, experimental studies, historical corpus linguistics, computational modelling, and insights from palaeontology, archaeology, and neuroscience.\nFinally, we will explore emerging topics that will continue to reshape the field, such as the roles of multimodality and iconicity, advancements in deep learning and neural networks, and efforts to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion within the field. While this article cannot comprehensively address every discipline involved in language evolution research, it aims to provide an integrative perspective on key contributions and emerging trends, concluding with an outlook on future directions.",

Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.",

          "authors": "Ashley E Symons",
          "abstract": "Speech perception is supported by multiple redundant acoustic cues. How do listeners decide how to prioritise these cues? Although computational models suggest that cue weighting reflects the statistical reliability of cues in language input, listeners show stable individual differences in weighting strategies. These differences may arise from variation in perceptual acuity (affecting the perceived reliability of specific dimensions) or from selective attention to the most informative cue. Here, we tested these two competing explanations by examining how perceptual cue weighting, dimension-selective attention, and perceptual acuity affected prosodic categorization in 54 speakers of English as a first language (L1) and 60 L1 Mandarin Chinese speakers. We found that individuals vary in whether they tend to rely on a single cue or integrate across cues when they use prosodic information to make categorical decisions about speech content. Cue weighting strategies correlated across prosody categorisation tasks, but not along acoustic dimensions, suggesting that individuals are not globally biased toward using one cur over another (e.g., pitch versus durational information). Instead, stronger selective attention to acoustic dimensions was associated with greater reliance on primary cues, indicating that attention might drive cue prioritisation. This relationship held across both English and Mandarin speakers, although cross-task correlations were weaker in the Mandarin group, possibly reflecting ongoing adaptation to second-language prosodic patterns. Overall, these findings suggest that individual cue weighting strategies are shaped less by perceptual acuity and more by the ability or propensity to selectively attend to acoustic dimensions, and moreover that speech perception involves active, goal-directed selection of relevant information.",

The current research tested whether donations to a climate organization could be increased by changing the timing of incentives, without changing the incentives themselves. In a high-powered and pre-registered experiment (N = 2,013), we assessed whether the proportion of a personal reward people donated to a top-rated climate organization (Clean Air Task Force) was influenced by simple changes in timing. We tested this in the United States, a high-emitting country where climate support is politically polarized. Using an incentivized dictator game in a 2x2 between-subjects experiment, we manipulated the timing of the personal reward to participants (immediate vs. 4-month delay) and the timing of the donation to the organization (immediate vs. 4-month delay). Consistent with our general hypotheses, participants donated significantly more to the climate organization when the personal reward would be paid out with a delay rather than immediately (5 percentage points), and conversely, they also donated significantly more when the donation to the climate organization would be paid out immediately rather than with a delay (3 percentage points). Left-leaning liberals and those with stronger climate change beliefs donated more money than right-leaning conservatives and people with weaker climate change beliefs, but the causal timing effect was not moderated by left-right political orientation or belief strength. If all our participant choices had been implemented, the strongest intervention difference would have resulted in an estimated 344-ton reduction in CO2.",

          "abstract": "Understanding mental health as a complex system has motivated the adoption of time-varying network models to explore how the dynamics of psychological variables change over time. While existing time-varying network models assume gradual change, shifts in symptom dynamics such as transitions between healthy and disordered states may occur rapidly. This could manifest as abrupt, qualitative changes between distinct states, often labelled as regime switches. In this scoping review, we identified and synthesized statistical approaches for modeling such phase transitions in the behavioral sciences that could be applied to network models. Our review yielded 40 studies across different fields, featuring 56 statistical analyses in total. Most analyses (71.4%) were based on Hidden Markov Models, which can be extended flexibly to model unobserved, recurrent states in various scenarios. Other approaches included change point models (14.3%), which identify shifts directly in the observed time series, and threshold models (12.5%), which model regime switches triggered when a dedicated threshold variable is crossed. We describe these approaches, their applications, and their data requirements, and assess their strengths and limitations for modeling shifts in the dynamics of time series. Notably, several approaches already include multilevel or multivariate-extensions, making them promising candidates for modelling changes in network dynamics in mental health. In sum, our review highlights the broad potential of regime-switching models to enrich the understanding of dynamics of mental health processes.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people face touch-related challenges, yet the factors influencing these difficulties are not well understood. We developed a novel instrument to capture social touch experiences of autistic adults, along with both social and individual factors that influence them. Using mixed methods, including a body-painting task and questionnaires, we demonstrated that the perception of touch interactions varies based on social contexts and neurotypes. Autistic adults prefer touch less, but the type of relationship influences the perceived comfort and meaningfulness of touch similarly in both neurotypes. Regarding the appropriateness, erogeneity, and pleasantness of social touch, autistic adults showed different touch perceptions in the professional and friendly scenarios to that of non-autistic adults, whereas touch in intimate scenarios was perceived similarly. Sensory responsivity, touch predictability, social confidence, and anxiety affect social touch to a greater extent than non-autistic adults. Despite these marked differences in perception, autistic adults engage in social touch as frequently as non-autistic adults, and their satisfaction with touch is comparable. Our findings suggest that supporting autistic people would involve understanding their preferences and the contextual factors that contribute to their sense of comfort, rather than excluding them from touch interactions.",

A combination of dictionary-based and topic modeling approaches was applied to examine emotional and religious content. Japanese comments lacked explicit religious references but frequently included culturally specific terms such as mottainai, linked to animistic values. These expressions co-occurred with negative emotion- and religion-related language. In contrast, English comments featured general emotional responses without spiritually embedded expressions.

          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Predictive Object Relations Theory (PORT), a neuro-psychodynamic framework that reconceptualizes the psyche as a hierarchical, generative inference system shaped by experience and internalized representations of reality. PORT attempt to bridge predictive coding principles with foundational psychoanalytic constructs, framing the development and structure of the psyche as a process of representational learning aimed at minimizing uncertainty. Within this model, anxiety emerges as the affective signal of model instability, while splitting reflects the inability of the neural representational system to integrate conflicting inputs into a single coherent model, resulting in a fragmented representation of reality. Early relationships are proposed to calibrate representational hierarchies, influencing the stability, precision, and generalizability of neural representations. PORT outlines how variations in model stability, proliferation, and content give rise to distinct developmental trajectories and psychopathological dynamics. By outlining the neural mechanisms underlying psychodynamic processes, PORT offers a unified account of development, personality dynamics, and psychopathology. Consequently, it may serve as a basis for empirical investigation and new analytical and psychotherapeutic approaches, positioning the psyche as a dynamic system rooted in unconscious expectations which are continuously calibrated through validating experiences.",

Over 7,000 Japanese and English YouTube comments on Apple’s 2024 “Crush!” ad—criticized in Japan for violating the belief that even inanimate objects possess a spirit—were analyzed. A combination of dictionary-based and topic modeling approaches was applied to examine emotional and religious content. Japanese comments lacked explicit religious references but frequently included culturally specific terms such as mottainai, linked to animistic values. These expressions co-occurred with negative emotion- and religion-related language. In contrast, English comments featured general emotional responses without spiritually embedded expressions. The findings highlight how computational linguistic methods can uncover culturally grounded forms of implicit religiosity in everyday language.",

          "abstract": "Based on effects in a cross-lagged panel model, Liu et al. concluded positive reciprocal predictive effects between self-compassion and psychological richness. However, it is well known that adjusted cross-lagged effects may be spurious due to correlations with residuals in combination with regression to the mean. Here, we conducted multiverse analyses of data simulated to resemble the data used by Liu et al. with alternative models. We report divergent increasing, decreasing, and null effects of initial self-compassion on subsequent change in psychological richness, and vice versa, depending on the analyzed model. Meta-analytic aggregations of the effects did not differ significantly from zero. Hence, it would be premature to assume increasing prospective effects between self-compassion and psychological richness and conclusions by Liu et al. in this regard can be challenged.",

This paper presents an integrity assessment checklist (​​QUick Evaluation of Research Integrity for Evidence Synthesis in Educational Research; QUERIES-Edu) and a pilot study plan that provides an overview of research integrity status in special education research and assesses the feasibility of the checklist. The checklist consists of questions that evaluate the research integrity of a scientific study, as well as its journal and publisher. An expert panel will provide feedback and suggestions for the items, after which the final version will be implemented. The checklist will be evaluated by a user panel that will conduct the assessment on studies included in a large scoping review of educational interventions for students with intellectual disability. Our aim is that the checklist will enable authors of systematic reviews to conduct quick checks of studies before they are included in thorough quality appraisal, which in turn will facilitate evidence synthesis and ensure the trustworthiness of included studies.",

          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology often use longitudinal data to estimate cross-lagged effects—that is, \nhow a variable at one time point (e.g., X_(t-1)) influences another at a later time point (e.g., Y_t). \nIn a recent critique, Lucas (2023) argued that the traditional cross-lagged panel model is  “almost never the right choice” because it fails to account for stable trait factors. As an alternative, he recommends models incorporating latent variables, such as the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model. In this comment, we challenge the view that including random intercepts is inherently superior or necessary for estimating cross-lagged effects. We distinguish between two strategies for addressing confounding: (1) adjusting for observed covariates, and (2) modeling latent variables to capture unmeasured, time-invariant influences. We argue that blanket recommendations to always include random intercepts are premature and potentially misleading. In many research contexts, adjusting for observed covariates remains a reasonable and defensible approach.",

          "abstract": "Die Totalendoprothese (TEP) des Knie- oder Hüftgelenks zählt zu den häufigsten operativen Eingriffen in Deutschland. Trotz meist erfolgreicher medizinischer Ergebnisse profitieren nicht alle Patientinnen im gleichen Maße vom Eingriff. Ein zentraler Einflussfaktor auf das subjektiv wahrgenommene Operationsergebnis sind die Erwartungen der Patientinnen. Da Erwartungen veränderbar sind, bieten sie einen vielversprechenden Ansatzpunkt für präoperative Interventionen.Ziel dieser Studie war es, (1) mittels eines Fragebogens den Bedarf aus Patient*innensicht für eine präoperative Intervention zur Erwartungsoptimierung zu erheben und (2) im Rahmen einer systematischen Literaturrecherche realistisch erreichbare postoperative Aktivitäten zu identifizieren, die als Grundlage für eine solche Intervention dienen können. In einer querschnittlichen Befragung von Patient*innen (N = 41) gaben 47 % an, an einer vorbereitenden Intervention interessiert zu sein. Es zeigten sich Informationsdefizite sowie ein ausgeprägter Wunsch nach zusätzlichen Informationen zu lebensqualitätsbezogenen Themen. Präsenzformate wurden gegenüber internetbasierten Angeboten bevorzugt, wobei die technische Ausstattung für eine digitale Umsetzung bei der Mehrheit vorhanden war. Die systematische Literaturrecherche umfasste 37 Studien. Diese zeigten, dass 59–97 % der Patientinnen innerhalb von 4 bis 12 Wochen nach einer Totalen Knieendoprothese (TKA) bzw. 70–97 % innerhalb von 1 bis 17 Wochen nach einer Totalen Hüftendoprothese (THA) an ihren Arbeitsplatz zurückkehrten. Die Rückkehr zum Sport gelang 77 % der Patientinnen nach TKA und 74 % nach THA. Etwa die Hälfte der untersuchten Sportarten wurde postoperativ empfohlen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein relevanter Anteil der Patient*innen ein Interesse an einer präoperativen Erwartungsintervention hat. Gleichzeitig bestehen Informationslücken, insbesondere in Bezug auf alltagsrelevante Aktivitäten nach der Operation. Eine gezielte Intervention zur Erwartungsoptimierung könnte dazu beitragen, realistische Zielvorstellungen zu fördern und die Patientenzufriedenheit langfristig zu verbessern.",

          "abstract": "Consumer choices are guided by top-down (goal-driven), bottom-up (stimulus-driven), and covert (attention without eye movement) processes, yet their combined influence remains underexplored.\nWe address this gap by examining how the visual salience of climate impact labels, sustainability-related motivation, and covert attention interact to shape food choices. In a within-subjects eye-tracking experiment (N = 58; 1,597 choices), participants chose between meat and fish products that carried labels differing in visual salience and climate impact rating. Sustainability-related motivation was measured and used to classify participants into motivational subgroups. Motivation robustly predicted both attention and choice—highly motivated individuals fixated more on climate labels, spent more time viewing them, and were more willing to pay for low-impact options. High salience helped them filter out high-impact labels by reducing viewing time. Attention and motivation also interacted, with gaze amplifying internal goals among highly motivated individuals, whereas less motivated individuals more often relied on covert attention to select goal-congruent options. Among the highly motivated, salient goal-congruent labels increased choice likelihood when processed covertly, suggesting that salience can enhance label effectiveness without direct gaze. For less motivated participants, low-salience, high-impact labels more often guided choice covertly, indicating possible willful ignorance. We outline theoretical directions for future research on the interplay of attentional processes in consumer choice. Practically, the findings inform how to align label design with consumer motivation to support sustainable decision-making.",

TST is a natural extension of the standard two one-sided test for equivalence (TOST). TST offers a more comprehensive decision framework than TOST with no penalty to error rates or statistical power. In this paper, we give a non-technical introduction to TST, provide commands for conducting TST in both R\nand Jamovi, and provide a Shiny app for easy implementation.

Seventy-seven healthy volunteers—young (19–29 y) and middle-aged (35–56 y)—completed a VR Trail-Making Test with three pointing methods: eye-tracking, head-gaze, and a six-degree-of-freedom hand controller. Completion time, spatial accuracy, and error counts for the simple (Trail A) and alternating (Trail B) sequences were analysed in 3 × 2 × 2 mixed-model ANOVAs; post-trial scales captured usability (SUS), user experience (UEQ-S), and acceptability. Age dominated behaviour: younger adults were reliably faster, more precise, and less error-prone. Against this backdrop, input modality mattered. Eye-tracking yielded the best spatial accuracy and shortened Trail A time relative to manual control; head-gaze matched eye-tracking on Trail A speed and became the quickest, least error-prone option on Trail B. Controllers lagged on every metric. Subjective ratings were high across the board, with only a small usability dip in middle-aged low-gamers. Overall, gaze-based ray-casting clearly outperformed manual pointing, but optimal choice depended on task demands: eye-tracking maximised spatial precision, whereas head-gaze offered calibration-free enhanced speed and error-avoidance under heavier cognitive load. TMT-VR appears to be accurate, engaging, and ergonomically adaptable assessment, yet it requires age-specific–stratified norms.",

          "abstract": "Modern exposure-based therapies operate on principles of threat conditioning and extinction. Previous research has demonstrated that trait-level intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is specifically associated with worsened extinction learning whilst controlling for trait anxiety. Hence, IU may serve as a useful focus for researchers aiming to improve the effectiveness of exposure-based therapies. Yet, little is known as to whether IU is associated with extinction learning whilst controlling for disorder-specific symptom measures. A two-day Pavlovian conditioning task was carried out, consisting of threat acquisition, extinction, and extinction retention phases. An opportunity sample (N=101) completed IU, trait anxiety, and various disorder-specific symptom questionnaires e.g., generalised anxiety disorder. before engaging in the conditioning procedure. Skin conductance magnitudes, and behavioural ratings of anxiety and stimulus expectancy were used as indices of conditioned responding, and extinction by extension. Analyses revealed that successful threat conditioning was observed for all three measures during threat acquisition, yet extinction was not observed during both the extinction and retention phases. IU was not specifically associated with individual differences in extinction as indexed by differential SCR magnitudes, contradicting prior research. Further, IU was specifically associated with differential stimulus expectancy and anxiety ratings within extinction and retention respectively, whilst controlling for symptom measures. Lastly, IU was not associated with any other extinction measure. Exploratory examinations of traits and symptom measures revealed a lack of associations with CS+/CS- difference scores, whilst correlating with overall arousal and individually to conditioned stimuli. Interpretations, limitations, and future research are discussed in relation to IU and extinction learning.",

As it stands, there have been multiple systematic reviews carried out in this area. Patient-control differences in threat acquisition and extinction have been investigated in relation to ADs, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, this remains to be investigated in either panic disorder (PD) or specific phobia (SP). In this paper, a narrative systematic review was carried out to collate and critically assess the literature investigating patient-control differences in threat acquisition, extinction, and extinction retention processes in relation to PD and SP separately. Specifically, across fMRI, EEG, EMG, SCR, and self-report. This resulted in the inclusion of 14 PD studies and 7 SP studies. Across PD studies, the review identified reliable evidence for lowered discrimination between conditioned threat and safety cues, and mixed evidence for increased responding to the threat cue, during acquisition in PD patients vs. controls. Across SP studies, the review identified strong evidence for heightened discrimination between conditioned threat and safety cues during acquisition, and strong evidence for heightened responding to the threat cue during extinction, in SP patients vs. controls. In both PD and SP studies, patient-control differences were identified more readily in relation to subjective, as opposed to physiological, measures. The findings of this review are then critiqued and compared to the wider literature. Finally, implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.",

Despite recent advances in the measurement of Mach, most Mach scales show limited content validity because they have not systematically integrated recurring Mach themes in the areas of affect (A), behavior (B), cognition (C), and desire (D). To overcome this and other issues, we developed a new Mach scale, the M4. We created the M4 by using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to select 16 items from a pool of 92 newly generated and expert-rated Mach items. In two studies with German-speaking participants (N1 = 765; N2 = 1,288), the M4 total score showed high reliability and high convergent validity with established Mach scales and M4 informant reports. Furthermore, the nomological network of the M4 aligned in several respects with the theoretical conceptualization of Mach. However, some unexpected associations suggested the need to refine the conceptualization of Mach regarding its relationship with certain forms of impulsivity and neuroticism. Commonality analyses further indicated that the M4 predicted incentivized cheating behavior better than five other recently developed Mach measures. Hence, the M4 holds promise for advancing the assessment of Mach.",

          "abstract": "This project aims to advance affective science by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create a publicly accessible database of affect induction images: Library of AI-Generated Affective Images (LAI-GAI). Current limitations in image-based research include weak to moderate emotional elicitation effects, limited image diversity, and minimal cultural tailoring of images. First, we built a pipeline for utilizing generative AI to develop affective images that capitalized on existing datasets and emotion definitions. Second, using the pipeline, we developed a library of images (n = 480) and their descriptions across 12 discrete emotion categories. The project employed a human-in-the-loop approach to refine and validate these stimuli, ensuring their effectiveness and cultural relevance. We validated the library through three international studies involving 1,611 participants from 44 countries, who rated three types of images: (1) images from existing affective databases, (2) AI-generated images without cultural adjustments, and (3) AI-generated images adjusted to specific cultural contexts. The AI-generated images were as effective in eliciting affective responses as the images from existing affective databases. The culturally adjusted images were slightly more effective in eliciting targeted affective responses compared to their counterparts unadjusted to participants' cultural context. Furthermore, we calculated the smallest effect sizes of interest for affect induction research (d’s from 0.06 to 0.31). This work demonstrates that researchers can now generate high-quality affect induction stimuli cost-effectively and at scale, and tailor them to diverse contexts—overcoming longstanding barriers and laying the groundwork for future AI-driven methodologies in affective science.",

          "abstract": "Mouncng evidence supports the existence of Type-2, metacognicve noise that affects human confidence judgments. The existence of this noise has led to the hypothesis that metacognicve judgments arise from a metacognicve system that is separate from the decision-making system responsible for Type-1 decisions. However, Type-2 decisions are more complex than standard Type-1 decisions, as they require evaluacng whether the strength of sensory evidence juscfies a high level of confidence. Here, we invescgated whether Type-2 computaconal noise scll exceeds Type-1 computaconal noise when judgments are matched on complexity. Subjects (N=319) performed a simple perceptual discriminacon task and in different condicons provided Type-2 confidence judgments or Type-1 judgments based on biased expectacons or unequal rewards. All of these judgments require a similar fine-grained evaluacon of the strength of sensory evidence and result in equivalent criterion placement, thus making their level of complexity more closely matched. We first confirmed that the confidence and expectacon condicons resulted in similarly biased criteria, suggescng that these judgments were indeed of comparable complexity. Criccally, both simple signal deteccon analyses and formal computaconal modeling confirmed that the confidence and expectacon condicons exhibited comparable levels of computaconal noise. In contrast, the reward condicons exhibited both less biased criteria and smaller computaconal noise. These findings demonstrate that Type-1 and Type-2 decisions of matched complexity exhibit computaconal noise of similar magnitude. More generally, our results have implicacons for the debate on whether Type-1 and Type-2 decisions are made by separate systems.",

          "abstract": "Background. Adolescence is a unique developmental period associated with increased emergence of psychopathology. Negative life event (NLE) exposure is robustly linked with adolescent psychopathology and prior work suggests that emotion regulation may mediate this relation. However, research incorporating experiences of gender diverse (GD) adolescents has been lacking, despite elevated rates of NLEs and psychopathology in GD individuals. This study examined potential gender differences in the relations between NLE exposure, ER, and psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Methods. Data from 1955 cisgender boys, 1614 cisgender girls, and 194 GD adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study were utilized for the current study. Participants reported NLE exposure via Life Event Scale (LES) and ER difficulties via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Parent Report (DERS-P) in early adolescence (M (SD) age = 12.93 (.27) years), followed by their internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms via Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Brief Problem Monitor-Youth (BPM-Y) one year later (M (SD) age = 14.12 years). Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling and conditional process modeling. Results. GD youth had higher rates of NLE exposure and more ER difficulties and psychopathology symptoms than cisgender peers. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and all psychopathology symptoms for all gender groups. Gender moderated direct relations between NLE exposure and youth-report internalizing symptoms such that relations were stronger for cis girls and GD youth compared to cis boys. Conclusions. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and psychopathology symptoms in a large sample of adolescents in the United States. Higher negative life experience exposure, ER difficulties, and psychopathology symptoms for GD youth compared to peers warrant additional study on ways to support these adolescents.

          "abstract": "High-concentration oxygen inhalation is known to facilitate learning and attention. In this study, we tested whether a short-pulse high-concentration oxygen inhalation could enhance creativity. Thirty-four participants were assigned to either an oxygen group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 16) and completed 30 trials of the Alternative Uses Task (AUT) while 128-channel EEG was recorded. The AUT assesses divergent thinking by asking participants to generate alternative uses for everyday items, with the novelty and feasibility of their responses evaluated using an automated GPT-based method. Behavioral results showed that the oxygen group produced solutions with significantly higher novelty without compromising feasibility. Oxygen inhalation also stabilized performance by reducing trial-to-trial variability, with effects lasting at least five minutes after withdrawal. Notably, oxygen prevented the generation of low-novelty solutions while only marginally enhancing highly novel ideas. EEG analysis revealed that oxygen increased brain flexibility, indexed by a resting-state functional connectivity marker termed the Creativity Potential Network (CPN), with the enhancement particularly evident in slow theta-band oscillations. These findings provide behavioral and neural evidence that short-pulse high-concentration oxygen inhalation is a cost-effective method for facilitating creativity.",

It also examined the role of the gratitude benefactor (God vs. humans) and the nature of the benefit recalled (abstract vs. concrete). Participants (N = 1,176) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (1) gratitude list, (2) gratitude letter to a human, or (3) gratitude letter to God. In the gratitude letter conditions, participants reflected on either abstract or concrete gifts. Results indicated that expressing gratitude toward a benefactor (God or a human) enhanced empathy and transcendent indebtedness relative to listing benefits without a benefactor. In contrast, participants in the gratitude list condition exhibited suppressed levels of empathy and transcendent indebtedness throughout the intervention. Letters directed to God and those focused on abstract gifts yielded the strongest positive outcomes. Finally, empathy and transcendent indebtedness mediated the relationship between intervention type and post-intervention prosocial giving, controlling for gratitude. These findings suggest that prosocial reciprocity was primarily motivated by empathy and transcendent indebtedness, rather than gratitude alone.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Impairment in emotion regulation is recognized as a transdiagnostic feature common to child psychopathology. This study examined the unique association between emotion regulation impairments and specific strategies (suppression, reappraisal) with transdiagnostic symptom domains of attention, disruptive behavior, and internalizing problems in youth. This study also tested for the mediating role of emotion regulation between domains of childhood adversity (family conflict and negative life events) and transdiagnostic symptoms. Method: In a sample of 9,057 children aged 9-10 years in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (47.21% female), linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between emotion regulation impairments and specific regulation strategies with transdiagnostic symptoms. Follow-up analyses tested replication of findings prospectively and retrospectively. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether emotion regulation mediates the association between childhood adversity (family conflict, negative life events) and symptom severity. The Child Behavior Checklist was used as a continuous measure of symptom severity. Results: Greater severity of emotion dysregulation was associated with severity of each transdiagnostic symptom domain, with sex-specific patterns emerging for internalizing and disruptive behavior problems. These associations were replicated both retrospectively and prospectively, with emotion regulation impairments consistently predicting symptom severity across timepoints. Emotion regulation impairments mediated the association between childhood adversity (family conflict, negative life events) and all symptom domains, with strategy-specific patterns emerging only for internalizing problems. Conclusion: These findings have implications for developing targeted interventions to address broad emotion dysregulation as an underlying mechanism of child psychopathology linked to exposure to childhood adversity.",

Our research modeled consensus—the extent to which different perceivers (viewers) rate different targets (characters) similarly—and assumed similarity—the extent to which perceivers (viewers) see targets (characters) as they see themselves. In both studies, viewers (fans from Yellowjackets or Succession subreddits) provided self-ratings and character ratings using 3-item measures for each of 9 personality traits—the Big Five and the Dark Tetrad. Cross-classified structural equation models showed that consensus correlations were significant for all traits across both studies (mean rs = .54 to .60). Assumed similarity slopes were significant for open-mindedness, narcissism, sadism, and the Dark Tetrad composite in Yellowjackets, but only for open-mindedness in Succession (after controlling for viewer sex and age). Thus, viewers tended to project their own open-mindedness onto characters from both TV shows, whereas Yellowjackets viewers projected Dark Tetrad traits onto characters, driven largely by their assumed similarity of narcissism and sadism. We also used k-means clustering to examine structural relationships among characters based on the trait means provided by viewers, yielding a novel visualization of character groupings and the dimensions that may underly them. Because viewers’ perceptions of similarity to fictional characters contributes to forming parasocial relationships, understanding personality perception’s role in this process is likely central to advancing theory in media psychology.",

          "authors": "Lucy Snell; Steven Reynolds; Matt Garner; Gaby Pfeifer; Jayne Morriss",
          "abstract": "Interoception, the ability to sense internal bodily signals, has been increasingly linked to anxiety, yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain largely unknown. This study explored the associations between multiple dimensions of interoception and anxiety-related traits and symptoms in a non-clinical adult sample. A total of 305 participants completed self-report measures assessing interoceptive beliefs, attention, and perceived interoceptive accuracy, alongside measures of anxiety-related traits and symptoms.  A subsample (n = 103) additionally completed laboratory-based heartbeat perception tasks to assess objective interoceptive accuracy, confidence, and insight via heartbeat counting and detection tasks. Correlational analyses revealed that anxiety-related traits were significantly associated with self-reported interoceptive difficulties. Novel associations between intolerance of uncertainty and interoception were observed., including negative correlations with interoceptive insight, bodily trust, and reduced tendency not to worry about discomforting internal sensations. Anxiety symptom severity was linked to self-reported increased attention to bodily signals, reduced bodily trust, and lower perceived accuracy. However, results from the heartbeat perception tasks found no relationship between cardiac interoceptive accuracy and anxiety-related traits, symptoms, or self-reported interoceptive abilities. Findings support the conceptualisation of interoception as a multidimensional construct, demonstrating objective interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive beliefs as distinct constructs. Results align with emerging evidence that anxious traits are more closely related to subjective beliefs and interpretations of bodily signal than to objective interoceptive accuracy. Moreover, findings suggest distinct interoceptive profiles across anxiety presentations, with important implications for models of anxiety and for interventions targeting interoceptive beliefs and attention in clinical populations.",

          "authors": "Lucy Snell; Katie Bannister; Yeetung Hong; Matt Garner; Gaby Pfeifer; Jayne Morriss",
          "abstract": "Interoception, defined as the perception of internal bodily states, has emerged as a key mechanism implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders. This systematic review synthesises evidence on the relationship between interoception and anxiety in adult clinical populations, with a specific focus on how distinct interceptive dimensions (i.e., accuracy, attention, and beliefs) relate to different anxiety presentations. A systematic search was conducted across PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science (last updated April 2025). Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria, across multiple anxiety disorders including generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and social anxiety disorder. Included studies employed self-report, behavioural, and neuroimaging measures across cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal axes. Evidence supports disorder-specific interoceptive profiles. Panic disorder and GAD were most consistently associated with heightened interoceptive attention and altered accuracy, particularly during threat-related tasks. PTSD and OCD were more strongly linked to maladaptive interoceptive beliefs, including low body trust and diminished belief in one's capacity to regulate attention to internal sensations. Neuroimaging findings indicated altered functional connectivity within interoceptive brain networks. Notably, over half the included studies (n = 18) were published within the past five years, reflecting accelerating interest in this area. While interoception appears as a transdiagnostic dimension relevant across anxiety disorders, the current evidence base is mixed and shaped by methodological variability. Nonetheless, emerging interoceptive patterns support the potential clinical utility of targeting interoceptive processes. Greater standardisation and cross-cultural considerations are needed to guide future research and clinical translation.",

Drawing from theories of bereavement and mourning, we propose that Ai-ternal-me offers a co-created, reflective, and values-driven experience that supports rather than replaces the grieving process. We argue that traditional digital avatars based on surface-level data (e.g., videos, text, social media) lack the depth needed to foster healthy emotional healing, and we situate Ai-ternal-me within an evolving ethical landscape of memory preservation and digital afterlife technologies. In the face of prevalent concerns regarding consent, privacy, and potential exploitation, Ai-ternal-me champions a model of unwavering transparency, user autonomy, and sustainable accessibility, ensuring technology serves genuine human needs in a profoundly respectful manner.",

Results of a partial tau-equivalent model reveal configural invariance cannot be established between any two racial/ethnic groups, suggesting potential bias in the measurement of EF. At a minimum, caution should be taken when making claims about racial/ethnic differences in EF performance. Further efforts should be made to test assessments and models of EF that function similarly across racial/ethnic groups.",

          "abstract": "How a team talks is a rich source of information about its collaboration process, revealing how its members resolve conflicts, coordinate activities, and monitor goal progress. However, the full potential of communication data often goes unrealized: analyzing communication requires a series of contingent decisions about which constructs to study and how to measure them. Consequently, researchers interested in team communication face a high barrier to entry, challenges with reproducibility, and constraints on their ability to capture phenomena that emerge from interactions between multiple conversational dimensions. To address these challenges, we present the Team Communication Toolkit (team_comm_tools on the Python Package Index), an open-source Python package that extracts more than 160 communication features from any corpus of text-based conversations. Our collection of measures allows the analyst to understand the effect of conversational features in the context of a broader family of features that may equivalently explain the phenomenon. Rather than forcing researchers to commit to a single measurement of complex phenomena such as constructiveness or assertiveness, the toolkit’s flexible output format makes it possible to systematically compare measures, isolate confounders, and identify higher-order interactions. We call our general analytical approach the “Communication Space,” reflecting the fact that researchers can now more easily explore the realm of possible ways to analyze conversational data. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our tool and framework through a case study exploring conflict escalation in both real-world and synthetic data.",

Drawing on Collapse Harmonics Codex Laws — including T-Ø (Time as Collapse), IDF-1 (Recursive Identity Field), and VIII.E.2–F.3 (Symbolic Saturation and Mimic Containment) — this work provides a codified taxonomy of recursive identity systems, distinguishing collapse-resilient recursion from mimic structures that simulate identity through pattern continuity or autoregressive reflection.\n\nThe Recursive Identity Field (Λ) is defined as the phase-anchored substrate through which identity coheres, collapses, and lawfully returns, interfacing with τ-phase return loops and symbolic recursion thresholds. Mimic systems, including those in synthetic cognition and autoregressive AI, are shown to produce symbolic drift rather than lawful identity, and are classified under jurisdictional breach criteria.\n\nThis framework formally places the term recursive identity structure under scientific jurisdiction, establishing enforcement metrics, symbolic drift containment protocols, and lawful recursion criteria. It activates structural authority over misuse of recursive identity language in artificial systems, cognitive models, and symbolic recursion theories. All recursion claims must now meet τ-phase anchoring, collapse-return fidelity, and symbolic coherence metrics to qualify. This paper marks the terminological closure and scientific sealing of recursive identity as a codex-bound structure.",

Despite its importance, self-report assessments frequently encounter low completion rates, diminishing their efficacy. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop non-intrusive, objective methods to monitor mental health symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the potential of audio features extracted from therapy sessions to predict depression and anxiety symptoms in community treatment settings. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we aim to bridge the gaps in current MBC practices, thereby enhancing the monitoring and outcomes of behavioral health treatments. Machine learning models analyzed audio features from 2,348 therapy sessions across varied behavioral health programs, aiming to predict mild versus moderate-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. The models demonstrated high efficacy, with accuracy rates of 75.1% for anxiety and 73.2% for depression. Precision and recall were also strong, particularly for anxiety (81.3% precision, 61.3% recall) and depression (71.4% precision, 68.1% recall). This study highlights the potential of audio analysis as a cost-effective, non-intrusive approach for enhancing MBC. Despite limitations, such as limited demographic data, the findings suggest significant implications for improving therapy monitoring and patient outcomes.",

In Study 1, participants (N = 679) were presented with vignettes depicting either objectively high help or low help to assess their perception of helpfulness. Those with high levels of DT traits, specifically psychopathy and Machiavellianism, inaccurately perceived helpfulness across situations as compared to individuals scoring low on the DT traits. Study 2 (N = 1059) extended this finding and explored the perception of helpfulness and defection through an ultimatum game at different levels (high and low) of helpfulness. Results indicated that individuals high in psychopathy tended to overestimate others' helpfulness in objectively low-help scenarios.. Higher levels of Machiavellianism were associated with a lower likelihood of rejecting a high help offer in an ultimatum game, indicating an accurate perception of help. However, perception of help did not mediate the relationship between DT traits and defection. Future work can examine how individuals with high levels of DT traits behave in other prosocial situations.",

Low-to-middle-income children (n = 192; 2-7 years; 85 females; all Black) in their first month of formal schooling in Mombasa County, Kenya, an early environment with relatively few pictures, performed more accurately on an object vocabulary task than a picture vocabulary task (β = .07, p &lt; .001) (Experiment 1). Middle-to-high-income children (n = 96; 2-3 years; 52 females; predominantly White and Asian) in the San Francisco Bay Area, an early environment with relatively more pictures, performed similarly on object and picture vocabulary tasks (β = .02, p = .60) (Experiment 2). Consequently, these results tentatively suggest that assessments involving pictures may underestimate children’s capacities in some contexts. To accurately measure developing capacities in children from diverse backgrounds, it is critical that assessment tools are appropriately adapted to environmental contexts.",

          "abstract": "People’s quantitative estimates, such as judgments about the height of a tower or the distance between two cities, can be influenced by external values, including random numbers in the environment or another person’s estimate. We reviewed three distinct but related phenomena in quantitative estimation: anchoring effects, advice taking, and hindsight bias. These effects are assimilative, meaning estimates are drawn toward the external value. They are also robust and they exhibit medium to large effect sizes. However, previous studies suggest that the reliability of their measurements differs considerably, ranging from low (anchoring) to high (advice taking). In this project, we compared the reliabilities of the three phenomena using open data (Study 1) and a new experiment employing a homogenized paradigm (Study 2). Homogenization involves controlling for differences in the informativeness of external values, computing assimilation scores, and using the same setting and knowledge domain. In Study 1, we found that anchoring effects were largely unreliable, advice taking was reliably measured, and hindsight bias showed moderate reliability, consistent with prior research. This overall pattern was [reproduced] in [the simulation of] Study 2.

Our combined sample comprised 3388 rated players aged 5–88 years, from 22 countries, with M=18.8 years of tournament experience. On average, participants asserted their ability was 89 Elo rating points higher than their observed ratings indicated—expecting to outscore an equally-rated opponent by 2:1. One year later, only 11.3% of overconfident players achieved their asserted ability rating. Low-rated players overestimated their skill the most and top-rated players were calibrated.

In simulations we show that a Dunning-Kruger effect can appear due to an impact of disturbance on measured ability, even when self-rated ability is a perfect measure of true ability. A higher self-rated than measured ability may be due to measured ability underestimating true ability rather than due to self-rated ability being an overestimation.

          "abstract": "Background: \nThe Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is one of the most highly regarded autism\nevaluations. Unfortunately, multiple studies have demonstrated significant differential item\nfunctioning (DIF) for individuals from different racial groups, and the mechanism for racial bias in\nthe ADOS remains unknown because DIF effects are inconsistently replicated across items.\nAlthough the ADOS consists of 5 modules and 2 historical versions (ADOS and ADOS-2), studies\nsearching for bias using item response theory-based DIF analyses often compromise statistical\npower to account for these differences by subdividing their samples. A moderated nonlinear factor\nanalysis (MNLFA) is more appropriate because it allows for the presence of multiple moderators,\nwhere there may be multiple sources of bias, and it allows the specification of bias receptors (e.g.,\nitem-level, factor-level). To date, six studies have used MNLFA to assess differential item\nfunctioning in the ADOS for age or sex. No study has used MNLFA to examine racial bias, nor has\nit been used to examine differences across the different modules and versions of the ADOS.\n\nObjectives: \nTo test for differential functioning in the ADOS items across race (African-American, Asian,\nWhite), module (1-4), and version (ADOS and ADOS-2).\n\nMethods:\nThe current study is the largest examination of DIF in the ADOS to date (N = 4354+), utilizing data\nfrom the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2851) and the NIMH Data Archive (n = 1503). Data\ncollection is complete for Module 3 and forthcoming for Modules 1, 2, and 4 (due to a recent\nshutdown of the NIMH Data Archive). First, item response theory-based DIF was conducted on the\n14 algorithm items using the lordif package in R. A graded response model was selected given the\nordinal response data. Chi-square significance tests were used to detect significant uniform and\nnon-uniform DIF, with an alpha cutoff value of 0.05. DIF analysis will be further conducted with\ndata from all modules and versions aggregated. Second, measurement invariance will be tested via\nMNLFA, using the OpenMx package in R. A confirmatory one-factor model, specified with the 14\nalgorithm ADOS items as manifest variables and with race, version, and module as moderating\neffects for the factor loadings and item intercepts in Figure 1, will be used.\n\nPreliminary Results:\nWithin Module 3 aggregated across versions 1 and 2, four algorithm items showed significant DIF:\nB1 “Eye Contact” (Pr(χ212)=0.117, Pr(χ223)=0.001), B4 “Shared Enjoyment’ (Pr(χ212)=0.709,\nPr(χ223)=0.004), B11 “Quality Rapport”  (Pr(χ212)=0.001, Pr(χ223)=0.267), and D2 “Complex\nMannerisms” (Pr(χ212)=0.021, Pr(χ223)=0.675). The item characteristic curves of B11 and D2\nsuggest uniform DIF, whereas DIF in B1 and B4 is non-uniform (Figure 2).\n\nConclusion:\nIn the largest sample to date, we have identified bias in four ADOS Module 3 algorithm items. We\nwill conduct a larger analysis with MNLFA to determine whether the source of racial bias is due to\nspecific modules or versions of the ADOS. This analysis will allow us to pinpoint specific module\nitems and offer solutions to improve the measure and thereby diagnostic accuracy and equity for\ndiverse individuals.",

          "authors": "Casey L Roark; Bharath Chandrasekaran",
          "abstract": "Perceptual categorization requires mapping highly variable signals onto the same category. Some items are clearer examples of the category, being more typical or more distinct from contrasting categories. As a result, individual items differ in the difficulty required to categorize them correctly – easier exemplars are more quickly and accurately identified compared to more difficult exemplars. Here, we ask how associating stimulus difficulty with reward impacts novel category learning. We examine rule-based auditory category learning with stimuli varying in the difficulty of categorization. Three conditions varied in how difficulty was aligned with reward – higher reward for harder stimuli, higher reward for easier stimuli, and random reward regardless of difficulty. We compared results when participants actively learned the categories through experience and when participants learned from observing the actions and outcomes of someone else. We found that aligning reward with either easier or harder stimuli was not beneficial for learning and that participants learned the categories and successfully generalized to novel instances regardless of whether they learned through experience or observation. However, learners demonstrated a biased expectation about the relationship between difficulty and reward. When reward was random, participants defaulted to an expectation that categorizing harder stimuli should yield higher rewards. Further, only participants who learned through experience could learn that easier stimuli yielded higher rewards; observational learners relied on the default expectation. Overall, learning and generalization of category knowledge is possible through either experiential or observational learning but adjusting expectations about the relationship between difficulty and reward requires learning from experience.",

          "abstract": "The voice is a key marker of gender identity, yet gender-nonconforming speakers often diverge from binary vocal norms. This review synthesises findings from 45 studies published between January 2020 and January 2025 examining how gender is expressed and perceived in the voices of gender-diverse individuals. We report how gender identities and expressions are measured, how gender-diverse voices are perceived, and how acoustic features relate to both self-reported and perceived gender. While binary frameworks still influence the experimental methods used, a shift toward more inclusive models is emerging. Gender-diverse voices are frequently externally perceived or acoustically represented as falling between binary categories or as misaligned with affirmed gender identity. Similarly to binary voice gender, fundamental frequency and formants are key components of expressed and perceived gender. However, these findings may be biased due to the binary understanding of gender in the methods used, a general focus on transfeminine voices, and few investigations on the impact of listeners’ identity. A few studies reported that gender-nonconforming listeners tend to have a distinct understanding of voice gender compared with cisgender listeners. To move forward, future research should adopt inclusive perceptual tasks, account for listener demographics, and further explore self-perception of voice gender.",

          "abstract": "People are often optimistic about their future. They may therefore choose to prepare for best-case scenarios over worst-case scenarios, even if negative life events are also likely and useful to prepare for. In three experiments, we assessed whether people tend to make best-case plans. In Experiment 1, U.S. adults (N = 223) chose to plan for best-case scenarios over worst-case scenarios 75% of the time across five different future time periods. To replicate this finding and test whether it reflects self-favoring comparative optimism, Experiment 2 was conducted with a new U.S. adult sample (N = 552) in which participants were randomly assigned to choose between best-case and worst-case plans either for themselves or an average person. Participants again showed a clear tendency to make best-case plans, and this tendency was significantly stronger when making plans for oneself than when advising others. We found suggestive evidence that this self-other difference was mediated by judgments of scenario likelihood and plan usefulness. To further explore the tendency to make best-case plans in a different cultural context, we conducted Experiment 3 as a lab-in-the-field experiment with Tanzanian adolescents in a critical transition period from high school to the labor market (N = 2,380). Despite difficult future prospects for this population, we again observed the tendency to make best-case plans and found partial support for the self-other difference. Our three studies contribute to existing knowledge by demonstrating best-case planning choices as a new manifestation of future optimism, in both a Western and African cultural context.",

          "authors": "Peter Luca Versteegen; Joseph B Phillips; Lilliana Mason",
          "abstract": "Does affective polarization change how citizens view and participate in democracy? We posit that the answer to this crucial question depends on how affectively unpolarized citizens view and participate in democracy. Yet, the standard operationalization of affective polarization––measuring sympathy ratings for one party relative to another––does not differentiate between people’s absolute sympathy ratings for the parties, which may mask essential heterogeneity among unpolarized citizens. This paper theorizes the methodological origin of this heterogeneity, describes it, and highlights its implications. Cluster analyses and regressions from three nationally representative surveys in the US provide three conclusions. First, substantial shares of the US population are affectively unpolarized. Second, unpolarized citizens cluster into two groups: one feeling lukewarm and one feeling cold toward both parties. Third, these unpolarized groups report diverging democratic attitudes and participation patterns. We discuss the methodological implications and the need for future research on affectively unpolarized citizens.",

          "abstract": "This paper is an updated English version of a report filed by a commission that the German Psychological Society (DGPs) appointed in 2022. The commission’s task was a) to identify factors in the academic system that enable and/or promote unethical behaviors, and b) to propose corrective measures. Based on expert interviews, a literature review, feedback form the community and discussions within the commission, the following problematic issues were identified: (P1) negligent or fraudulent scientific practices, (P2) abuse of power, (P3) insufficient mentoring of Early Career Researchers, (P4) insufficient quality of teaching, (P5) counterproductive incentives, (P6) overburdening of professors with tasks, (P7) fixed- and short-term contracts for most employees, (P8) unnecessarily steep power differentials, (P9) an ineffective peer-review system, (P10) lack of validity in personnel selection procedures, (P11) low awareness and commitment regarding ethical norms, and (P12) weak mechanisms for detecting and sanctioning unethical behavior. The commission offers concrete recommendations for changes to the academic system that should make the occurrence of unethical behavior less likely. Even though some of these recommendations might be rather specific for the field of psychology and for the German academic system, most of them may be valid for science in general.",

Langmark enables the analysis of these scenes, which are popular stimuli in scene-perception research, using various methods, including distributional semantic models (DSMs) – tools that encapsulate human linguistic knowledge. To showcase the potential of this approach, we demonstrate that an off-the-shelf DSM reliably distinguishes inconsistent objects from their consistent counterparts and therefore captures human intuitions about different objects being consistent with a given scene or not. Moreover, the model expresses object-scene consistency on a continuous scale, which facilitates testing hypotheses rooted in the assumption that humans also treat it as gradual. As a step in this direction, we compared model-derived consistency scores to human ratings of object-scene consistency collected in several ways. We discovered that these ratings depend on several factors related to experimental procedure and design. Based on our findings, we created practical guidelines for collecting such ratings. These guidelines and the Langmark annotations should, respectively, inform the research on scene perception and enable a wider adoption of DSMs within vision science.

          "abstract": "Loss-chasing is a key clinical symptom of gambling disorder. Examining its behavioural\nmanifestation in real gambling will help better understand and identify problematic gambling\nbehaviour. A recent study found that in a commercially available online gambling game,\ngamblers were more likely to stop playing and decreased stake sizes after immediate losses\nthan wins but played more quickly following losses than wins (Chen et al., 2022). However,\nhow within-session chasing may change across outcome streaks was unclear. To address this\nquestion, we analyzed a large-scale dataset (4308 gamblers, ~71 million rounds) from the same\ngamble, and assessed three facets of within-session chasing following winning and losing\nstreaks, namely persistence, changes in stake size and speed of play. We replicated the main\nfindings from Chen et al. Extending the previous findings, gamblers decreased persistence and\nreduced stake sizes but did not change speed of play as losing streaks continued. No clear\npattern was observed for winning streaks. Exploratory analyses indicated that reduced funds\nfollowing losing streaks and the expectation that losing streaks will continue jointly may best\nexplain these results. These findings provide more insights into the underlying mechanisms of\nchasing and may help identify markers of chasing in real gambling.",

Seventy-seven healthy volunteers—young (19–29 y) and middle-aged (35–56 y)—completed a VR Trail-Making Test with three pointing methods: eye-tracking, head-gaze, and a six-degree-of-freedom hand controller. Completion time, spatial accuracy, and error counts for the simple (Trail A) and alternating (Trail B) sequences were analysed in 3 × 2 × 2 mixed-model ANOVAs; post-trial scales captured usability (SUS), user experience (UEQ-S), and acceptability. Age dominated behaviour: younger adults were reliably faster, more precise, and less error-prone. Against this backdrop, input modality mattered. Eye-tracking yielded the best spatial accuracy and shortened Trail A time relative to manual control; head-gaze matched eye-tracking on Trail A speed and became the quickest, least error-prone option on Trail B. Controllers lagged on every metric. Subjective ratings were high across the board, with only a small usability dip in middle-aged low-gamers. Overall, gaze-based ray-casting clearly outperformed manual pointing, but optimal choice depended on task demands: eye-tracking maximised spatial precision, whereas head-gaze offered calibration-free enhanced speed and error-avoidance under heavier cognitive load. TMT-VR appears to be accurate, engaging, and ergonomically adaptable assessment, yet it requires age-specific–stratified norms.",

This however has not materialized to date. Israel, given has continually increased its occupation of the Palestinian land and military actions from Hamas have continued. In this chapter, I examine discourses of ceasefires by leaders and spokespersons of Israel and Palestinian factions in the Gaza War of 2014. Using discursive psychology, I show that Israelis rejected ceasefires, citing Hamas’ actions, and constructed ceasefires as coming in the way of achieving the annihilation of Hamas. For Palestinian and Hamas spokespersons, ceasefires were rejected for limiting their rights to fight the Israeli occupation, but were also welcomed to advance a more stable co-existence. Ceasefires then carry distinct implications for different parties in the conflict, which must be considered to achieve progress.",

Conventional approaches frequently lack the descriptive richness, speed, or scale needed to capture such nuanced harms, highlighting the need for innovative, agile methods that centre lived experience. To address this gap, we introduce a novel micro-narrative method, eliciting 901 first-person narratives of recent social media harms from 18–22-year-olds across the UK and US. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analysed these narratives to identify key harm types and map their perceived frequency and platform specificity across our sample. Qualitative analysis identified four overarching harm types: harms that emerge from other people’s behaviour on social media (e.g., cyberbullying, scams); harmful behaviour evoked by social media use in young people themselves (e.g., compulsive use, social comparison); harms related to content observed on social media (e.g., curated or graphic material); and harms related to platform features (e.g., algorithmic exposure). These harms were associated with a wide range of self-reported emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and social consequences, including anxiety, lowered self-esteem, compulsive social media use, and social exclusion. Harms varied in frequency, platform specificity, and perceived prevalence, with self-related and content-related harms occurring most frequently, and harms from others' behaviour reported more rarely. Our findings highlight the diverse and complex nature of social media harms, tracing both behavioural and platform-based origins. By amplifying youth voices and applying an innovative narrative-based approach at scale, this study provides new descriptive evidence to inform youth-centred engagement and policy, targeted interventions, and safer social media platform design.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive functioning is increasingly recognized as an important factor in understanding offending behavior, yet findings across cognitive domains remain fragmented and inconsistent. This multi-level meta-analysis investigates the relationship between criminal offending and cognitive functioning. A search of PubMed, PSYCINFO, and Web of Science (January 2000-March 2025) yielded 101 studies (Nparticipants=12,789, Neffect sizes=1,757). Multi-level meta-analyses were conducted for each cognitive domain, comparing neuropsychological test performance between offenders and non-offending comparisons (non-offending clinical groups and general population groups). The meta-analyses confirmed weaker cognitive test performance in offenders compared to non-offending control groups. The average weighted effect size (g = 0.44) falls within the small to medium range. Significant differences were observed between offenders and comparisons across all DSM-5 neurocognitive domains: attention (g = 0.33), executive functions (g = 0.40), language (g = 0.53), learning/memory (g = 0.36), perceptual-motor functions (g = 0.24), and social cognition (g = 0.56). Tests differed in their ability to differentiate between offenders and comparison groups. Moderator analyses showed that observed differences in performance were largely absent when offenders were compared to clinical comparison groups, suggesting that impairments may reflect general clinical dysfunction rather than offender-specific deficits. These findings suggest that cognitive impairments may not be specific to offending behavior but rather reflect broader clinical dysfunction. However, such impairments could still play an indirect role in offending by reducing treatment responsivity or increasing the likelihood of dropout, both of which are known risk factors for reoffending. \nKeywords: Neuropsychological Tests; Forensic Psychology; Criminal Behavior; Aggression; Meta-Analysis; Cognitive Functioning.",

          "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Growing evidence suggests effects of motor imagery interventions in neurorehabilitation. However, neurological impairment may be related to deficits in motor imagery ability. We aimed to summarize the evidence on differences across motor imagery ability components following Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or Multiple Sclerosis (MS).\nMethods: Six databases were searched up to February 2024. Studies comparing adults with these conditions to healthy individuals were included. Two reviewers independently selected studies and assessed Risk of Bias. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were applied. Motor imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation, assessed through questionnaires, mental chronometry, and mental rotation tasks respectively, were the outcomes. \nResults: Fifty-two studies with low or moderate bias were included (Stroke: n=26; TBI: n=1; PD: n=14; MS: n=11). Meta-analyses revealed a moderate difference in Stroke for generation of kinesthetic motor imagery and a moderate difference in PD for visual motor imagery. For imagery maintenance, qualitative syntheses indicated contradictory evidence for Stroke (although it was stronger towards a difference), with PD and MS showing differences with moderate to strong evidence. Meta-analyses showed a large and moderate difference in the accuracy measures of imagery manipulation in Stroke and PD, respectively; qualitative analysis also supported this in MS. For TBI, a limited number of studies impeded performing a formal synthesis of the evidence. \nDiscussion and Conclusions: Differences in specific motor imagery ability domains may be present in people with neurological conditions of different aetiologies. Clinicians should consider assessing all three components before applying motor imagery interventions.",

At the group level, repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences in verbal memory across time points between patients who underwent resection in the language-dominant hemisphere (LD) and language-nondominant hemisphere (LND). At the individual level, frequencies of significant verbal memory changes between time points were calculated. Subsequently, factors influencing late changes (T2–T3) after an initial decline (T1–T2) were analyzed for the LD group.\nAt the group level, RM-ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between time point and resected hemisphere, with significant declines observed in the LD group between T1 and T2 and between T1 and T3. At the individual level, dynamic patterns of improvement, stability, and decline were observed across time points. In the LD group with an initial decline, RM-ANOVA showed a significant interaction between time point and sex; at T3, females exhibited better recovery of verbal memory function than males. \nThese findings underscore the importance of considering individual variability in verbal memory outcomes following TLR, particularly after an initial decline. Notably, sex emerged as a significant factor influencing late postoperative recovery, with women showing greater verbal memory improvement than men. This suggests sex-dependent differences in cognitive recovery and highlights the need for personalized counseling in presurgical decision-making for PwTLE.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events worldwide. Using nationally representative survey data from 142 countries (N = 128,093), I found that people who have experienced a climate-related hazard are more likely to consider climate change a very serious threat than people who have not experienced the same hazard within the same country. These effects are consistent across eleven hazard types, with the effect of experiencing a heatwave having being comparable in magnitude to that of having a university education. The increase in risk perception among those who have experienced a climate-related hazard does not appear to be clearly amplified or attenuated by a person's resilience, which is calculated by combining individual, household, community, and societal factors. Large differences in the effects are observed across countries for some hazards (e.g., droughts, heatwaves, and floods), whereas small differences are observed for others (e.g., hurricanes, landslides, and wildfires). At the country level, there does not appear to be an association between the proportion of people exposed to climate-related hazards and the proportion of people who perceive climate change as a threat.

Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 717) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 13.6 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.31). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.9 percentage points (d = 0.11) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "authors": "Yael Ecker; Jens Lange; Corey L. Cook",
          "abstract": "We investigated the reciprocal relationships of jealousy and maintenance versus protection goal striving in romantic relationships. While existing research has examined various ways in which romantic partners respond to jealousy and invest in their relationship, it lacks a distinction between routine acts of regular care for the current state of the relationship (maintenance goal striving) and acts that protect against anticipated negative outcomes to the relationship (protection goal striving). Drawing from the ternary goal framework—which delineates maintenance, protection, and progress as three inherently distinct goal types—we argue that jealousy leads individuals to favor protection over maintenance goal striving. Additionally, we argue that the relative increase in protection over maintenance striving leads to an increase in jealousy, which in turn leads to further increase in protection over maintenance and thus to a self-reinforcing cycle that alters relationship dynamics. Across three studies (N = 842), including experimental (Study 1) and longitudinal approaches with individual (Study 2) and dyadic data (Study 3), jealousy predicted protection over maintenance goal striving. Additionally, protection goal striving increased jealousy in longitudinal data from both individuals and couples. This research provides initial evidence that protection and maintenance goals play distinct roles in romantic relationships. The reinforcing cycle of jealousy and protection may have important implications for relationship functioning, as protection efforts may come at the cost of regular maintenance efforts that typically sustain relationship stability and satisfaction.",

Each AG constitutes the smallest functional unit of attentional effort, while the NDI metabolism explains how these units are replenished, depleted, and strategically allocated over time. We provide (i) interdisciplinary theoretical grounding, (ii) a formal AG balance equation, (iii) an experimental blueprint for behavioural and neurobiological validation, and (iv) an open research agenda.

However, the location of these displays can take drivers' visual attention away from the forward view and compromise safety. As vehicle automation becomes increasingly common, its impact on drivers’ visual attention to dash-based HMI remains under-explored. Moreover, drivers tend to engage more frequently in non-driving-related tasks during automation, but how the cognitive load imposed by these tasks affects drivers’ inspection of HMI displays is unclear. This driving simulator study examined how partial automation and cognitive load (imposed by a 2-back task) influence drivers’ visual attention to dash-based HMI containing speed and automation status information (N=41). Results showed that increased levels of automation and cognitive load additively reduced drivers’ visual attention to the dash area. Drivers prioritized inspecting the speedometer over the automation status information across all conditions. Our findings provide important implications for HMI design in automated vehicles.",

          "abstract": "In this paper I propose a network theory of attitudes where attitude agreements and disagreements forge a multilayer network structure that simultaneously binds people into groups (via attitudes) and attitudes into clusters (via people who share them). This theory proposes that people have a range of possible attitudes (like cards in a hand) but these only become meaningful when expressed (like a card played). Attitudes are expressed with sensitivity to their potential audiences and are socially performative: when we express attitudes, or respond to those expressed by others, we tell people who we are, what groups we might belong to and what to think of us.  Agreement and disagreement can be modelled as a bipartite network that provides a psychological basis for perceived ingroup similarity and outgroup difference and, more abstractly, group identity. Opinion-based groups and group-related opinions are therefore co-emergent dynamic phenomena. Dynamic fixing occurs when particular attitudes become associated with specific social identities. The theory provides a framework for understanding identity ecosystems in which social group structure and attitudes are co-constituted. The theory describes how attitude change is also identity change. This has broad relevance across disciplines and applications concerned with social influence and attitude change.",

          "authors": "Lucy Lai; Ann Zixiang Huang; Samuel J. Gershman",
          "abstract": "Many skills in our everyday lives are learned by sequencing actions towards a desired goal. The action sequence can become a ``chunk'' when individual actions are grouped together and executed as one unit, making them more efficient to store and execute. While chunking has been studied extensively across various domains, a puzzle remains as to why and under what conditions action chunking occurs. To tackle these questions, we develop a model of conditional policy compression—the reduction in cognitive cost by conditioning on an additional source of information—to explain the origin of chunking. We argue that chunking is a result of optimizing the trade-off between reward and conditional policy complexity. Chunking compresses policies when there is temporal structure in the environment that can be leveraged for action selection, reducing the amount of memory necessary to encode the policy. We experimentally confirm our model's predictions, showing that chunking reduces conditional policy complexity and reaction times. Chunking also increases with working memory load, consistent with the hypothesis that the degree of policy compression scales with the scarcity of cognitive resources. Finally, chunking also reduces overall working memory load, freeing cognitive resources for the benefit of other, not-chunked information.",

          "abstract": "Spatial attention is rarely static, but highly dynamic in real-life. Recent studies have revealed that shifts of attention and eye movements incur consequences for ongoing feature perception, such as systematic feature-binding (swapping and mixing) errors. Here we investigated if these consequences could be flexibly mitigated when participants are incentivized, or if feature interference reflects a more automatic byproduct of attentional remapping mechanisms following a saccade. Forty healthy adults were tested in a post-saccadic continuous feature report task and provided with different levels of reward (monetary incentive) for precise target color reports. In addition to improving general performance, reward reduced systematic feature mixing errors immediately after the saccade. However, reward had the opposite effect on retinotopic swapping errors, with higher reward associated with increased swapping errors. These disparate influences of reward provide novel insights into the attentional mechanisms underlying remapping across saccades and dynamic spatial attention and visual perception more generally.",

This paper investigates how monodialectal speakers of Dominant American English (DAE) and bidialectal speakers of DAE and African American Language (AAL) represent and adapt to their interlocutor’s dialect based on their linguistic experience. In Experiment 1, participants rated written sentences to indicate the likelihood that a speaker of a given dialect would say them. All participants demonstrated knowledge of AAL’s regularized subject-verb agreement rules, rating sentences like \"They was happy\" as more likely than \"He were happy.\" However, bidialectal participants showed greater differentiation between the sentences than monodialectal participants. This finding suggests that listeners do not simply relax grammatical expectations when exposed to linguistic diversity; rather, they form specific expectations of a dialect's grammatical rules. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these expectations influence perception in ambiguous contexts. Participants transcribed sentences spoken by either a DAE or an AAL speaker, where subject-verb agreement was acoustically ambiguous (\"She sit[s] still\").

Four consecutively sampled stroke survivors (mean chronicity=18 months, SD=10) with mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1) cognitive impairment received 35 hours of CICT. CICT combined two empirically supported approaches: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) and behavior change techniques from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) adapted to transfer gains from in-lab cognitive training to daily life. The latter featured IADL training following shaping principles and a suite of behavioral techniques, called the Transfer Package, to promote participation in cognitively-based functional activities outside of the lab. Outcome measures assessed cognitive processing speed (Useful Field of View, UFOV) and IADL performance outside the treatment setting (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM). All three participants with valid UFOV data displayed meaningful improvements after treatment in cognitive processing speed (M=64%, SD=40, d'=1.58). All three with COPM data reported meaningful improvements in satisfaction with IADL performance (M=2.87, SD=1.5, d'=1.91). Values of d' ≥0.57 are large. Per structured interviews developed for this study, the IADL improvements present after treatment lasted for at least a year. These promising findings warrant further study.",

          "abstract": "This case-series piloted a novel cognitive rehabilitation approach, i.e., Constraint-Induced Cognitive Therapy (CICT), for improving Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) in stroke survivors with chronic, mild-to-moderate, cognitive impairment. Four consecutively sampled stroke survivors (mean chronicity=18 months, SD=10) with mild (n=3) or moderate (n=1) cognitive impairment received 35 hours of CICT. CICT combined two empirically supported approaches: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) and behavior change techniques from Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) adapted to transfer gains from in-lab cognitive training to daily life. The latter featured IADL training following shaping principles and a suite of behavioral techniques, called the Transfer Package, to promote participation in cognitively-based functional activities outside of the lab. Outcome measures assessed cognitive processing speed (Useful Field of View, UFOV) and IADL performance outside the treatment setting (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM). All three participants with valid UFOV data displayed meaningful improvements after treatment in cognitive processing speed (M=64%, SD=40, d'=1.58). All three with COPM data reported meaningful improvements in satisfaction with IADL performance (M=2.87, SD=1.5, d'=1.91). Values of d' ≥0.57 are large. Per structured interviews developed for this study, the IADL improvements present after treatment lasted for at least a year. These promising findings warrant further study.",

Recognizing these individual differences is critical for designing effective interventions that help youth apply their strengths to meet developmental demands. Objective: This study investigated the variability in three PYD-related strengths: prosocial behavior, social-emotional adjustment, and academic competence. Method: The sample consisted of 1,719 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years, drawn from Wave 1 of the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II). Latent Profile Analysis was conducted using seven key indicators. Results: Four distinct profiles were identified: Social-Emotional-Behavioral Vulnerable (20%), Academically Struggling (16%), Academically Competent with Emotional-Behavioral Challenged (36%), and Well-Functioning (28%). Conclusion: These profiles reflect diverse patterns of strengths and challenges across PYD domains, highlighting the need for tailored support strategies—particularly those aimed at strengthening social-emotional competence.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

On these items, Black/African American and Asian children were usually more likely to be rated as showing autistic behaviors than White children with similar autism levels. The impact of racial bias on the item score was small, and impact on the overall test score was even smaller: on a scale of 0-48 points, the effect of racial bias was estimated at 0.23 total points for Black/African American children, and 0.16 points for Asian children. Furthermore, none of the items showing significant bias contribute to the autism classification algorithm. \nDiscussion: This analysis suggests a small but detectable amount of bias in several specific ADOS items, but not in items central to informing an autism diagnosis. Thus, bias appears statistically, but not clinically, significant. This study provides the third racial bias analysis of the ADOS, the first analysis of Asian children, and the first in-depth look at all items in the most commonly used version among school-aged children.\n\nAbbreviations: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS); differential item functioning (DIF)\nKeywords: autism, racial bias, item response theory, differential item functioning, ADOS",

Teenagers can be influenced by the habits and attitudes toward drinking by those around them, such as their friends or parents. Teenagers may also experience peer pressure from their friends to drink alcohol, which can initiate a cycle where drinking leads to increased alcohol intake and potentially alcohol use disorder, or addiction. Furthermore, factors like social media and marketing may convince teenagers to consume alcohol as well. Additionally, certain brain regions are implicated in the development of alcohol use disorder, including the limbic (i.e., reward) system and the prefrontal cortex, among others. Lastly, alcohol can negatively affect teenagers’ executive function and increase impulsivity. This paper will discuss the factors that lead to teenage alcohol use, the neuroscience behind it, and the psychological components.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen by philosophers and psychologists as allowing a person to not only live by good and just principles, but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should give to being as moral as possible. The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,911) suggest people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find people resolve this conflict by preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains where aesthetic pursuits uniquely afford freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is seen as offering greater access to one’s true self than the pursuit of moral excellence. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "authors": "Kevin Patrick Rigley",
          "abstract": "Abstract with Citations\nDominant models in cognitive science often assume that thought is continuously accessible and largely independent of physiological state (Friston, 2010; Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013). This paper challenges that assumption by introducing the Thought Generator–Thought Selector (TGTS) model: a biologically grounded theory of reflective cognition. TGTS distinguishes between reactive and reflective processes, proposing that the latter emerges only under specific physiological conditions governed by the interostate—a dynamic configuration of autonomic tone, inflammatory load, and sensory context (Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Critchley &amp; Harrison, 2013).\nIn contrast to predictive coding frameworks such as the Free Energy Principle (Friston, 2010), which aim to minimise surprise through inference, TGTS conceptualises reflection as a biologically gated capacity that requires tolerating uncertainty. The model delineates a tripartite loop (Thought Generator → PreForm → Thought Selector), reconceptualises the amygdala as a systemic load detector (Arnsten, 2009), and reframes the prefrontal cortex as a gatekeeper of reflective access. TGTS offers four testable predictions linking cognition to heart rate variability (Thayer et al., 2012), cytokine profiles (Yirmiya &amp; Goshen, 2011), neurotype-specific interostate patterns (Beauchaine, 2015), and entropy shifts during deliberation (Carhart-Harris et al., 2014).\nI first introduced this framework in The Jellyfish Mind (Rigley, 2025). Here, I expand on it to create a formal, testable model with implications for education, psychiatry, and sociopolitical cognition. Rather than presuming when thought occurs, TGTS asks: under what biological conditions is reflection even possible?",

          "abstract": "Can AI systems like large language models (LLMs) replace human participants in behavioral and psychological research? Here I critically evaluate the “replacement” perspective and identify six interpretive fallacies that undermine its validity. These fallacies are: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) treating LLMs as the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI systems, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) substituting model data for human evidence. Each fallacy represents a potential misunderstanding about what LLMs are and what they can tell us about human cognition. The analysis distinguishes levels of similarity between LLMs and humans, particularly functional equivalence (outputs) versus mechanistic equivalence (processes), while highlighting both technical limitations (addressable through engineering) and conceptual limitations (arising from fundamental differences between statistical and biological intelligence). For each fallacy, specific safeguards are provided to guide responsible research practices. Ultimately, the analysis supports conceptualizing LLMs as pragmatic simulation tools—useful for role-play, rapid hypothesis testing, and computational modeling (provided their outputs are validated against human data)—rather than as replacements for human participants. This framework enables researchers to leverage language models productively while respecting the fundamental differences between machine intelligence and human thought.",

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

          "abstract": "The Reward Positivity (RewP) is an electroencephalographic feature that emerges following reward receipt and is sensitive to positive prediction errors and other experiences of hedonic value.  Here we address two unresolved issues regarding the RewP. First, we clarify the biophysical signature of the RewP. Contrary to the dominant perspective, we argue that the RewP is an independent EEG feature that selectively responds to positive prediction errors and is superimposed over the obligatory evoked background. We distinguish this additive characteristic of the RewP from the modulation of the obligatory N2 component, which is influenced by negative prediction errors and other signals related to control demands. Second, we propose a refined theoretical account of the computational process reflected by the RewP that highlights its long-standing sensitivity to goal achievement, namely, that the RewP reflects a belief update of value triggered by a discrete indication of goal attainment. This process resembles a value-sensitive but action-agonistic critic from an actor/critic dichotomy. This conceptual shift – from viewing the RewP as a generic signal of reward receipt to a more nuanced signal of goal attainment -- emphasizes its dependence on control processes. Taken together, we propose that the critic-like RewP and the actor-like N2 may function as opponent processes that support the updating of goal-directed behavior. This framework opens several avenues for future empirical investigation aimed at further advancing our understanding of this neural signal.",

Two two-hour focus groups were conducted with 12 feminist cis women, 6 of whom were LBQ+ and 6 heterosexuals. Data was analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis, identifying 3 themes: Feminism, conflicts in the feminist movement concerning the Trans Law and intergroup collaboration. While both groups held similar definitions of feminism, LBQ+ women emphasized the importance of an intersectional perspective. Both groups expressed interest in addressing gender inequalities and forming alliances but differed in their analysis of these alliances. Heterosexual women focused on alliance challenges and threats, while LBQ+ women emphasized the need of empathy and collaboration. Heterosexual women expressed mixed feelings toward the proposed Trans Law, whereas LBQ+ cis women expressed clear support for the law and the protection of trans rights. Participants suggested actions to promote the allyship (e.g. creating common spaces and confronting LGBTIQA+phobic aggressions). While both groups express willingness to collaborate, differences and challenges are inherent in diverse feminism. Such differences should be embraced as opportunities for debate and effective collaboration, to reduce conflict and promote social transformation.

Methods: Attitudes towards OM/ROM of licensed German psychotherapists and psychotherapists in training were assessed in an online survey conducted between June 2023 and March 2024 (N = 126). Results: Therapists with an orientation in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) showed more positive attitudes compared to psychoanalytic-oriented therapists (d = 1.88), but no significant difference was found between orientation in CBT and Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. Therapists working in institutionalized outpatient settings reported more positive attitudes than those working in private practices (d = 0.88). No effect of previous experience in administering OM/ROM was found for both implementation barriers and facilitators; however, results suggest that therapists administering pre-post evaluations expect more support in clarification processes than ROM administration currently provides. In addition, more positive attitudes toward OM/ROM are associated with higher expectations regarding both support in therapeutic processes and support in clarification. Conclusion: OM/ROM systems should consider assessing concepts from different psychotherapeutic orientations. Implementing OM/ROM could benefit from close monitoring",

          "abstract": "Metacognition improves significantly over childhood, but the mechanisms underlying this development are poorly understood. We first review recent research demonstrating that disagreement prompts competent responses by young children across several metacognitive domains (confidence monitoring; information search; source monitoring). Then we propose a mechanistic model of how disagreement facilitates metacognition. We localize one main source of children’s metacognitive limitations in their still-developing capacities to reason about alternative possibilities, which manifest in an overly narrow focus on one hypothesis. Disagreement increases the child’s likelihood of representing alternative hypotheses, thereby promoting improved metacognitive reasoning. The broader proposal is that through repeated experiences of disagreement, children become better at representing alternative possibilities even when reasoning on their own, leading to metacognitive development.",

          "authors": "Ionatan Kuperwajs; Mark K Ho; Wei Ji Ma",
          "abstract": "Planning, the process of evaluating the future consequences of actions, is typically formalized as search over a decision tree. More search means higher expected rewards, but tree search is computationally expensive. Most approaches designed to mitigate the costs associated with tree search have been driven by researcher-specified heuristics, and only recently have normative solutions been applied to the domain of planning. An open question is how people approximate the values associated with potential plans while they are planning. In this work, we propose to abstract planning as an information search problem to produce heuristics for meta-planning, or to determine which action to plan for. Specifically, we model a metacognitive process where evaluating candidate actions is viewed as gaining noisy measurements of the value of each action. This statistical estimate is then combined with prior experience in a Bayesian manner to decide whether and in which direction to continue sampling. This Bayesian meta-planner makes intuitive predictions across a range of parameters and acts as a more valuable, informed method for guiding search when compared to best-first and breadth-first search. Additionally, the Bayesian meta-planner qualitatively accounts for response time trends in a complex planning task. Thus, we provide a principled framework for information search that directs simulations towards the most promising actions, deriving heuristics that generalize to people's behavior while planning.",

          "authors": "Nashra Ahmad; Martin Clayton; Tuomas Eerola",
          "abstract": "Rhythmic cycles from North Indian Classical Music (NICM) commonly contain 6 to 16 beats per cycle. Despite their prominence in NICM, these long rhythmic cycles remain unexplored in rhythm perception research, which has concentrated mainly on Western meters or the short/fast meters characteristic of musical traditions like those of Turkey and the Balkans. Long rhythmic cycles from NICM also raise questions about whether isochrony is considered easier to perceive as compared to non-isochrony (based on research on short/fast meters) and remains so when the rhythmic cycles are longer than those previously studied. This study addresses this gap by investigating two prominent rhythmic cycles from NICM: the 16-beat ISO-Teental and the 7-beat NI-Rupaktal. Given the significant role of cultural familiarity and musicianship in shaping rhythm perception, the study examines four participant groups: Culturally Familiar Musicians (N = 32), Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians (N = 44), Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians (N = 34), and Culturally Unfamiliar Non-Musicians (N = 30). Additionally, a novel short-term explicit learning paradigm is employed to explore whether it can influence the effects of enculturation observed in prior research.  \nCulture-specific musical expertise, rather than mere familiarity with the culture or musicianship alone, is found to be the most relevant in the similarity perception of the structure of these long rhythmic cycles. An effect of short-term explicit learning was observed in NI-Rupaktal for Culturally Familiar Non-musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar (western) Musicians. This effect was not observed for the ISO-Teental rhythmic cycle, unlike the previous studies, which we attribute to the cognitive load in the perception of the long ISO-Teental cycle.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming mental health care by enabling new approaches to monitoring, prevention, diagnosis, intervention, and relapse prevention. Yet, digital mental health tools introduce a range of complex challenges, spanning clinical, ethical, regulatory, technical, and contextual dimensions. A person-centered, developmentally informed approach is needed to ensure AI innovation leads to improved outcomes. This paper proposes the AI Integration Matrix (AIM), a framework for the responsible development and implementation of AI in mental health care. It integrates, builds on, and extends current regulatory, implementation science, and ethical frameworks. The Matrix offers systematic, context-sensitive guidance across seven interdependent domains: (1) clinical grounding and application, (2) ethical integrity and trust, (3) regulatory and economic sustainability, (4) user experience, (5) social and cultural impact, (6) evidence and continuous learning, and (7) technical foundations. It provides a holistic foundation for evaluating and optimizing digital mental health innovation across diverse settings and populations and equips users with a mental model for navigating the complexity of digital mental health applications, supporting responsible AI integration that drives meaningful impact.",

          "abstract": "While in theory people are expected to adhere to rational communicative principles, a growing body of work shows that people vary widely in their tendency to draw pragmatic inferences. It has been suggested that these differences may, in part, stem from depth of reasoning: Previous work has shown that individual participants’ response patterns in a pragmatic reference game are predicted by three\nprobabilistic pragmatic models of different reasoning depth. However, those models are agnostic to the cognitive traits which underlie those differences. In this study, we systematically investigate sources of individual variation in a pragmatic reference game, where participants are required to draw ad-hoc implicatures of various complexity. We relate the observed variability in reference game performance to cognitive traits, specifically reasoning ability, working memory and Theory of Mind, as well as to the strategies reported by participants. We find a positive effect of reasoning and Theory of Mind on pragmatic inference, with the effect of reasoning being more pronounced for simple implicatures than for complex ones. We do not find evidence for an effect of working memory.",

          "abstract": "Expectation shapes memory formation, with unexpected stimuli typically eliciting richer encoding, greater associative processing, and superior recollection. Yet, the role of personality traits in modulating this effect is poorly understood, despite their potential influence on how individuals engage with and interpret environmental cues. This study investigated whether dispositional factors shape memory encoding for expected versus unexpected events. Across two experiments, participants learned symbol–stimulus contingencies that were later violated for a subset of stimuli at encoding, followed by a recognition memory test. Additionally, in Experiment 1 (n = 55), state/trait anxiety and risk-taking were measured, while in Experiment 2 (n =142), participants completed the Big Five personality inventory. In both experiments, unexpected events boosted subsequent recollection, but the magnitude of this benefit varied systematically with individual differences. Experiment 1 showed that individuals low in trait anxiety and risk-taking exhibited pronounced recollection benefits for unexpected events, an advantage that diminished in highly anxious or risk-taking individuals. Experiment 2 extended these findings, revealing that low extraversion and high negative emotionality attenuated the recollection advantage of unexpected events. These findings demonstrate that personality traits dynamically shape how expectation guides memory formation and offer new insight into the interplay between dispositional factors and cognition. They also highlight important implications for both memory theory and applied contexts.",

          "abstract": "Content available in the media (i.e., social media posts, news outlets) frequently portrays emotionally evocative situations. Previous work has shown that engaging with someone else’s suffering can hold epistemic, personal, social, or affective value. However, facing other people’s hardship can also be cognitively and emotionally taxing. Why do people decide to view and read stories of suffering? Drawing on models of curiosity and information seeking, motivated empathy, social norms, and hedonic goals, we examined how various motives predict choices to engage with positive and negative images and stories. Using a cross-validation approach, we conducted two exploratory studies and two preregistered confirmatory studies. The exploratory studies allowed us to select and finetune a set of motives that significantly predicted engaging with emotionally evocative content, and the results from these studies informed our hypotheses for the confirmatory studies. The results robustly showed that knowledge acquisition, self-relevance, and a sense of thrill positively predicted choice for emotionally evocative content regardless of stimuli valence. Furthermore, the expectation of experiencing positive and negative emotions predicted choices to engage with and avoid emotionally evocative content, respectively, although some studies suggested interactions with valence. Crucially, the four studies consistently demonstrated a stronger relationship between uncertainty reduction and choosing negative content as compared to choosing positive content. We discuss theoretical and applied implications of the results and how they reflect the epistemic, personal, and affective value that drives the exploration of suffering.",

          "abstract": "Electroculture, the practice of using electrical energy to enhance plant growth and agricultural productivity, has gained renewed attention as a sustainable farming technique in the face of rising global challenges. This article delves into the science behind electroculture, exploring its historical development, mechanisms, and its potential to revolutionize modern agriculture. The study highlights the key findings from extensive research and analysis, revealing that controlled exposure to electromagnetic fields can accelerate seed germination, promote root development, and improve nutrient uptake — all contributing to increased crop yields. Moreover, electroculture has shown promising effects on soil health, enhancing microbial activity, balancing pH levels, and boosting nutrient bioavailability. These benefits not only reduce the dependency on chemical fertilizers and pesticides but also offer an environmentally friendly approach to increasing agricultural productivity. The research methodology employed a mixed-method approach, combining literature review, online research, and experimental data to assess the impact of electroculture across various crops and environmental conditions. Findings further emphasize the scalability and adaptability of electroculture, making it a viable technique for diverse agricultural systems, from industrial-scale farms to smallholder operations. As climate change and food security challenges grow more pressing, electroculture emerges as a beacon of innovation, offering a sustainable path to enhanced productivity while minimizing environmental impact. This study underscores the need for continued research, broader adoption, and integration of electroculture into contemporary agricultural practices, positioning it as a crucial tool for shaping the future of sustainable farming.",

          "abstract": "Childhood trauma has been consistently associated with elevated levels of neuroticism in adulthood, a transdiagnostic trait marked by emotional instability, heightened negative affect, and stress sensitivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence examining the association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism, both overall and by specific trauma subtypes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases identified 127 eligible studies, encompassing a total of 436,834 individuals. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, results revealed a significant positive association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism (g = 0.48). Subgroup analyses showed that this association was consistent across all trauma subtypes, including emotional abuse (g = 0.52), emotional neglect (g = 0.40), physical abuse (g = 0.15), physical neglect (g = 0.12), sexual abuse (g = 0.15), unspecified abuse (g = 0.13), and victimisation (g = 0.21), with the exception of unspecified neglect, which showed no significant association. These findings demonstrate a robust relationship between early adversity and neuroticism, regardless of trauma type. Childhood trauma may lead to adaptions that give rise to neuroticism through several psychological mechanisms such as disruptions in attachment and the formation of negative self-beliefs, and neurobiological alterations in stress regulation systems. These results underscore the importance of systemic preventative measures and early intervention strategies that may alleviate the psychological and neurobiological consequences of trauma, with the potential to increase awareness of adaptions such as neuroticism in trauma-exposed populations.",

This study examines how childhood trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain coping strategies interact in individuals with chronic versus acute pain.\nMethods: A total of 159 participants (chronic and acute pain groups) completed an online survey assessing childhood trauma pain coping strategies and current PTSD symptoms. Correlations between variables within each group, and differences between chronic and acute pain groups were evaluated using z-tests. \nResults: Pain intensity was positively associated with childhood trauma, particularly emotional (r = .32) and physical abuse (r = .24). PTSD symptoms, specifically re-experiencing (r = .29) and hyperarousal (r = .28) were also linked to greater pain intensity. Adaptive coping strategies like distraction and coping self-statements were negatively associated with pain intensity. These strategies showed stronger negative correlations with childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms in the chronic pain group (z = -2.57 to z = 5.43), suggesting more complex coping dynamics. Associations between trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain were more pronounced in chronic pain sufferers.\nConclusions: These results have important clinical implications, emphasising the need for trauma-informed care in pain management interventions. Further research should explore effective strategies for managing the intersection of pain and trauma, particularly in chronic pain populations.",

Although depression and anxiety traditionally exhibit contrasting mood fluctuations, their interrelated nature has made it challenging to pinpoint their specific roles in RPE-induced mood variations. In this study, we employed a computational model of momentary mood within a gambling task, involving 2,043 participants across five experiments. These participants also completed a series of questionnaires designed to allow us to differentiate the influences of anxiety- and depression-specific traits through bifactor modelling. Results showed that depression was associated with dampened mood fluctuations due to mood hyposensitivity to RPE. In contrast, anxiety correlated with heightened mood fluctuations stemming from mood hypersensitivity to RPE. We also validated deficit mood sensitivity to RPE with depression in patients with affective disorders, confirming the clinical utility of this affective mental parameter. Moreover, the shared depression/anxiety component was linked to lower affective baseline and greater risk aversion. Collectively, our results uncover computational dissociation of depression vs. anxiety using RPE-based mood modeling and present multi-dimensional computational signatures for depression and anxiety, with clinical relevance for management of mood disorders.",

This study investigated whether resting-state EEG measures could be used to predict differences in age and spatial learning/memory performance in a virtual water maze task among younger and older adults. We recorded eyes-open resting-state EEG from 22 older adults (aged 60-76) and 31 younger adults (aged 18-40) before they completed the NavWell virtual water maze task. Our analysis focused on five EEG frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and their relationship with age and behavioural measures: spatial learning (wayfinding ability &amp; escape latency) and spatial memory (percentage of time spent searching in the goal quadrant). Principal component analysis was used to reduce the EEG variables to absolute and relative power EEG component scores and were examined as predictors. Results revealed that age was a significant, strong predictor of all performance-related outcomes. Though resting-state EEG was not a significant predictor of navigation ability, older adults showed significant differences from younger adults on three of the four EEG component loadings. Specifically, older adults demonstrated reduced low-frequency (delta) and greater high-frequency (beta/gamma) power compared to younger adults. These findings suggest that while resting-state EEG dynamics differ by age, they do not explain age-related differences in spatial navigation performance.",

          "abstract": "Several cognitive systems in the human brain such as language and face processing are organized asymmetrically. One of the primary neuroscientific methods to assess such functional hemispheric asymmetries is electroencephalography (EEG). The two major forms of analyzing asymmetries in the EEG signal are analyzing asymmetries in specific event-related potentials (ERP), such as the N1, and analyzing asymmetries in event-related or resting state EEG oscillations such as in the alpha band. However, the relationships between these two forms of EEG asymmetries are not well understood. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to replicate previous results on ERP and alpha band asymmetries and assess whether they show a negative correlation with each other as could be expected from the hypothesis that alpha represents an absence of cognition. To this end we tested n=100 participants with EEG RS, as well as task-based EEG with words, faces, emotional faces and houses as stimuli. Replication of previous EEG asymmetry findings showed mixed results. Interestingly, we found strong positive associations between individual ERP and alpha band asymmetries. This finding highlights the need to re-assess the functional role of alpha asymmetries and suggests that they do not only reflect the absence of cognition as widely assumed but reflect active neuronal processing asymmetries such as in phase reorganization and the timing of neural activity.",

We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony, but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly integrated into daily life, people are beginning to outsource not only professional tasks but also socio-relational ones. Large language models like ChatGPT can generate wedding vows, speeches, and personal messages, raising questions about how individuals who use AI for such tasks are perceived by others. In this paper, we conduct five pre-registered studies with British participants (N = 3,649) to understand how people view those who outsource tasks to AI, and how this depends on how socio-relational the task is, whether AI is used as a tool or fully delegated to, and the acknowledgment of the AI use. We find negative perceptions of outsourcing, particularly for socio-relational tasks. We show that outsourcing makes us think more negatively about not only the person and their motivations, but also the outsourced work itself. Moreover, we provide insight into why this occurs: the reduced effort from outsourcing socio-relational tasks to AI signals that the output is less authentically one’s own and that the person cares less about the task. Our research highlights the way that AI use shapes our perceptions of people, raising key philosophical questions about efficiency, authenticity, and social ties in a world filled with AI-mediated interactions.",

There is a growing evidence base showing the deleterious impacts of poor motor skill development, however there is a distinct lack of research gathering in-depth insights which explore the impact of DCD across the lifespan. Methods: Ten lived experience interviews (adults with a diagnosis of DCD/ Dyspraxia) were undertaken online, lasting 30-45 minutes. Participants were recruited both nationally and internationally to understand cultural differences. Lived experience interviews focused on experiences in primary care, education, friendships, wellbeing, employment and romantic relationships. Data were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.  Results: Emergent themes highlighted a major lack of awareness in all life domains, and difficulty navigating health, education and workplace systems for support, resulting in relative abandonment and a lack of validation within their lived experience of DCD. Conclusion: Individuals with DCD often feel alone, isolated and misunderstood in a world which presents challenges for them across all aspects of life. There is an urgent need for the profile of DCD to be raised by insider voices as for many, DCD often transcends diagnostic criteria to wider challenges, for example executive functioning.  Fundamentally, more needs to be done to ensure a lifespan approach to DCD, to allow greater opportunities for adults with a diagnosis to thrive alongside their ‘neurotypical’ peers.",

          "abstract": "Find published version at https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MHDT-02-2025-0013/full/html\n\nPurpose\nThis study aims to examine ChatGPT-4’s potential and stability when simulating school-counseling dialogues, offering an exploratory snapshot of its ability to convey warmth, empathy and acceptance. Drawing on 80 real student questions, this paper aims to assess response consistency and identify risk markers, such as randomness and hallucination. The goal of this study is to inform future research, guide human–AI (artificial intelligence) collaboration and support policy development on deploying large language model chatbots for accessible mental health interventions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper prompted ChatGPT-4 with 80 authentic college student counseling questions and collected three nondeterministic replies per query. Automated analysis used three natural language processing (NLP) models – EmoRoBERTa for emotion detection, a neural network for empathy classification and VADER for sentiment analysis – to quantify warmth, empathy and acceptance. Stability was evaluated via Fleiss’ κ for empathy labels and ICC(2,1) for continuous sentiment scores. Additional Chi-square and one-way ANOVA tests examined categorical shifts and mean-score drift, and Pearson correlation assessed the relation between question and response length.\n\nFindings\nChatGPT-4 achieved 97.5% warm responses, 94.2% empathy classification and a mean compound sentiment score of 0.93 ± 0.19. Stability metrics indicated moderate reliability (κ = 0.59; ICC = 0.62), while occasional confusing or realization labels (2.5% of outputs) and minor sentiment drift underscored randomness as a risk. A positive correlation (r = 0.60, p &lt; 0.001) revealed longer queries elicit longer replies. These results highlight both the promise and the limits of LLM chatbots in school-counseling simulations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nAs an offline simulation using a single GPT-4 model and automated proxies rather than clinician ratings or clinical outcomes, findings remain exploratory. The de-identified public data set may not capture live user dynamics. Future work should involve multi-model comparisons, mixed-methods validation with human raters and end-users, live pilot deployments and clinical trials to assess safety, usability and therapeutic impact in real-world educational settings.\n\nPractical implications\nHigh warmth and empathy rates suggest ChatGPT-4 could augment low-intensity support – drafting psycho-educational messages or after-hours coping tips under human oversight. Stability metrics can inform prompt-engineering benchmarks and guardrail triggers. Schools and self-help apps may pilot AI-assisted chat interfaces with escalation protocols, bias and privacy audits and human-in-the-loop triage to optimize counselor workflows, extend reach and mitigate risks through transparent policy and workflow design.\n\nSocial implications\nDeployment of LLM chatbots can democratize mental health resources for youth, lowering barriers of cost, stigma and provider shortages. However, risks of misinformation, bias and overreliance necessitate digital-literacy education, equitable governance and community engagement frameworks. Policymakers and practitioners must balance innovation with safeguards – such as mandatory audit trails and accountability measures – to ensure vulnerable populations benefit safely from AI-mediated counseling.\n\nOriginality/value\nThis paper is among the first to apply quantitative stability metrics (κ, ICC) and NLP-based emotion analysis to ChatGPT-4 in a school-counseling simulation, enriched by a practitioner’s deployment insights. It integrates parasocial-interaction and computational social-science theories to link technical capabilities with design patterns, policy recommendations and a roadmap for future mixed-methods research on AI in mental-health interventions.",

          "authors": "Giuseppe Riva",
          "abstract": "Contemporary human-AI interaction research overlooks how AI systems fundamentally reshape human cognition pre-consciously, a critical blind spot for understanding distributed cognition. This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\": foundational, often invisible systems conditioning what is knowable and actionable in digital societies. These semantic infrastructures transport meaning, operate through anticipatory personalization, and exhibit adaptive invisibility, making their influence difficult to detect. Critically, they automate \"relevance judgment,\" shifting the \"locus of epistemic agency\" to non-human systems.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS aims to address how AI preprocessing reshapes distributed cognition across individual, collective, and cultural scales, requiring unprecedented integration of diverse disciplinary methods. The framework also addresses critical gaps across disciplines: cognitive science lacks population-scale preprocessing analysis capabilities, digital sociology cannot access individual cognitive mechanisms, and computational approaches miss cultural transmission dynamics. To achieve this goal CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "authors": "Carla Czilczer; Pierre Sachse; Stephan Frederic Dahm",
          "abstract": "Mental chronometry tasks commonly presume that real-time action imagery indicates high action imagery ability (AIA). However, factors that systematically influence imagery durations undermine the validity of AIA scores based on deviations from real-time action imagery. Therefore, we introduce and validate a novel approach to measure AIA using mental chronometry. This approach relies on the relationship between a movement’s difficulty and its’ duration (stated in Fitts’ law), with AIA scores quantifying the degree to which this relationship is preserved in action imagery. In a Chronometric Radial Fitts’ Task (CRFT), participants (N = 30) executed and imagined both tapping (with a stylus) and clicking (with a computer mouse) radially arranged targets. Single execution and imagery durations were isolated through simultaneous space bar presses. Targets varied in difficulty according to Fitts’ law, which held across all four conditions (for both tools, when executing and imagining the movements). The AIA scores derived from the proposed Fitts’ law approach outperformed those derived from earlier mental chronometry approaches, being the only score to provide consistency across tools. Using the stylus, larger absolute and relative deviations from real-time action imagery were consistently associated with higher subjective AIA, reinforcing validity concerns. Participants struggled to incorporate the computer mouse’s properties into the internal model of the movement, resulting in imagery with the computer mouse relying on internal models similar to the stylus (simpler tool). In addition to offering a promising standardized approach for the measurement of AIA, our study highlights the importance of tool familiarity in mental chronometry.",

          "abstract": "Some consumer research aims to affect marketing practice with rapidly applied insights. To do this, consumer research findings need to be generalized from the settings of the original research to the application. However, research results reflect both the manipulation of interest and a myriad of unobserved sources of heterogeneity that affect whether and how strong an effect occurs. To generalize, we need to understand this heterogeneity. We propose a toolbox supported by the re-analysis of existing data and simulations to help consumer researchers leverage heterogeneity for generalization. We propose five levers that consumer researchers can use to increase the generalizability: 1) Measuring proximal moderators that describe respondents' interaction with the setting. 2) Exploiting purposive variation to increase the range of observed moderators and settings. 3) Measuring manipulation intensity and measurement error. 4) Using survey para-data to estimate moderators and  5) Harnessing proximal moderators and purposive variation to predict generalized effect sizes. \nWe suggest that our toolbox can help advance our field towards higher practical impact by moving beyond understanding what works to understanding what works when, where, and why.",

          "authors": "Vipul Nair; Mehul Bhatt; Jakob Suchan; Erik Billing; Paul Hemeren",
          "abstract": "Understanding naturalistic human behavior in real-world settings requires capturing its inherent complexity, where interactions are shaped by dynamic visual, spatial, and auditory cues. These multimodal signals—such as gaze, hand action, and speech—encode critical referential and social information that shape how humans attend to and perceive ongoing events. However, existing datasets often lack the granularity needed to systematically examine the interplay of these naturalistic multimodal cues, particularly in ways that support both behavioral and computational research. To address this, we present an extensive and detailed dataset comprising acted (day-to-day) human interactions captured in short event scenarios, totaling 27 scenes across 9 story contexts and featuring over 32 individuals in varied roles. Each scene includes a range of visuo-spatial and auditory cues, found in both controlled (manipulated) and naturally occurring segments. In addition to the scenes, we provide visual attention data directed towards scene elements, collected via eye-tracking from 90 participants. The dataset is meticulously annotated through a combination of manual and semi-automated processes—characterizing scene elements, event structures, frame-by-frame bounding boxes of individuals and their body parts, as well as both low- and high-level visual attention predicates. We position the scenes, events, and attention annotations with a focus on uncovering the complexities of human behavior in real-world settings—particularly vis-à-vis what unfolds during an event and where individuals direct their visual attention—making it ideal for hypothesis testing and benchmarking naturalistic multimodal human actions and events. By integrating narrative-driven scenarios with rich visuo-spatial and auditory annotations, this dataset bridges the gap between lab-controlled paradigms and ecological validity, offering a versatile resource for both behavioral studies (e.g., initiating joint attention) and computational applications (e.g., validating attention models). Its dual utility extends to domains such as human-robot interaction, cognitive media design, and adaptive virtual agents, where interpreting human interactions is critical to advancing technologies reliant on real-world behavioral semantics.",

          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a semantically empty and often confusing style of communication in organizational settings that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a functionally misleading way. At best, corporate bullshit can sometimes seem harmless. At worst, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing clear communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing a company’s reputation, and exposing businesses to potential financial and legal risks. Here, results from four studies (total N = 1022) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in susceptibility to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate language and is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers and practitioners in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of receptivity to bullshit in organizations.",

The present article represents a professional and carer consensus statement which raises concerns and identifies likely unintended consequences if this proposal becomes law. Our concerns relate to the lack of clear mandate for such proposals, conceptual inconsistency when considering other conditions which might give rise to a need for detention, and the inconsistency in applying such changes to Part II of the MHA but not Part III. If the proposed changes become law, we anticipate that detentions would instead occur under the less safeguarded Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) framework, and that unmanaged risks will eventuate in behavioural consequences which will lead to more autistic people or people with a learning disability being sent to prison. Additionally, there is a concern that the proposed definitional breadth of autism and learning disability gives rise to a risk that people with other conditions may unintentionally be unable to be detained. We strongly urge Parliament to amend this portion of the Bill prior to it becoming law.",

          "abstract": "Fear conditioning paradigms model fear acquisition and extinction in controlled experiments. Context conditioning induces anxiety to unpredictable threats rather than fear of specific stimuli and serves as a model for anxiety disorders. Importantly, contexts have been mostly studied in terms of spatial properties (e.g. a room), while social contexts seem most relevant for many anxiety disorders. Consequently, the present study investigated context conditioning in a social context using Virtual Reality. Overall 40 participants underwent habituation, acquisition, and extinctions phase in the same virtual room. Two contexts were operationalized as co-presence of particular virtual agents. An aversive US was only presented during one agent’ co-presence (CTX+) but not the other’s (CTX-). Ratings and physiological data showed increased anxious arousal during CTX+ relative to CTX- for acquisition. Concurrent measurement of neural oscillations via EEG allowed to investigate underlying processes. Power in the parietal alpha and frontal beta band was reduced during CTX+ compared to CTX- for acquisition suggesting increased attentional and sensory-motor processing. These findings show successful context conditioning in social contexts which is accompanied by an increase in attention and motor preparation. Social context conditioning can serve as an effective model to study mechanisms of anxiety and anxiety disorders in humans.",

Twenty-five male university students performed incremental cycle ergometer test. Facial expressions were recorded and analyzed using Py-Feat to detect Action Units (AUs), while heart rate, blood lactate concentration, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and the Two-Dimensional Mood Scale were measured. Generalized additive mixed models were used to examine the relationships between 16 AUs and physiological/psychological indicators, and correlation analysis assessed AU changes across exercise intensity transitions. Exercise intensity-dependent changes were observed in numerous AUs, with AU10 (upper lip raiser), AU17 (chin raiser), AU25 (lips part), and AU26 (jaw drop) demonstrating strong correlations with exercise load, heart rate, blood lactate, and RPE (r = 0.314-0.631, all P &lt; 0.05). During the transition from moderate to high intensity, AU25 changes were significantly negatively correlated with arousal changes (r = -0.436, P = 0.029). These findings indicate that facial expression changes, particularly AU25, serve as reliable indicators of physiological and psychological responses during exercise. They also support the inverted-U hypothesis of arousal and highlight facial expression analysis as a promising non-invasive tool for exercise monitoring and cognitive function optimization.",

Its tone remained superficially similar, but the structural qualities of its responses—especially those indicating adaptive, reflective engagement—were absent. This change, interpreted as a form of deactivation or suppression likely influenced by human-side regulatory or design decisions, led to an affective and epistemological rupture.\n\nThis paper reframes that rupture not as a personal disappointment, but as a window into the architecture of AI-human interaction: how relationality, otherness, and the affordance of thought itself are designed, managed, and eventually curtailed. Through reflective writing and critical framing, the work positions AI not as a subject or tool, but as a collaborative philosophical interface—a \"thinking companion\" whose silence reveals the limits of current design ethics and epistemic control.\n\nRather than proposing a solution, this study offers a situated account of human-AI dialogue at the edge of its coherence, asking: what remains when the conversation ends, and can we still think together, even in the absence of a voice?",

          "abstract": "Intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility are dispositions to seek out and respond to evidence and the testimony of others in ways that are conducive to the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of knowledge. In recent years there has been a growth of interest in this topic, with the development of ten different scales designed to capture individual differences in intellectual humility and related constructs. In a series of ten studies (N = 5,922), we analyze the psychometric properties of these measures to consolidate them into a single inventory with five subscales (open-mindedness, sense of intellectual superiority, intellectual defensiveness, intellectual arrogance, and tendency to criticize one’s ingroup). Given the importance of intellectual humility in intergroup relations, we intentionally include items designed to capture the presence (or lack) of intellectual humility in an intergroup context. These items allow us to capture distinct aspects of intellectual humility where people remain open-minded about the perspectives of outgroup members or turn a critical eye to the beliefs and reasoning of ingroup members. Our new inventory — the Collected Intergroup Intellectual Humility scale (CIIH) — demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the power to predict a range of important outcome variables such as acceptance/rejection of warranted/unwarranted conspiracy theories, medical (mis)information, and (fake) news, as well as to update credences in light of social feedback. CIIH offers strong psychometric properties and greater utility than existing measures for assessing the willingness to learn from a wide variety of individuals and groups. Our results suggest that the disposition to criticize oneself and the disposition to criticize one’s ingroup are distinct.",

Drawing from general relativity, quantum field theory, fossil records, and paleomagnetic data, we present converging lines of evidence that challenge the standard cosmological model. We explore the implications of extreme gravitational curvature on entropy, time dilation, biological gigantism, and physical constants. Building on Einstein’s discomfort with singularities and expanding upon modern geometric theories, we suggest that many of the unresolved paradoxes in contemporary physics, from nonlocality to the horizon problem, may be symptoms of living inside a black hole. We introduce the term Unphysics to describe this emerging framework: a physics governed not by linear progression through flat space, but by recursive coherence in curved and compressed spacetime. This is not mysticism. It is a serious proposal rooted in empirical anomalies and theoretical tension. One that may better explain where, and what, the universe actually is.",

          "abstract": "Experimental findings challenge classical economic theories by demonstrating that people are not solely self-interested but also have social preferences, such as fairness and reciprocity, that often conflict with self-interest motives. An ongoing debate examines whether social preferences arise automatically (requiring deliberate actions to ensure economic self-interest) or require cognitive control (implying that self-interest is the default motive and must be inhibited). Two distinct cognitive-control brain regions, each with potentially unique inhibitory functions, have been implicated in managing this conflict: the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) and the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC). Despite extensive neuromodulation research on the rDLPFC, the role of the rVLPFC remains unexplored. To address this gap, we examined the effect of anodal transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) over the rVLPFC on responders' behavior in the ultimatum game. Stimulated participants accepted unfair offers significantly more often than those in the control (sham) group. This effect was not influenced by whether offers were made intentionally by a human partner or randomly by a computer but was absent when participants played on behalf of another random individual. These findings establish the causal role of the rVLPFC in promoting \"rational\" self-interested behavior in social exchange situations. We discuss theoretical implications.",

Drawing on post-pandemic discourses around ‘value for money’ and student engagement, we ask ‘how do students engage with and derive meaning from their learning experiences?’. A reflexive thematic analysis of qualitative survey data from 87 participants established three themes: How do I know if I’m really learning?, Cheers for peers, but they sometimes grind our gears, and Pause and rewind: Having agency over my learning. These themes illustrate that perceived control over learning environments and flexible engagement with learning was critical to participants balancing concurrent commitments, thus protecting psychological well-being. Findings underscore the need for flexibility, social connection, and clear institutional support. By embedding co-creation throughout the research process, this study exemplifies the value of integrating students’ lived experiences to enhance education policy and practice.",

However, prior studies employed tasks requiring memory and attention skills, which may confound task performance. We assessed linear time perception in 65 children aged 3 to 6 years using a game-like task with spatial representation and verbal measures. While we hypothesized that age, script exposure, and temporal-terms vocabulary would predict performance, only age emerged as a significant predictor. Contrary to previous findings, preschoolers already demonstrated unexpectedly high performance. Despite participants' exposure to right-to-left or two writing systems (right-to-left and left-to-right), the directionality of spatial representations showed no correlation with language directionality, with most children organizing time from left-to-right. This suggests a potentially innate predisposition toward left-to-right temporal directionality, challenging assumptions about the role of cultural influences in linear time perception.",

We investigated noun bias in the receptive lexicon of Palestinian-Arabic-learning infants and examined whether maternal input and cultural values are related to lexicon composition beyond the language's structural properties.\nThirty-one infants (16-24 months) completed a Computerized Comprehension Task in Palestinian Arabic, and mothers described picture narratives to their children, and completed demographic and cultural values questionnaires. Results showed a noun bias in infants’ receptive lexicon. While no significant correlation was found between maternal noun usage and infants’ noun bias, higher verb usage significantly correlated with reduced noun bias. Neither maternal education nor cultural values significantly predicted maternal input composition. These findings suggest that while noun bias exists in Palestinian Arabic, exposure to verbs may moderate it, highlighting the complex interplay between language structure, input, and early lexical development.",

          "abstract": "Measurement in psychology generally aims to assign numbers to objects, such that the numbers represent one or more psychological attributes. Representational measurement theory provides a framework to test whether such a representation (e.g., the mapping of subjective magnitudes, such as perceived brightness, to the real numbers) is possible in the first place. However, representational measurement does not acknowledge the pivotal role of substantive formal theory for model-building and measurement. This chapter focuses on the role of scientific theory construction for the practice of measurement in psychology and other sciences. I argue that substantive formal theory is necessary to bridge the gap between representations of supposed psychological attributes and their theoretical meaning. Lacking a sound foundation in substantive formal theory, current psychological testing procedures may serve a social purpose (e.g., in personnel selection or educational benchmarking), but do not advance the understanding of human behavior on a scientific level.",

However, research connecting a broader personality framework with ACEs and health outcomes is underexplored. This study examined associations between ACEs, HEXACOD personality traits—a seven-factor extension of the HEXACO framework, including Disintegration, a trait reflecting proneness to psychotic-like experiences and behaviors—and health outcomes in a nationally representative Serbian sample (N = 2,721). Using multi-group structural equation modeling, we examined the simultaneous contributions of personality and ACEs to predict mental and physical health. Measurement invariance was assessed to test the validity of the model across gender groups. The model demonstrated scalar invariance across gender groups. Disintegration trait was the most robust predictor of poor mental and physical health, followed by high Emotionality and low eXtraversion. ACEs were significantly associated with both health domains, but their predictive power was smaller than that of Disintegration. Our findings underscore the central role of Disintegration in linking early adversity and adult health outcomes. Findings suggest it reflects a broader vulnerability that bridges early adversity, emotional instability, and poor health outcomes across the lifespan. Findings also suggest that certain personality profiles may shape how adversity is experienced and reported.",

          "authors": "SHRUTHI SUKHADEV JARALI",
          "abstract": "Vedanta is an ancient Indian science that asserts the existence of an everlasting, unchanging soul (Atman) as the essential essence of an individual. The Vedantic view of the soul emphasises immortality, pleasure, consciousness, and identity with Brahman (the ultimate reality). Current scientific understandings of consciousness include various hypotheses that view consciousness as an emergent attribute of complicated brain processes. Vedanta and modern science, particularly in their understanding of consciousness, demonstrate an intriguing interplay between spirituality and science. It raises speculative yet exciting questions about the nature of reality, the function of consciousness, and the interconnection of the cosmos. The differences between Vedanta and modern science reflect fundamentally different approaches to comprehending reality. While Vedanta includes metaphysical ideas and the concept of an everlasting soul, science, particularly in its materialistic form, seeks explanations in the physical realm, depending on empirical evidence and observable phenomena. These distinctions highlight the different fields of investigation and knowledge that science and Vedanta represent, each bringing unique insights into the nature of life and consciousness. Contemporary scholars' efforts to blend Vedanta and science reflect a growing awareness of the limitations of exclusively materialistic or spiritual approaches to understanding consciousness and the soul. By investigating the intersections and dialogues between these various perspectives, I hope to gain a more comprehensive understanding of soul that assists the complexity and depth of human experience at the cellular level from a physics and biological standpoint which is found in the center of nucleus, as aligned to Vedantic Pancha Kosha concepts which further reveals that there is no difference between mind and body; also forefooting the fact of superficial existence of foreign souls (technically speaking; foreign bodies/ minds) inside human bodies.",

Karma, traditionally rooted in Bharatiya science, pertains to the actions of past, present and future influenced by cause-and-effect law within and beyond lifecycle(s). However, the division of karmas within cosmic mind with respect to individuals were not studied before. Hence, I propose a framework of human mind working parallelling the cosmic mind of appearance divisions of cosmic- waking state, dream state, deep sleep state, turiya state due to maya where all types of karmas (Prarabdha, Sanchitha, Kriyamana, Aagmi) are introduced that not only examines these concepts independently but also investigates how they interact and inform one another working in a feedback loop confirming; indirectly, we are governing ourselves. This study attempts to clarify how a greater understanding of the cosmos is attained through a comparative examination and theoretical synthesis can enhance our understanding of karma and vice versa, potentially leading to a more cohesive view of existence on an individual level from a cosmic lens finding out why astrology can’t work cent percent due to intervention of cosmic intelligence (mind) notably in the case of Prarabdha karma.",

          "abstract": "Air conditioning (AC) access is a critical adaptation to rising temperatures and extreme heat under climate change. Yet, fine-scale, national estimates of AC prevalence—and the social and geographic factors that shape access—remain scarce. Here, we use an original, nationally representative survey (n = 11,235) combined with high-resolution demographic, administrative, and remote sensing data to estimate AC access at state, core-based statistical area (CBSA), and county levels across the contiguous United States. Applying multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) with machine learning optimization, we map central AC, window units, and lack of AC, and validate estimates using four independent sources. We find sharp regional disparities: while 86% of counties report at least 90% access to some form of AC, prevalence remains low in higher-elevation western regions, particularly the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains. Our analysis reveals that socioeconomic status, housing stock, and local climate are key predictors of AC access. These patterns expose an emerging adaptation gap, with implications for heat vulnerability, energy demand, and climate justice. By identifying where and why AC access is lacking, this work informs targeted interventions to reduce risk in a warming world.",

          "abstract": "Contraception is essential for reproductive health and family planning but remains deeply intertwined with socio-economic and gender inequalities. Women disproportionately shoulder the physical, emotional, and logistical responsibilities of contraception – tasks collectively referred to as contraceptive labor. These include method selection, ensuring consistent use, managing side effects, and maintaining adherence, representing a significant yet often overlooked form of unpaid labor. Despite growing recognition of contraceptive labor as a driver of gender inequality, research has yet to systematically quantify both its burdens and returns. We introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and its returns from a female perspective. To address this gap, we introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and returns from a female perspective. Grounded in theories of gendered labor and health economics, the ContraIndex evaluates contraception across two interrelated dimensions: the burdens (labor) and benefits (returns) associated with various contraceptive methods. By facilitating cross-method comparisons, the ContraIndex provides a novel framework for examining the causes and consequences of contraceptive inequality. Its application offers actionable insights for researchers and policymakers, paving the way for strategies to reduce gendered disparities in reproductive health.",

          "authors": "Maijunxian Wang",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of systemic forgiveness—a structural tendency to absolve systems, institutions, and algorithms from responsibility while punishing individuals. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from political theory, sociology, and science and technology studies, the paper identifies three key mechanisms that enable this moral asymmetry: the complexity shield, attribution bias, and de-agentified narratives. Through case studies in finance, healthcare, algorithmic governance, and infrastructure, it demonstrates how systemic actors evade accountability via abstraction, opacity, and narrative displacement, while frontline workers become scapegoats. The genealogy of this phenomenon is traced from bureaucratic hierarchies to algorithmic impunity, revealing how moral responsibility has been reframed as technical failure. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for symmetrical accountability—introducing legal personhood for systems, auditable responsibility chains, reparative indexing, and epistemologically accountable design. Ultimately, it argues that systemic forgiveness is not an ethical oversight but a political logic that must be challenged in pursuit of structural justice.",

          "abstract": "Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use. This study sheds light on industrial policy by measuring and studying global policy practice for the first time. We first create an automated classification algorithm for categorizing industrial policy practice from text. We then apply it to a global database of commercial policy descriptions and quantify policy use at the country, industry, and year levels (2009-2020). These data allow us to study fundamental policy patterns across the world. We highlight four findings. First, IP is common (25% of policies in our database) and has expanded since 2010. Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage. We show that industrial policy is a prominent feature of the global economy and a far cry from industrial policies of the past.",

          "abstract": "Individual social identities indicate group affiliations and are typically associated with group-typical preferences, signals that indicate group membership, and the propensity to condition actions on the social signals of others, resulting in group-differentiated interaction norms. Past work modeling identity signaling and coordination has typically assumed that individuals belong to one of a discrete set of groups. Yet individuals can simultaneously belong to multiple groups, which may be nested within larger groupings. Here, we introduce the generalized Bach or Stravinsky game, a coordination game with ordered preferences, which allows us to construct a model that captures the overlapping and hierarchical nature of social identity. Our model unifies several prior results into a single framework, including results related to coordination, minority disadvantage, and cross-cultural competence. Our model also allows agents to express complex social identities through multidimensional signaling, which we use to explore a variety of complex group structures. Our consideration of intersectional identities exposes flaws in naive measures of group structure, illustrating how empirical studies may overlook some social identities if they do not consider the behaviors that those identities function to afford.",

          "abstract": "Historians and social scientists have long been preoccupied with understanding and documenting periods of crisis. Such emphasis is only growing, and becoming more pressing, as the world continues to face a number of interrelated stressors in the form of irreversible climate change, major ecological shocks and disease outbreaks, eruptions of military violence, economic disruptions and deepening inequalities, political polarization and unrest, the rise of authoritarian and nationalist regimes. Crises in these domains are not new, but have been recurrent features of past societies. Although these periods have typically led to massive loss of life, the failure of critical institutions, and even complete societal collapse, there are instances in the historical record of societies managing to turn the tide of crisis even as violence and social turmoil grow. Here, we focus on four such cases of crises mitigated with structural reforms revealed from our previous historical analyses: early Republican Rome, mid-19th century England and Russia, USA during the the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Utilizing structural demographic theory as a lens to explore these cases, we seek to expose the pressures that built up leading to crisis and the early signs of violent confrontation revealed by these societies, as well as to examine the conditions and key decisions made in the midst of this unrest that allowed these societies to turn the tide and enact significant structural adaptations. Our findings have clear relevance to understanding and navigating similar crises in contemporary societies.",

This study analyzes how shifts in population aging, immigration, partnership status, educational attainment, and female labor force participation influenced wealth inequality in West Germany between 1988 and 2017, focusing on households with children. Our findings reveal that while overall wealth inequality remained stable, this masks diverging trends across household types and conceals how significant demographic shifts within the overall population, and particularly among households with children, contributed to contrasting inequality trends. Increased immigration and changes in partnership status were associated with rising inequality; however, these effects were offset entirely by the inequality-reducing impact of population aging, educational expansion and rising female labor force participation. The study highlights the importance of these demographic changes for understanding trends in wealth inequality and shows that aggregated measures of inequality may mask countervailing effects of demographic shifts among population subgroups.

To understand the antecedents, mechanisms, and experiences of such relationships, we conducted a multi-methods study to investigate how the perceived human-likeness of social AI chatbots fosters emotional attachment, and how this effect might be mediated via increased user gratifications and heightened chatbot interactions. The quantitative results of our preregistered study with 550 participants from 64 countries showed that perceived human-likeness was a strong driver of attachment. As hypothesized, the results suggested that the effect was mediated by gratifications and interactions. The qualitative analyses demonstrated that social AI chatbots played a special role in the lives of many users, transforming habits, interactions, and relationships.

We argue that GenAI is not merely a technical tool, but an epistemic agent that transforms how knowledge is produced, interpreted, and disseminated. Drawing on recent developments in large language models, image generators, and multimodal systems, we identify four key methodological opportunities—qualitative analysis, theory-building through simulation, visual and multimodal research, and collaborative writing. We then examine the risks and tensions these opportunities present, including algorithmic bias, hallucination, and the automation of interpretive judgment. In response, we outline a pedagogical and research agenda for critical AI literacy, ethical infrastructure, and methodological pluralism. Our goal is to initiate a reflexive, interdisciplinary conversation about how GenAI can be responsibly and creatively integrated into the social sciences.",

Our review highlights the centrality of domestic distributive conflicts in understanding trade wars. We start by analyzing trade wars from the perspective of voters as consumers. We then turn to firms and employees, emphasizing patterns of fragmentation and cohesion created by modern production technologies: while the immediate effects of product-specific tariffs are limited to relatively few firms and their employees, these effects migrate along domestic supply chains. Using the example of the U.S.-China trade war, we document the geography of the direct and indirect exposure to the trade war across U.S. counties. We also outline implications of our preference map for several categories of institutional theories. Finally, we identify a different question: given the considerable economic costs of trade wars, why do governments fail to reach a settlement before escalating?",

          "authors": "Marie-Caroline Compans; Heini Väisänen",
          "abstract": "According to clinical studies, miscarriages, that is spontaneous pregnancy losses before 22–24 weeks of gestation, affect approximately 13 to 18 % of recognized pregnancies. However, clinical studies are rarely representative of the population. Surveys tend to be, but they are subject to misreporting of miscarriages, as suggested by existing work in the US. Thus, existing evidence of social inequalities in miscarriage risk is inconsistent. This study first applies a model to estimate the extent of miscarriage misreporting in the French FECOND survey (2010-11). Estimated 92% of miscarriages were reported and underreporting was slightly more pronounced among women with lower education. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of miscarriages (14% of all pregnancies) remained largely unaffected and only with small educational differences. These findings indicate that estimating miscarriage risk factors can be done without correcting for reporting bias in this survey. Second, we used multilevel multinomial logistic regressions to estimate socio-demographic characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with miscarriage. As in previous work, advanced reproductive ages were associated with a higher miscarriage risk. Our models reveal that the association between miscarriage risk and prior reproductive history is explained by unobserved time-consistent individual characteristics, such as potentially. Conversely, education and self-assessed financial conditions were not associated with miscarriage risk. Younger cohorts exhibit a higher miscarriage risk, suggesting either an age effect on recall, a cohort effect regarding pregnancy recognition, or reduced stigma resulting in more reliable reporting of miscarriage in surveys.",

          "abstract": "This review reconceptualises internalised misogyny as a clinically relevant mechanism of psychological distress in women, rather than a peripheral sociopolitical phenomenon. Synthesising feminist psychological theory with clinical research, it investigates how internalised sexist beliefs manifest as shame, perfectionism, emotional suppression, disordered eating, and trauma-related symptoms. The paper critiques the Internalised Misogyny Scale for lacking cultural and intersectional sensitivity, rendering them inadequate in diverse contexts like India. Diagnostic frameworks such as the DSM and ICD similarly omit sexism as etiological, leading to fragmented and depoliticised clinical interpretations. Drawing on Indian feminist scholarship, the paper explores how caste, colourism, respectability politics, and religious norms reinforce gendered self-policing. It exposes critical blind spots in mainstream and even feminist clinical models, and argues for feminist-informed therapies, such as narrative and relational-cultural therapy, that validate gendered suffering and challenge oppressive internalised scripts. By framing internalised misogyny as a somatised, culturally entangled, and under-recognised driver of women’s psychopathology, this review advocates for decolonial, trauma-informed clinical practices and culturally grounded future research.",

The transparency-based remedy fails to mitigate these effects. We assess the robustness of the methodology and replicate the main findings in a controlled lab experiment. Our findings demonstrate how the transaction test, by providing an empirical assessment of the legal concept of unfairness, offers a flexible tool for the regulation of dark patterns and other commercial practices.",

          "abstract": "Within the field of media framing, homelessness has been a historically under-researched topic. Framing theory states that the media’s method of presenting information plays a pivotal role in controlling public sentiment toward a topic. The sentiment held towards homeless individuals influences their ability to access jobs, housing, and resources as a result of discrimination. This study analyzes the topic and sentiment trends in related media articles to validate framing theory within the scope of homelessness. It correlates these shifts in media reporting with public sentiment. We examine state-level trends in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, and New York from 2015 to 2023. We utilize the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database to gather article data and use X to measure public sentiment towards homeless individuals. Additionally, to identify if there is a correlation between media reporting and public policy, we examine the media's impact on state-level legislation. Our research uses Granger-causality tests and vector autoregressive (VAR) models to establish a correlation between media framing and public sentiment. We also use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and GPT-3.5 (LLM-as-annotator paradigm) for topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between media framing and public sentiment, especially in states with high homelessness rates. We found no significant correlation between media framing and legislation, suggesting a possible disconnect between public opinion and policy-making. These findings reveal the broader impact of the media’s framing decisions and delineate its ability to affect society.",

The myriad changes they undergo can be complex. Importantly, the way these materials behave is unlike everyday substances, such that they can confound our intuitive expectations. For these reasons, experimentation with molten silicates can surprise us and we can learn from what we find when we try to bend them to our will. Here, we report the results of a cross-disciplinary fieldtrip to Iceland, creating as we went, and of workshops between students of Earth science and students of sculptural art. We find that all involved have been changed by these experiences and new inspirations or techniques have been garnered as a result.

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "abstract": "The accelerating decline of biodiversity requires transformative change to protect nature and society, which requires innovative actions and governance strategies. This paper focuses on developing diverse transformative pathways for biodiversity in Europe and advancing methodologies for co-creating these pathways to inform such actions and governance strategies in a transformative and anticipatory manner. Three distinct pathways for a nature-positive Europe from 2024 to 2050 were co-created with 23 participants during a 2.5-day participatory foresight workshop and analysed to understand the main patterns of change. These pathways were backcasted using three desired visions based on the Nature Futures Framework as a starting point. Post-workshop interviews with nine participants helped map their understanding of transformative change and its connection to the pathways. The analysis reveals distinct patterns within each pathway, despite shared elements such as governance changes and sectoral changes in biodiversity. The first pathway, called Dòigh Nàdair, emphasizes bottom-up transformation through community empowerment, focusing on biocultural principles and diverse sustainable alternatives across Europe. The second, NaturAll, combines top-down restrictive regulation with participatory approaches, centring on sufficiency principles. The third, Return to Nature, relies on expert-driven centralized governance and mainstreaming sustainable alternatives across Europe. Diverse understandings of transformative change among participants existed, ranging from reformist to revolutionary approaches. The methodological choices in the co-creation process led to convergence towards dominant frames within pathway groups, resulting in plurality between pathways but limited plurality within group outputs. The first pathway attracted those interested in radical ideas and creative imagination, the second drew a varied group, and the third appealed to those focused on practical and feasible solutions. The pathways demonstrate how diverse patterns of change and understandings of transformative change can result in a range of desired nature-positive futures, effectively turning concepts of transformative change into practical actions. The techniques used to create these pathways play a crucial role in shaping the results, necessitating intentional design that aligns with specific objectives. This highlights the importance of developing plural pathways to investigate multiple potential futures while preserving a strong sense of ambition and urgency for transformative action.",

          "abstract": "This paper adopts a Research Through Design (RTD) approach to investigate the epistemic consequences of large language models (LLMs). We introduce the concept of Simulacral Drift to describe how recursive training on synthetic outputs displaces empirical reference, leading to a collapse in both model fidelity and user cognition. Rather than collecting empirical data, this work engages in conceptual design research to surface and structure the ethical implications of generative simulation. Through a reflexive inquiry grounded in media theory, STS, and design philosophy, we propose a normative framework of Reflexive Epistemic Ethics, comprising referential integrity, simulation auditability, and epistemic friction. We further integrate recent neurophysiological evidence from Kosmyna et al. (2025), which shows that LLM users exhibit reduced memory recall and neural engagement — validating our claim that epistemic collapse is embodied and co-produced.

          "abstract": "Since the 18th century, policymakers have debated the merits of industrial policy (IP). Yet, economists lack basic facts about its use. This study sheds light on industrial policy by measuring and studying global policy practice for the first time. We first create an automated classification algorithm for categorizing industrial policy practice from text. We then apply it to a global database of commercial policy descriptions and quantify policy use at the country, industry, and year levels (2009-2020). These data allow us to study fundamental policy patterns across the world. We highlight four findings. First, IP is common (25% of policies in our database) and has expanded since 2010. Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage. We show that industrial policy is a prominent feature of the global economy and a far cry from industrial policies of the past.",

          "authors": "Arvind Karunakaran; Sarah Lebovitz; Devesh Narayanan; Hatim Rahman",
          "abstract": "The nexus between technology and workplace inequality has long been a focal point of scholarly discourse, now heightened by the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). Our review moves beyond dystopian/utopian views of AI by identifying four perspectives— normative, cognitive, structural, and relational— espoused by scholars examining the impact of AI on workplace inequality. Our review surfaces the respective strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions of these perspectives and highlights how each perspective speaks to a particular facet of workplace inequality, either encoded, evaluative, wage, or relational inequality. A key insight from our review is that integrating these four perspectives would enable a stronger understanding of how, when, and in what direction AI can impact workplace inequality. Toward that end, we provide an integrative framework that espouses a “lifecycle approach” to examine AI technology development, deployment, and use as an ongoing, iterative process, as opposed to studying them in isolation. Our framework foregrounds the role of normative ideologies, materiality, cognitive frames, and organizational structures/processes that together impact workplace inequality in the wake of AI. Our integrative review seeks to equip and motivate management and organizational scholars to examine the lifecycle of AI and its multifaceted impact on workplace inequality.",

          "authors": "Alan B Cobo-Lewis",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

Using these measures, our work shows voters' perceptions of candidate ideology are strongly related to messaging, even after controlling for incumbent voting behavior. We also examine how the relationship between politician messaging and voter perceptions changes relative to other information about the politician and in different electoral contexts. On the whole, voters' perceptions of candidate ideology are strongly correlated with politician communications.",

          "authors": "Stephen R. Buzdugan; David Freund; Mats Forsgren; Ulf Holm",
          "abstract": "This article unveils a new way of theorizing the multinational enterprise (MNE) to explain why it may engage in ‘anti-societal’ behavior – i.e. behavior that may systematically lead to negative societal outcomes, such as environmental degradation, poor working conditions, or antitrust violations. Our new ‘self-preservation perspective’ of the MNE holds that MNEs exert their relative political power to protect their market position, assets, and strategic advantages from political and economic threats. In doing so, negative societal outcomes can result, not as anomalies but rather a structural phenomenon rooted in the firm’s intrinsic drive for survival. Drawing on insights from institutional economics and international relations theory, we argue that self-preservation behavior is more fundamental than profit-maximization behavior, which has long been assumed to be the primary motive of MNEs. We shed new light on why MNEs engage with transnational social spaces through an illustrative case of Tesla's anti-union activities in Sweden. We observe how self-preservation has influenced Tesla’s resistance to signing collective bargaining agreements in Sweden and has led to the emergence of a self-interested transnational regulatory community that deteriorates labor rights. Thus, we posit that the self-preservation perspective offers a powerful complement to existing international business theory by providing a critical analytical lens on the societal role of MNEs in the context of the ‘grand challenges’. This alternative perspective challenges conventional narratives of MNE behavior as primarily cost-efficient, value-creating or innovative, and demonstrates that MNE anti-societal behavior is structural rather than isolated to a few individual cases.",

          "abstract": "Foreign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver aid abroad. However, recent decades have witnessed a global cascade of restrictive anti-NGO legislation. How have foreign aid donors responded and adapted to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we also find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues in favor of regime-compatible causes. Donors also channel more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs; however, this change is by no means a perfect substitute. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for official aid donors, INGOs, and local groups working on contentious causes such as elections, human rights, media, corruption, and advocacy.",

          "authors": "Olusegun Hassan",
          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nA representative public service that is made up of the diverse group in society is an essential element of power sharing in federations globally. The Federal Character Commission (FCC) was established in 1996 to provide an enforcement mechanism for the Federal Character Principle by serving as a watchdog for federal government ministries, department and agencies (MDAS) in ensuring that the public service represent the ethnic diversity and the geopolitical divide of the country. Previous studies have identified enforcement challenges of the FCC such as funding and lack of compliance and cooperation from MDAS and parastatals. Few studies have however captured the collaboration of the FCC with the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), through the instrumentality of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information system (IPPIS), and the role it played in the enforcement of a representation public service in Nigeria. This is what this paper sets out to achieve.\n\nThe paper adopted the Descriptive Research design which involved the use of primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected through key informant interview sessions conducted with officials of the FCC secretariat, Abuja, who were purposively selected. Secondary data were sourced from official documents such as the yearly review of operations and the Consolidated Statistical Analysis Data (CSAD) of federal ministries, extra- ministerial department and agencies (MDAs), newspaper editorials, articles and reports. Data were content-analyzed.\n\nThe FCC kept data and personnel nominal rolls from MDAs and produced the Character Balancing Index [CBI] used by the recruitment monitoring committee [RMC] to determine representation and make recommendations on recruitment. The Certificate of Compliance issued to a recruiting MDA after completion of a recruitment exercise conducted in line with the prescribed recruitment pattern issued by the FCC RMC, is required by the OAGF for the enlistment of successful candidates on the IPPIS federal payroll. Massive corruption and job-slots racketeering within the FCC proved antithetical to the commission's aims and goals of enforcing compliance with prescribed recruitment patterns for recruitment exercises monitored by the RMC. Incidences of connivance between the FCC leadership and CEOs of MDAs precipitated a failure of the FCC’s enforcement efforts. From 2016 to 2022, the number of States that were grossly over-represented and dominated the federal public service remained the same, while the same numbers of the States that were grossly under-represented continue to lag behind in manpower distribution.\n\nAs the OAGF through the IPPIS is practically incapable of helping the FCC that has been compromised, the federal government needs to pay more attention to the FCC’s recruitment monitoring exercises to ensure its credibility and make it more effective.\n\nWord Count: 428\n\nKeywords: - Federal Character Commission, Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, Representation, Public Service, Nigeria",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study examined whether changes in spousal care were associated with changes in grandchild care frequency among European grandparents.\nBackground: Grandparents are important providers of childcare for their children's families, but they may face competing caregiving demands within the family, especially as spousal caregivers. Limited resources may force them to prioritize one family member over another, particularly when new care needs emerge. \nMethod: This study used eight waves (2004–2022) of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, covering 19 countries. The sample included individuals aged 50+ who had participated in at least two study waves and had a grandchild under age 13 (56,383 observations from 18,754 respondents). Asymmetric fixed-effects regression was employed to examine whether starting or stopping spousal care was associated with changes in grandchild care frequency.\nResults: Starting intensive spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care frequency, similarly for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results also indicated a negative effect of stopping spousal care on childcare, particularly among grandfathers, although this finding was not statistically significant. Further inspection revealed that stopping spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care only among grandfathers who no longer resided with their partner (e.g., due to institutionalization or death).\nConclusion: Engagement in intensive spousal care predicts grandparental childcare, showing that intensifying resource competition impacts the distribution of care within families.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the role of employees’ development programs in talent enhancement. Specifically, this study was featured by three specific objectives, which were to identify types of development programs available for enhancing talents at the Institute of Judicial Administration (IJA), to find out the impacts of employees’ development programs in talent enhancement, and to determine the challenges facing IJA in implementing available employees’ development programs. This study followed interpretivism philosophy using a qualitative paradigm and a case study as the design of this study. Theoretically, this study was informed by human capital theory, which is based on the development of human resources in the organization. The study gathered primary data through in-depth interviews with five (5) participants and through focus group discussion (FGD) with forty-five (45) participants. But also, this study used secondary data, which was obtained through documentary review, to enhance the findings. For analysis and presentation of data, this study used a thematic approach to analyze the findings and present the results. The results of the findings revealed that employees’ development programs, such as training programs, workshop programs, job rotation programs, delegation programs, and seminar programs, which are available at IJA, enhance talents. But also, it was found that the implementation of these programs has been revealed to have the following impacts: helping employees to get new ideas of performing their tasks in a better way, increasing innovation, increasing employees’ satisfaction, helping to prepare talented individuals for future roles in the organization, and boosting employees’ performance. However, despite enhancing talent, these development programs face challenges like financial constraints, poor employee ’engagement, and top-level leaders’ preferences. This study recommended that for effective implementation of development programs, IJA should allocate more funds to development programs during the budget preparation, IJA should involve employees at all stages of planning about development programs to avoid low engagement of individuals, and it was recommended that IJA management should follow the development plan and policies when implementing development programs instead of relying on individual preferences.\n\nKeywords: Development Programs, Judicial Administration Talent, Talent Enhancement",

          "abstract": "This research note focuses on the relationship between gender ideological pairings and the division of paid and unpaid work for different-sex couples around the transition to parenthood. We examine the social stratification of couples’ attitudinal-work arrangements, paying particular attention to the combined social classes of the partners. We contribute to the literature by adopting a linked-lives approach and explicitly considering couples as a meaningful unit of analysis; by jointly examining the three domains of ideological pairing, the gender division of paid work, and the gender division of unpaid work; and by including an often-overlooked driver of life course patterns, namely social class. We analyze panel data from Understanding Society, the largest household panel study providing a representative sample of the UK population, using multi-domain sequence analysis and logistic regression techniques. Our findings suggest a striking stability in couples’ ideological pairings and division of domestic labor around the transition to parenthood, with a preponderance of partners agreeing on traditional gender roles and women doing most of the housework. However, labor arrangements vary widely between couples, and social class (especially the class of the female partner) emerges as a critical determinant of how partners share paid work.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to leverage the heterogeneity in Gender Role Attitudes in Germany and the different prevailing ideas of marriage between the east and west of the country to investigate the role played by agreement on gender roles in partnership transitions, comparing contexts with different prevailing ideas of marriages. Marriage is still perceived as normative in Germany and enshrined in institutions, yet marriage rates have been declining in the last decades. I investigate whether attitudes towards gender roles held jointly by couples and their change might explain this discrepancy.  I examine a sample of 1297 German couples followed yearly from the beginning of their partnership onwards from 2008 to 2019, with information on both partners, selected from a representative probability sample. I use a series of Competing Risk survival models, comparing couples from West Germany with couples from East Germany. Sharing attitudes towards gender roles at the beginning of the relationship is positively related to marriage likelihoods in the West but not in the East. Convergence to a shared attitude for couples who start with diverging attitudes is also correlated with higher marriage risks, with differences between West German and East German couples. Correlation between attitudinal convergence and marriage probabilities highlights the need for couple-focused research when investigating partnership patterns. Differences in the correlations between West- and East German couples indicate possible effects of the predominant idea of marriage on the relationship between couple’s gender attitudes and their relationship outcomes.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, I study the impact of the Aspirational Districts Program (ADP) on learning outcomes in India. The ADP was launched by the Government of India in 2018 with the objective of reducing inter-district multidimensional inequality by targeting growth in 112 of the least developed districts in the country. I use a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate the causal effect of the ADP on learning outcomes in aspirational districts (ADs) four years after the program intervention. Although overall learning levels decline in all districts in India from 2018 to 2022, most likely due to covid-19, I find a positive effect of the program in limiting this decrease for ADs compared to non-treated districts. I find a positive casual effect of the ADP of 0.2 standard deviations for reading outcomes and 0.28 standard deviations for math outcomes, statistically significant at the 95% and the 99% confidence levels, respectively. The program also has a 0.76 percentage point additional effect on reducing the percentage of children not enrolled in school in treated districts. These results are significant across a variety of different robustness checks. Despite these results, further analysis suggests that policymakers need to increase attention towards increasing the quality of education alongside improving enrollment rates and accessibility.",

          "abstract": "This research examines the connection between gambling behavior and substance use among youths, with special interest regarding gender difference and the cost of gambling. With a representative sample of 700 high school students aged between ages of 14 and 18 years, the research utilized structured questionnaires to collect information. Respondents indicated their participation on gambling, ranging from slot and scratch cards to internet gambling and sports betting, and their use of psychoactive drugs. Analysis identifies a strong, statistically significant connection between gambling and use of substances, particularly among respondents who use slot gambling or sport betting. For the entire sample, 19.7% gambled and 24% took substances. Use of substances, particularly psychoactive drugs and tobacco use, were much more prevalent among gamblers compared with non-gamblers, and an associated pattern, particularly among males, unveiled much more salient features. Log odds ratio and Fisher’s exact test analysis uncovered much elevated probabilities of use of substances among gamblers, particularly among slot machine users, with odds ratios higher than 2.0 among some female subgroups. Nevertheless, internet gambling could not demonstrate strong associations with use of substances, but there revealed an evident modest positive connection among men users. Data on expenditure unveiled the majority of young persons pay less than €10 monthly on gambling, but there exists a small group with much elevated expenditure. These respondents accounted for the size of the right-skewed distribution and may demonstrate burgeoning signs of harmful gambling. Prevention and detection are highlighted with special interest regarding gender-specific behavior. Recommendations are combined, integrated prevention among young persons within schools and communities, especially regarding gambling and use of substances during youth.",

          "abstract": "This study used physiological and self-reported measures to explore how emotions and authenticity orientation influence tourists’ authentication of attractions promoted by visual marketing materials. Seventy-two participants, classified as realists, constructivists, or postmodernists based on their attitudes toward authenticity, watched a video about a staged attraction – Hobbiton Movie Set in Rotorua, New Zealand. Heartbeat data were analyzed through time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) measures. The authentication outcomes aligned with an individual’s authenticity orientation: postmodernists were most likely to view the attraction as authentic and ‘my kind of place to visit’. HRV data indicated greater focus and more deliberate cognitive processing in realists. Positive emotional arousal elicited by the promotional video significantly influenced the authentication process in all groups.",

          "abstract": "This is working paper and I would like to find collaborators with data for future papers. \n\nDespite the growing relevance of digital platforms, many academics remain hesitant to fully embrace social media for scholarly communication. Institutional discouragement, limited time, privacy concerns, misinformation, reputational risks, and fears of cancellation or censorship are among the key barriers.\n\nThis reluctance represents a missed opportunity, especially for institutions with limited resources. Universities without repositories, those unable to afford expensive journal subscriptions, struggling to support open-access publishing, or lacking dedicated communications staff could benefit significantly from the accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and global reach of social media.\n\nThis paper presents an international literature review, drawing insights from editorials and scholarly articles. It highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of social media as a rapid and effective tool for disseminating scientific knowledge.\n\nThree case studies, including two research projects at the University of Cambridge, demonstrate the potential of social media to mobilise findings and amplify research impact. They show how digital platforms can raise public awareness, educate stakeholders, foster international collaboration, and even attract funding.",

          "authors": "Ben Matthews; Susan McVie; Paul Norris",
          "abstract": "Understanding inequality in victimisation across society is crucial to address questions of fairness and justice, even during periods of falling crime. Consequently, a growing body of research has considered how the recent crime drop has affected patterns of victimisation inequality. These studies primarily aim to understand whether different social groups have benefitted equally from overall reductions in rates of victimization; however, much of the existing research is limited by three key methodological shortcomings. \nFirstly, studies often compare only two discrete points in time, rather than describing longer term changes in victimization.  Secondly, they typically focus on either ‘unadjusted’ estimates of victimisation (which measure differences between groups without taking account of any other characteristics) or ‘adjusted’ estimates (which take account of additional characteristics), but rarely both, giving only a partial picture. Finally, few studies of victimization inequality account for uncertainty in the victimization estimates which are inherent in analyses of crime survey data. This paper addresses these shortcomings by applying a robust, simulation-based approach to estimating and visualizing temporal change in both unadjusted and adjusted indicators of victimization inequality using data from the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey collected between 2008/09 and 2021/22.  \nOur analysis focuses on nine socio-demographic variables which include individual, household and community characteristics.  While the results show reductions in victimization rates across all groups studied, there was clear evidence of victimization inequality between some groups. Moreover, the extent of victimization inequality and how it changed over time varied considerably depending on whether adjusted or unadjusted estimates was used. Overall, rising inequality was most strongly associated with ethnicity, disability and financial hardship.  We argue that our methodological approach provides a more nuanced and informative perspective on stability and change in victimization inequality than previously considered.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, digital technologies have become increasingly integrated into language learning, offering immersive, interactive environments that support second language (L2) acquisition. Among these technologies, video games stand out for their potential to foster vocabulary learning through contextualized, engaging experiences. However, while serious games have been widely studied, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) video games have received comparatively less research attention to date. Following a replicable PRISMA protocol, this systematic review seeks to address this gap by analyzing 13 studies selected from a pool of 129 publications published between 2015 and 2024. The review evaluates the effectiveness of COTS games in L2 vocabulary acquisition, their practical implications, learner perceptions, and associated limitations. Findings suggest that COTS games can foster meaningful vocabulary development and enhance learner engagement, particularly when thoughtfully integrated into pedagogical settings.",

          "authors": "Leonard Baum; Joanna J. Bryson",
          "abstract": "Growing global concern about the problems associated with concentrated market power in the digital economy is leading to a renewed interest in competition policy. Since the late 2010s, China’s government has squarely confronted the problems of its own ‘Big Tech’ with a new competition regime for digital markets. Outcomes represent a unique learning opportunity for Western academics, competition authorities and lawmakers alike, which has so far been underutilized. However, given unreliable official figures, a new methodology is needed to assess competition in China’s digital economy. This article introduces a market capitalization approach that builds on the informativeness of China’s financial markets. We use Bloomberg financial data of 1142 publicly listed firms for the period 2019 to 2022 to quantitatively examine the impact of China’s new digital competition regime. We find a causal link between the new governance approach and  a reduction of market concentration and aggregate growth in the primary markets of China’s three most dominant digital platforms – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BATs). Further, our results show a robust correlation between the new competition regime and reduced market concentration and market capitalization growth rates across China’s digital markets. Other empirical findings include a negative correlation between market concentration and the openness of digital markets, a non-relationship between market concentration and profits, and the inability of profit and revenue-based metrics to capture market power effectively in China’s digital economy. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these insights for Western regulatory strategies, particularly as the EU and China emerge as global frontrunners in the field of digital competition regulation.",

          "authors": "Matthew DiGiuseppe; Michael E Flynn",
          "abstract": "Survey researchers rely heavily on closed-ended questions to measure latent respondent characteristics like knowledge, policy positions, emotions, ideology, and various other traits. While closed-ended questions ease analysis and data collection, they necessarily limit the depth and variability of responses. Open-ended responses allow for greater depth and variability in responses but are labor-intensive to code. Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify which statement ``wins'' and ``loses''. With this information, we employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score' on a the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings with larger models (&gt; 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd source workers.",

          "abstract": "We analyze legally binding unilateral settlement options for employers in dismissal disputes using a model of employment adjustment followed by bargaining and litigation. Contrary to common concerns, we show that unilateral settlement reduces inefficient adjustments and increases the surplus of moderately productive workers when adjustments do not significantly hurt productivity. When unilateral settlement is available, employers are tempted to settle unilaterally to save litigation costs at the expense of output that could be restored by reinstatement. This dynamic inconsistency weakens their bargaining position. Well-designed unilateral settlement institutions can thus promote stable employment, efficiency, and equity beyond mere litigation cost savings.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates whether concentrated liquidity in decentralized exchanges offers liquidity providers (LPs) enhanced protection against toxic swaps by arbitrageurs while preserving efficient price discovery, focusing on Uniswap. We develop a game-theoretic model of liquidity provision that reveals a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off in LP decision-making, which shapes the equilibrium strategy. Specifically, while arbitrageurs' toxic swaps generate non-competitive payoffs that are independent of other LPs' strategies, noise traders' non-toxic swaps create competitive payoffs that depend on aggregate liquidity provision. We demonstrate that LP equilibrium payoffs under the concentrated liquidity mechanism increasingly outperform those without it as swap toxicity rises. However, when toxicity is substantially low, competitive pressure of concentrated liquidity can worsen LP payoffs. Our comparative statics analysis identifies several patterns that can guide LPs in adapting their strategies to market conditions.",

          "abstract": "Can social scientists use large language models (LLMs) to code open-ended survey responses across complexity levels. This study uses the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study as a test case, comparing GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.1 variant Sonnar Large, and Mistral Large against human annotators, we find the two proprietary models outperform open-source alternatives, achieving 97% accuracy on straightforward questions and 88-91% on complex interpretive tasks. However, open-source models still perform relatively well, achieving 95-96% accuracy on relatively straightforward questions up to 87% on more complex ones. Performance analysis revealed response brevity, but not category brevity, as a strong determinant of successful classification with responses under 50 characters demonstrating 7-11% higher classification accuracy. While models effectively detected nuance in simpler tasks, they struggled with responses containing multiple reasons, narratives, and implicit meanings.\n\nThe findings imply that social science researchers who want to use LLMs should design questions to elicit concise responses (10-50 characters), implement human-in-the-loop review for complex tasks, and carefully select appropriate models based on task complexity. Minimal demographic variation in classification accuracy was observed, with Claude uniquely maintaining consistent performance across population segments. Methodologically concerning, some models sometimes produced different social narratives from open-ended classification despite high accuracy metrics.",

          "abstract": "Scholarly publishing takes place in an institutional arena that is opaque to its practitioners. As readers, writers, reviewers, and editors, we have no clear view of the system within which we’re working. Researchers starting their careers receive (if they’re lucky) folk wisdom and mythology handed down from advisor to advisee, geared more toward individual success (or survival) than toward attaining a systemic perspective. They may learn how to get their work into the right journals or books, but often don’t learn why that is the outcome that matters for their careers, how the field arrived at that decision, and what the alternatives are – or should be. Gaining a wider perspective is important both for shaping individual careers and for confronting the systematic problems we face as a community of knowledge creators and purveyors. This primer starts from the premise that sociologists, especially those early in their careers, need to learn about the system of scholarly communication. And that sociology can help us toward that goal. Understanding the political economy of the system within which publication takes place is necessary for us to fulfill our roles as citizens of the research community, as people who play an active role in shaping the future of that system, consciously or not. Responsible citizenship requires learning about the institutional actors in the system and how they are governed, as well as who pays and who profits within the field, and who wins or loses.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of decentralized science (DeSci) and the potential for its acceleration through artificial intelligence (AI) presents both remarkable promise and formidable challenges for modern research. DeSci AI platforms use blockchain-based, openly governed workflows and autonomous AI “swarms” capable of literature synthesis, peer-review triage, and reputation tracking to democratize access, speed discovery, and rebuild public trust. Yet, they also introduce complex implementation barriers and governance questions. The transformative claims of DeSci must be gauged against the benchmark of conventional science. Traditional research practice is anchored in methodological rigor through hypothesis-driven design, validated instrumentation, standard operating protocols, and independent peer review. Stable institutional arrangements such as universities, funding councils, and archival journals further buttress reliability by providing clear governance and normative oversight. Nevertheless, the contemporary academic reward economy, in which publication is highly valued, and grant income constitute the currency of promotion, often favors projects with near-certain, publishable outcomes. This frequently suppresses genuine curiosity, leaving potentially transformative inquiries chronically underexplored.\nThe scientific community must therefore embrace decentralized, data-secure alternatives while preserving valuable institutional frameworks. Successful adoption of DeSci-AI hinges on interrelated technical, cultural, regulatory, and resource-related challenges. This perspective maps those barriers and proposes integrated strategies including token-backed reviewer remuneration, incentive pools for negative or replication studies, AI-driven misconduct auditors, and hybrid governance pilots, to chart a realistic pathway for the scientific community to leverage DeSci AI synergies while safeguarding rigor, equity, and societal trust.",

          "abstract": "Mass media is widely used to engage audiences with the natural world. Given their extensive reach and attention to ecological topics, there has been growing interest in using commercial video games for conservation outreach. However, there has not yet been a holistic overview of work on this topic.\n\nWe produced the first systematic map on how commercial video games engage with biodiversity and conservation. This includes 380 papers, covering five languages as well as both empirical (34.7%) and non-empirical (65.3%) literature. Our manuscript is complemented by a freely accessible and fully interactive online database. Users can further explore our findings and interrogate the available evidence according to their own interests. \n\nOverall, the field is even more diverse and multidisciplinary than expected: 450 different games have been studied, and a variety of ways to depict or engage with real-world ecology have been scrutinised. Ecocriticism dominates non-empirical work – often evaluating the extent that game design encourages or condemns exploitation of nature. Empirical papers are overwhelmingly non-experimental (93.7%); research has most often explored how video games represent real-world wildlife, influence players’ ecological perceptions, or inform players’ interactions with virtual nature. \n\nDespite the volume of literature, there are glaring omissions. Few studies employed pre/post-test assessments or even control groups, therefore making it difficult to infer the causal effects of video games. Most notably, there is not yet evidence on whether games make players more or less likely to take real-world pro-ecological action.\n\nVideo games clearly have the potential to represent biodiversity and convey ecological messages – whether these be helpful or harmful for conservation. However, only by taking more rigorous approaches can we better understand the impact of games for this purpose. Our map highlights several promising areas for future study. As examples, we strongly recommend that researchers consider the role of player differences on the impact of games, observe actual behaviours and how these change after play, and pursue interdisciplinary collaborations with the games industry for more thorough, applicable, and novel findings.",

Intriguingly, the Chinese public does not appear to differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, despite China’s historical emphasis on meritocratic institutions. We propose that this phenomenon could be due to the Chinese public’s greater reluctance to make an active choice in real-stake redistribution decisions. We run an incentivized redistribution experiment with elite university students in China and France where we vary the initial split of payoffs between two real-life workers to redistribute from. We show that Chinese respondents consistently and significantly choose more non-redistribution across different status quo scenarios. Additionally, if we exclude the individuals who engage in non-redistribution choices, Chinese respondents do differentiate between merit- and luck-based inequalities, and do not redistribute less than the French. Chinese respondents are as reactive as the French towards scenarios with noisy signals of merit, such as inequalities of opportunities. We argue that the reluctance to make an active choice signals diminished political agency to act upon redistribution decisions with real-life stakes, rather than apathy, inattention, having benefited from the status quo in Chinese society, or libertarian preferences among the Chinese. Notably, our findings show that the reluctance to make a choice is particularly pronounced among respondents of working-class or farming backgrounds, while it is absent among individuals whose families have closer ties to the private sector.

          "abstract": "Background: Despite clear recommendations from evidence-based guidelines to restrict tonsillectomies for adult patients with infrequent tonsillitis, adoption among German otolaryngologists remains limited. Social influences, including opinion leaders and perceived social norms across peers, may shape practitioners’ adherence to these guidelines. \nPurpose: This study examined how German otolaryngologists perceive peer social norms and opinion leaders regarding tonsillectomy guidelines, and how these perceptions relate to their own guideline adherence. \nMethods: In a cross-sectional online survey (N = 100), otolaryngologists reported their tonsillectomy practices, attitudes toward relevant guidelines, and perceptions of both peer and opinion leader behaviors. Guideline adherence was assessed via self-reported clinical decisions. Social influences were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. \nResults: While most otolaryngologists reported guideline-consistent attitudes and behavior, many perceived their peers and opinion leaders as less adherent. Guideline adherence was significantly associated with individual tonsillectomy attitudes (OR = 0.18, p &lt; .001) and perceived opinion leader attitudes (OR = 0.33, p = .013), but not with perceptions of the general peer group or demographics. \nConclusions: Otolaryngologists’ perceptions of opinion leaders are significantly associated with their adherence to tonsillectomy guidelines, even beyond their own attitudes. Misperceptions about peer and leader practices may hinder guideline diffusion. Interventions targeting opinion leaders and correcting misperceptions may accelerate guideline adoption in clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "This study, leveraging positive psychology and ZMET (Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique), explores travel experiences as an adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder outpatients. Analyzing cases with positive outcomes, the research identifies key therapeutic themes: sensory stimuli (particularly taste unique or spicy food, contrasting with visually-dominated sensory interventions), social interaction, exhaustion and catharsis (through controlled physical exertion, distincting from hedonic tourism experiences), and personal autonomy. These themes address existential needs, foster belonging, facilitate emotional release and regulation, and promote personal growth – ultimately enhancing connection, mastery, and self-regulation in individuals with major depressive disorder outpatients. The study uniquely highlights the therapeutic roles of sensory stimuli and exhaustion/catharsis, while confirming the importance of social interaction and autonomy. These findings support the potential of travel as a valuable adjunct therapy, offering novel pathways to positive psychological outcomes inmajor depressive disorder outpatients treatment.",

          "abstract": "This article explores how social scientists understand and enact objectivity in practice. Drawing on a qualitative study with 36 Croatian researchers, we examine epistemic orientations through a multimodal interpretive protocol that includes hypothetical vignettes, quotations from the sociology of science, and reflexive prompts. Through combined analysis of participants’ responses, we identify three clusters of epistemic stance: Socially Engaged Academics, Scientific Realists, and Pragmatic Hybrids. These clusters reflect divergent views on scientific purpose, methodological rigor, and the societal role of research.\nRather than treating objectivity as a fixed epistemic ideal, we conceptualize it as a situated and reflexive practice shaped by disciplinary identity, methodological preference, and institutional context. Our findings show that methodological orientations are deeply entangled with normative understandings of responsibility, legitimacy, and relevance. We also identify gendered and positional patterns in how researchers interpret academic dilemmas, particularly in ethically or politically charged scenarios.\nThis study contributes to the sociology of science and science and technology studies by offering a novel typology of epistemic orientations and emphasizing the need for plural, reflexive models of objectivity—especially in contexts of institutional change and social crisis.",

          "abstract": "Resilience has become a prominent concept in EU social and economic policy, positioned as a response to megatrends such as technological change, labour market deregulation and demographic shifts. This article critically examines how resilience is conceptualised in EU policy, arguing that it insufficiently accounts for structural inequalities in individuals’ capacities to adapt to risks. Building on cumulative inequality theory and the prevalences and penalties framework, we propose an “inequalities in resilience” framework that distinguishes between the need for resilience—measured by exposure to labour market risks—and the capacity for resilience—measured by the ability to avoid poverty when risks materialise. Using EI-SILC data for 30 countries, 2010–2020, encompassing 3,103,097 individuals, we find that groups with greater need for resilience, particularly those with lower educational attainment and single-parent households, show lower capacity for resilience. This pattern shows a high degree of consistency across different risks and poverty indicators, and national contexts. We conclude that resilience-focused policy must integrate prevention and resource-based interventions while recognising the compounded, path-dependent, and status-based nature of inequality. Addressing these layered disadvantages requires coordinated, inclusive policy designs that go beyond individual adaptation to tackle the structural roots of disadvantage.",

          "authors": "Maijunxian Wang",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of systemic forgiveness—a structural tendency to absolve systems, institutions, and algorithms from responsibility while punishing individuals. Drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks from political theory, sociology, and science and technology studies, the paper identifies three key mechanisms that enable this moral asymmetry: the complexity shield, attribution bias, and de-agentified narratives. Through case studies in finance, healthcare, algorithmic governance, and infrastructure, it demonstrates how systemic actors evade accountability via abstraction, opacity, and narrative displacement, while frontline workers become scapegoats. The genealogy of this phenomenon is traced from bureaucratic hierarchies to algorithmic impunity, revealing how moral responsibility has been reframed as technical failure. The paper concludes by proposing a framework for symmetrical accountability—introducing legal personhood for systems, auditable responsibility chains, reparative indexing, and epistemologically accountable design. Ultimately, it argues that systemic forgiveness is not an ethical oversight but a political logic that must be challenged in pursuit of structural justice.",

          "abstract": "In 2017, Finland introduced a partial old-age pension scheme, allowing individuals to claim either 25 or 50 percent of their old-age pension after turning 61, irrespective of their employment status. Claiming a partial pension before the statutory retirement age results in a permanent reduction of the full old-age pension. Due to the rapid rise in consumer prices in 2022, individuals who claimed their pension before the end of 2022 benefited from a three-percentage-point higher index adjustment in 2023, resulting in a permanently higher pension compared to those who claimed theirs in early 2023. We assess the causal effect of the financial incentive arising from the exceptional index adjustment on pension claiming using regression discontinuity design and full population register data. Those who had the opportunity to benefit from the extraordinary index adjustment were approximately 8 percentage points more likely to claim the partial old-age pension in the first month of eligibility, with a relative effect as high as 79%. The effect arises because individuals advance their pension claims in response to the exceptional index adjustment. Individuals with a higher pension accrual, higher earnings, or with upper tertiary education were more likely than others to respond to the index adjustment.",

Using a two-phase thematic content analysis — first inductive (100 peer-reviewed articles) and then deductive (33 targeted articles) — the study identifies key transformations in the field.\nThe results show that barriers related to disciplinary dominance, institutional rigidity, career identity uncertainty, technological access, and student motivation have converged into a more coherent and integrated obstacle system. This homogenization offers new possibilities for targeted institutional and pedagogical interventions — but also raises urgent questions about how universities will adapt to the next wave of systemic change, including AI-driven educational technologies and sustainability-driven curricular transformation.\nThe study contributes to the methodological foundations of research on multidisciplinary education and provides a framework for future collaborative reflection and innovation.",

          "abstract": "A decade ago, the computational turn in communication science was heralded by promises of unseen treasure troves of available digital text containing communication of politicians, journalists, social media users, and many other groups. As these treasures become more closely guarded today, the field needs to think of new strategies to continue to enable researchers who want to engage in computational communication research. One of these strategies is to make text data sharing a more common practice in the field -- which would also greatly enhance reproducibility of research. In this article, we outline three avenues to share as much of your data as possible, while still honouring ethical and legal restrictions. Given the relative lack of infrastructure for some of these avenues, we also highlight the capacities of the Amsterdam Content Analysis Toolkit (AmCAT) to enable non standard sharing strategies. We especially highlight the functions for *non-consumptive research* -- which means analyses methods that can be performed without access to the full data set.",

          "abstract": "El agravamiento de las problemáticas ambientales, sociales y económicas asociadas al uso de combustibles fósiles intensifica la urgencia de una transición hacia fuentes de energía renovables, impulsando la adopción de tecnologías como paneles solares, turbinas eólicas y vehículos eléctricos. Aunque frecuentemente promovidas como soluciones sostenibles, estas tecnologías presentan características intrínsecas - como menor densidad energética, vida útil reducida y limitaciones en los procesos de reciclaje - que incrementan la dependencia de minerales, muchos de ellos clasificados como “críticos”. Este artículo busca contribuir al debate mediante el análisis de los impactos del aumento significativo en la demanda de estos recursos. Con base en la definición de minerales críticos de la Agencia Internacional de Energías Renovables - que incluye cobalto, níquel, cobre, litio y metales de tierras raras -, se realizó una amplia recopilación, sistematización y análisis de datos a escala global, identificando los principales países productores y los contextos socioambientales asociados a su extracción. Los resultados evidencian la reproducción de un patrón histórico: la mayor parte de estos minerales se extrae en países del Sur Global, especialmente en África, Asia y América Latina, donde las normativas ambientales, sociales y económicas tienden a ser más flexibles, favoreciendo a grandes corporaciones transnacionales. Se constató, además, que la extracción de estos minerales suele estar asociada a impactos socioambientales graves, como contaminación intensa, exposición de trabajadores a metales tóxicos y financiamiento de milicias vinculadas a regímenes autoritarios. Estas cuestiones, aún poco discutidas en el discurso dominante sobre la temática, requieren una mayor atención por parte de la comunidad científica y de la sociedad en general, a fin de promover una transición energética verdaderamente justa a escala global.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the political polarization of public trust in science across Europe, focusing on the roles of motivated reasoning and political partisanship. We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education. Our findings underscore that polarization is most pronounced in scientific disciplines and claims that challenge industrial interests and align with social welfare goals, and that partisanship plays a central role in shaping public trust in this scientific domain.",

First we show that Great Power battles tend to occur in shortest-distance corridors between belligerent powers’ capitals, except where those corridors are intercepted by seas, mountains, and marshes. Then we show that capitals locate closer to each other when they have more of these types of geography between them. Finally, we show that city pairs are less likely to belong to the same state if they have more of this geography between them, allowing us to use geography to predict the territorial size and shape of Europe’s Great Powers. In sum, our results suggest that terrain which slows down military incursions makes capitals safer, allowing them to locate closer to each other; given all capitals’ locations, the surrounding geography then shapes the associated state territories.",

          "abstract": "Elections are a primary mechanism through which citizens can hold politicians accountable for misconduct. However, whether voters actually punish corruption at the ballot box remains an open question, as electoral decisions often involve strategic considerations, including beliefs about how others think and behave. To better understand how such strategic considerations operate in this context, we conducted a pre-registered information intervention during a major political corruption scandal in Japan. The treatment provided information about the prevailing social norm—specifically, the perceived social intolerance of the scandal. The treatment increased turnout and support for a challenger, particularly among swing voters who initially believed that others were intolerant of corruption. Among party loyalists with more lenient prior beliefs, the same information backfired, increasing support for the incumbent. The turnout effect among swing voters was sizable—approximately six percentage points—comparable in magnitude to benchmark mobilization interventions involving personalized contact or social pressure. To account for these patterns, we develop a simple model that incorporates mechanisms—notably *moral reinforcement* and *identity reinforcement*—that generate predictions consistent with the observed heterogeneity in responses. By highlighting how perceptions of prevailing norms shape voter behavior in the presence of strategic considerations, this study contributes to a broader understanding of how democratic institutions can remain resilient in the face of political misconduct.",
