          "authors": "Priyam Jha",
          "abstract": "Deepfake technology has emerged as a significant challenge to the authenticity and trustworthiness of digital media. This paper presents a comparative literature review of eight leading deepfake detection methods, including Spatiotemporal Convolutional Networks, PRNU-based Detection, Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Networks, Deep Learning-based Approaches, Transfer Learning models, Multimodal Detection techniques, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based frameworks. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and adaptability across benchmark datasets such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and UADFV.\n\nThe analysis identifies the Frequency Domain Filtered Residual Network as the most reliable framework, achieving over 98% accuracy and strong generalization on uncompressed data. Ethical and societal implications — including privacy, fairness, and transparency — are discussed to promote responsible AI research. The paper concludes by outlining strategies for improvement and future directions, including real-time detection, multimodal fusion, explainable AI, and privacy-preserving architectures. This comparative review serves as a reference point for advancing the reliability and accountability of deepfake detection systems in modern digital forensics.",

          "title": "A Netnographic Study on Social Mediation in Online Conflict between Day6 Fans and Mecima Pro",
          "authors": "Yati Khalala",
          "abstract": "Conflicts between K-Pop fans and concert promoters in Indonesia are increasingly gaining attention in the digital age, which has accelerated the flow of information. One recent case is the dispute between MyDay, the name given to Day6 fans, and promoter Mecima Pro regarding the Day6 concert at the GBK Madya Stadium on May 3, 2025. This study aims to analyze the role of social mediation in resolving digital conflicts between fanbases and promoters. The method employed is qualitative, utilizing a netnographic approach, which involves observing social media activities, discussion forums, and official statements from the promoter. The results of the study indicate that social mediation occurs organically through the roles of community actors such as fanbase administrators, fandom leaders, and online media. Communal solidarity and public pressure are the primary factors driving the promoter's response. This study emphasizes the importance of two-way communication and mediation based on equality within the digital cultural context.",

          "authors": "Jens Madsen; Panagiotis Tzirakis; Jeff Brooks; Alan Cowen; Dacher Keltner",
          "abstract": "Emotional experiences vary with culture, age, and sex, but whether such differences extend to expressions remains unclear. We tested 7,633 participants from 16 countries who privately watched silent, emotionally evocative videos. Participants reported their experiences using 48 categories while webcams recorded facial reactions, which we analyzed with a dynamic machine learning model. Participants from culturally adjacent regions reported similar emotional experiences, with clear differences between culturally disparate regions such as South America, Asia, and Europe. People’s emotional experiences became more similar with age among peers but differed across generations. Women and men reported similar experiences, particularly among older groups. In contrast, the average facial expressions evoked when people reported the same experience were highly consistent across countries, sexes, and ages. Together, these findings indicate that while emotional experience is shaped by cultural and demographic factors, facial expression remains relatively conserved across populations, suggesting a shared structure for how emotions are displayed even when they are experienced differently.",

          "abstract": "The Mere Exposure Effect  is an effect where repeated, unreinforced exposure to a stimulus leads to increased positive affect towards that stimulus. While the effect has been shown in static stimuli of person identity, such as faces, it is unclear if it applies to dynamic person identity representations such as human voices. In two studies (NS1 = 238 with spoken sentences, NS2 = 88 with spoken words) university students engaged in exposure, rating, and validation tasks. We observed increased liking of voices with 8 initial repetitions for the sentences. Voices initially presented 2 and 5 times were liked less than unfamiliar voices and recognised as familiar with less confidence than voices initially presented 8 times, forming an inverted “U” in likeability and familiarity. Less experience with the speaker’s accent weakened the inverted “U” in liking. Our words data are insufficient for inferential conclusions, but the sentences results indicate an uncanny valley of “familiarly unfamiliar” voices, which are more familiar than never heard stimuli but not familiar enough for the mere exposure effect of increased liking.",

          "authors": "Eleanor Brower Schille-Hudson; David Landy",
          "abstract": "By exploring the boundaries of systems, we learn about their capacities and their forms. We believe that studying edge cases of what human cognition can do is an important supplement to studying prototypical human cognition. This paper describes a class of experiences we call  induced sensory experiences, which we think are (1) rare, (2) trainable, and (3) singularly effective in certain kinds of problem solving. People consistently report non-drug-induced hallucination-like experiences in religious and spiritual contexts. These sensory experiences are often induced through explicit training and practice designed, in part, to invoke them. Here, we report the results of a survey extending this phenomenon to the case of professional and highly trained mathematicians. We document the prevalence of  powerful, sensory or quasi-sensory experiences of non-physical objects.  In short, we find them to be extremely common: Individual mathematicians nearly universally describe experiences and activities that closely match the pattern of induced sensory experiences. These sensory experiences can be seen as an achievement of mathematical thinking: they tend to develop with time and experience in a domain, and many participants find them to be unique in some way to mathematical thinking. These experiences were not reported to be rare. Mathematicians reported having meaningful amounts of control over their visualization.  Finally, explicit belief in the ‘reality’ of these objects was largely unrelated to any measures of sensory vividness or control. Altogether, we believe this work demonstrates how humans are able to build complex and abstract reasoning out of sensorimotor components through extensive training.",

          "authors": "Annabel Dare Gereau; Neil Mulligan",
          "abstract": "Retrieval practice improves memory compared to strategies such as restudying and is thought to do so in at least two ways — the direct testing effect (improved memory for tested material) and the forward testing effect (improved memory for material learned after a practice test). Recent research implies that many studies of “the testing effect”, though usually defined in terms of the direct testing effect, conflate direct and forward testing effects (Mulligan et al., 2022). This motivates a new meta-analysis on testing effects with free recall that distinguishes between studies capable of isolating the direct effect of testing (direct studies) from those susceptible to both direct and forward testing effects (mixed studies). The results show that the large majority (67%) of the “testing effects” are from mixed studies, confounding direct and forward testing effects, and only 33% are from direct studies, with mixed studies producing larger testing effects than direct studies. Furthermore, the mixed studies differed in terms of whether the purported forward testing contribution should act to increase, decrease, or have an intermediate effect on the observed testing effect. The effect sizes differed across the mixed subtypes confirming this characterization of the mixed effects as a confounded mixture of forward and direct testing effects. Separate moderation analyses were conducted for the direct and mixed effects further indicating differences between the two population of effects. The literature on the testing effect is not a coherent body and does not clearly tell us about a specific memory phenomenon. Rather, it is a mixture of direct and forward testing effects, in which the forward component sometimes increases, sometimes decreases, and sometimes has an intermediate influence on the observed testing effect.",

          "authors": "Connor Esterwood; Xin Ye; Ruijia Guan; Lionel P. Robert",
          "abstract": "The validity of using non-physically co-located (NPC) robots versus physically co-located (PC) robots in human-robot interaction research remains debated, with mixed empirical findings threatening study reliability and theoretical frameworks. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether robot interaction modality significantly affects human acceptance by analyzing 30 studies representing 1,944 participants across eight acceptance sub-dimensions. Using psychometric meta-analytic methods with corrections for sampling error and measurement unreliability, we found no significant overall effect of robot representation type on acceptance (r² = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.02, 0.16, k = 25). Non-significant effects emerged across acceptance sub-dimensions including attitude, trust, social presence, intention to use, perceived enjoyment, anxiety, and actual use, with effect sizes ranging from -0.13 to 0.16. Moderator analyses examining representation type (screen-based versus virtual reality), contextual factors (field of application, human role), and measurement type (objective versus subjective) failed to explain the moderate to high heterogeneity observed across studies. Publication bias assessment revealed relative symmetry, and risk of bias evaluation indicated moderate robustness across included studies. These findings challenge the embodiment hypothesis in human-robot interaction, suggesting physical co-presence may not provide presumed advantages over virtual representations, and support investigating when rather than if differences between robot modalities emerge.",

          "abstract": "Because most validated personality measures were designed to capture relatively general and stable characteristics, they do not specify a particular timeframe for respondents to consider. It is thus unknown how these measures perform when administered repeatedly or how this performance compares to the same measures with instructions and items adapted to the repeated timeframe of interest. We randomly assigned undergraduate participants (N = 257; Mage = 20.4; 79% female; 77% white; 77% heterosexual) to complete measures of personality (NEO-FFI-3, LPFS-BF-2.0, PID-5-BF, FFBI-SF) with validated general instructions and items or measures with instructions and items pertaining to the previous week once per week for six weeks. Compared to measures with general instructions, measures with weekly instructions demonstrated greater within-person internal consistency (weekly omegas: .42-.83; general omegas: .44-.72), lower rank-order stability (weekly average one-week r: .72; general average one-week r: .86), greater variability (ds: .08-.94), lower average mean scores across time (ds: –.96 - .25), and stronger associations with measures of anxiety and depression, well-being, and functioning but similar between-person internal consistencies (weekly omegas: .79-.99; general omegas: .79-.99) and measurement invariance. Researchers assessing personality weekly may thus be able to capture more variability and stronger associations with relevant constructs while still maintaining reliable individual differences and construct validity using personality measures referencing participants’ past week. However, nuances such as lower average scores when referencing the past week should be kept in mind when comparing results between studies using different reference time frames.",

          "abstract": "Mimicry, the automatic tendency to imitate others, informs our impressions of interaction partners in social situations. In recent years, researchers have expanded the study of social impression formation beyond impressions of a single individual and towards how we form impressions of multiple individuals through observing their interactions with each other. Mimicry, as a ubiquitous phenomenon of nonverbal social interaction, is very likely to play a part in the formation of such encounter-based impressions of multiple others. The mimicry and action response video library (MARVL) aims at expanding the possibilities of researchers to study third-party inferences based on observing behavioral mimicry and other nonverbal action-response patterns in dyadic interactions. It provides a set of interaction videos of multiple dyads, both male and female, addresses relevant confounds, and features movements both within and across effector systems (arm and leg movements). A planned set of studies that will be reported in following iterations of this preprint will aim to validate the MARVL and enable its use in studies on observed mimicry, action-response patterns, as well as social impression formation more generally.",

          "abstract": "This study examines emotional tone and linguistic framing in newspaper reports of violent crime, specifically in their evolution across two distinct periods (1995-2000 and 2020-2025) in the UK and USA. Using a mixed-methods design, 560 articles were analysed with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool, followed by critical discursive psychology (CDP) on a stratified subset of the data (N = 12). An exploratory factor analysis identified three linguistic factors: Social Moral Framing (SM), Evaluative Structure (ES), and Personal Expressiveness (PE) which were used to predict emotional tone through cross-temporal hierarchical regression. Quantitative results showed ES and PE to consistently predict emotional tone in both timeframes, whereas SM to be the strongest predictor only in the contemporary/later time frame. The qualitative analysis highlighted that recent reporting prioritises moralised and emotionally-charged narratives, with the origin country and political leaning influencing both the style and framing of information. The findings show a shift towards personalised and empathetic coverage from the earlier to the later time periods, providing implications for support regarding rehabilitation, public perceptions of crime, and punitive attitudes. Thus, the dual role of media is prevalent, as an informer and influencer, emphasising the need for ethically responsible reporting that considers psychological and societal impacts of violent crime narratives.",

          "abstract": "Cognition is not a static process but is subject to substantial and meaningful variation within individuals over time. This has led to an increase in studies that aim to describe cognition in daily life by sampling participants repeatedly and remotely. Such studies, which we call high-frequency cognitive assessment or HFCA, tend to use a limited number of brief cognitive tests. This focus on a small number of tests leaves open questions concerning the psychometric characteristics of a wide array of cognitive tasks useful for HFCA that can guide researchers on appropriate task selection. We developed the Cognitive Variability Battery (CVB) a series of 9 cognitive tests clustered into three distinct cognitive domains, attentional control, processing speed, and episodic memory. CVB was administered to participants 3 times per day for 3 weeks. Cognitive tests were rotated to reduce the length of any single testing session. Each test was administered up to 60 times. We provide detailed descriptions of the performance of each task including variability, skew, and reliability statistics using intraclass correlations. We examine the sensitivity of each test to several contextual factors including stress, affect and social interactions. Finally, we provide power analyses on each cognitive test to determine how many assessments and participants are needed to detect effects of interest. These analyses will be essential to anyone seeking to implement HFCA testing in their own research programs by providing guidance on which cognitive tests to select and how many participants and observations may be needed.",

          "authors": "Sascha Béla Duken; Evalotte Krause; Elske Salemink",
          "abstract": "Social anxiety represents a significant burden to well-being and is characterized by enhanced negative affect in social situations. Affective processes in anxiety are usually investigated as a single response that represents the overall magnitude of affect elicited by an event. However, social events and the emotions that they elicit unfold over time. Importantly, individual differences in temporal dynamics of affect within fear-relevant situations might explain differences in social anxiety symptoms. The first aim of this study was to develop a paradigm to quantify individual differences in within-situation affect dynamics. The second aim was to test whether affect dynamics were associated with social anxiety symptoms. 84 young adults with low to high social anxiety symptoms viewed movie clips of negative, positive, and neutral social situations. They continuously rated their affect while viewing the scenes, and we measured their negative and positive facial expressions over time with facial electromyography (fEMG). Consequently, we could quantify subjective and expressed affect dynamics in terms of intensity, variability, instability, and inertia. Our results showed that affect dynamics unfolded on the timescale of seconds and differed between positive, negative, and neutral situations. Crucially, individuals differed in subjective and expressed dynamics even when viewing the exact same situation. In contrast to our expectations, only intensity but no other affect dynamics was associated with social anxiety. We argue that for comprehensive insights into the affective processes that underlie social anxiety, future research should investigate affect dynamics within fear-relevant situations on short timescales and distinguish between different types of anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Cultural Consensus Theory (CCT) leverages shared knowledge between individuals to optimally aggregate answers to questions for which the underlying truth is unknown. Existing CCT models have predominantly focused on unidimensional point truths using dichotomous, polytomous, or continuous response formats. However, certain domains such as risk assessment or interpretation of verbal quantifiers may require a consensus focused on intervals, capturing a range of relevant values. We introduce the Interval Consensus Model (ICM), a novel extension of CCT designed to estimate consensus intervals from continuous bounded interval responses. We use a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to estimate latent consensus intervals. In a simulation study, we show that, under the conditions studied, the ICM performs better than using simple means and medians of the responses. We then apply the model to empirical judgments of verbal quantifiers.",

However, previous studies have tested the acquisition of past tense via corpus analysis or elicitation tasks, in which few items are tested, resulting in limited between-item variability. To overcome these weaknesses, we analysed data from a uniquely large and longitudinal dataset containing 191 verbs, collected via an educational online platform from 38,550 Dutch-speaking children aged 8-12 years old, an age range in which errors are still present. We examined whether form-frequency, phonological neighbourhood density (PND), their interaction and telicity predict the verb-specific difficulty of past tense forms in Dutch.  Our findings suggest a key role for form-frequency in the simple past and present perfect, while there is no evidence for PND and telicity.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness is a distressing subjective experience reflecting a lack of fulfilling social\nconnections. But why are some people more likely to experience loneliness than others?\nAttachment theory provides a possible explanation: stable patterns of emotions, cognitions,\nand behaviors rooted in early relationships shape the quality and stability of social\nrelationships throughout life, and consequently, the likelihood of experiencing loneliness.\nWhile previous research has consistently linked insecure attachment orientations to higher\nlevels of loneliness, important questions about the strength, robustness, and moderators of this\nassociation remain open. We addressed these gaps in a meta-analysis of bivariate correlations\nbetween loneliness and attachment orientations, using random-effects robust variance\nestimation. Across 91 publications, 108 independent samples, and 441 effect sizes, we found\na strong and robust association: individuals with higher attachment-related anxiety or\navoidance reported higher levels of loneliness (overall r = .38). Moderator analyses and\nrobustness checks revealed that this association holds across various populations and study\ncharacteristics, including age, gender, relationship status, and sample type. However, the\nstrength of the association varied depending on socio-cultural context and the attachment\nfigures considered. Moreover, we observed differences between loneliness facets and\nattachment dimensions, though these may also reflect scale characteristics rather than to\ngenuine conceptual distinctions. Overall, these findings highlight a substantial association\nbetween attachment insecurity and loneliness and suggest that targeting attachment-related\nvulnerabilities could be crucial for preventing or reducing loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is marked by instability in self-representation, self-regulation, and interpersonal functioning. These domains overlap with central functions of inner speech—the covert and typically conscious use of language. Examining how inner speech varies in BPD can therefore clarify its role in self-knowledge and metacognition, the sense of self, and self-regulation. We propose that specific dimensions of inner speech—such as egocentricity, intrusiveness, and valence—are systematically altered in BPD. Such alterations may both arise from, and in turn exacerbate, BPD symptoms. This perspective yields testable predictions and opens new avenues for understanding the role of inner speech in cognitive architecture.",

          "authors": "Tatiana Goregliad Fjaellingsdal; Konstantin Döhr; Greta Maria Zschoche; Ulrike M. Krämer",
          "abstract": "In social interactions, we constantly need to keep track of both, our own affective states and the affective states of others. We therefore employ mechanisms to distinguish between the mental representations of our own and others’ affective states, which is called affective self-other distinction. Affective self-other distinction may be less effective, leading to an emotional egocentricity bias or an emotional altercentric bias. Deficits in affective self-other distinction are characteristic of several psychopathologies, highlighting the need for reliable and valid measures to understand its cognitive, affective and neural basis. Here, we present a novel paradigm, which uses short videos of the other’s facial expressions, allowing for a direct perception of the other’s feelings, presumably challenging self-other distinction. In a series of studies (including in total n = 125 participants), we show that the paradigm successfully elicits emotional ego- and altercentric biases. Interindividual differences in the emotional egocentricity bias were stable over time, demonstrating that the paradigm can be used to reliably study interindividual differences in affective self-other distinction. The results also indicate that self-salience should be taken into account when interpreting interindividual differences in emotional biases. All paradigm materials are openly available, which will hopefully facilitate future research on affective self-other distinction. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on affective self-other distinction and expand it by elucidating the psychometric properties of emotional ego- and altercentric biases.",

          "authors": "Anaëlle Gonzalez; Darian Harff; Laura Vandenbosch",
          "abstract": "Adolescents’ favorite media actors (e.g., influencers, celebrities or sports stars) are known to share political opinions on their social media accounts amid their entertainment and lifestyle content. Through engaging political posts, these actors have the potential to empower the political self-efficacy beliefs of their (young) audiences, but research on such effects is missing. The effects of political content by mediated role models (short: MRMs) on adolescents’ political self-efficacy may further depend on the source (comparing influencers and celebrities/athletes) and users’ level of elaborate political information processing on social media. However, knowledge of these potential boundary conditions is lacking. A three-wave panel study among 648 French adolescents (Mage = 15.21, SDage = 1.89, 56.6% girls) in 2021-22 addressed these research gaps. The between-person results from the random-intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that higher trait-like levels of exposure to the political content of a favorite role model were significantly related to higher trait-like levels of political self-efficacy. None of the explored reciprocal relationships emerged on the within-person level, and neither the type of role model nor the elaborate processing of political information moderated the relationships.",

          "authors": "David James Greeno; Candice Coker Morey; Vencislav Popov",
          "abstract": "When people encode items into working memory, the time taken to complete a secondary task slows as the memory load increases but becomes faster during retention intervals. The findings are best explained by either a reconfiguration process needed only during encoding, or by a resource-depletion model in which encoding of each item drains cognitive resource that recovers during retention. We tested diverging predictions of these accounts with a running span complex span task. List-length was unpredictable, and participants had to recall only the most recently presented N memory items. According to the reconfiguration account, after N items are presented, response times for the secondary task should stabilize. This should occur because the amount of updating required at each memory item beyond N should be equivalent. According to the resource-depletion account, each new encoding event beyond N should continue to deplete a limited resource. This depletion results in a continued slowing of response times for the secondary task. Across four experiments, secondary task response times increased with each new memory item, even after the required memory load was reached. The only exception was with memory loads of 2 where secondary task response times plateaued after 2 items. These findings place limits on reconfiguration as a comprehensive explanation for short-term memory but are mostly in line with a modified resource-depletion account.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the emergence of conversational synchronization by examining both motion and language in a peer-talk corpus of 75 Hebrew-speaking children across five age groups (2;6-6;0). We use AI-driven tools to track children's physical proximity and their corresponding referential expressions. Quantitative analyses reveal that when children are closer together, they tend to use less explicit referential forms, whereas greater distance is associated with more explicit lexical forms. The relationship between distance and referential form usage is highly dynamic, with distinct patterns emerging at different developmental stages. The linear mixed-effects models reveal that children employ both stable, context-dependent usage patterns across all ages, and that some of these patterns undergo significant developmental change. This study demonstrates the power of integrating motion analysis with corpus-based linguistics to unravel the multimodal fabric of early peer interaction, illuminating how synchronized interaction evolves in parallel with communicative skills and underlying cognitive development.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Nicolas Thomas Vogel; Justine Stang-Rabrig; Philipp Jugert; Birgit Leyendecker; Nele McElvany",
          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

          "abstract": "Personality is highly consequential for important life outcomes, and many people are motivated to change aspects of their personality. This implies a high potential for volitional personality change interventions, which are on the rise. However, their effect sizes tend to be small and heterogeneous. A key reason may be that intervention designs remain largely disconnected from current work on dynamics relevant to personality change. We argue that personality interventions should be enriched by work on personality dynamics, which focuses on momentary states and their patterns (mean-level, variability, state-state associations, situational contingencies, temporal dynamics). We outline three opportunities for more effective personality interventions incorporating personality dynamics. First, dynamics can serve as novel targets of intervention, representing key mechanisms underlying personality change (e.g., decreasing stress reactivity in neuroticism interventions). Second, dynamics can be used to personalize interventions at a between-person level (e.g., promoting person-specific activities associated with desired states). Third, dynamics can be used as momentary within-person triggers of adaptive interventions (e.g., encouraging the planning of social activities following a day with little social contact). Key advantages of the proposed approach include potentially more effective, safer, and more inclusive interventions with stronger downstream effects on life outcomes. We provide guidance on the methodological implementation and discuss limitations and future directions. Ultimately, leveraging personality dynamics could enable a novel generation of personality interventions.",

          "abstract": "Parental burnout, which includes emotional exhaustion, emotional distance, and feeling fed up with parenting, is a chronic and potentially debilitating stress condition that has become highly prevalent in Western countries. Yet uncertainty remains about parents’ daily experience of burnout and how their experiences interact with their family environment. In this study, we surveyed a sample of 40 parents (who felt overwhelmed and exhausted by parenting) daily for eight weeks about their experiences of parental burnout, interactions with their children, and family environment, yielding 1541 total observations; main analyses focus on 36 mothers. We estimated a multilevel vector autoregressive model and created three distinct graphical networks to best reveal the dynamics of these interactions. All models point to interactions with children as a key determinant in the parent’s daily experience of parental burnout—particularly predicting emotional distance and feeling fed up. At the temporal level, parental burnout symptoms were characterized by strong self-prediction (autoregression). In addition, the severity of parental burnout was negatively correlated with daily variation of parental burnout features. Together, these results suggest that mothers in a severe state of burnout are less sensitive to their context, with the exception of interactions with their children.",

          "abstract": "Developing expertise when learning a motor sequence involves optimization of bodily movement. Although there is understanding of the stages of learning development from reactive responses to accurate and well-represented sequence performance, very little is known about the contribution of movement variability for learning. Fractal scaling can quantify the complexity of variability in learning behavior, yet motor sequence learning studies have not applied it. These results could offer valuable insights for profiling learners in real-world settings. The aim of this study was to understand fractal scaling differences in movement kinematics between learners of different expertise levels performing the Dance Discrete Sequence Performance task. We recorded Centre of Mass accelerations using a lower-body seven sensor setup with the Movella Xsens MVN Awinda and extracted Hurst Exponents of the accelerations as a representation of fractal complexity, between 11 High and 11 Low expertise learners (top 50% versus bottom 50% percentile). The results of the mixed effects models showed significant differences with increased fractal scaling during preparation, but decreased scaling during movement periods for the High expertise group. Our findings show that differences in fractal scaling can quantify motor learning expertise and their contribution to learning for different phases of the task.",

          "abstract": "Importance. The literature on paediatric gender-affirming care has paid little attention to non-binary young people’s clinical presentations, including their desires for gender-affirming interventions.\n\nObjective. To describe the gender-related presentation of non-binary children and adolescents first attending a paediatric gender clinic, exploring differences based on birth-registered sex and between young people with non-binary and binary identities.\n\nDesign. In this cross-sectional study, young people and a parent/caregiver completed online questionnaires prior to their first appointment between Feb 2017-Dec 2023. Analyses were conducted in January 2025.\n\nSetting. Multidisciplinary gender clinic at a public children’s hospital in Victoria, Australia. \nParticipants. Of those attending an initial appointment (n=2,303), those included in the analytic sample had available questionnaire data (n=2,138) and reported a gender identity that discorded with their birth-registered sex (n=1,745). \n\nMain Outcomes and Measures. Validated measures assessed gender dysphoria, body image, embodiment goals, gender-diverse behaviour, voice dysphoria and chest dysphoria. Gender identity was assessed on the Gender Slider, and social transition via reported changes to presentation, name and pronouns.\n\nResults. The ratio of non-binary to binary young people increased over time, from 1:6 in 2017 to 1:1.6 in 2023. The non-binary group exhibited high levels of body dissatisfaction (m=3.3; 95% CI=3.3,3.4) and gender dysphoria (m=42.0; 95% CI=41.2,42.8). They reported similar levels of gender dysphoria to binary young people (m diff=0.3; 95% CI=-2.3,2.9) and slightly less body dissatisfaction (m diff=-0.3; 95% CI=-0.4,-0.2). Among non-binary people, medical/surgical change to breasts was desired most frequently of all body characteristics (90.1%, n=263). Fewer non-binary than binary individuals reported desires to medically/surgically change their body characteristics [e.g. breasts (% diff=-7.5; 95% CI=-11.1,-3.9)]. Some differences were also observed between non-binary young people assigned female at birth and assigned male at birth [e.g., desire to change body hair (% diff=-39.1; 95% CI= -51.7,-26.5)]. Further between-group differences were observed regarding gender-diverse behaviour and social transition.\n\nConclusions and Relevance. Non-binary children and adolescents accessing gender-affirming care experience significant gender dysphoria, body dissatisfaction and desires for medical/surgical affirmation. While it is important for clinicians to be aware of potential differences in clinical presentation based on gender identity, an individualized, person-centered approach remains priority.",

To address this gap, we studied 72 socially anxious students who used our smartwatch–smartphone system for an average of nine days. The smartwatch collected multimodal physiological and behavioral signals (e.g., heart rate, movement), while the smartphone delivered seven randomly timed ecological momentary assessments per day to capture state anxiety. These multimodal data formed the basis for anxiety modeling. We present a weakly supervised multimodal framework that trains a base model on a public dataset, then transfers learning and personalizes predictions via meta-learning. Our model outperformed baselines, achieving 72.1% balanced accuracy on our dataset and 66.9% on an external dataset, demonstrating potential to support just-in-time-adaptive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Collective punishment has been applied to sanction and mitigate unethical or illegal behavior. While the use of this controversial mode of punishment might be justifiable from a consequentialist perspective, its effectiveness as well as factors affecting individuals’ endorsement of its use are largely unexplored. Focusing on dishonesty and rule breaking as two prominent examples of unethical and often illegal behavior, we herein address these gaps by testing the effectiveness and endorsement of collective punishment across six preregistered experiments and survey studies with samples from three countries (overall N = 11,020). Exploring the role of inter-individual differences, we tested whether the HEXACO dimensions and the Dark Factor of Personality (D) interact with the implementation of collective punishment in predicting dishonesty and relate to the endorsement of collective punishment (in context of the COVID-19 pandemic). Our results provide substantive evidence for the effectiveness of collective punishment. Further, both honesty-humility and D predicted dishonesty irrespective of the presence of collective punishment, while individuals high (vs. low) in emotionality reacted more to the implementation of collective punishment and more strongly endorsed its use. Combined, these results provide important implications for the evaluation and consideration of collective punishment, including the role of individual differences.",

          "abstract": "This article advances the debate on artificial intelligence (AI) use in education by moving beyond the mechanistic notion of prompt engineering and the human-centered focus of prevailing AI-literacy frameworks. We introduce prompting (l)iteracy, a sociotechnical capacity that is simultaneously iterative (built through cycles of prompt revision and reflection) and critical (attuned to the economic logics, linguistic hierarchies, and distributed agencies that shape AI dialogue). Four theoretical lenses scaffold the concept: (1) post-Fordist political economy explains how each prompt exploits commodified linguistic labor embedded in large language models; (2) Bourdieu’s linguistic-capital thesis illuminates the social inequities likely reproduced by differential prompting proficiency; (3) Latour’s actor-network theory highlights non-human agency, as humans do not only prompt AI, but they are also prompted by AI; and (4) de Certeau’s tactics foreground users’ creative appropriations and resistances. Vignettes of AI interactions illustrate these dimensions and expose the twin pitfalls of techno-solutionism and techno-pessimism. We argue that future research must abandon self-report surveys in favor of authentic, trace-centered mixed methods that record authentic prompt–response logs and machine telemetry. Prompting (l)iteracy thus offers a richer analytic lens for understanding, and ultimately mitigating, AI-mediated educational inequality.",

          "abstract": "Attentional bias to drug-related cues is widely considered a core feature of addiction, yet its empirical detection is highly sensitive to task design and stimulus selection. In this study, we used a computer mouse-tracking paradigm to examine attentional bias toward cigarette-related, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral images in 96 participants (49 smokers, 47 nonsmokers). Trajectory deviation, measured via maximum absolute deviation (MAD), served as an index of attentional bias. Both groups showed stronger bias for emotionally salient distractors, especially pleasant images, highlighting how the inclusion of emotionally matched control stimuli could reveal overlooked confounds in addiction research. Contrary to expectations, smokers did not exhibit greater attentional bias to cigarette cues than nonsmokers. Prior work has identified individual differences in cue reactivity among smokers. To investigate whether similar differences were present here, we applied k-means clustering to the MAD data. This analysis revealed two subgroups of smokers: one selectively biased toward cigarette cues, and another more reactive to pleasant stimuli. We replicated these results in an independent sample of 85 smokers. This dissociation aligns with prior neuroimaging findings, and suggests that the mouse-tracking paradigm may serve as a scalable, cost-effective tool for detecting reliable individual differences in reactivity to drug-related and non-drug-related pleasant stimuli.",

PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched from inception until September 2024. Peer-reviewed English publications were included if they reported on PA or diet and TDF constructs in relation to the menstrual cycle in biological female populations of reproductive age currently not suffering from conditions impairing PA or diet. Of 9,247 screened records, 36 were included, comprising 28 primary studies and 9 reviews. The TDF component of emotions was the most explored in both diet and PA studies, although the latter investigated a broader range of constructs (e.g., social influences, attention). The menstrual phase, pain and bleeding impaired PA and performance. The results on diet remained inconclusive. Small samples, cross-sectional designs, heterogeneity of menstrual cycle assessments and a lack of explicit sex-based recruitment limit generalizability. Gaps include several TDF constructs (e.g., self-efficacy). Longitudinal designs and objective assessments of the menstrual cycle and behaviours in larger heterogeneous samples are needed.",

          "abstract": "The number of available response options is a central design feature in any experimental psychology paradigm, with binary response paradigms restricting the range of behavioural responses into staying or shifting. Participants (n = 72) played nine blocks of a novel zero-sum game, Dice Dual, while we parametrically manipulated the different number of response options (2, 4, 6) against an unexploitable computerized opponent. When the number of responses exceeded two, this allowed us to identify two types of shift behaviours: between-category shifts relevant to mental model exploitation, and, within-category shifts reflective of random exploration. Between-category shifts were sensitive to outcome valence, exhibiting an increased shift rate when more response options were available after-win, while shift rates were independent of response availability after-loss. In contrast, within-category shifts were only sensitive to response availability, with increased shift rates when more response options were available, irrespective of outcome valence. Identifying multiple, functionally different classes of shift behaviour using non-binary response paradigms allows us to more easily separate attempts at exploitation and exploration. The data also offer more general models of performance regarding sub-optimal decision-making, where negative outcomes constrict the range of factors considered in future mental model updates.",

While familiar cues (e.g., size) readily support motor planning, it is unclear whether newly learned cues can enhance performance in demanding tasks. Understanding the predictive utility of novel cues has implications for sensory augmentation. We investigated this using a goal-directed hitting task, where participants earned a performance-based reward for squashing virtual bugs. Targets appeared briefly at unpredictable locations on a touchscreen, and participants used light and heavy containers to squash the bugs. Container weight was signaled with a familiar (visual volume), novel (checkerboard patterns), or no cue (identical containers). The number of bugs hit was highest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and smallest with no cue. Response time followed a corresponding pattern: movements were fastest with the familiar cue, followed by the novel cue, and slowest with no cue. No differences were found in precision, but constant bias was highest with the novel cue, followed by no cue, and smallest with the familiar cue. These findings demonstrate that novel cues, though less effective than familiar ones, can be rapidly integrated to guide efficient motor behavior, suggesting their potential for augmenting human performance in real-world tasks.",

          "abstract": "Personality pathology often emerges in adolescence—a period marked by increasing autonomy and complex peer dynamics —but its moment-to-moment interpersonal expression remains poorly understood. This preregistered, multi-informant ambulatory assessment study tracked 294 adolescents (58.5% female; ages 12–21) across 13,190 real-world interactions over 14 days. Using the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD), we examined how maladaptive traits (Criterion B) relate to interpersonal functioning (Criterion A), operationalized via momentary reports of mentalizing, enacted warmth and dominance, and perceptions of others’ warmth and dominance. Multilevel structural equation modeling revealed that self-reported maladaptive traits predicted lower perceived and enacted warmth, higher perceived and enacted dominance, and greater variability in all these processes, with informant reports showing similar but weaker patterns. Contrary to expectations, trait pathology was unrelated to average mentalizing but predicted greater fluctuations in mentalizing across interactions. Different pathological traits were associated with distinct patterns in how moment\nto-moment mentalizing related to interpersonal behavior, with some traits strengthening rather than weakening these associations. These domain-specific patterns indicate that personality pathology affects not only overall interpersonal functioning but also shows distinct coordination patterns between social cognition and behavior. Our findings illustrate how adolescent personality pathology manifests in everyday social interactions, highlighting the need for interventions that target both mean levels and variability in social processes to stabilize momentary social cognition and promote affiliation over control.",

Regression analyses revealed few differences in mental health severity and barriers to accessing campus services between most REM subgroups and white students. Most REM subgroups reported lower rates of substance use, greater awareness of campus services, and found services more helpful relative to white students. Sexually minoritized students reported greater severity of mental health symptoms and more barriers to accessing campus services relative to heterosexual students. Interactions between SGM and REM identities did not correspond with differing outcomes.

          "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates an association between social isolation and psychosis risk. In this perspective, we attempt to account for why that is. Drawing from work in social psychology, social neuroscience, and clinical psychological science, we present two frameworks for understanding the association between social isolation and psychosis risk: the social needs framework and the social processing framework. Social needs states that due to people’s inherent social needs, isolation produces increased social attention, perception, and thought to fill the social void, resulting in the perception of anomalous social information and social meaning. Social processing states that the lack of exposure to social stimuli during isolation diminishes social processing (i.e., social thought, social perceptions), and may lead isolated individuals to turn their attention inwards, blurring internal and external worlds in a way that creates reality monitoring disturbances and anomalous self-experiences. Conveniently, these frameworks can be empirically arbitrated. We review the literature connecting social isolation to psychosis, the frameworks, their empirical support, and the predictions they make. Ultimately, a better accounting of isolation’s pro-psychotic effects might lead to better efforts at psychosis prevention.",

          "abstract": "Slowing down one’s response speed following an error, also known as post-error slowing (PES), is a common phenomenon that has been observed in both adults and children as young as 3 to 4 years of age. Despite the pervasive nature of PES, its functional significance, developmental trajectory, and relation with error processing in middle childhood are still debated. This study examined how PES changes throughout middle childhood and relates to neural markers of error processing, Pe amplitude and midfrontal theta (MFT) power. Participants aged 5-12 years (n = 182, 41.8% = female) completed a task-switching paradigm where response times (RTs) and electrophysiological (EEG) data were collected. PES increased with age, primarily on repeat trials. Pe increased after errors in 11-12-year-olds, but not younger children, whereas MFT was elevated post-error across all age groups. MFT power modestly correlated with Pe and, importantly, predicted PES. Greater PES and more efficient error processing with age suggest that PES reflects adaptive adjustment of cognitive control. \nKeywords: Post-error slowing (PES), error monitoring, cognitive control, Pe, midfrontal theta power, middle childhood.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is typically characterized by executive dysfunction, yet emerging evidence points to spatially asymmetrical features of cognition. We examined whether transsaccadic working memory (tWM), the mechanism that integrates visual and motor signals across eye movements, shows directional vulnerability in ADHD. Participants with ADHD completed a spatial tWM task in which memory arrays (one or three items) were presented before leftward, rightward, or fixation trials, and repositioned a probe to the remembered target location. For comparison, data from a previously tested neurotypical sample were included in group-level analyses. Errors were decomposed into systematic and unsystematic components. Compared to controls, ADHD participants showed a modest but reliable rightward-saccade disadvantage, with greater systematic distortions after rightward than leftward eye movements. Saccades disrupted working memory in both groups, but the typical load-dependent increase in unsystematic error observed in neurotypical participants was absent in ADHD. Two complementary interpretations may account for this asymmetry. The integration-imbalance hypothesis attributes it to weakened right-hemisphere contributions to spatial working memory, which impair integration of left-hemisphere oculomotor and right-hemisphere spatial signals during rightward saccades. Alternatively, the anchoring-disruption hypothesis suggests that rightward eye movements destabilize the spatial scaffold anchoring remembered locations, producing geometric distortions without increased error. Together, these findings identify a direction-specific fragility of visuomotor-cognitive coupling in ADHD not explained by general capacity limits. More broadly, they reveal a partial neglect-like pattern of transsaccadic vulnerability: selective impairment for rightward saccades without a left-field deficit—highlighting the utility of oculomotor paradigms for revealing hidden spatial asymmetries in neurocognitive function.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Aphasia rehabilitation increasingly emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and ingredients underlying behavioral interventions. Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is a commonly-used intervention for anomia in aphasia but there is little evidence directly examining its active ingredients. Using within-trial responses during SFA, we sought to explore how generating semantic features might facilitate naming improvements. \n\nMethod: A retrospective analysis evaluated data collected from a clinical trial focused on intensive SFA treatment for individuals with chronic aphasia. The study included 44 adults with chronic aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. A pre-trained semantic model was used to estimate the semantic relatedness between  features and targets.\n\nResults: Participants were 2.6 (95% CI: [2.16, 3.12]) times more likely to correctly name target words after engaging in feature generation. Each additional feature generated was associated with a three percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4]) in the probability of a correct response at the end of the trial; a one standard deviation increase in semantic similarity (i.e., feature quality) was associated with a six percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.4, 0.10]). Model comparison favored semantic similarity over feature generation count in predicting final response accuracy.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide converging evidence that semantic feature generation is an active ingredient in SFA treatment, emphasizing the importance of feature quantity and semantic quality, consistent with a spreading activation account of SFA’s benefits. Further research is warranted to validate relatedness values from semantic model embeddings, and to explore the relationship between within-trial feature generation and generalization to semantically related but untreated words.",

          "abstract": "Aims: It is generally believed that the younger the age of first alcohol consumption, the higher the risk of developing physical/psychosocial alcohol related problems, but not all studies support this association. Differences among findings may stem from heterogeneity in the definitions of alcohol initiation and its operationalization. This problem has already been recognized in the literature, but it is unclear whether recent studies have taken steps to improve this issue. In this context, we investigate current practices in inquiring about alcohol initiation. Methods: Our goal was to obtain a representative sample of recent publications and to review the questions used to assess alcohol initiation in studies with children/adolescents. To that aim, we searched PubMed for empirical studies published between 2018 and 2024 on early alcohol use and which claimed to have assessed alcohol initiation. Findings: Our search returned a total of 523 documents, of which 59 met our eligibility criteria. Overall, the questions used to assess what constituted alcohol initiation varied widely in terms of the quantity of alcohol consumed, from just one or a few sips to at least a full drink, with some studies having no definition of alcohol initiation and many failing to define alcohol and/or doses. Only 17 studies enquired about context of use, focusing on excluding drinking in religious ceremonies and parental consent. Conclusion: Definitions of alcohol initiation remain highly heterogeneous and sub-optimal in terms of clarity in respect of the quantity/context of alcohol consumption. We suggest a comprehensive and standardized set of questions to change this state of affairs.",

This study introduces and supports the Flourishing Fit Model, a multi-level framework proposing that well-being reflects coherence across behavioral, motivational, and dispositional levels of functioning. Using both person (N=392) and activity (N=1,179) level data, preregistered analyses tested whether hedonic and eudaimonic well-being emerge from alignment among these systems rather than from their independent effects. Type of activity engaged in showed no significant main effects (ps &gt; .15), whereas hedonic and eudaimonic motives were associated with corresponding forms of well-being (βs = .34–.59, ps &lt; .001). We found a motive–orientation congruence interaction for social well-being (β = .14, p = .015), and four small but interpretable personality–motive interactions (βs = ±.03–.09, ps &lt; .05) indicated that traits such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism calibrate motivational benefits. Collectively, the findings suggest that motivational coherence may represent a particularly consistent pathway to flourishing, advancing an understanding of well-being that sets the stage for further longitudinal tests of flourishing fit.",

We found discrepant decreasing and increasing prospective effects and a meta-analytic aggregation of these discrepant effects did not differ significantly from zero. Moreover, a good fit of the spurious prospective associations model (SPAM) indicated that the meta-analytic data may have been generated without any direct effects between peer relationships and internet addiction. Hence, we conclude that the meta-analytic data does not support conclusions of decreasing prospective effects between peer relationships and internet addiction.

          "authors": "Michael L DeKay",
          "abstract": "People’s choices involving money, health, and other matters can often be steered toward safer or riskier options by framing the options as gains or losses. This risky-choice framing effect is well established, but its direction and magnitude depend on whether the options are described completely or incompletely and whether the descriptions are matched or mismatched (in terms of good and bad outcomes) in the gain and loss frames. In a recent experiment involving 18 combinations of option descriptions (nine in each frame), DeKay and Dou (2024) found that the valence or gist of the descriptions accounted for substantial variation in risk preferences, favoring categorical theories of framing over more mathematical theories. However, a residual framing effect and a framing effect in choices between completely described options contradicted the categorical theories and previous results. The effect for completely described options was especially surprising, but it was based on data from only 97 participants. The experiment reported here replicated all these effects in a large sample (N \"=\" 1,697) well-matched to U.S. Census data and with many more participants (477) making choices between completely described options. Risky-choice framing effects do stem partly from mismatched option descriptions, but a framing effect persists even when descriptions are matched and complete. The latter results expand the effect’s relevance to situations where it was thought to be absent. Among several theory specifications, only a new rescaled version of the explicated valence account explains these effects in the replication and in DeKay and Dou’s online and student samples.",

Additionally, we found that participants' rating of a sentence's perceived rhythmicity predicted response times to the sentence. Our studies offer evidence for the special role of rhythmicity in its different aspects for coordinating and speeding up the turn transfer in communication.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and wearable devices afford opportunities to collect real-time data on events experienced in daily life. Examples of event-based data in the psychological and behavioral sciences include smoking a cigarette, experiencing a stressor, having a disruption to sleep, experiencing a depressive or manic episode, drinking an alcoholic beverage, or engaging in a bout of exercise. The increasing availability of dense sampling approaches allows for the measurement of such events at relatively fast time-scales (e.g., occurring across minutes, hours, days, or weeks), expanding the possibilities for how time can be conceptualized and modeled. Survival analysis is a modeling approach that allows researchers to address scientific questions regarding whether and when events occur in time. Although not often applied to EMA data, there are myriad research questions relevant to psychosocial and behavioral scientists which can be addressed using survival analysis. This article provides an overview of survival analysis, describes several time-based considerations for modeling event-based EMA data using survival analysis, and provides several illustrative examples of the different time-based considerations. Altogether, the goals of this article are to enhance knowledge of the types of research questions that can be examined using survival analysis, to illustrate nuances of applying the method to EMA data, and to spark ideas for future empirical and methodological research.",

This study therefore qualitatively explored maternal cognitive changes through the lens of matrescence as an adaptive developmental process, without a deficit-focus. Eight mothers took part in one-to-one audio recorded semi-structured online interviews, in the United Kingdom, during December 2024. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to examine participants’ lived experiences, resulting in three overarching themes (1) the overloaded brain (2) thinking beyond the self (3) solidarity. The findings highlight that maternal cognition cannot be fully understood through objective measures alone. Societal expectations and the availability of meaningful support inform how mothers makes sense of their experiences, making cognitive changes inseparable from their social context.",

Consequently, we’ve iteratively developed a variation of Heyman and Vanpaemel’s model in which students choose their own effect/dataset for an individual multiverse capstone project. \nObjective: To evaluate student-led individual multiverse capstone projects. \nMethod: One cohort of five project students qualitatively reflected on designing, running, and reporting an individual multiverse project in a small group supervision context. We thematically analysed these reflections.\nFindings: Two themes captured (a) the factors promoting project success (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual) and (b) the outcomes of a multiverse capstone project (the range of skills developed and multiverse’s potential contributions to psychology).\nConclusion: Individual multiverse projects are a meaningful, desk-based alternative to traditional capstone projects, and address many key undergraduate research methods learning outcomes.\nTeaching Implications: We propose an evidence-based ‘recipe’ for successful individual multiverse projects.

This dataset included 9,159 speech acts by 68 unique politicians. The results showed that, although most speech acts were classified as civil, the prevalence of political incivility in Dutch televised election debates did increase in the second half of the investigated time period. In addition, incivility was associated with the speaker’s party’s populism, but not gender and incumbency status, and was more likely when a previous comment had been uncivil. Finally, incivility was more prevalent in debates or debate segments featuring only two, rather than three or more, politicians. Potential causes of the increase of incivility in recent years, such as the rise of populism, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Construal level theory (CLT) proposes that psychological distance influences the level of abstraction at which something is mentally construed: things perceived as less probable (likelihood) or further away from the here (spatial distance), now (temporal distance), or self (social distance) are thought about more abstractly. This international multi-lab study tests four basic hypotheses derived from core assumptions of CLT and explores potential moderators and boundary conditions of the effects. Participants (N = 11,775) from 27 countries and regions were randomly assigned to one of four experimental protocols focused on different types of psychological distance (temporal, spatial, social, or likelihood), and each experiment manipulated psychological distance (close vs. distant). The protocols for temporal distance (N = 2,941) and spatial distance (N = 2,973) were direct replications of Liberman and Trope (1998, Study 1) and Fujita et al. (2006, Study 1), respectively. The remaining two protocols were paradigmatic replications, applying to social distance (N = 2,926) and likelihood (N = 2,936). The effects of psychological distance on construal level for the four present studies were (original effects within parentheses; positive effects are consistent with hypotheses): dtemporal = 0.08, 95% CI [0.003, 0.16] (cf. d = 0.92); dspatial = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.11] (cf. d = 0.55); dsocial = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.19]; and dlikelihood = 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.11]. Pretests indicated that valence and abstraction were confounded in response options on the outcome measure. Controlling for this confound eliminated the hypothesis-inconsistent effect of social distance, d = 0.006, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.07].

          "abstract": "Objective: Mental health concerns are rising, particularly among post-secondary students, who may lack access to traditional therapeutic resources due to barriers like long wait times and high costs. To help address these challenges, we explored the potential of large language model-based chatbots for supporting mental health and wellbeing in student populations.\n\nMethods: We conducted two studies, lasting one week and four weeks, to examine the effectiveness of chatbot interventions over different durations. Both studies compared two chatbot interventions—one mindfulness-focused and one value-focused—against an active check-in-only control condition. The primary outcome measure was the improvement in wellbeing through the mindfulness-to-meaning (MM) pathway, a process in which enhanced decentering, the ability to see one’s experience from a wider perspective, leads to improved positive reappraisal, the ability to find constructive and empowered interpretations of experience.\n\nResults: All conditions showed evidence of stress reduction. However, compared to the active control group, both intervention styles at both durations resulted in improved wellbeing via the MM pathway. This effect was primarily driven by significant improvements in decentering. For the longer duration only, we also observed enhanced reappraisal. \n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the potential of chatbot-based interventions to support the development of regulatory skills by leveraging the MM pathway to enhance mental health. Educational institutions and mental health providers might consider integrating such tools into scalable and accessible student support systems, addressing a broader and more diverse audience while promoting sustained wellbeing through skills development.",

          "abstract": "It is becoming common to repeatedly measure cognition over short intervals in order to capture dynamic fluctuations over time, which can be substantial. It is currently unknown whether daily deviations in cognitive performance have implications for real-world behaviors or merely reflect short-term change of limited scope, perhaps due to assessment artifacts. Daily driving behavior was captured in a group of adults using GPS tracking and participants also completed daily repeated assessments of high frequency cognitive testing. Multilevel negative binomial models were constructed to relate daily cognitive performance to adverse driving events (e.g., speeding or hard braking). Results indicate that on days when cognition is poor relative to the participants’ average functioning, incidence of adverse events increased. Global cognitive ability did not predict driving behavior. These results show that deviations in cognitive performance are not merely “noise”, as they have measurable implications on real-world outcomes that may have implications for driver safety.",

Some programs such as 4-H and FFA center around youth interacting with animals, potentially enhancing youth development. Mueller (2014) investigated whether these interactions and attitudes about animals influenced measures of positive youth development. The aim of our studies was to replicate Mueller’s methods and extend her work by evaluating whether membership in animal-focused youth programs moderate any associations between interactions, attitudes, and positive youth development. We did not find strong relationships among human-animal interaction and positive youth development, which failed to replicate Mueller’s findings. However, we did find relationships between animal attitudes and positive youth development, replicating Mueller’s findings. Membership in animal-focused youth programs did not moderate any observed effects. Thus, though animal attitudes are associated with positive youth development, membership in a youth program does not seem to enhance these relationships, and human-animal interactions do not seem to have strong associations with positive youth development.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by heightened emotionality. Past research indicated that the biased interpretation of social situations (i.e., interpretation bias) might contribute to these aberrant affect dynamics in adolescents’ daily life. Social situations are, however, constantly changing. Therefore, the ability to flexibly revise social interpretations (i.e., interpretation flexibility) might be equally important as interpretation biases for explaining affective outcomes during adolescence. The present study examined whether interpretation bias and inflexibility predicted two major affect dynamics features (i.e., mean and standard deviation) in children and adolescents. At baseline, N = 154 children and adolescents (M = 12.81 years; 48.70% female; 49.35% male; 1.95% non-binary; 72.08% White) completed a task assessing bias and inflexibility in interpreting social situations. Then, for 28 days, participants rated their positive and negative affect. Results showed that inflexibility in revising positive and negative interpretations in light of disconfirming evidence predicted higher intensity of negative affect. When controlling for interpretation inflexibility, positive interpretation bias predicted higher positive affect, whereas negative interpretation bias was associated with more variable negative affect. The results emphasize the predictive utility of interpretation biases and inflexibility for daily affective experiences in youths.",

The present study uses longitudinal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to characterize different NPS trajectories, their association with cognitive impairment, and white matter microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles as a possible biomarker of NPS progression. \nMETHODS: We assessed the association of different trajectories of NPS identified though growth mixture models with cognitive decline and white matter microstructure changes over the course of two years. \nRESULTS: Four classes of NPS trajectories were identified in 785 individuals. These classes predicted cognitive decline over time but were unrelated to changes in the microstructure of the cerebellar peduncles in a subsample of 60 individuals for whom sufficient longitudinal neuroimaging data was available. \nDISCUSSION: There are substantial individual differences in NPS trajectories. Distinguishing classes of NPS trajectories is important to predict cognitive decline.",

Many believe that intracortical axons conduct signals\ntoo slowly to bring the contextual information from receptive fields of other neurons.\nA popular opinion is that much of the contextual influences arise from feedback\nfrom higher visual areas whose neurons have larger receptive fields.\nThis paper re-examines pre-existing data to reveal these unexpected findings:\nthe conduction speed of V1 intracortical axons increases approximately linearly\nwith the conduction distance, and is sufficiently high for conveying the contextual\ninfluences.

Given the multiple modalities available in these videos, understanding how design choices impact learning is essential for optimising educational practices.    \nAims: This study aims to explore how the instructor’s use of gestures as well as student motivation and allocation of visual attention influence learning from instructional videos. Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. \nSample: Participants were 135 Undergraduate Psychology students.  \nMethods: Participants completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. They were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Self-reported motivation was measured.  \nResults: Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation differed depending on whether gestures were present: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning gains primarily when they also reported higher motivation to study further, whereas the presence of gestures was associated with more consistent learning gains across motivation levels. \nConclusion: These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "abstract": "Artificial neural networks achieve impressive success in many vision tasks. Nevertheless, previous work has suggested that their representation of geometric shapes only partially captures the representations found in humans, who additionally require a symbolic “language of geometry”. In this study, we evaluate the progress in this area by systematically comparing human performance in three geometric shape perception tests, with the predictions of recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers, varying in size, training datasets and training methods, to recognize and process geometric shapes and compare these representations to the ones found in humans. In two tasks probing quadrilateral and geometric shape perception, introduced by Sable-Meyer et al. (2022, 2025), recent neural networks exhibit representations similar to humans and predict human performance better than a symbolic model. In a third task, involving geometric drawings, the networks still fell short of human performance. Across the three experiments, the main factor driving similarity between human and neural network representations was the size of the training dataset, rather than a specific architecture or the number of parameters of the model. Together, our results show that a massive scaling-up of the training data helps neural networks approximate human-like representations of geometric shapes, but that they still fall short of fully capturing the human representations of geometric shape.",

          "abstract": "Screening abstracts is a crucial yet labor-intensive step in research synthesis projects such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise an opportunity to streamline and automate this process. However, there is currently little experience or practical insight into how such automated workflows can be implemented in research practice. In this article, we illustrate an LLM-based abstract screening workflow using a set of human-rated abstracts from a recent meta-analysis. We describe how we developed and evaluated different prompting strategies and structured output formats, compared the performance of multiple LLMs, quantified model uncertainty, and automated the entire workflow within the R environment. We also provide R scripts and implementation guidance to support psychological researchers in adopting LLM-based workflows for research synthesis. Our comparisons show how different types of LLMs vary in accuracy relative to human raters, and how prompting strategies and hyperparameter settings affect model performance and uncertainty. We demonstrate that LLM-assisted screening can substantially reduce the time and cost of review preparation while maintaining accuracy comparable to human raters. At the same time, we emphasize that this work represents an initial step, and that continued refinement and validation are essential as LLM technologies and their applications continue to evolve rapidly.",

          "abstract": "Games offer a unique way to study human behavior by extending traditional lab-based research into more complex, naturalistic, yet highly controllable settings. A key feature of games is their potential to reframe failure as a learning opportunity, supposedly leading to persistent engagement and competence. This study empirically tested this idea by developing a platformer game in two versions: one with regular checkpoints (resulting in less negative consequences of failure) and one without (resulting in more negative consequences of failure, i.e., having to restart the level). Among 172 participants, those randomly assigned to the checkpoint condition completed more levels of the game on average, but were less committed to individual reward opportunities within each level. Importantly, they also reported significantly lower frustration and higher perceived competence, an essential predictor of intrinsic motivation, compared to participants in the condition without checkpoints. Subjective frustration of the basic need for competence partially mediated game-induced frustration, suggesting that reducing negative consequences of failure facilitates reframing failure as a learning opportunity. These findings illustrate how game design can reduce frustration and enhance motivation and engagement.",

          "authors": "Michelle Achterberg",
          "abstract": "Experience Sampling Method (ESM) research, relying on real-time data collection via mobile devices,  provides unique insights into adolescents’ daily lives. However, concerns about digital distraction and overstimulation have led to shifting societal norms and consequently, increased restrictions on smartphone use—both institutionally (e.g., school bans) and informally (e.g., parental rules, self-regulation). These constraints raise questions about the feasibility and ecological validity of using ESM in adolescent samples. In this study, 195 adolescents (Mage = 16.12) participated in a 17-day ESM protocol, completing six prompts daily. Most adolescents reported facing school-based (88%) and parental (56%) smartphone restrictions. Despite these constraints, compliance was moderate to high (M = 78%), and analyses of nonresponse patterns revealed when and why prompts were most likely to be missed. Early morning prompts were often missed due to sleep, late morning prompts due to school, and evening prompts due to work—highlighting the importance of context-sensitive sampling strategies. Moreover, data quality was high: careless responding was rare, and participants reported high levels of integrity and motivation. Most participants evaluated the study as positive, with financial incentives, scientific contribution, and social connection as key motivators. These findings underscore that adolescent ESM studies remain feasible and ecologically valid when protocols are flexibly aligned with real-world constraints. Given that societal norms on digital well-being are in flux and smartphone restrictions intensify, aligning ESM design with adolescents’ everyday realities becomes increasingly essential to preserve both feasibility and ecological validity in research on adolescence.",

In two experiments (preregistered; N=1320), we investigated how incidental character information influence moral and causal judgments. Participants judged bad agents to be more blameworthy, more causal, and more deserving of punishment than good agents for committing the same act. This effect was robust across how the information was presented (Experiment 1) and different moral domains (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that moral character exerts a domain-general influence on judgments, challenging the view that only traits that are similar or congruent to a subsequent act influence blame.",

These issues are considered in the context of previous research, with renewed attention to the perceived distinctions between different types of services.\nThe data were collected through questionnaires adapted from previous studies, in which participants evaluated statements on a five-point Likert scale, where 5 indicated the highest level of agreement.\nThe findings of the study demonstrate high reliability across all measurement indicators. In the second experiment, age was negatively associated with attitudes toward online shopping, while showing a positive association with attitudes toward shopping in physical stores. The third experiment revealed a negative correlation between attitudes toward online and in-store shopping, consistent with prior research and reinforcing the stability of the assessment instruments employed in this study.",

In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates intelligence-related differences in the adjustment of brain activity and connectivity to varying cognitive demands, testing for a moderation of an association between intelligence and neural efficiency by task difficulty. In 72 young adults (34 female, 38 male), fMRI brain activity changes during a decision-making task with five levels of difficulty were related to intelligence scores from a non-verbal matrix reasoning test. In fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions activated during task processing, we observed smaller increases in brain activity in more intelligent participants – independent of task difficulty. However, in two regions of the default mode network, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and left angular gyrus (AG), more intelligent participants showed greater decreases in activity with increasing task difficulty. Furthermore, with increasing difficulty, more intelligent participants showed greater increases in functional connectivity of DMPFC and AG. These findings suggest a more dynamic adjustment of neural processing to varying cognitive demands in more intelligent individuals. Particularly when it comes to more difficult tasks, more intelligent people seem to be better able to down-regulate activity in the brain's default mode network. Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings must be considered preliminary. While their interpretation should therefore be treated with caution, they suggest conceptually new avenues for replication in larger samples. As far as the observed processes reflect the suppression of task-unrelated neural processing and a better focus on the task at hand, they can potentially explain the general performance advantage of more intelligent individuals across various cognitive tasks.",

          "abstract": "Reliability is a key concept in psychology that has been broadly studied since the introduction of Cronbach's alpha, which is a measure of the internal consistency of a test. Despite its importance, this is a topic that is relatively understudied when dealing with intensive longitudinal data. In particular, when studying the psychological dynamics of affective states, there is no warranty that intensive longitudinal measurements are reliable. Given this, empirical researchers need tools to study and report the reliability of the scales used in intensive longitudinal research. In recent years, different approaches to estimate the reliability of the scales and the items used when studying psychological dynamics have been proposed. However, the advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods are unclear, making it difficult to determine when a certain approach would be preferred over the others. Specifically, these approaches estimate reliability indices based on different statistical models, such as linear multilevel analysis, vector autoregressive models, and dynamic factor models. Furthermore, while some methods involve estimating one reliability index for the scale that applies to the whole sample, others estimate person-specific reliability indices. This wide variety of approaches can provoke some confusion for empirical researchers. In this paper, we aim to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used to estimate the reliability of intensive longitudinal data. We also showcase their application with empirical data.",

This qualitative study explores how 20 adolescents in a low-income, semi-rural South African community navigate the double-edged nature of social media. Drawing on in-depth interviews, we show how offline violence, gendered power dynamics, and structural inequalities are entangled with online experiences, creating overlapping risks that amplify existing vulnerabilities. At the same time, social media is a source of entertainment, belonging, and glimpses of alternative futures, particularly for adolescents with personal smartphone access. Digital literacy in this context is largely informal and reactive, shaped by peers and trusted adults rather than formal education. These findings contribute to debates on adolescent online risks and digital inequality by showing how local contexts structure both the benefits and harms of social media as well as the forms of digital competence that develop. We argue that understanding adolescent digital life requires attention to structural adversity, everyday social dynamics, and the interdependence of online and offline worlds.",

          "abstract": "Despite their wide application, designing Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies remains challenging partly due to complex and interdependent methodological decisions, such as sampling schedules, response formats, and technological platforms. The existing literature provides valuable frameworks but often mentions methodological options without concrete examples; this article aims to bridge this gap in practical guidance. Informed by the existing ESM literature, we illustrate our decision-making process while designing an ESM study on the temporal associations between momentary life meaning, eating disorder symptoms, and negative affect. While grounded in our specific research questions, this paper provides practical guidelines on how to decide among various methodological options for researchers across psychological fields. We outline key decisions, practical considerations, and challenges encountered during the study’s development. Our paper provides a practical checklist to support researchers in designing ESM studies from scratch and in reporting essential aspects in their manuscripts, promoting transparency and replicability. By illustrating a real-life example of setting up our own study, we aim to guide researchers in navigating the complexities of ESM design.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study evaluated barriers and facilitators to implementing, delivering, and participating in an enhanced smoking cessation service for individuals with severe mental illness (SMI). The service, delivered across four pilot sites in the North East and North Cumbria (NENC) of England between April 2023 and March 2024, used a primary care referral model and a 20-week ‘cut down to quit’ approach combining behavioural and pharmacological support.\nMethods: A mixed methods approach was used, including analysis of aggregated recruitment and outcome data, coding documents for Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), a quantitative survey with purposively recruited service providers (n = 20), and qualitative interviews with service providers (n = 14) and service users (n = 4). The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behaviour (COM-B) model informed survey and interview design and analysis. A purposively recruited Lived Experience Advisory Panel (LEAP) (n = 6) contributed to protocol development, study materials, and interpretation of findings.\nResults: In Pilot Sites A and B, nearly half of service users who set a quit plan had quit smoking at 28 days (~45%). Documentary analysis found the most common BCTs were pharmacological support, adding objects to the environment, and restructuring the environment. Survey findings indicated that providers had the capability, opportunity, motivation, and intention to deliver the service and found it acceptable, though perceptions of required effort varied. Interview findings showed that facilitators for service implementation were primarily linked to motivation (e.g., positive user feedback, staff motivation), whereas barriers were linked to capability (e.g., data recording) and opportunity (e.g., primary care links). For service delivery and participation, facilitators linked to capability (e.g., tailoring support, understanding social determinants) and motivation (e.g., benefits of quitting, goal setting).\nConclusions: Service delivery was perceived as effective due to flexibility and tailored support. Recommendations for improving service implementation should focus on strengthening primary care engagement and referral pathways, enhancing training and skills development for Stop Smoking Advisors, and improving data management systems and evidence gathering early in implementation. Future research should engage more service users and referrers to better understand barriers to service implementation and participation.",

The sample comprised 324 two-wave longitudinal cases collected over two decades of mixed-method research in the USA and Germany, with an average interval of 7.39 years (SD = 4.34) between assessments. Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength. The findings further suggest that faith development and religiosity may follow different pathways, underscoring the need for future qualitative inquiry into the diverse biographical trajectories of faith development.",

          "abstract": "Self-other relations are fundamental in shaping an individual’s mind and health. Two principal aspects of the social self can be distinguished. Intersubjectivity comprises empathy and other relational phenomena, whereas subjectivity includes an intrapersonal sense of agency and identity. We hypothesized that individual differences in sociality, in particular friendships and loneliness, depend not only on interpersonal factors, but also on intrapersonal personality features. We administered a comprehensive set of psychometric questionnaires to a random sample of non-clinical, young adults. Relational outcome variables concerned personal experiences of friendship and loneliness. Factor analysis confirmed the duality of latent intrapersonal and intersubjective factors. The results showed that intrapersonal traits exert a critical influence on friendships and loneliness of healthy young adults, independent of intersubjective factors and COVID-19 pandemic effects. A low sense of agency together with high psychotic-like experiences and schizotypal traits strongly predicted less friendships and more loneliness. Our study empirically supports a central role of self-concept in individual sociality. These findings provide a novel perspective on low social life quality combined with possible subclinical alterations of self-experience. The results also offer potential contributions to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies for psychopathological conditions associated with both self-disturbances and social deficits.",

          "abstract": "Background. Emotion regulation is a multidimensional construct that is robustly linked to emotional disorders yet remains underexplored in multiple sclerosis (MS), with no studies to date addressing individual differences in emotion regulation difficulties in this population. To address this gap, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct profiles of emotion regulation difficulties in an MS sample. \n\nMethods. Participants were 259 people with MS (Mage = 42.79, 78.8% female). Participants completed an online survey measuring emotion regulation difficulties and symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), health anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Emotion regulation was specified as the indicator variable in the LPA, with the additional measures of depression and anxiety utilised to validate the identified profiles.\n\nResults. Three emotion regulation profiles were identified: low impairment (n = 66, 25.48%) characterised by minimal difficulties regulating negative emotions across all domains; global dysregulation (n = 71, 27.41%) characterised by pronounced difficulties in all domains; and goal-impaired regulators (n = 122, 47.10%) characterised by distinct challenges maintaining goal-directed behaviours. Individuals in the global dysregulation profile endorsed the greatest symptom severity on measures of depression and PTSD but reported comparable levels of GAD and health anxiety relative to the goal-impaired regulators.\n\nConclusion. People with MS exhibit distinct emotion regulation profiles, revealing critical subgroups with varying psychological needs. Tailoring psychological assessments and treatments to these profiles can enhance the management of depression and anxiety and potentially improve disease outcomes in people with MS.",

However, research findings on this topic are sometimes inconsistent or conflicting, probably due to diverse conceptualisations of social support components and heterogeneous measures of social support. This narrative review identifies and describes core types of functional social support relevant to mental health and wellbeing. Three literature searches across three databases were used to select papers reporting taxonomies of social support, social support questionnaires, and reviews of social support. A taxonomy of social support types was constructed using inductive qualitative synthesis. Five core types of social support were identified and described: (1) emotional support, (2) social contact and companionship, (3) belonging support, (4) information and guidance support, and (5) tangible support. Emotional and tangible support were most frequently identified. Core elements of emotional support are opportunities for confiding provided by sympathetic listening and caring, which included affectionate support and esteem support. These five types of social support provide a robust set of criteria for informing the development of social support interventions and assessing the adequacy of social support measures.",

          "abstract": "Overgeneral autobiographical memory (OGM), the inability to recall specific events and instead recall general memories, is a well-known feature of psychopathology. Although OGM has been regarded as a deficit in generative retrieval, recent studies highlight the role of direct and involuntary (associative) retrieval in OGM. We propose the accessibility model, which discards the hierarchical structure of autobiographical memory and truncated search hypothesis. The accessibility model assumes that memory representations of different specificities are structured in parallel, and compete to be retrieved. The model contends that direct and generative retrieval are serial processes (i.e., direct retrieval initially, followed by generative retrieval), and specific and general memory accessibility each affect OGM. We argue that increased accessibility of negative general memories and decreased accessibility of positive specific memories underlie OGM in depression. These changes in accessibility are differentially associated with hippocampal abnormalities, memory suppression, self-referential processing, and positivity biases, suggesting different mechanisms depending on emotional valence. Furthermore, we propose that metacognitive monitoring and control are required to initiate generative retrieval when retrieved memories are goal inconsistent. The accessibility model integrates existing basic memory and OGM research, which may lead to improved memory therapeutics, and new avenues for research development.",

This mixed-methods study combines two survey datasets (N₁ = 69; N₂ = 44) with fifteen expert interviews to examine the cognitive, affective, and professional determinants of AI trust. Quantitative analyses indicate that prior AI experience, perceived transparency, and emotional comfort predict willingness to trust AI-assisted decision-making, while accountability is consistently attributed to humans. Qualitative analysis identifies seven recurring themes: emotional reasoning, meta-cognition, AI-augmented creativity and innovation, algorithms codifying injustice, radical skepticism, heuristics and cognitive biases, and algorithmic transparency. Experts emphasized that AI functions as a supportive tool rather than a substitute for professional judgment. Together, these findings highlight that trust in AI emerges through interactional, cognitive, and affective processes, underscoring the importance of explainable, ethically aligned, and human-centered AI design.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 Haredi Attitudes Survey presents a comprehensive empirical portrait of contemporary ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) society in Israel, exploring how its members navigate the tension between religious identity and civic belonging. Conducted among 429 respondents from all major Haredi subgroups, the survey examined attitudes toward education, employment, military service, political representation, and collective identity. Findings depict a society marked by bounded pragmatism: gradual behavioral adaptation without ideological rupture. Economic participation and professional education are increasingly accepted, driven by necessity rather than by ideological change. Core studies and male academic education remain sensitive identity boundaries, while female higher education has become normatively accepted. Opposition to military conscription remains widespread and morally grounded, viewing Torah study as an equivalent national contribution. Support for adapted service is highly limited, mainly to younger, modern, and more integrated respondents, with rabbinic authority continuing to define permissible compromise. In the domain of identity and belonging, most respondents define themselves as conservative yet acknowledge collective change towards moderna. A large segment locates itself between conservatism and modernity, signaling hybrid identities that reinterpret change as continuity. Political attitudes mirror this moral logic—trust in existing parties is moderate, but there is cautious openness to new “national Haredi” frameworks. Together, the data illustrate a community balancing adaptation and preservation through meaning reconstruction rather than ideological reversal. The Haredi public does not deny change—it reframes it as fidelity. In doing so, it offers a vivid case of collective moral regulation under social pressure, exemplifying how identity systems sustain coherence through reinterpretation rather than transformation.",

Studies have highlighted the importance of therapeutic support, but questions remain about the type of effective support and its specific contribution. \nAims:\tWe examined the contribution of therapeutic context and amount of perceived support within the therapeutic context to the relationship between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and psychological outcomes. \nMethods:\tAn online survey was conducted in an international sample (N = 1,867) of psychedelic users. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine moderating roles of therapeutic context and support on presumed links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes. \nResults:\tData generally supported theorized associations among stressful life events, challenging psychedelic experiences, therapeutic context/support, and psychological outcomes. Therapeutic context mitigated associations of stressful life events with challenging experiences and of challenging experiences with coping, but not other associations. Interaction effects indicated that degree of therapeutic support moderated the association of challenging experiences with valence, impact on coping, and impact on well-being. In other regression models, therapeutic support maintained significant independent effects, but interaction effects were not found.  \nConclusion:\tTherapeutic context and degree of therapeutic support was found to moderate links between life stress and challenging psychedelic experiences and between challenging experiences and outcomes.

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive dysfunction and emotional symptoms frequently co-occur in Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet the mechanisms linking these domains have yet to be clearly defined. One proposed pathway involves differences in emotion regulation (ER) strategy use, which may vary as a function of cognitive capacity.\nObjectives: To examine whether task-based executive functioning (EF) and self-reported functional cognitive impairment (FCI) are associated with anxiety, depression, and mental wellbeing in PD, and whether these relationships are mediated or moderated by ER strategies.\nMethods: 103 individuals with PD completed EF tasks, as well as self-report measures of FCI, ER strategy use, and mental health. Principal component analysis was used to derive EF components. Mediation and moderation analyses examined whether cognitive functioning predicted mental health through or in interaction with ER strategy use.\nResults: Worse FCI was directly associated with poorer mental health and linked to greater use of maladaptive strategies. Better task-based EF was indirectly associated with better mental health outcomes via increased use of adaptive ER strategies. The association between regulation strategies and mental health varied depending on cognitive capacity, suggesting that the effectiveness of specific strategies is contingent on underlying cognitive functioning.\nConclusions: These findings identify cognitive capacity as a key underpinning of ER and its relationship to mental health outcomes in PD. By delineating distinct contributions of functional and task-based cognition, this study advances understanding of the mechanisms underlying affective symptom expression in PD and highlights the cognitive context in which non-motor symptoms emerge.",

Using both person (N=392) and activity (N=1,179) level data, preregistered analyses tested whether hedonic and eudaimonic well-being emerge from alignment among these systems rather than from their independent effects. Type of activity engaged in showed no significant main effects (ps &gt; .15), whereas hedonic and eudaimonic motives were associated with corresponding forms of well-being (βs = .34–.59, ps &lt; .001). We found a motive–orientation congruence interaction for social well-being (β = .14, p = .015), and four small but interpretable personality–motive interactions (βs = ±.03–.09, ps &lt; .05) indicated that traits such as openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism calibrate motivational benefits. Collectively, the findings suggest that motivational coherence may represent a particularly consistent pathway to flourishing, advancing an understanding of well-being that sets the stage for further longitudinal tests of flourishing fit.",

Building on this legacy, the present study investigates how workers in a petrochemical facility navigate written procedures during everyday operations. Using head-mounted video recordings, we analyzed 1,422 procedural steps across 40 operations, comparing paper-based and digital procedures. A Skip-Order-Action (SOA) Framework is introduced to investigate deviations between WAI and WAD, moving beyond binary notions of compliance and non-compliance. Results showed that approximately one-third of steps deviated from prescribed methods, yet all tasks were completed successfully, underscoring the adaptive role of procedural variation. Analyses further revealed that the type of procedural variation (Skip, Order, Action) changed significantly depending on the operational phase. Crucially, variability was driven primarily by contextual factors, such as operational phase and procedural medium, rather than individual worker differences, emphasizing the systemic nature of adaptation. These findings provide empirical support for Hollnagel’s call to understand why work succeeds and demonstrate how procedural variability can be conceptualized as functional adaptation rather than error. By operationalizing Safety-II concepts through the SOA Framework, this study extends Hollnagel’s vision of safety as an emergent property of everyday work.",

          "abstract": "The construct validity of psychometric measures is a foundation of credible psychological science, ensuring that measures reflect their intended theoretical constructs rather than unintended ones. Yet many conventional construct validation practices produce weak, uninformative evidence and fall short of the strong, risk-bearing tests emphasized by validity theorists. As a result, the available evidence is often insufficient to support meaningful claims about construct validity. To address this issue, we introduce a framework based on Meehl’s logic of hypothesis testing that can be used to evaluate the evidential value (or quality) of construct validation efforts. We define evidential value as the extent to which conducting a test of construct validity can shift confidence in the proposed construct interpretation of a measure over plausible alternative interpretations. Using this framework, we identify three conventional practices that contribute to low evidential value in construct validation: (a) treating theoretical constructs as conceptual placeholders, (b) relying on generic psychometric methods, and (c) performing post hoc revisions to the nomological network (i.e., employing the Lakatosian defense). This article demonstrates how using these practices allows virtually any psychometric measure to be portrayed as “validated”, while providing only nominal evidence of construct validity. We offer recommendations to help researchers design construct validation studies of high evidential value.",

We present evidence that these mappings arise from a combination of statistical learning, magnitude matching, valence matching, and semantic mediation, involving an interplay between perception and conception.

          "abstract": "ADHD is often characterized as having clinically relevant sex-differentiated manifestations. We revisited this popular conjecture and examined whether ADHD symptoms’ associations with 88 theoretically-relevant external validators (e.g., psychopathology, neurocognitive tasks) varied by sex. To do so, we used four waves of data from a large community sample of youth (N = 11,878, ages 9 through 13). Only 4.1% of tests (157 / 3,760) supported significant sex-differentiated manifestations of ADHD or its individual symptoms. ADHD and some of its symptoms (e.g., inattentive, impulsive, hyperactive) were more strongly associated with externalizing in boys than girls, but ADHD and other symptoms (i.e., inattentive, acted young) were also more associated with internalizing and thought problems in boys than girls. Most observed sex-differentiated manifestations were very small to small in magnitude, with only a handful emerging as large, suggesting sex-differentiated manifestations of ADHD may be the exception rather than the rule.",

          "authors": "Sixbert Sangwa",
          "abstract": "Abstract: Background: Traditional programmes across Sub-Saharan Africa have struggled to cultivate the agency and work-ready competences graduates need to meaningfully address the continent’s development priorities. Purpose: This study critically examines African Leadership University’s mission-driven, hybrid model, asking whether organising learning around personally defined “missions” rather than disciplinary majors measurably enhances student agency and post-graduation impact. Design/methodology/approach: A secondary, mixed-methods evaluation triangulated (i) ALU’s alumni-outcomes dataset covering 1,741 graduates from 2017-2024, (ii) continental statistics from UNESCO, Afrobarometer and the World Bank, and (iii) a systematic literature and policy review. Quantitative indicators were juxtaposed with thematic analysis of policy texts to assess alignment between institutional practice and regional reform agendas. Findings: ALU graduates achieved a 75% placement rate within six months (continental median ≈ 65 %), with 25–33 % founding ventures that collectively [i.e including students] generated more than 52,317 jobs—an estimated 121:1 job-creation multiplier. Ninety-five percent of employed alumni remained on the continent, countering “brain drain”. Qualitative evidence reveals heightened autonomy, intrinsic motivation and leadership competence attributable to a learning design that blends online mastery modules with mentored, real-world projects. Originality/value: By integrating Self-Determination Theory with the emergent Mission-Driven Learning Theory, the paper offers a falsifiable conceptual model in which mission clarity and mission-competence alignment jointly mediate the link between autonomy-supportive environments and graduate impact. The findings provide policy-relevant evidence that flexible accreditation “sandboxes” could mainstream mission-driven pedagogy and accelerate Africa’s skills revolution. For students who explicitly anchor their life missions in discipleship, success is defined as faithful stewardship and fruitfulness under God’s will rather than credential accumulation. Our analysis therefore treats alignment to a discerned vocation as both a motivational mechanism and a normative success criterion, consistent with Christian Scripture and with the model’s values-based element. Practical implications: Universities can embed mission-definition modules, mandatory internships and portfolio-based assessment to replicate key elements of the model, while governments should create regulatory space for purpose-centred curricular innovation.",

          "authors": "Johanna Prugger; Simone Kühn",
          "abstract": "Environmental psychology has extensively documented the restorative effects of nature: the recovery of cognitive resources and emotional well-being following stress or fatigue. Yet, the field may have overlooked instorative effects, where nature enhances functioning from a neutral baseline without prior depletion. We reviewed 54 studies (61 experiments, 19962024) investigating nature versus urban exposure effects on cognition, affect, and perceived restoration. Studies were categorized as explicit stressor (deliberate pre-exposure stress induction), implicit stressor (pre-exposure assessments likely inducing fatigue), or instorative (no prior stressor/assessment). Using an iterative, data-driven approach inspired by Grounded Theory, we analyzed study characteristics, exposure types, and the proportion reporting beneficial effects. Restorative studies vastly outnumbered instorative studies (45 vs. 8), revealing substantial research bias. Despite limited representation, instorative studies demonstrated high success rates: all cognition studies reported positive effects, while two-thirds examining affect showed benefits. Explicit stressor studies showed stronger effects than implicit stressor studies, suggesting dose-response relationships. Differentiating between instorative and restorative effects remains difficult, as no validated tools specifically assess instoration. The widely used Perceived Restorativeness Scale primarily measures general environmental benefits, conflating restoration and instoration. Studies predominantly employed young, Western samples and brief laboratory exposures, limiting ecological validity. The capacity of nature to enhance, rather than merely restore, functioning is underexplored. Future research should investigate instorative effects using ecologically valid paradigms with neutral baselines, refined theoretical models, standardized terminology, and appropriate questionnaires that distinguish between instorative and restorative effects.",

Epistemic curiosity is intellectual and cognitive curiosity. Japanese studies in epistemic curiosity have developed independently, based on Hatano and Inagaki's theory. Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Interpreting whether someone is showing romantic or sexual interest can be challenging, particularly when cues are ambiguous or when attention is influenced by visceral states such as physiological or emotional arousal. Building on previous findings linking sexual arousal to men’s overreliance on global cues (OGC) when assessing women’s flirtatious intent, the present preregistered online study examined whether a similar cue-based judgment bias would emerge under nonsexual arousal. Using a key-press paradigm, heterosexual men (N = 275) completed a two-stage selection task in which they chose which of two women appeared more likely to be flirting with them. Stimuli were drawn from a validated image set and varied in global sexual (clothing style) and specific affective (facial expression) cues. Cue combinations were either congruent, potentially facilitating selection, or incongruent, thereby increasing selection difficulty. Between the two measurements, participants listened to a vividly narrated audio recording designed to elicit positively valenced nonsexual arousal. Reaction time (RT) and error rate (ER) served as behavioral indicators of OGC. Consistent with previous research, participants showed longer RTs and higher ERs in incongruent compared to congruent trials, indicating higher selection difficulty in ambiguous contexts. However, nonsexual arousal did not reproduce the pronounced behavioral response pattern that had been observed under sexual arousal. The findings suggest that sexual arousal exerts unique effects on cue weighting in social judgments, highlighting the importance of specifying boundary conditions under which arousal alters cognitive processing.",

Participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse as the most preferred, least offensive, and most acceptable, whereas neurominority and neurospicy were least endorsed. The overall order of preferences was largely consistent across diagnostic groups, gender identities, and countries, though group-level differences emerged for specific terms. Dyslexic participants rated neurodivergent and neurodiverse less positively than other groups, while the Autism+ADHD group expressed the strongest endorsement of neurodivergent. Participants reported infrequent self-use of these labels, suggesting that while certain terms are broadly acceptable, they may not yet serve as primary identity markers.

This paper delineates the anatomy of a positive peer review in psychology, emphasizing clarity, structure, consistency, specificity, constructive tone, vigilance against bias, integrity, relevance, timeliness, and place-centeredness. Drawing on metascientific principles, we synthesize practical guidance for reviewers, editors, and authors, including the use of structured review prompts, explicit checks for analytic flexibility and adequacy of power, attention to sampling frames and context, and expectations for sharing data, code, and materials when ethically feasible. We also outline editorial policies that realign incentives toward inclusion and rigor, such as adopting formats that foreground methods and transparency, implementing calibrated decision criteria, and providing developmental feedback that supports authors at different stages and from diverse settings. Finally, we propose concrete steps for training, recognition, and accountability in review, along with indicators that departments, journals, and societies can track to monitor progress. Taken together, these practices reposition peer review as a tool for equity and quality in psychological science and as a lever for improving how research is disseminated.",

          "abstract": "Psychology faces crises of theory and measurement, where poorly specified constructs hinder the validity of measurement instruments. This article turns prior pleas to transparently explicate comprehensive construct definitions and accompanying measurement instructions into practice, using self-efficacy as an exemplary case. Drawing primarily on Bandura’s conceptualization, we explicate the key elements distinguishing self-efficacy from related constructs and examine implications for measurement. More importantly, this is the first time to introduce Narrative Response Models (NRMs) as a tool to describe and study how hypothesized processes that need to occur allow inferences about a psychological construct from the registered responses to an item used to assess that construct (in this case self-efficacy). Without this, there is no reason to assume the responses can tell anything about the construct: the item is invalid. Because NRMs as a tool were developed to justify confidence in the validity of an item, they explicate many underlying assumptions that warrant further investigation. In the case of self-efficacy, for example, the retrieval of gist traces and the simulation of what it takes to engage in the behaviour of interest. As such, NRMs provide scaffolding for the systematic study of a measurement instrument’s validity.",

In the future, it may be possible to develop hearing aids that monitor brain activity in real-time and adapt their output to the volitions of the user. In music, this could mean selectively amplifying the sound of the instrument the listener wants to hear. The first steps in this research is to determine whether machine learning can be used to identify which instrument an individual is listening to based only on a brief EEG signal. In this work, participants were presented with a series of brief tones that varied in timbre (Trombone, Clarinet, Cello, Piano and Pure Tone) while their ongoing EEG was recorded from 73 electrodes. To distinguish between EEG responses to the five different musical instruments, we investigated the use of three different classifiers – Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Gradient Boosting (GB), and k-NN, and four different sets of features – raw EEG, ERP-based features, harmonics-based features and regularity-based features. N1 and P2 components of the ERP were analyzed for differences between instruments. All three classifiers performed significantly above chance (i.e., approximately 20% for 5 classes) when trained using the raw EEG features (LDA: 37%, GB: 35%, k-NN: 26%). It may be possible to improve these results with more advanced classification algorithms or different transformations of features. Statistical analysis found the Cello to have contributed to the largest P2 amplitude and Pure Tone to the smallest, and for Cello to have contributed to the earliest N1 latency and Clarinet the latest.",

Little is known about how concurrent instrument tones are processed subcortically, so that they can be perceptually segregated. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to understand how the timbre of one instrument impacts subsequent processing of that same instrument when combined with a second instrument, using the frequency following response (FFRs). Participants were presented with sequences that consisted of a priming tone that was either a guitar or a piano tone, immediately followed by a composite tone consisting of both instruments.  EEG data was averaged into two separate FFRs.  Both FFRs were evoked by the combined piano and guitar tone; the only difference between the two FFRs was which tone came first: guitar or piano. The FFR was analyzed using the strength of stimulus-to-response correlation (SRC) to both instrument tones in isolation and spectral power analyses at harmonic frequencies for each instrument in isolation. Results suggest instrument-specific neural priming. Guitar primed FFRs correlated more strongly with the guitar tone compared to the piano tone, (p&lt;.001, d=1.54). Guitar priming enhanced SRC between combined-tone responses and guitar stimuli compared to piano-primed conditions (p&lt;.001, d=0.76). Piano priming showed no significant SRC enhancement (p=0.29). Spectral analysis revealed instrument-specific enhancements: guitar priming increased spectral power at the harmonics in the guitar tone, while piano priming enhanced power at the harmonics in the piano, both p&lt;.001.

Yet, little is known about how AI compares to humans in detecting misinformation. To address this question, two preregistered studies compared 15 major AI chatbots to human participants (N = 2,461) with regards to three factors (i.e., truth discernment, acceptance threshold, slant bias) in the detection of political misinformation (Exp. 1) and misinformation about vaccines (Exp. 2). The results show that, for both topics, AI chatbots discerned true from false information with much greater accuracy than U.S. Democrats and Republicans (political misinformation, Exp. 1) and human participants with favorable, unfavorable, or neutral vaccine attitudes (vaccine misinformation, Exp. 2). AI chatbots also outperformed the “wisdom of crowds”, an approach that has been shown to approximate veracity judgments of professional fact-checkers. At the same time, many AI chatbots showed large biases comparable to those of human participants, showing tendencies to accept or reject information regardless of veracity and tendencies to favor information with a certain slant. Overall, AI chatbots showed large variation in all three factors of misinformation detection. The results challenge conceptions of AI chatbots as hallucinating lie-machines, while drawing attention to biases and large differences between chatbots.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive science of religion has predominantly framed ritual as goal-demoted and causally opaque, serving primarily affiliative functions. This paper challenges this dominant framework, arguing that it fails to account for magical rituals, which are explicitly goal-oriented from the practitioner's perspective. I propose the \"folk-technology model,\" which treats magic not as symbolic or opaque action but as an instrumental, problem-solving practice. The paper critiques the concept of \"irresolvable causal opacity\" by presenting three lines of evidence: first, the natural/supernatural dichotomy that underpins the concept of irresolvability is a modern Western construct often absent in the societies in question; second, many magical practices are underpinned by detailed, if scientifically inaccurate, causal theories; and third, the apparent lack of articulated theory among laypeople often reflects practical knowledge and a social distribution of expertise rather than inherent opacity. The folk-technology model is further supported by widespread ethnographic evidence of instrumental tinkering, efficacy testing, and pragmatic adaptation in practices ranging from Azande oracles and Melanesian cargo cults to contemporary AI divination. This reframing challenges classic dichotomies between technical and performative action, generates novel, testable predictions about the structure of magical systems, and revitalizes intellectualist theories of magic within a modern cognitive and (cultural) evolutionary context.",

          "abstract": "Advanced societies face a paradox: unprecedented abundance coincides with declining motivation, fertility, and social engagement (Easterlin, 1995). Conventional explanations—economic stress, education, gender equality, and value shifts—describe outcomes but not the underlying regulatory mechanism linking individual motivation to civilizational trends. Existing theories remain siloed: neuroscience explains reward processing in individual brains, while demography documents population-level changes, yet no framework connects these scales of analysis (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016; Schultz, 2016).\nWe propose Chois’ Theory of Evolutionary Homeostasis (CTEH), which positions dopamine as the necessary starting point for modeling motivational transmission. This is not a reductionist claim, but a recognition that any theory of motivation must begin with the neurochemical that encodes the question, “Is this worth the effort?” (Volkow et al., 2011). CTEH’s eight tenets describe how dopaminergic adaptation to abundance propagates through cultural learning to produce civilizational cycles of motivation, fertility, and renewal.\nThe framework’s key innovation lies in defining the cultural–neurobiological interface of how individual reward sensitivity scales to population patterns through social learning and institutional amplification (Montague et al., 2006). Sustained abundance elevates dopamine baselines, dulling reward sensitivity and shifting behavior from effort-based striving to passive consumption and artificial stimulation (Berridge &amp; Robinson, 2016). As desensitization spreads, motivation wanes, fertility declines, and crisis restores contrast and renewal (Becker et al., 2023).\nWe validate this multi-scale model using fertility as the primary gateway, owing to robust demographic data and its direct neuroendocrine linkage to reward systems (Eisenegger et al., 2011; Elson et al., 2024). However, the same regulatory principles extend to disengagement in work, education, and relationships. Ultimately, this framework reframes societal decline as a predictable process of homeostatic regulation, suggesting that interventions should focus on restoring motivational contrast, not merely increasing material resources.",

          "abstract": "Many experiments in psychology involve deceiving participants about aspects of the study. Researchers who employ deception sometimes administer post-experiment suspicion probes and exclude participants from analysis if their responses indicate that they were not successfully deceived. However, several studies have found that their suspicious participants behave as if they were deceived as intended. One explanation is that participants infer that they were deceived upon being presented with a suspicion probe, which biases them to overreport being suspicious. We tested whether post-experiment beliefs about deception can indeed induce such biases by manipulating whether we admitted to using deception before administering suspicion probes. Admitting to deception did not increase the amount of suspicion reported (Experiment 1), nor did the content of participants’ suspicions reflect the content of our admission (Experiment 2). Results suggest that it is unlikely that suspicion probes ‘tip off’ participants in a way that causes them to overreport suspicion.",

          "abstract": "The uncertainty monitoring account proposes that during reasoning, people may generate several intuitive responses, each contributing to an overall uncertainty parameter that will trigger conscious deliberation if it becomes high enough. In two experiments (total N = 186), we test this account by utilising methods and theory of metacognition – which also describes a second-order process that regulates the operation of first-order cognition. We analyse which internal cues influence confidence and accuracy, and how the consistency of cues influences confidence, accuracy, and participants changing their answers. Confidence judgements were not sensitive to belief-logic conflict when other cues were accounted for, contrary to prior research. Instead, overall cue consistency was more important for determining confidence and response changes. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of current dual process accounts of reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Approximately 10-20% of U.S. adolescents report past-year cannabis use (CU). Although regular CU beginning in adolescence is expected to have a blunting effect on the dopamine system, safety concerns about methods like positron emission tomography have precluded testing this hypothesis in adolescents. However, dopamine neurophysiology can be noninvasively indexed via subcortical tissue iron measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examined adolescent CU quantity, frequency, and problems in relation to tissue iron in regions with high dopamine activity, hypothesizing an inverse relationship to reflect the aforementioned blunting effect. Adolescents (n=81) aged 14-17 who reported either fewer than 5 lifetime cannabis episodes (n=47) or more than 11 episodes (n=34), with limited alcohol and nicotine use and no other illicit substance use, completed substance use assessments and an MRI. We calculated the inverse of the normalized T2* measurement (1/nT2*; lower values indicate less tissue iron) from preprocessed resting-state functional scans by assessing relative T2* decay. Tissue iron levels were estimated for the ventral tegmental area (VTA), bilateral thalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and pallidum using subcortical masks. Lower tissue iron was associated with increased daily concentrate hits and hours high, CU sessions, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) severity in linear mixed models. Post-hoc analyses highlighted the VTA as a key region. Our results align with findings of blunted dopamine neurophysiology associated with CU in adult and animal samples, and have implications for understanding adolescent CUD development. Measuring brain tissue iron offers an innovative, non-invasive method to index dopamine neurophysiology in adolescent CU.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The US is facing a well-documented caregiving crisis, with more aging adults requiring informal caregiving at home and fewer young people available to support them. This paper estimates the current economic value of care provided by unpaid adolescents (ages 10 to 17) to family members who are chronically ill, disabled, or facing aging-related decline.\nMethods: We leverage large-scale, national datasets to estimate the economic value of informal caregiving provided by adolescents nationally and at the state level. \nResults: We estimate that adolescents provide by $15.01 billion (range = $5.38 to $41.63 billion) worth of informal caregiving work nationally. These estimates correspond to up to 8.86% of the $470 billion value of informal unpaid caregiving by adults, and up to 1.09% of the US total health care expenditure. State-specific estimates show substantial variability. \nDiscussion: Adolescents contribute substantially to the annual US economy by providing informal unpaid caregiving for their families. This information can inform the design of targeted polices and programs to support adolescents’ health and the health of the family members they care for. \nImplications and Contribution. This study highlights the substantial informal family caregiving adolescents provide to the US economy. We estimate adolescents contribute $15.01B in annual caregiving services, with implications for public health. Supporting caregiving adolescents and their families is crucial given the scope and impact of their work, and the shortage of family caregivers in the US.",

          "abstract": "Political candidates in the U.S. increasingly endorse anti-democratic actions across all levels of office, yet most research focuses on federal races. A key concern is that norm-violating candidates at lower levels may ascend to higher office, posing broader risks to democratic stability. This study examines whether voters are more or less likely to defect from co-partisan norm violators at lower levels of office. Across two preregistered survey experiments with 5,000 U.S. respondents, we find that defection rates remain consistent across local, state, and federal races, regardless of the number or type of violations. These findings suggest two interpretations: optimistically, voters are not more forgiving of norm violations in lower-level elections; pessimistically, even where the stakes appear lower, voters are also no more likely to hold norm violators accountable. Our results are consistent with the nationalization of voting behavior and the risk of a candidate pipeline that enables norm violators to rise unchecked.",

          "abstract": "Context effects in multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice are pervasive and yet, paradoxically, elusive at the same time. For example, simple changes to the spatial layout of alternatives on the screen can nullify or reverse the effects. Despite the success of dynamic decision models in explaining the occurrence of context effects, a coherent theory for understanding their elusiveness is currently lacking. We introduce a novel theoretical framework that relies on attention modulated comparisons to explain the elusive nature of context effects. We show via simulation that our model produces the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects simply by assuming that more time is spent comparing alternatives that are more similar. However, when more time is spent comparing dissimilar alternatives, model simulations reveal a reversal of the attraction and compromise effects. The empirical support for this model-based prediction is assessed by manipulating similarity-based attention in separate experiments for the three context effects (total N = 887). Further, by allowing the spatial organization of information to constrain the attention process, the model can explain changes in context effects induced by display layout. We show that the model's spatial attention mechanism allows it to capture presentation order effects in a reanalysis of previously published data. Finally, we develop a continuous approximation of the full model that permits fitting of choices and response times. In summary, the proposed framework provides a new tool for understanding not only the existence of context effects in choice, but also the attentional factors that lead to null or reversed context effects.",

The Munich Sentence (MuSe) database enhances reproducibility by providing sentence completion norms for 619 German sentences, including cloze probabilities and entropy estimates from up to 232 participants. Sentence completions were collected in two online studies in which participants completed sentence beginnings with a single-word response after either hearing (auditory sample, N = 133) or reading (visual sample, N = 98) the sentence beginning. All responses were manually preprocessed to correct typos and spelling mistakes and to label grammatical errors, proper nouns, and singular and plural variants of the same response. In addition to the sentence norms, we provide trial-level data with participant-level demographic information and subclinical autistic and schizotypal trait measures. Together with open access R-Scripts or our webtool, this allows for tailoring the cleaning and norming steps to integrate individual difference measures. For a subset of 479 sentence beginnings, the database also includes professional audio recordings of sentence beginnings which can be flexibly combined with 531 recordings of unique sentence-final words and implemented in auditory language paradigms.

Previous literature shows that such phonetic learning is often speaker-specific for certain speech sounds (e.g., fricatives) --- it does not transfer to novel speakers, possibly because fricatives contain spectral properties that cue speaker identity. However, recent research shows that  transfer to a novel sound contrast can occur within a single speaker, suggesting that there is room for transfer of learning to a novel speaker with a sufficiently similar pronunciation. This study examines the transfer of phonetic learning for an atypical fricative pronunciation to novel speakers, focusing on the mechanisms that underlie such perceptual adaptation. Results of a series of experiments show that transfer of phonetic learning can occur to both novel speakers and novel phonetic contrasts. Results suggest that listeners may use a more targeted mechanism when generalizing learning to novel speakers, with acoustic similarity being a possible predictor of learning transfer.",

          "authors": "Dave Kenneth Tayao Cayado; Kathleen Rastle",
          "abstract": "The majority of words across the world’s languages are composed of smaller meaningful units called morphemes (e.g., mis-trust-ful-ness). Research over the past 50 years has shown that such words are processed through morphological analysis—the decomposition of complex words into their meaningful subparts. While psycholinguistics has made significant progress in understanding this process during reading, most evidence comes from a narrow range of languages and morphological types. In this paper, we quantify linguistic and typological diversity in morphological processing and acquisition research from 1975 to 2025. Articles were coded for language(s), morphological type(s), participant type, and publication year. Our survey revealed that about 40% of the studies come from English and about 74% come from Indo-European languages (e.g., French, Spanish, German). We also found that about 53% of the studies focused on suffixation, the most frequent morphological process in English. We argue that this narrow scope limits theoretical progress. Many languages form complex words through reduplication, infixation, circumfixation or nonlinear morphology that differ structurally from English suffixation, and that pose learning and processing challenges that would not arise in English. We conclude that expanding linguistic diversity is necessary for building a more comprehensive account of morphological learning and processing.",

          "authors": "Ashish Kumar Sahoo; Steven Marc Weisberg",
          "abstract": "Spatial navigation requires learning environments larger than what can be perceived at one time, requiring the integration of distinct episodes into one representation. Modern theories postulate hierarchical models of space, in which environments are mentally segmented, allowing more precise navigation within subregions and less precise strategies across them. But how does space become segmented into subregions? Segmentation, a component of many domains in human cognition, is the process by which a continuous stream of input is divided into chunks. In spatial navigation, segmentation often leverages natural divisions, like rivers or highways. Here, we hypothesize that temporal segmentation, a powerful organizer of information thought to support event cognition (Zacks &amp; Swallow, 2007), could play a role in segmenting space as well. To test this hypothesis, in a carefully controlled virtual environment experiment, participants learned landmarks around a square virtual environment in two temporally separated sessions designed to elicit temporal divisions during learning while controlling other factors. We then queried participants’ spatial (and non-spatial) memories for evidence of temporal segmentation across multiple behavioral measures. We found a gradient of temporal segmentation effects: measures more likely to depend on time, like free recall and distance judgments, were more affected by temporal segmentation, while measures more likely to depend on space (pointing judgments and maps) were less affected. Results support the notion that temporal segmentation is task-dependent, with variable effects on spatial memory. We interpret our findings in the context of theories of hippocampal encoding of space and time.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the association between structural properties of the human brain and individual differences in behavior is an ongoing endeavor, challenged by the brain’s complexity. Past approaches, limited by simplistic neural structure measures like brain volume or cortical thickness, have given way to more advanced modeling approaches. Empirical evidence using these simpler metrics occasionally shows that hippocampal structure relates to individual variation in spatial navigation ability, particularly for older individuals or for expert navigators (like London taxi drivers). Yet high-powered, pre-registered studies in typical younger adults revealed no association between hippocampal volume and navigation ability. Here, we follow a data-driven approach developing and comparing deep learning methods (graph convolution neural networks, GCNN; 3DCNN) to analyze whether complex aspects of brain structure predict spatial navigation ability in young populations. To that end, we trained GCNNs and 3DCNNs on a T1 MRI dataset (N=90) to predict navigational ability as measured by an objective virtual reality test of spatial memory in which participants created as accurate a map as they could of a highly realistic virtual environment. Across all approaches, we found weak predictive value in held-out test data, despite good fits to training data. These results could indicate the need for much larger datasets, including more comprehensive behavioral measures (as this study was limited to one measure) to improve predictability but may also support the notion that hippocampal structural features may not be a primary factor associated with navigation ability in healthy younger adults.",

          "abstract": "Open science (OS) practices are increasingly integrated into undergraduate psychology curricula. While OS can enhance students’ scientific literacy, engagement, and attitudes toward research, its teaching also introduces challenges. This narrative review synthesizes published experiences and recommendations concerning OS education for undergraduate psychology students, identifying common pitfalls and strategies to mitigate them. Eleven pitfalls were identified: the overwhelming variety of OS practices, high technical demands, substantial time investment, insufficient support, perceived competitive disadvantage, potential disengagement, worries about public mistakes, inconsistencies between teaching and practice, risks of academic misconduct, erosion of trust in science, and inclusivity concerns. To address these challenges, educators are encouraged to scaffold learning through replication and preregistration exercises, create authentic assignments, foster collaboration and student authorship, increase feedback literacy and epistemic humility, embed OS across the curriculum, and pay attention to inclusivity. We conclude that teaching OS to undergraduates is both feasible and valuable, provided educators anticipate its challenges and make deliberate pedagogical choices. Viewing OS as a buffet of practices rather than a prescriptive set of rules can help align educational choices with course goals and student readiness. The availability of open educational resources and international teaching communities further supports the integration of OS into undergraduate psychology education, allowing students to experience firsthand the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and rigorous scientific practice.",

School-level nested cross-validation was used to train and evaluate machine learning models for predicting individualized benefit from SBMT.\n\nSetting: Eighty-four broadly representative UK secondary schools across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nParticipants: A total of 8,376 adolescents aged 11-13 years at baseline were included.

Causal forest (CF) and elastic net regression (ENR) models computed Personalized Advantage Index scores quantifying individual expected benefit from SBMT vs. TAU.\n\nResults: CF showed acceptable calibration (mean Best Linear Predictor slope = 0.78, SE = 0.15), while ENR demonstrated modest predictive performance (r = 0.29; R² = 0.09; RMSE = 10.3). Both the CF and ENR models identified a subset of adolescents predicted to benefit from SBMT, but group differences in outcomes were negligible (CF: d = 0.07, p = .007; ENR: d = 0.08, p = .004). Top predictive features from the CF model were symptom severity (e.g., low-to-moderate depression and anxiety predicted greater SBMT benefit) and several school factors with non-linear patterns. ENR emphasized school-level characteristics with minimal differentiation.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Machine learning identified a subgroup with statistically detectable but clinically trivial differential intervention response.

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives, with nearly 5 billion users worldwide. Its ubiquity has sparked concerns about the potential effects on sleep, particularly among young people. Previous research has generally shown that greater social media engagement is associated with poorer sleep outcomes, such as later bedtimes and longer sleep onset latency. However, most evidence is cross-sectional, limiting causal claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal studies published in the last five years examining the impact of social media use on subsequent sleep in young people. In accordance with cross-sectional findings, the majority of studies (~70%) provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use, including at bedtime. These findings inform professional recommendations, including strategies to reduce problematic use to improve sleep outcomes in youth. Yet implementation may be challenging, as adolescents often resist device restrictions and family contexts vary widely, highlighting the need for flexible approaches. Methodological limitations of the reviewed studies further constrain conclusions. Many studies rely on self-reports and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep. Future studies should employ validated measures and move beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how content, patterns of problematic use, and the timing of social media use influence sleep longitudinally. Studies must also address the complexity of this relationship and consider bidirectional pathways and interactions with other key variables such as neurodiversity, socioeconomic status and mental health.",

          "abstract": "Our language environment is rich in statistical structure. It is therefore natural to hypothesize that statistical learning (SL) —the ability to detect regularities in the environmental input— contributes to the efficient processing of written text and supports literacy skills. Some prior studies reported correlations between SL as a general ability and reading, while others found null effects. We propose that this link may be better revealed by measuring individuals’ learning of orthographic statistical patterns, a type of regularity more directly relevant to literacy. This study examined how sensitivity to bigram frequency in participants’ first language (L1, French) and the ability to learn novel bigrams through exposure relate to literacy outcomes. The measures showed moderate to good reliability (L1 sensitivity: r = .60; novel orthographic learning: r = .84) and were significantly associated with spelling, but not reading. Notably, sensitivity to bigram frequency was not significantly associated with orthographic learning performance and did not mediate the link between orthographic learning and spelling. These findings suggest that different aspects of sensitivity to existing and newly acquired orthographic patterns independently support spelling abilities in French, without extending to reading performance.",

          "abstract": "Clinical psychology is a discipline reliant on self-reports, but uniquely susceptible to specific biases associated therewith. Here we review progress in objective behavioral assessment in the domain of alcohol research, introducing an emerging transdermal class of wearable alcohol biosensor. We note challenges of transdermal assessment, together with recent performance gains from updated devices and analytic tools, including machine learning. We indicate unanswered questions for transdermal technology, including whether devices might ultimately produce fine-grained drinking quantity estimates and device longevity. We further identify factors that can impede development of new objective measures, including the tendency to judge new tools against an implicit ideal and consider scientific findings divorced from methodological details. Finally, in evaluating transdermal and other objective measurement tools, we argue for consideration of the specific error type (random vs systematic) generally linked with novel vs existing tools, identifying measurement diversification as a priority for clinical psychology moving forward.",

          "abstract": "“There is zero causal effect of effort on scores,” concluded a recent study, Is Trying Harder Enough? Causal Analysis of the Effort-IQ Relationship Suggests Not (Bates, 2025). The study included two experiments. Each paid a treatment group a two-pound reward if they increased their performance on a subsequent IQ test after an initial test. The estimated effects of effort were not significantly different from zero in either experiment.\n\nI argue that this conclusion commits the statistical non-significance fallacy—just because an effect size is not significantly different from zero does not mean that the effect really is zero. Confidence intervals reported in the study are too large for strong inferences to be made. This is in part because the sample size (1,737) and financial incentives offered are too small. I estimate the study would need a sample size around four times larger, at 6,500 participants, to have 80% power to reject the null, if the true effect of effort were moderate in size. Nevertheless, I find that by incorporating sensible control variables (such as IQ from the initial test) or by pooling data with a prior study (Bates &amp; Gignac, 2022), a significant effect of effort can be found. Confidence intervals in my re-analysis are very large, making the magnitude of the effect of effort uncertain.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Listening engagement describes the extent to which an individual may recruit cognitive resources for a listening task (Herrmann &amp; Johnsrude, 2020a), potentially contributing to the experience of listening effort–the subjective experience of exerting cognitive resources to process sounds. The present study explored the use of spoken narrative stimuli to assess two different measures of listening engagement in children and objectively assess their engagement in stories.\n\nMethod: Seventy children (31 female; mean age = 10.3 years) between the ages of 9-12 years listened to two engaging stories containing different child-preferred themes, and a non-engaging control story lacking these themes. Engagement was measured using two methods: a self-report measure (a version of the Story World Absorption Scale), and a performance-based measure (i.e., a speeded directional judgment task) presented concurrently with the stories.\n\nResults: Stories with child-preferred themes were rated as more engaging than the control story via self-report. Moreover, secondary task reaction times were significantly slower while listening to engaging stories than the control story, suggesting that engaging stories placed higher demands on cognitive resources. Intersubject correlation analyses revealed that reaction times across the duration of engaging stories were more consistent than across the control story, suggesting that reaction times reflected a shared response to narrative content.\n\nConclusions: Together, these results suggest that children’s engagement with auditory narratives can be measured objectively, and that engagement varies across stories in a manner that is qualitatively similar to adults.",

Statistical Learning (SL) supports speech segmentation through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables, and individual differences in SL ability were found predictive of further language development. The current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; the ability to perceive the beat and infer the meter in a rhythmic stimulus auditory input) correlated with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm in a quadruple meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with entrainment to the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed behavioral tasks measuring their RA and were asked about their engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a correlation between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This correlation was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting similarity between processing items at hierarchically corresponding levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appeared to have a positive effect on infant RA.",

          "abstract": "In this paper, we present Radical Embodied Memory (REM), a new theory of memory grounded in the\ncommitments and concepts of radical embodiment. First, we distinguish between the conceptual\nfoundations of mainstream cognitive neuroscience and radical embodied cognitive neuroscience and\ndescribe what it means for a theory of memory to be “radically embodied”. Specifically, we argue that\nREM is radically embodied insofar as it explains memory using the conceptual resources of neural reuse,\nneural resonance, environmental coordination, and dynamical systems theory instead of the mainstream\nmemory concepts of stimulus, encoding, storage and retrieval. Using the sorts of models proposed in\ndynamical systems theory, REM posits that memories are previously traversed locations in the state space\nof the brain-body-environment system. The activity of remembering is then that system’s dynamics\nmoving back to those locations. We then survey key findings from the memory neuroscience literature\nand reinterpret the results through the lens of REM. Namely, we explain the role of the hippocampus and\ncortico-hippocampal interactions, amnesia, relational memory, and memory consolidation using this new\nframework. We end with a discussion on the practical implications of modelling memory as distributed\nacross the brain-body-environment system, including new hypotheses and considerations for experimental\ndesign. In doing so, we hope to provide a conceptual and methodological framework for the cognitive\nneuroscientist interested in studying memory as radically embodied.",

          "abstract": "HIV self-testing (HIVST) has the potential to increase testing uptake among populations underserved by facility/clinic-based services, including sub-Saharan African migrants (SSAM) in Europe. However, research on HIVST among SSAM in Europe and other high-income countries remains limited. This study aimed to explore perspectives on HIVST, identify barriers and facilitators to HIVST uptake, and provide recommendations to inform effective implementation among a diverse group of 26 SSAM and 13 key informants in the Netherlands through semi-structured interviews. Interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants’ perspectives on HIVST centered on three themes: enhanced autonomy in decision-making and testing processes; navigating autonomy and support for self-testing and care linkage; and HIVST within the Dutch context and prevention landscape. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was subsequently employed as a post-hoc interpretive framework to map study findings within a broader implementation context. Factors potentially influencing successful uptake and implementation were identified across multiple CFIR domains, including perceived relative advantage over facility/clinic-based testing, evidence on reliability, and procedural complexity (Innovation Characteristics); low self-efficacy, self-testing and linkage to care support needs (Individual Characteristics); HIV stigma, limited awareness and low visibility of HIVST (Outer Setting); and perceived incompatibility with existing healthcare systems (Inner Setting). Although HIVST can address key testing barriers among SSAM, targeted implementation strategies are needed to guarantee equitable access, proper use, and optimal outcomes. These include enhanced dissemination of HIVST information, normalization of HIV testing and self-testing, provision of person-centered support, and establishing clear pathways for timely care linkage when required.",

Barriers to general healthcare included negative perceptions of the Dutch healthcare system and financial constraints. Disclosure challenges hindered LtHC, while linkage support acted as a key facilitator. Migration-related challenges, bureaucratic healthcare processes, and community-based support for care connections were identified as intersecting factors acting as barriers and facilitators to general healthcare access and LtHC. This study underscores migration as a critical determinant embedded within broader systemic and structural factors influencing healthcare access.

Methods: We collected our data through an online survey. Adults’ social media users could participate in our study. We conducted a cross-sectional study during July 2024 in Greece. We gauged personality with the Big Five Inventory‐10 (BFI‐10), and social media addiction with the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS). We performed multivariable linear regression analysis to eliminate confounding. Results: The personality trait “extraversion” was related with increased social media addiction (adjusted beta = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.69, p-value = 0.005). Moreover, the personality trait “agreeableness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.62, 95% CI = -0.92 to -0.32, p-value &lt; 0.001). In addition, the personality trait “conscientiousness” was related with reduced social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.80, 95% CI = -1.04 to -0.57, p-value &lt; 0.001). Levels of social media addiction was higher among females (adjusted beta = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.07 to 3.36, p-value &lt; 0.001). Decreased age was associated with increased social media addiction (adjusted beta = -0.09, 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.04, p-value = 0.001). Conclusion: We found a positive relationship between the personality trait “extraversion” and social media addiction. On the contrary, we found a negative relationship between the personality traits “agreeableness” and “conscientiousness” with social media addiction. Personality traits affect levels of social media addiction among individuals, and therefore policy makers and healthcare professionals in mental health should take into their consideration the personality of social media users.",

          "abstract": "People tend to forget information once they offload it to an external reminder such as a written note or computer file.  However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

The theory predicts more challenging communication between individuals with and without autism, but better communication among individuals with autism. While individuals with autism indeed report better communication, experimental studies testing the theory are largely lacking. In this study, 106 adults (55 with autism) completed an empathic accuracy task in which they watched video clips of an interaction between an individual with and without autism and inferred the individuals’ thoughts. Contrary to our hypothesis, adults with autism were not better at estimating the thoughts of other adults with autism. Instead, they were generally less accurate than adults without autism. Individuals with autism were also perceived as more difficult to estimate. In conclusion, this study did not find support for the DEP theory.

          "abstract": "Interoception, the processing of internal bodily states, contributes to human behaviour through multiple cognitive and affective processes, including emotional regulation and decision-making. It also constitutes a key variable in a range of psychopathological processes. Yet, its core phenomenological dimension, namely how bodily sensations are subjectively experienced, remains understudied. Bodily mapping offers a promising method to address this gap, but existing tools do not allow for a fine-grained assessment of the various dimensions of bodily sensations. Here, we introduce InteroMap, an open-access, open-source tool that enables rigorous and comprehensive assessment of self-reported interoceptive phenomenology. InteroMap comprises (1) a precise drawing interface that combines valence and intensity ratings, (2) front and back views of the body, (3) clear anatomical landmarks for accurate localization, (4) a correction feature, and (5) a post-processing platform to support data visualization and standardization. In a preregistered study (N = 654), we compared InteroMap with the tool most used to assess bodily sensations: emBODY. Our findings show that InteroMap has strong construct validity and outperformed emBODY on convergent, concurrent, and response process validity, as well as on several user experience metrics. InteroMap therefore represents significant progress in the study of interoceptive phenomenology. This tool opens new avenues for testing theoretical models that posit a central role for bodily sensations in healthy and pathological psychological functioning.",

Recent work has shown that episodic retrieval contributes to this cost, confounding estimates of inhibition. This study examines age-related differences in the contributions of inhibition and episodic retrieval to the n–2 repetition cost using a paradigm that controls episodic interference. We also applied the drift diffusion model (DDM) to estimate latent processes underlying these effects. Results showed robust n–2 repetition costs for younger and older adults in response times which reduced when episodic interference was controlled. However, only younger adults showed this pattern in error rates. The DDM showed n–2 repetition costs and their modulation by episodic retrieval were isolated to drift rates, reflecting changes in evidence accumulation. Only younger adults' drift rates were affected by episodic retrieval, with n–2 repetition costs reduced under episodic match conditions. Older adults showed n–2 repetition costs in drift rate regardless of episodic match, suggesting age-related differences in episodic retrieval at the latent level. The results provide insight into age-related differences in inhibition, the importance of controlling episodic retrieval effects in task switching, and the value of computational modelling in revealing age-related differences.",

          "abstract": "Serial dependence is a phenomenon in which current perception is attracted to the immediately preceding perception and is thought to reflect a mechanism for stabilizing perception by integrating information over successive moments. It has been demonstrated across a variety of stimuli and has also been observed in the numerosity perception. A previous study suggested that cross-modal serial dependence in numerosity perception from audition to vision did not occur. However, differences in the stimulus presentation format might have prevented serial dependence from emerging. Therefore, we employed a standardized temporal presentation format consisting of sequences of white noise and visual flashes. As a result, we observed bidirectional cross-modal serial dependence between audition and vision. This result highlights the critical role of presentation format in cross-modal serial dependence. Furthermore, this effect was still observed when inducer stimuli was presented at different spatial positions, in contrast to previous studies on serial dependence within the visual modality. These findings suggest the involvement of a higher-level processing stage. Specifically, a representation that is not selective to specific modality or strictly tied to spatial position, although it remains selective to presentation format, may be involved in the observed effect.",

Thirty-four 30- to 36-month-old children participated in an eyetracking task. First, we examined children’s interest in objects from four semantic categories using three measures of interest: the relative amount of time children spent looking at the novel objects from the different categories, pupillary arousal to familiar objects from the different categories, and pupillary arousal to the novel objects. We then measured children’s target looking in a following test phase. We found that children’s interest in a novel object – as indexed by the looking time – predicted children’ mapping of a novel label with this object. Children mapped the previously heard novel label to their object of interest, and showed a different pattern of looking when presented with a supernovel label. Furthermore, parents’ evaluation of children’s interest in the category to which the object belonged modulated children’s word-object mapping, highlighting the interplay between children’s situational interest in a novel object and their individual interest in the category of the object. We consider the social environment in which such a hit-and-miss strategy could yield successful learning in early development, highlighting the role of children’s interests in driving vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nAlthough major depressive disorder (MDD) is known to have a high societal burden, little is known about the costs associated with the remission phase. Many individuals in remission experience residual symptoms that may impact functioning, productivity, and healthcare use. This study aimed to estimate the societal cost of individuals in remission from MDD in Belgium.\n\nMethods\n\nA total of 138 adults in remission from MDD completed questionnaires assessing healthcare use (iMCQ) and productivity loss (WPAI:GH) over the past three months. Unit costs were applied to estimate annual costs. Descriptive analyses with bias-corrected bootstrap intervals were used. Generalized linear models with a log-link function and Tweedie distribution examined predictors of total, direct and indirect costs.\n\nResults\n\nMean annual societal cost per person was €5388.43 (BCa 95% CI: €3563–8875.05), including €1767.84 (BCa 95% CI: 1148.18–3927.78) in direct costs and €3620.59 (BCa 95% CI: €2142.32–6581.60) in indirect costs. In the final model predicting total societal costs, older age was associated with higher costs (+4.50% per year, p = .001). Sex and education were not significant predictors. Remission duration over 12 months was linked to lower total costs (–67.95%, p = .01) compared to less than 6 months.\n\nConclusions\n\nRemission from MDD continues to impose substantial societal costs, mostly due to reduced work participation. These findings highlight that remission does not equate to full recovery, emphasizing the need for future research into the cost-effectiveness of maintenance and relapse prevention strategies in remitted depression",

          "abstract": "Criticism belongs to everyday communication and is used in different settings and among people with different types of social relationships. The present study experimentally investigated the perception of criticism in French, and examined the role of social distance, power, and of ranking of imposition using a Discourse Evaluation Test in the form of a judgment task. Participants rated short discourse stimuli on Likert scales assessing perceived politeness, perceived offense and disposition to change the behavior criticized. In Experiment 1, we investigated how participants judged bare direct criticisms versus direct criticisms with a marker of positive politeness. In Experiment 2, we compared judgments of bare direct criticisms and indirect criticisms. We also evaluated the impact of the interindividual variables of age, empathy and gender. Results from both experiments confirmed that ranking of imposition was a crucial factor for the perception of criticism. They also indicated that the gender of participants impacted their perception of criticism, as did their level of empathy. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the factors shaping the perception of criticism, in particular on the role of ranking of imposition, thus contributing to broaden our perspective on this crucial speech act.",

          "authors": "Guy Hochman",
          "abstract": "Why do intelligent, well-informed individuals persist in biased reasoning and polarization? Rather than viewing these phenomena as cognitive failures, this paper proposes that rationalization serves an adaptive regulatory function, a form of cognitive homeostasis that maintains psychological coherence when beliefs, emotions, and identity collide. The Homobiasos framework reconceptualizes bias as part of a homeostatic system analogous to physiological regulation, balancing stability and adaptation across cognitive and affective domains.\nDrawing on evidence from decision science, moral psychology, and affective neuroscience, Homobiasos proposes three recursive processes: (1) conflict detection, where dissonant information triggers affective discomfort; (2) regulatory integration, where intuitive and deliberative processes collaborate to restore equilibrium; and (3) narrative consolidation, where reinterpretation stabilizes coherence even at the cost of accuracy. This model predicts that deliberation amplifies rather than corrects bias under identity threat, cognitive sophistication facilitates motivated reasoning, and interventions targeting affective regulation (e.g., self-affirmation, trust-building) outperform accuracy incentives.\nBeyond human cognition, parallels with machine learning systems suggest that homeostatic regulation may constitute a general principle of adaptive intelligence. Reframing rationalization as cognitive homeostasis shifts the question from “why do people deviate from rationality?” to “how do people regulate trade-offs between competing economic, emotional, and identity utilities?” Bias, under this view, is not a flaw to eliminate but a mechanism sustaining psychological integrity amid complexity and uncertainty.",

Within the Tuning to Reset framework, a community-based sound immersion using a guided OM frequency (136.10 Hz) was conducted (n=41). Participants self-reported transitions from coldness, fatigue, and pain to sensations of warmth, calmness, and relaxation. Although uncontrolled and qualitative in nature, these observations complement findings from laboratory studies showing the influence of low-frequency vibratory and chanting exposures on heart rate variability, brain hemodynamics, and subjective stress. The outcomes suggest that collective sound resonance may be feasible as a scalable intervention in community health settings.

          "abstract": "Many common conceptualizations of emotion assume that hedonic tone and motivations to approach or avoid are tightly coupled. Though this view has strong heuristic value, it can fail to differentiate classes of emotion that have similar valence but differing behavioral goals. Threats to personal safety may reliably elicit escape or avoidance. By contrast, cues of suffering in others can elicit competing or mixed motivational states, including prosocial approach. We characterized patterns of valence and motivational direction in response to images of suffering, threat, and interpersonal harm, as well as positive images with and without social content. Participants were 229 undergraduate students who reported their reactions using unipolar dimensions of felt positivity, negativity, approach, and avoidance. In comparison to threat (r = .77), we found that suffering (r = .31) elicited a weaker correlation between valence and motivational direction, and more pronounced coactivation of approach–avoidance states, despite similar levels of negative valence. Images of harm, which combined visual elements of suffering and threat, showed intermediate patterns of avoidance motivation. Across participants, higher trait empathy was associated with greater approach to suffering, while empathy and agreeableness were associated with more extreme valence responses across images. These findings offer novel evidence that motivational direction and valence are separable features of emotional experience and highlight the role of person–situation interactions in shaping the dimensional structure of affect.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "Cultural exchange has been a hallmark of human history, yet it is not always positively received. In particular, people sometimes express strong disapproval toward other groups' use of cultural elements they consider their own—a reaction commonly referred to as cultural appropriation. Prior research attributes such responses to power asymmetries or concerns about identity distinctiveness. However, we argue that such derogation can also arise in the context of shared culture, and is not fully explained by these group-based factors. Instead, we propose that a set of lay beliefs known as cultural essentialism—the belief that culture is inherent, stable, and exclusive—plays a critical role. Across four studies (total N = 3,371) conducted in East Asian cultural contexts, we show that cultural essentialism is associated with (Studies 1–2) and causally increases (Studies 3–4) negative evaluations of outgroup engagement with shared cultural practices. This effect is mediated by collective psychological ownership threat and further amplified when the outgroup is perceived as culturally similar (Studies 2 and 4). Importantly, the effect of cultural essentialism persists above and beyond the influence of ingroup identification, outgroup attitude, and distinctiveness threat. Studies 3–4 additionally demonstrate that cultural essentialism promotes more exclusive cultural behavioral intentions. These findings suggest that cultural essentialism contributes to intergroup cultural tension by activating ownership-related concerns, independent of cultural identity or power asymmetry.",

          "abstract": "The prevailing model of democracy is currently grappling with a profound crisis of affective polarization, necessitating a reimagining of both the theory and practice of democracy. In response to this challenge, deliberative democracy, which emphasizes civil and diverse discussions that empower individuals to make well-informed decisions by critically evaluating competing arguments, has garnered increasing attention. Existing literature initially supports deliberative democracy as a societal norm capable of addressing affective polarization. We further propose that deliberative democracy as a set of lay beliefs may also mitigate outgroup derogations on public issues. Through four studies conducted in the Chinese context (N = 1634), we first developed a measurement of beliefs in deliberative democracy, then got support for our main propositions, verified opinion extremity as boundary conditions, and receptiveness to opposing views as a partial mediation. The findings highlight the potential of reshaping public beliefs through education and policy interventions to cultivate a healthier and more inclusive democracy.",

          "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a promising cost-effective alternative for assessing public opinion. However, most prior research has focused on simulating individual personas using past surveys, leaving it unclear whether LLMs can accurately estimate out-of-sample public opinion at the societal level. We address this gap with three studies that systematically evaluate the accuracy, bias, and variability of commercial and non-commercial LLMs in inferring societal-level public opinion. First, we evaluated GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on four recent Pew Research Centre polls, finding that both models outperformed traditional baseline methods, with GPT-4 showing higher accuracy, with an error rate ranging from 4% to 9%. Notably, GPT-3.5 produced overly uniform responses characterized by lower variance and higher entropy compared to actual human data, whereas GPT-4’s predictions more closely mirrored real response patterns. Both models, however, exhibited partisan skew, aligning more strongly with Democratic perspectives and underrepresenting Republican viewpoints. Second, we assessed the generalisability of these findings by testing various models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3) on three additional Pew surveys. These models demonstrated similar predictive accuracy and a continued tendency toward less varied responses, though partisan bias was less pronounced in the latest models. Third, we examined the robustness of our findings through ablation studies of prompt design by varying parameters such as temperature, role, and input format and found that the results were consistent across these conditions. Importantly, collective-level estimation consistently outperformed averaged individual-level simulation, which suffered from greater homogeneity bias. Overall, LLMs show strong potential for public opinion estimation, though their inherent biases and methodological limitations warrant careful consideration.",

          "abstract": "Why do uninvolved bystanders punish norm violations less harshly than victims? This longstanding puzzle lies at the heart of theories of fairness and cooperation. Prior accounts suggest that bystanders are less sensitive to unfairness than victims when reacting to fairness norm violations. Across three experiments, we tested this assumption by directly comparing third-party punishment (TPP) and second-party punishment (SPP). In Experiment 1 (N = 234), both fairness-related factors (harm, intention) and interest-related factors (cost) shaped punishment, yet bystanders consistently punished less than victims. Experiment 2 (N = 105) showed that bystanders and victims perceived unfairness similarly, but third parties punished less, decided faster, and displayed reduced decision conflict. Through computational modeling, Experiment 3 (N = 139) revealed that interest-driven motives—self-interest consideration and cost-ratio-based inequality disregarding—accounted for the punishment gap, whereas fairness-driven motives played a secondary role. Moreover, interest-driven motives shaped the initial bias against intervention, prompting bystanders to reach rejection decisions faster. Together, these findings challenge fairness-centered explanations and demonstrate that third parties intervene less, not because they fail to recognize unfairness, but because they are more sensitive to the personal costs of sanctioning. This conclusion refines motivational theories of norm enforcement and highlights how institutional mechanisms that lower the costs of intervention may promote stronger collective action to uphold social norms.",

          "abstract": "Native speakers imitate F0 contours that vary between two lexical tones non-linearly–they do not precisely reproduce the presented F0 features but instead cluster them toward tonal categories, the so-called contrast mediation effect. However, less is known whether non-native speakers who lack the lexical tone phonology will show linear imitation of F0 contours. Addressing this question will deepen our understanding of whether F0 imitation is solely influenced by lexical tone contrasts or also shaped by other sources of non-linearity beyond phonological contrasts. To investigate this, the current study examined the categorization and imitation of a Mandarin flat-falling tonal continuum by both Mandarin speakers and English speakers who were naïve to tonal languages. Imitation distributions were analyzed by comparing two models: a linear regression model, which assumes participants linearly track phonetic cues, and a mixture regression model, which assumes imitation reflects underlying categories. The mixture regression model fit the data better for the Mandarin speakers while the reverse was true for the English speakers, suggesting that Mandarin speakers imitated the F0 contours more categorically than English speakers. However, for both groups, the data was best fit using a weighted combination of both models. For the Mandarin group this result along with additional analyses of duration, F1 and intensity suggest that tone categories involve both phonological and phonetic information and imitation taps both, possibly via hyper- and hypo-articulation. For English participants, the evidence for categorical mediation suggests that imitation is mediated by factors other than lexically contrastive linguistic categories, although the exact nature of the factors is unclear.",

However, empirical research has not yet clarified how distinct patterns of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) relate to recidivism across different types of criminal offenses. We therefore constructed a Bayesian network to model the probabilistic relationships between CERS and recidivism, conditioning on offense type. To obtain a practical, parsimonious network, we first derived interpretable summary indexes from multiple CERS indicators using convex generalized structured component analysis. These indexes were then used as network nodes. The resulting network suggests that CERS differ systematically across offense types and are differentially associated with the likelihood of recidivism. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both individual CERS profiles and offense type into the design of correctional interventions aimed at reducing recidivism.",

However the behavioral consequences of these policies on human navigation are mostly unknown. Using virtual reality, we investigated how some common preventive measures influenced how people navigate near other people. Participants (N=29) traversed virtual rooms containing virtual people\n(“agents”) while we manipulated their mask status, the mask status of the agents, and the perceived environmental safety (high/low community vaccination rates). We found that initial path selection was primarily determined by agent mask-wearing, with participants more likely to pass in front of masked than unmasked agents. The perception of environmental safety predominantly governed subsequent interpersonal distance, with closer proximity maintained in high-vaccination contexts. The participants’ own mask status was the least influential, suggesting that navigational choices were driven by external risk assessment rather than personal protection. We observed clear risk compensation: subjects generally reduced interpersonal distance in safer conditions (whether environmental, agent masking, or personal masking). Bayesian model comparisons favored a three-factor additive model, indicating independent rather than interactive influences on behavior. These findings reveal the interplay of decisions underlying pandemic-era social navigation, and highlight the importance of accounting for risk compensation in public health interventions.",

          "abstract": "It is well known that the way monolingual listeners discriminate speech  sounds is strongly influenced by their native (L1) sound system (Best, McRoberts, &amp; Goodell, 2001; Best &amp; Strange, 1992; Werker, Gilbert, &amp; Humphrey, 1981). Such perceptual constraints are not limited to monolinguals: multiple studies have found evidence of language-specificity in bilingual speech perception (Antoniou, Best, &amp; Tyler, 2013; Sebastián-Gallés &amp; Soto-Faraco, 1999). However, the question of whether bilinguals have simultaneous access to both of their phonologies during non-native contrast discrimination has not been systematically examined. Namely, very few studies of bilinguals have specifically examined cases where a non-native contrast pair straddles the boundary between two sound systems, with one sound corresponding to a sound in the L1, and the other to a sound in the L2, but with neither the L1 nor the L2 containing both. The current study aimed to do so by comparing the ability of early bilinguals to discriminate non-native phonetic contrasts consisting of sounds that exist in either their L1 or L2, but not in both. A forced-choice perception task was designed to compare two listener groups—Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals—on their perception of Nepali dental-alveolar stop contrasts. Results showed that despite displaying some sensitivity to phonetic differences within each contrast pair, the bilingual group was unable to discriminate such “cross-language contrasts” significantly better than the monolingual English control group.",

          "abstract": "Individuals with Williams syndrome have been reported to experience challenges with executive functioning relative to neurotypical individuals, particularly in inhibition. However, previous studies have produced conflicting findings on the extent of differences between these two groups which might reflect a failure to deconfound inhibition and working memory effects on performance. This study assessed this issue by examining performance on novel Go/No-go and colour-word Stroop tasks that varied in inhibitory and memory loads in individuals with Williams syndrome (N = 24) and a large comparison sample of neurotypical children (N = 82). Bayesian analysis showed a meaningful difference between the participant groups on Go/No-go sensitivity scores (D’): participants with Williams syndrome showed poorer sensitivity on all conditions, with the exception of a high memory and high inhibition condition where they outperformed the comparison group. On the Stroop task, individuals with Williams syndrome were slower and less accurate than the comparison group, particularly on high memory and high inhibition conditions. However, accounting for sample differences in non-verbal ability, or word reading speed, removed many previously meaningful group differences in task performance. While inhibitory control is therefore not entirely ‘intact’ in Williams syndrome, individuals’ performance was broadly consistent with other abilities measured in this study. It would therefore be premature to conclude that inhibition is a fundamental area of weakness within executive control for individuals with Williams syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Working memory capacity (WMC) has long been used as a central measure of cognitive abilities, predicting performance across a wide range of tasks. We argue that much of this predictive power in fact reflects attention control (AC)—functions such as goal mainte-nance and inhibition—rather than storage capacity per se. We review evidence across six domains: (1) perception and sensory discrimination, (2) learning and problem solving, (3) cognitive control and decision making, (4) retrieval and memory performance, (5) mul-titasking and real-world performance, and (6) clinical applications. We show that many findings attributed to WMC are better explained as reflecting demands on AC. We en-courage the use of more reliable measures of AC to directly test these mechanisms and recommend latent-variable approaches to better distinguish the cognitive processes underlying complex performance.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify research that utilizes modern intensive longitudinal assessment methods (e.g., Ecological Momentary Assessment [EMA]; Experience Sampling [ESM], Daily Diary) to study the mechanisms of change in behavioral activation. \nIntroduction: Behavioral activation (BA) is an efficient and accessible transdiagnostic therapy that has demonstrated considerable effectiveness across populations, settings, and delivery formats. Despite decades of research on BA, its underlying mechanisms remain understudied, partly due to the use of inadequate methodologies. Modern intensive longitudinal assessment methods, like ecological momentary assessment administered via a smartphone, are ideally suited to capturing mechanisms of change in therapy because they facilitate examination of dynamic within-person processes across large samples. To date, such research is fairly limited and has never been summarized.\nInclusion criteria: We will include peer-reviewed empirical articles on clinical trials of BA that examine mechanisms of change in the context of treatment captured with modern intensive assessment methods. No restrictions will be placed on the sample or treatment setting, with the exception that small N studies (N &lt; 5) will be excluded. Clinical trials of treatments that include BA alongside other interventions (e.g., cognitive restructuring) will be excluded.\nMethods:  The search strategy will aim to locate published studies from database inception up to October 14, 2025. A comprehensive search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science will be undertaken by independent reviewers to identify peer-reviewed articles on the topic. Data extracted from eligible studies will include information about the article, sample characteristics, intervention details, mechanism assessment details, and main findings regarding the mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "A widespread observation is that people avoid mentally effortful courses of action, and much recent work examining cognitive effort has explained subjective effort evaluation—and consequently, preferences—in economic terms, which assumes that the expenditure of cognitive effort is experienced as costly. However, this economic perspective is largely tacit about the source of these costs. Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands. Finally, we identify open questions which might help bridge across these accounts.",

          "abstract": "The Affect Grid is a single-item measure that simultaneously assesses affective valence and arousal, yet few studies have tested its validity in everyday settings. Prior validation efforts focused on only one dimension, used small samples, and/or relied on cross-sectional data. To address these gaps, we integrated two week-long daily diary studies (N = 474; 2,809 observations) in which participants reported their nightly affect using both the Affect Grid and single-item ratings of how positive, negative, neutral, and aroused they felt. Correlation analyses showed that Affect Grid valence and arousal were strongly related to their corresponding single-item measures but only weakly related to other dimensions, supporting convergent and discriminant validity. Multilevel models further showed that Affect Grid valence predicted higher positive and lower negative affect, whereas Affect Grid arousal primarily predicted single-item arousal, at both between- and within-person levels. A quadratic pattern for valence suggested that neutral affect peaked at moderate levels of valence, consistent with the view of valence as a bipolar continuum. Overall, these results support the Affect Grid as a concise and reliable tool for measuring affective valence and arousal in daily life.",

This commentary addresses the question of what determines “better than expected” cognition. More specifically, it considers cognitive performance that is better than expected from standard clinical assessments of the brain. This is in the spirit of the original puzzle raised by (Katzman et al., 1988), who identified individuals whose cognitive abilities had been well above average despite post mortem revealing neuropathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. More commonly these days, the term is used by neurologists to describe people who show comparable atrophy on a clinical brain scan, yet differ markedly in their cognitive function. This “puzzle” is important, particularly if we can identify factors, such as lifestyle choices, that might boost this reserve, allowing individuals to maintain their cognitive abilities for longer, despite brain atrophy.",

We explored how the combination of i) window size, ii) window overlap, iii) prewhitening and iv) use of Peak-Picking (PP) algorithm affected several indices of IPS strength and stability, as well as their ability to discriminate between real and surrogate dyads. \nThe original results of the stufy were overall replicated, with all IPS indices successfully discriminating genuine from surrogate synchrony regardless of parameter selection. By contrast, the selection of parameters had a greater influence when distinguishing between task and baseline IPS. Moreover, the PP algorithm tended to overestimate synchrony strength, thereby hindering discrimination. Importantly, measures of synchrony stability proved effective in distinguishing genuine from surrogate synchrony. Based on our multiverse results, we provide recommendations for researchers applying WCC analysis to study cardiac IPS synchrony.",

          "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations, especially the perception of voices in the absence of external stimuli, are a hallmark of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia. Modeling these complex phenomena in animals is challenging, as traditional rodent models rely on indirect behavioral proxies and simple stimuli. Here, I propose that songbirds, with their sophisticated vocal communication and well-mapped neural circuitry for auditory processing, offer a novel model for studying auditory hallucinations. We hypothesize that songbirds can experience hallucination-like perceptions of vocalizations under specific conditions, driven by neural mechanisms of predictive coding and neuromodulation analogous to those in mammals. In this article, we outline supporting evidence for this hypothesis, drawing comparisons between songbirds and traditional mammalian models. We discuss how pharmacological manipulations – extensively used in rodent models – could be applied or adapted to songbirds to induce and investigate hallucination-like events. We then propose a methodological framework to test these ideas, including behavioral paradigms (e.g., detecting illusory calls embedded in noise). Discussion of this framework highlights the strengths of songbirds (rich vocal behaviors, accessible neural circuits) and addresses potential limitations (evolutionary distance and differing brain anatomy). By emphasizing predictive coding and circuit-level mechanisms, we argue that songbirds can fill an essential gap in auditory hallucination research, offering a complementary model alongside rodents and primates. This hypothesis, if validated, would broaden our understanding of hallucinations and open new experimental avenues for probing the neural basis of psychosis.",

Models used 10-fold cross-validation; precision-recall AUC (PR AUC) was the primary metric. Both item-level and network-augmented models outperformed the total-score baseline. The network-augmented XGBoost performed best (PR AUC = 0.37) while meeting screening criteria (sensitivity ≥0.80; specificity ≥0.50). The most influential signals were the centrality and severity of depressed mood and worthlessness/guilt, network density, and selected edges. External validation across five datasets (N = 808,023) yielded normalized PR AUCs of 0.32-0.51, supporting generalizability.

Yet, it is unclear whether this improvement contributes to the development of serial order memory. Here we investigated the role of semantic elaboration in the development of immediate memory for lists of object pictures. If the ability to use elaboration to encode new inter-item associations accounts for some of the developmental trend, then training children in an elaborative strategy should mitigate age differences in memory for serial order. We trained 7-year-olds (elaboration group) to create short stories to memorize lists of four items for serial order reconstruction and compared them to same-age and adult controls who received no strategy-specific instructions. All participants responded to questions on strategy use intermittently during the task and at its end. Although the story-making training markedly changed children’s strategy reports, it did not improve their serial order memory. Moreover, although individual differences in the ability to create stories were strongly correlated with participants’ serial order memory task performance, story quality and memory for serial order were only weakly correlated at the trial level. Results suggest that growing levels of use of semantic elaboration cannot account for the development of serial order memory in childhood. We discuss children’s mnemonic\nstrategies in serial order tasks in light of other studies.",

Famously, Desmond Morris in his book The Naked Ape (Morris, 1967),\nconcluded that humans’ most obviously striking trait compared to other mammals is our\nhairlessness! But arguably the most vital of our unique traits is our unusually strong willingness to\ncooperate, often in notably large numbers. As a result of the importance and prevalence of\n[[cooperation]] to the human species, some go so far as to call humans [[ultrasocial]] (Campbell,\n1983). It is likely this ultra-cooperativeness helped humans to both survive the challenges of the\nAfrican savannah, where our species evolved, and then our rapid expansion across the globe\n(Townsend et al., 2023).\nHowever, despite this clear benefit to human success, it is all too common for discussions of\ncooperation to begin by calling it a puzzle (e.g., Henrich &amp; Muthukrishna, 2021) or a problem (e.g.,\nWest et al., 2011). It is the case that [[natural selection]] is generally a process of [[competition]]\nbetween individuals, and a trait that reduces an individual’s chances to reproduce will be selected\nagainst. Cooperation seems costly to reproductive fitness and often benefits other individuals, so\nsurely it is selected against? This is the source of the notion of cooperation as a puzzle. Yet in the\nevolutionary sciences there has been a lot of work undertaken to understand how behaviours that\nappear to undermine the fitness of cooperators could have evolved.

The dual-state model (Olivers et al., 2011) argues that visual working memory can only be focused on a single representation at a time, and therefore, we can only search for one target at a time. Consequently, to detect two potential targets, we must rapidly alternate our attention between the two corresponding representations. By contrast, the resource hypothesis (Huynh Cong &amp; Kerzel, 2021) posits that we can simultaneously activate more than one representation for visual search, although this requires sharing the available resources. In three pre-registered experiments, we compared the predictions from the state-based model and the resource hypothesis in a combined search and memory task. The results suggest that participants allocate their resources based on the reliability of the retro-cue and therefore favor the resource hypothesis. In contrast, the results are less consistent with the state-based model, which predicts that the cost in terms of response time and accuracy should remain identical regardless of the retro-cue’s reliability.",

While justification for civic dishonesty remained stable globally, we also find parallel winner/loser effects on personal well-being (happiness, optimism), again in the same direction among Europeans and Americans. Treating the U.S. election as a ‘vicarious event’, our study reveals how major democratic outcomes generate psychological and political spillover effects beyond national borders, extending the winner-loser gap to international citizens.",

In a sample of 4,642 sibling pairs from UKB, we estimate the standardized within-family effect of the PGS to be δ=0.355 (SE 0.0218), indicating only slight attenuation of prediction ability within-family (δ/β=0.876, SE 0.050). We obtain similar results in a sample of 736 9-10-year-old European ancestry sibling pairs from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort. After correcting for the reliability of the UK Biobank and ABCD phenotypes, the inverse-variance-weighted within-family association of the PGS with latent general ability is estimated at 0.448 (SE 0.025). Our PGS predicts higher educational attainment, occupational status, and family income within families, and retains good performance in non-European ancestry samples, with the correlation retaining 64% of its magnitude in the African American subset of the ABCD cohort, in line with expectations. In UKB siblings, higher scores correlate with better self‑reported health and lower risk of multiple cardiometabolic diseases.

Additionally, we extended the scope by exploring whether greenwashing training also affects healthwashing detection. Our study revealed that greenwashing training can make consumers more likely to perceive advertisements featuring deceptive environmental claims correctly as greenwashing but can also make them more likely to misperceive advertisements without such claims as greenwashing. Furthermore, it showed that although healthwashing is not the subject of greenwashing training, the triggered skepticism can transfer to healthwashing perceptions, too. Overall, these findings suggest that greenwashing training does not enhance greenwashing detection proficiency but rather promotes excessive suspicion.",

Notwithstanding its inherently simple and elegant idea - agents minimise surprise, otherwise known as free energy, through a blief and action updating process referred to as active inference - real-world application has been limited due to computational complexity and the abstract nature of the mathematical framework. This paper introduces FEP to travel behaviour research, developing an active inference model of route choice under uncertainty and applying it to two experimental datasets. Results demonstrate that the FEP model outperforms alternatives based on reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for individuals displaying exploratory or belief- adaptive behaviour. While computationally more demanding, the FEP framework offers substantial advantages in capturing learning dynamics, habit formation, and uncertainty-driven adaptation in travel decision-making, positioning it as a promising neurocomputational foundation for future travel behaviour models.",

This was also true for subgroups of Autistic adults who expressed clinically significant autistic traits, anxiety or depression, those from minoritised ethnicities, older adults and who were unemployed. The findings suggest the ICF CoreSets for Autism platform has potential as a standardised evidence-based tool to improve understanding of Autistic adults’ strengths and needs.",

          "abstract": "The perspectives on the genuine basis of self and self-consciousness are diverse. Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Large-scale changes in consumption are essential for mitigating climate change. Yet, people’s behaviors and their perceptions of what is feasible to change are deeply influenced by their social and physical environments. Despite growing recognition of these influences, empirical evidence integrating both current behavior and perceived feasibility of change remains limited. In this study, we examine the relationship between perceptions of physical and social environments and both the frequency of high-impact transport and food behaviors, as well as their perceived behavioral plasticity—the perceived likelihood of changing such behaviors while considering associated costs and barriers. In exploratory analyses, we also examine how perceived behavioral plasticity relates to perceived wellbeing impacts of behavior change. Using survey data from 1,202 UK adults, we analyzed current driving, air travel, public transport use, and red and white meat consumption, together with perceived plasticity and wellbeing impact for each behavior. Social environmental factors, particularly descriptive norms and family goal support, predicted most current behaviors and perceived plasticity across domains. By contrast, perceptions of physical environmental factors, such as public transport access or food appeal, were associated with behavior and plasticity in more domain-specific ways. Perceived behavioral plasticity was positively correlated with perceived wellbeing impacts, suggesting that perceptions of feasibility and desirability are intertwined. These findings together demonstrate the importance of targeting both physical opportunity structures and social contexts when promoting climate-relevant behavior change.",

          "abstract": "Aim: Childhood maltreatment and adolescent mental health problems are unequally distributed, with the highest burdens among marginalised groups including females and those experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Yet little is known about how the psychological consequences of maltreatment vary across intersecting social positions (e.g., socioeconomically disadvantaged females). Prior quantitative work has largely compared average differences across a few groups, obscuring non-additive, intersectional patterning. Because social realities are structured by overlapping systems of privilege and oppression, this study aimed to (i) map inequalities in adolescent emotional problems and the effects of maltreatment across intersectional groups; and (ii) describe the extent to which inequalities reflect additive and non-additive (intersectional) effects. Method: Data were analysed from 19,590 11-16-year-olds in the Oxwell 2023 Student Survey in England, United Kingdom. Within a random-coefficient Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA), individuals were nested in 180 intersectional strata defined by gender, ethnicity, household poverty, school year group, and school-level deprivation (also entered as additive effects). Emotional problem scores (Revised Child Depression and Anxiety Scale) were regressed on maltreatment exposure (Short Childhood Maltreatment Questionnaire) as the primary effect of interest. Stratum-specific predicted emotional problems and maltreatment effects were estimated, and between-stratum variance was partitioned into additive and residual non-additive components. Results: Maltreatment was associated with higher emotional problems for all strata (+3.20 to +6.14 points). Socioeconomically disadvantaged female and non-binary adolescents showed the highest burden and among the strongest maltreatment effects. Between-stratum inequalities in emotional problems were largely explained by exposure to maltreatment and the additive contributions of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, age, and place. However, residual non-additive intersectional effects were also evident, especially among individuals exposed to maltreatment (5.25% of between-stratum variance; compared with 3.46% among those not exposed). Conclusion: In this sample of adolescents in England, the detrimental effects of maltreatment on adolescent emotional problems appear pervasive but not uniform across intersecting social positions. Applying intersectional MAIHDA shows that inequalities largely reflect additive social patterning, with additional non-additive contributions suggestive of intersectional dynamics that are more pronounced with maltreatment exposure. These findings motivate deeper investigation into the social-structural mechanisms that shape vulnerability and resilience, and call for trauma-informed, equity-focused interventions and policy to reduce unequal exposure to maltreatment and the contexts that amplify harm.",

          "abstract": "Cross-sectional research indicates that first-person shooter (FPS) expertise relates to superior multitasking. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects true multitasking enhancement or differences in general processing speed. We classified N = 230 Counter-Strike players (16-34 years old) using k-means clustering into four expertise clusters (Novice, Skilled, Emerging, Expert). We assessed their task-switching performance, using Drift-Diffusion Modelling (DDM) to decompose reaction times and accuracies into underlying cognitive components. Expert and Skilled players exhibited significantly faster reaction times than Novice players. Crucially, the lack of significant interaction between expertise and task condition provided no evidence for a specific multitasking advantage. DDM revealed that this processing speed advantage was driven by shorter non-decision times, indicative of faster stimulus encoding and motor response execution. No significant expertise-related differences were found in drift rate or boundary separation. Findings suggest that FPS experience relates to a general processing speed advantage driven by perceptual-motor efficiencies.",

However, predictors such as obstetric complications, sleep disturbances and social support are underexplored in large population-based cohorts. \n\nMethods\n\nWe analysed data from 44,479 UK Biobank participants with at least one live birth to examine associations between obstetric factors (e.g., hypertensive disorders, multiple pregnancy, preterm birth), later self-reported sleep problems (e.g., insomnia, short sleep), and social support (e.g., loneliness) with PND risk. Comparisons were made with a) healthy controls and b) women with non-perinatal depression, using both lifetime history and prospective ICD-coded diagnoses around first birth. Predictors were examined using logistic regression and penalised regression models, adjusting for age, neuroticism, body mass index, deprivation, and education.\n\nResults\n\nLifetime PND was associated with younger age at first birth, higher parity, stillbirth/miscarriage, preterm birth, sleep disorders, and later self-reported insomnia, difficulty getting up, short sleep, loneliness, and evening chronotype vs. controls. Prospective analyses showed increased PND risk vs. controls following multiple or preterm births and in those later reporting difficulty getting up. Preterm birth was associated with PND but not non-perinatal depression. Penalised regression models showed good discrimination of lifetime and prospective PND vs. controls (AUC = 0.78 and 0.77). Strongest predictors included neuroticism, younger maternal age, higher BMI, greater parity, difficulty getting up, stillbirth/miscarriage, and sleep disorder history.\n\nConclusions\n\nMothers with pregnancy-related trauma/complications, tendency towards sleep difficulties and low social support may benefit from targeted preventive resources.

          "abstract": "Matrescence is the term used to refer to the developmental process of becoming a mother, encompassing conception through to the postpartum period. This vulnerable period involves profound neurological restructuring driven by hormonal and environmental changes. Despite the high rates of maternal mental illness, the socioemotional developments that accompany this neurological restructuring remain under researched. To better understand the social experience of matrescence, this study investigated how women experience the transition into motherhood, exploring the topics of body autonomy, social expectations, mental health, and identity development. Interviews with six postpartum women revealed how the experience reduced personal autonomy in motherhood, alongside the necessary cognitive adjustment, functioned as a key mechanism driving maternal identity transformation. The findings of this study provide critical context for understanding how neuroplasticity observed in matrescence can be expressed in real-time. The analysis also illuminated how social support functions as a crucial buffer against emotional distress for new mothers, providing insight into potential strategies to support new mothers. This study underscores the importance of further research into maternal identity transformation and the role of social support in facilitating this transition.",

          "abstract": "Background: Background music has been shown to influence cognitive performance and mood in healthy individuals, but evidence in clinical populations such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains scarce. In PD, attentional deficits and mood disturbances often co-occur, and both are closely linked to alterations in arousal regulation.\nObjective: This study investigated whether background music differing in arousal level modulates mood and attentional performance in individuals with PD and whether interindividual differences in music reward sensitivity influence these effects.\nMethods: Forty-one patients with mild to moderate PD completed the Attention Network Test (ANT) under three auditory conditions: moderate-low arousal music, moderate-high arousal music, and silence. Mood was assessed before and after the task using the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and individual differences were measured with the extended Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (eBMRQ).\nResults: Both music conditions reduced post-task depression compared to silence, but a significant pre–post improvement was observed only in the moderate-low arousal group. Fatigue was attenuated and tension decreased under low arousal music, whereas Vigor remained unchanged. Although overall ANT performance was unaffected by auditory condition, a block-wise analysis revealed that executive control improved over time in the low arousal group but declined in silence, while alerting increased only in the silence group. Furthermore, in the low arousal group, Mood Regulation scores from the eBMRQ positively predicted task accuracy.\nConclusion: These findings suggest that low-arousal background music can support mood stabilization and sustain executive control in PD, particularly in patients who habitually use music for emotional regulation. The results highlight the importance of considering arousal level and individual differences when designing music-based cognitive interventions for clinical populations.",

          "abstract": "Research on human memory has expanded rapidly over the past decades, leading to the development of numerous models and experimental paradigms. However, this growth has also resulted in increasing specialization, with limited integration across models, tasks, age groups, and domains. Here, we present the Embedded Computational Framework of Memory (eCFM), a simple yet flexible computational model that integrates encoding, storage, retrieval, and decision processes with structured representations that capture visual, orthographic, phonological, and semantic information. We tested the generalizability of the eCFM across 11 experiments involving approximately 40 younger (18 to 25 years) and 40 older adults (65 to 80 years) per experiment. In Experiments 1 to 4, participants completed order reconstruction tasks using words or images varying in semantic, phonological, orthographic, or visual similarity. Experiments 5 to 7 tested serial recall using the same materials. In Experiments 8 to 11, participants performed old/new recognition tests with studied and unstudied items with similar representational forms. Results showed age-related differences in serial recall, smaller differences in order reconstruction, and none in recognition. Across all tasks and domains, participants consistently showed high false memory rates for related foils, with no age-related differences. The eCFM accounted for all main findings and captured age-related differences, and the lack thereof, by manipulating encoding strength and position discriminability. Overall, the model represents a step toward a general account of human memory and highlights the potential and value of integrating traditionally separate areas of memory research.",

At the same time, culturally grounded adaptations were observed, including the incorporation of practices such as Naikan, Zen meditation, and martial arts, alongside thematic emphases on relational and psychosomatic processes. However, explicit engagement with cultural adaptation was relatively limited, raising questions about the extent to which local cultural contexts are informing or being overlooked in the adaptation process. \n\nConclusion: As mindfulness continues to circulate globally, findings from this study highlight the need for context-sensitive approaches that engage with both global frameworks and local conceptual traditions.",

          "authors": "Paul C. Bogdan",
          "abstract": "The present report argues that the pursuit of social alignment drives all aspects of how individuals evaluate and respond to another person’s behavior. Social/moral judgment – whether you see another person as good and their behavior as appropriate – can be framed as an evaluation of whether the person’s values align with yours and whether they acted the same way you would. Following negative judgments, your responses can be understood as attempts to reestablish alignment, such as by conforming to this person’s behavior or punishing it. From this perspective, the present research proposes the Self-Other Prediction Error (SOPE) model, which conceptualizes these mechanisms within frameworks of predictive coding, Theory of Mind, and dual-process decision-making. Recent studies experimentally testing this model validate its core arguments and show that SOPE predicts participants’ reactions to others’ behavior more accurately than earlier theories focusing on norms or utility. Furthermore, reinterpreting older studies suggests that the proposed model successfully reconciles a wide array of phenomena concerning moral psychology, behavioral economics, and other social cognition topics. Hence, the proposed SOPE account is posed as a foundation for understanding social information processing generally and its computational underpinnings.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

TSA posits that humans implicitly employ Higher Order Markov Models (HOMMs) of individualised orders to predict the next symbol in binary sequences. The internal beliefs of such models enable the emergence of subjectively perceived structure, even in randomly generated sequences, when Sub-en falls below an entropic threshold. \n\nWe conducted a single-participant pilot-study to investigate two related hypotheses: \n\ni) Participants achieve higher accuracy when predicting the next symbol in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic sequences. \nii) Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and used as an outcome measurement, reflect greater prediction errors in sub-entropic conditions.\n\nBehavioural results supported the first hypothesis. Neural data showed significantly larger MEP amplitudes for incorrect predictions in sub-entropic compared to super-entropic conditions, supporting the second hypothesis and suggesting a domain-general neural response to prediction errors that consequently decreases with greater internal baseline uncertainty. These findings provide initial empirical support for TSA and establish Sub-en as an objective metric for quantifying subjective predictability.",

Across three sentence-picture matching experiments, we  observed that bilingual logical representations can be primed both within- and between-languages. Moreover, a control experiment ruled out an explanation in terms of visual priming. These findings indicate that bilinguals use shared logical representations in processing both languages, which do not specify language-specific biases in scope assignment. Additionally, our results showed that Estonian-English bilinguals learn L2-specific scope assignment biases, and that they encounter cross-linguistic influence in the construction logical representations.

However, studies directly comparing virtual and real-world replicas remain scarce. The present study investigated three experimental conditions—IVR, non-immersive VR (N-IVR), and Reality—focusing on subjective experiences and episodic memory performance. Participants (N = 156) were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions and completed a Shelf Task involving two encoding sessions in which they placed 8 objects on a shelf per session, followed by two recall sessions 10 minutes later. After encoding, participants rated subjective experiences, including spatial presence (self-location and action possibilities), similarity to daily life, enjoyment, cybersickness, and game mechanics. Overall, IVR approximated real-world experience more closely than N-IVR. Ratings of action possibilities and similarity to daily life in IVR matched Reality, and IVR elicited higher enjoyment than both N-IVR and Reality. Some differences remained: self-location and game mechanics favored Reality, and cybersickness was unique to IVR, though at low levels. Memory performance revealed robust session × condition effects. In Session 1, IVR recall lagged behind N-IVR and Reality, suggesting initial challenges with IVR encoding. By Session 2, IVR performance improved markedly, reaching levels comparable to N-IVR for free recall and to both Reality and N-IVR for spatial recall. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of IVR: it can closely approximate real-world experience and memory performance over repeated exposure, but subjective and embodied aspects of reality are not fully replicated. The results have implications for experimental and applied cognitive assessment, as well as clinical and training contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to ease the increasing workload in ophthalmology by supporting ophthalmologists’ clinical decision-making. However, despite regulatory approvals, the adoption and use of AI-enabled clinical decision support systems (AI-CDSS) in ophthalmology remains limited. Critical obstacles that innovative healthcare technologies such as AI-CDSS face on their path to widespread clinical use are nonadoption and abandonment by their intended users, which prevent broader dissemination and real clinical benefit. This study explores how to overcome nonadoption and prevent abandonment of ophthalmic AI-CDSS by identifying ophthalmology professionals’ requirements for adoption and continued use of such tools in clinical practice.\nMethods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 22 ophthalmology professionals from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, representing a range of professional roles, clinical settings, and extent of AI-CDSS experience. To explore sociotechnical factors shaping ophthalmology professionals’ adoption decisions and their ability to derive added value from ophthalmic AI-CDSS, we conducted a qualitative content analysis combining deductive and inductive coding. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework deductively guided the development of higher-level code categories, representing seven sociotechnical domains relevant for the implementation of healthcare technologies. These were further refined into subcategories through inductive coding of the interview material.\nResults: Most participants expressed general openness to ophthalmic AI-CDSS. However, actual adoption decisions and the ability to derive clinical value from these tools were shaped not just by individual attitudes but also by a range of other sociotechnical influences. Specifically, we inductively identified 29 code categories, representing sociotechnical influences and requirements from all seven NASSS domains, including technological, user, organizational, and societal aspects. Our findings also suggest that while many sociotechnical influences and challenges are shared between AI-based and traditional healthcare technologies, a key distinction of (ophthalmic) AI-CDSS lies in the users’ psychological appraisal of such tools. \nConclusions: Our findings highlight the complex and context-specific nature of integrating AI-CDSS into ophthalmic practice. This study also informs AI and healthcare researchers on the applicability of the NASSS framework for studying AI implementation and provides actionable insights for AI developers and implementers aiming to address user needs more effectively.",

          "abstract": "Background: Routine screening of cognitive and mental health is considered best practice post-stroke care. However, empirical evidence to support clinical interpretation of cognitive screening outcomes in relation to neuropsychological functioning and anxiety/depression symptoms is limited. \nObjectives: The aim of this study was to enhance evidence-based interpretation of the Oxford Cognitive Screen-Australian version (OCS-AU) performance by examining relationships between OCS-AU outcomes with neuropsychological constructs and specific anxiety/depression symptoms.\nMethods: Fifty-three stroke survivors within 12 weeks post-stroke in Australian rehabilitation services were recruited. Participants completed the OCS-AU, a neuropsychological test battery, the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Correlations between OCS-AU outcomes with neuropsychological constructs, and anxiety/depression symptoms were analysed.\nResults: The OCS-AU subtests Hearts Cancellation, Picture Naming, Number Writing, and Gestural Imitation demonstrated significant correlations with their respective neuropsychological counterparts (r=0.35-0.72, p&lt;0.05), unlike OCS-AU Memory and Executive Function subtests, which demonstrated inconsistent associations with corresponding neuropsychological constructs. OCS-AU domains demonstrated stronger associations with anxiety symptoms than depression symptoms, especially ‘Feeling nervous’, ‘Worrying thoughts’, ‘Trouble relaxing’ and ‘Irritability’ from the GAD-7, and ‘Psychomotor changes’ from the PHQ-9. OCS-AU Executive Function, Memory and Spatial Attention showed the most associations with anxiety and depression symptoms. \nConclusions: \nThese findings reveal variable associations between OCS-AU subtests and neuropsychological constructs, with notable limitations in memory and executive function, requiring supplementary assessment when deficits are suspected. Variable associations between OCS-AU domains and specific anxiety/depression symptoms underscore the importance of assessing both cognition and mental health for comprehensive post-stroke evaluation and intervention planning.",

          "abstract": "Mixed emotions are strongly linked to aesthetic emotions, which involve both positive and negative emotional experiences. Mixed emotions are aroused as complex emotional reactions to artworks. However, the mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings have received scant attention in empirical science. This study seeks to quantify the intensity of mixed emotional experiences aroused by paintings and explore their relationships with the emotional and categorical characteristics of the paintings as well as with aesthetic emotion. In online surveys, 948 participants rated 356 paintings across seven emotional scales: three for basic positive emotions (amusement, happiness, and pleasure), three for basic negative emotions (sadness, fear, and disgust), and one for aesthetics (beauty). The strong co-occurrences of aesthetic and basic negative emotions, such as “sad beauty,” were demonstrated using data-driven principal component analysis (PCA) and theory-driven quantifications with minimum index (MI). The couplings of basic positive and negative emotions were also quantified using MI and their intensities were associated with the aesthetic emotion, albeit those couplings were relatively weak and not evident in the PCA. Furthermore, both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the paintings revealed that mixed emotional characteristics were distinctive between their negative emotional constituents. The contributions of mixed and negative emotions to aesthetic experiences have been discussed in philosophical aesthetics and art studies. This study provides empirical evidence and sheds new light on these philosophical questions.",

          "abstract": "Although there is a growing body of work assessing the efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for therapy, it is unknown whether using AI leads people to avoid traditional therapy with trained clinicians. Across two experiments (N = 1175), we addressed this gap by asking participants to describe a personal challenge for which they might seek guidance, including from a therapist. Participants then engaged in a conversation with GPT-4 Turbo, prompted to act as a psychotherapist and pragmatic problem-solver in the treatment condition, and as a neutral interviewer in the control condition. Compared to controls, treated participants reported improved mental health related to their stated challenge (Experiment 1a: β = 6.40, 95% CI [4.20, 8.59], t = 5.74, p &lt; .001; Experiment 1b: β = 7.82, 95% CI [5.51, 10.12], t = 6.67, p &lt; .001). When comparing preferences for future support (human therapy, AI therapy, both or neither), a larger share of treated participants chose AI therapy compared to those in the control (Experiment 1a: +18.3%; Experiment 1b: +4.9%). Crucially, the treatment also led to fewer participants preferring human therapy (Experiment 1a: –15%; Experiment 1b: –16.5%). Notably, across both studies and conditions, the most frequently chosen option for future psychological support was the combination of AI and human therapy, selected by 34.8% to 44.6% of respondents depending on experiment and condition.",

However, this economic perspective is largely tacit about the source of these costs. Here we review recent theoretical treatments of effort costs, which take vastly different perspectives—information-theoretic, psychological, and biological—to explain how the subjective experience of cognitive effort arises from controlled information processing, exploring their predictions about the simple observation that people avoid and report as unpleasant tasks with high (versus low) working-memory demands.

Empathic AI—large language models (LLMs) that provide empathic support—will undermine human kindness by stopping people from 1) seeking empathy and 2) giving empathy. Asking humans for empathy is often an imposition and can be expensive (e.g., therapy). Also, the empathy people receive from humans is often unwelcome advice (rather than pure sympathy). Because LLMs are always available to provide consistent and unconditional compassion, “seekers” will rely on LLMs instead of their relationship partners. And when seekers rely on AI, “givers” will happily offload their empathic responsibilities to save themselves from this uncomfortable and emotionally costly work. With seekers and givers both relying on LLMs, the kindness created by exchanging empathy will disappear—unless humanity uses empathic AI only to reinforce human empathy, not replace it. The future of human kindness hinges on how we choose to use LLMs.",

          "abstract": "The mind-brain relationship (MBR) problem is an important philosophical pursuit with far-reaching implications for research and practice in the realm of mental health. Although there is a multitude of proposed resolutions to this quandary, the fundamental questions associated with MBR still persist unexplained. This article is an invitation to the reader to embark on an exploration of this issue by first delving into the nature of our subjective first-person experiences (that contributes to conceptualizing and defining the mind, as explained in the article), and then examining how third-person scientific understandings including understandings relating to the organ brain are arrived at. We explain that the first-person and third-person perspectives represent two distinct yet equally valid approaches to comprehend the world and our experiences within it, involving contrasting epistemological frameworks. We also describe that insights derived from the first-person perspective cultivate self-knowledge and wisdom, while those arising from third-person analysis illuminate the workings of the world. We additionally highlight that the mind constitutes a dynamic system—comprised of constantly changing sensory encounters and mental processes involving the present moment, the past, and the future—to be regarded as a distinct variable. Without denying the neurobiological correlates of mental states, this article serves as a catalyst for a broader, more inclusive approach to mental health research and treatment that can empower service providers, patients, as well as caregivers, and also help scientists to formulate more refined research inquiries pertaining to the mind and the brain.",

          "abstract": "When testing for differential item functioning (DIF) in an item, researchers are often confronted with small sample sizes. Six DIF detection methods, designed to produce more stable inferences for DIF parameters, were examined under small sample conditions using both real and simulated data. These methods included the chi-square test based on the classical Mantel-Haenszel (MH) procedure with raw data, common odds ratio based the classical MH procedure with raw data, common odds ratios based on the MH procedure with log-linear smoothing and an empirical Bayes (EB) approach, Rasch-based improved version of Lord’s Wald test (i.e., Wald-1), and Rasch-based likelihood ratio test (LRT), all of which have been used in previous research studies. The results indicated that the common odds ratios of MH with raw and smoothed data produced almost identical results, while the Rasch-based methods exhibited similarities in terms of the Type Ι error and power rates. The findings from the current study support the use of the Rasch-based methods for detecting DIF. Specifically, the Type Ι error rates for the Rasch-based methods were below the significance level of .05 across all conditions. In contrast, the Type Ι error rates for the MH procedures, both with raw and smoothed data, exceeded .05 when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. However, the Rasch-based methods showed power rates below the .80 threshold when the sample sizes were 50 and 100. Moreover, the Type Ι error rates for the EB approach to MH procedure were lower than those for other MH procedures in most cases. Nevertheless, the power rates for the EB approach to MH tended to be similar to those for other MH procedures as the percentages and magnitudes of DIF increased.",

Sensor data has been linked to moment-tomoment psychological symptoms and mood of individuals and thus could alleviate the burden associated with repeated measurement. Additionally, psychological care could be improved by predicting moments of high psychopathology and providing immediate interventions. Current research assumes that the relationship between sensor data and psychological symptoms is constant over time - or changes with a fixed rate: Models are trained on all past data or on a fixed window, without comparing different window sizes with each other. This is problematic as choosing the wrong training window can negatively impact prediction accuracy, especially if the underlying rate of change is varying. As a potential solution we compare different methodologies for choosing the correct window size ranging from frequent practice\nbased on heuristics to super learning approaches. In a simulation study, we vary the rate of change in the underlying relationship form over time as well as the model type (OLS and RF). We show that even computing a simple average across different windows can reduce the prediction error rather than selecting a single best window for both simulated and real-world data.",

Accordingly, people tell a story of how the data was generated, focusing on goal-relevant information. On another account, people make predictions by learning simple mappings from relevant features of the situation to the outcome. Here, we provide evidence for the causal account. Across three experiments and two paradigms, we find that people misremember what happened, predict incorrectly what will happen, and generalize to novel situations in a way that's consistent with the causal account and inconsistent with a feature-based alternative. People spontaneously construct causal models that compress experience to privilege causally relevant information. These models organize how we remember the past, predict the future, and generalize to novel situations.",

Teleological essentialism, by contrast, proposes that people treat an entity’s purpose as part of its essence and explain its features in terms of what it is for. Across three preregistered experiments, we tested these competing accounts by examining how adults explain why members of different categories have their characteristic features. In Experiment 1, participants explained features of artifacts and biological kinds; in both cases, they overwhelmingly appealed to purposes rather than underlying causes. Experiment 2 showed that people can and do appeal to causal mechanisms such as DNA when explaining within-species differences, yet they revert to purpose-based explanations when explaining between-species differences, which prompts species-level categorization. Experiment 3, using randomly selected biological and non-living natural kinds, found that participants again favored purposes for biological kinds but invoked causes for certain non-living kinds (e.g., lead, oxygen, platinum). Together, these findings suggest that for biological kinds, which are central to theories of psychological essentialism, the explanatory connection between essence and features is primarily understood in teleological, not causal, terms.",

Previous studies report that innumerate humans are unable to recognize that two sets placed in one-to-one correspondence are exactly equal, and argue that this ability emerges when humans acquire symbolic numbers. Here we tested blind children and adults (n = 140), and found that despite having symbols to label and count large quantities, these participants did not use one-to-one correspondence to match large sets. We also found that blind individuals who had a gradient of visual sensitivity were more likely to match sets exactly, but participants who only used haptic exploration did not. Thus, numerate individuals (who can sometimes match sets exactly) are nevertheless unable to express their understanding of exact equality in a commonly used measure of this ability. We conclude that expressing knowledge of exact equality via set-matching requires not only conceptual understanding, but also experience with sophisticated sensori-motor procedures, suggesting a possible re-analysis of studies with innumerate and semi-numerate humans.",

Safety profiles indicate low risk in controlled settings, though longer-term follow-ups with human subjects may be needed. Phenomenological overlaps with near-death experiences (NDEs) are noted but debated.\n\nTherapeutic Advances: Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects. Top-line data from a recent Phase 2b trial showed that 57.5% of participants remitted from treatment-resistant depression (TRD) within eight days.1 Other Phase 2a and 2b trials have provided further, though still preliminary, evidence that 5-MeO-DMT may reduce depressive symptoms more than existing pharmacological treatments, like SSRIs.2–6\n\nLimitations: Most studies are early-phase with small samples (n ≤ 193). Only two double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted in clinical populations, and long-term effects require further investigation.\n\nConclusions: Emerging evidence supports 5-MeO-DMT as a promising, ultra-short-acting psychedelic for TRD and other psychiatric conditions, warranting larger RCTs.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Professors want students to feel included, but there has been little work on how to engender inclusion in collaborative learning. Recent work suggests that justice determines inclusion at the within-person level in student teams: an individual feels included on occasions when justice is high. In this article, we examine whether justice predicts inclusion at higher levels of analysis. Our hypotheses are that justice predicts a sense of inclusion at the between-person level and between-team level: individuals and teams will have higher mean inclusion when their justice levels are high. \nMethods: Four studies were conducted with data from 894 undergraduates across 342 teams, primarily from a biomedical engineering program. Overall peer justice was the independent variable, construed as a combination of distributive, procedural, interpersonal, and informational justice. Inclusion was construed as a combination of belonging and authenticity. Multilevel latent mean models were used for data analysis. Both unadjusted and adjusted models were specified. \nResults: Justice robustly predicted inclusion at the between-team and between-person levels. In two-person teams, there was also a contextual effect, indicating that the first partner’s justice perception affected the second partner’s inclusion level, holding other factors constant.\nConclusions: Instructors are likely to increase inclusion if they teach students about justice and set up team processes to maintain justice. Monitoring justice levels and ameliorating cases of injustice may also be helpful.",

This leaves a critical gap in explaining a person's neurobiological predispositions; specifically, the psychological trait of impulsivity. We propose a theoretical framework, The Dopaminergic Impulsivity Hypothesis of Cybercrime (DHIC), which lays that the dysregulation in the brain's dopamine reward system elevates the propensity for impulsive cybercriminal acts. I argue that individuals with a reduced dopamine receptor function, exhibit inherent reward deficiency and high trait impulsivity. The digital environment combines anonymity and immediacy, therefore appearing to be a \"supernormal stimulus\" that facilitates hacking, trolling, or digital piracy. This paper synthesizes evidence from neurobiology and criminology to build this model and derives testable and specific predictions.

Drawing on theoretical analysis and results from Marcus et al., we evaluated how PBS items function relative to the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). Intraclass correlations (ICC) of overall correlational profiles revealed that the nomological network of the PBS more closely aligns with TriPM Meanness than with Boldness. Rather than clarifying the role of boldness within psychopathy, the PBS repackages maladaptive content typically captured by meanness/antagonism under the boldness label and results in a case of the jingle fallacy.

Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation. Paradoxical homogenization appears to have reached a real-world, high-stakes educational context where writing is expressly personal and AI use is explicitly prohibited.",

          "abstract": "Mid-20th century in the People's Republic of China was a turbulent period: wars, famines, and Cultural Revolution that disrupted lives for a decade and more. Amidst this historical context, two state farms, Lianhu and Qukou, were founded and developed. According to Talhelm and Dong (2024), Lianhu should be considered a rice farm and Qukou should be considered a wheat farm. Since the farmers in the two farms were mostly randomly assigned to work on these farms, this pair of farms is thus a rare natural experiment that allows a test of the causal relationship between farming practices and their cultural orientation: that farming rice leads people to become more collectivistic. But do these two farms really provide a clear causal test for the effect of farming practices? In this comment, we argue that the reported differences between farmers from the two farms show varying sensitivity to the specifics of the researchers' analytical decisions, creating challenges in interpreting the empirical evidence. Furthermore, the historical context of the two farms may have played an important role in shaping their cultural orientation, suggesting that differences observed across two farms could be attributed to factors other than their farming practices.",

First, we show that societal threat perceptions vary in their interconnectedness, with security threats as crime, threats related to asylum seekers, and the war in Ukraine emerging as central nodes. Second, ideology, age, and education are the most relevant variables linked to societal threat perceptions. Third, we replicate the levels and structure of societal threat perceptions over time, highlighting the robustness of our conclusions. Our study’s results indicate that societal threat perceptions form a complex network that replicates over one year. We outline an agenda for the next generation of theorizing on the structure, correlates and stability of societal threat perceptions.",

          "abstract": "Societal threat perception, worry, and issue salience are central to research in psychology and political science, and previous research suggests considerable overlap between the three measures. Nevertheless, they have not yet been empirically distinguished. This study addresses whether the empirical patterns of these three measures are consistent and whether they yield congruent conclusions about political ideology across twelve societal issues. Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate overall similarly with ideology -- but also highlight exceptions -- whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reverses its direction (Type S error). These findings clarify the unique roles of threat, worry, and issue salience in (political) psychology, offering a framework for future research on the threat-politics link.",

This narrative review evaluates the role of predictive processing in understanding psychosis, revisiting the seminal work of Sterzer and colleagues (2018) seven years later. It consolidates recent experimental evidence on the alteration of priors and sensory likelihoods across different stages of psychosis, in an attempt to reconcile top-down and bottom-up accounts. It evaluates predictive processing alterations across the continuum of psychosis, from non-clinical psychotic experiences to high-risk and first-episode psychosis, to schizophrenia, exploring the explanatory potential of predictive processing as a transdiagnostic framework. We discuss the translational potential of predictive processing, including its use as a biomarker and in therapeutic interventions. We emphasize the need for standardised paradigms and longitudinal studies to advance predictive processing theories in clinical practice. By offering a unified theoretical perspective, this review aims to inspire further research into the neuro-computational mechanisms underlying psychosis and enhance our understanding of psychiatric disorders.",

          "authors": "Alma Bitran; Hannah Krall; Kenneth R. Conner; Shireen L. Rizvi",
          "abstract": "Objective: Studies show that only 50% of suicide decedents disclose their suicidal ideation or intent before death. However, most research has only assessed direct disclosure (i.e., explicitly stating suicidal intent), and may not capture indirect forms of disclosure that occur euphemistically or vaguely (e.g., “I’m worried I’ll do something dumb”). Prior evidence suggests that indirect disclosure may serve as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior, indicating its importance as a potential point of intervention. \nMethod: The current study examines direct and indirect disclosure in a sample of 35 adult inpatients hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Participants completed narrative interviews describing the day preceding their attempt. Suicide-related disclosures were characterized by two coders using qualitative content analysis. Coded features of disclosure included content, directness, function, recipient, and consequences.\nResults:  The majority (60%) of participants engaged in some form of disclosure, direct or indirect, preceding their hospitalization. The vast majority (95%) of disclosures occurred within 24 hours of the attempt. About one-third of reported disclosures were considered indirect, and included behaviors such as communicating distress, asking for help, expressing love, and saying goodbye. For 85% of participants, disclosure was at least partially responsible for the receipt of crisis intervention.\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that indirect disclosure is relatively common in the 24 hours surrounding an attempt, indicating its importance as a proximal risk factor for suicidal behavior. Moreover, disclosure appears to be a critical precursor to the receipt of crisis intervention. Further research into indirect suicide-related disclosure is warranted.",

          "abstract": "Exploring the interplay between social dynamics and dietary choices, this study focuses on the influential role of peer networks in shaping the vegetarianism practices of adolescents. Adolescence marks a pivotal stage where individuals actively construct their identities and behaviors, such as dietary practices. Dietary habits however extend beyond personal preferences. Adolescents may find resonance with the eating habits of their peers, incorporating them into their own dietary practices, or deliberately select friends who share similar moral perspectives on meat consumption.\nThis study utilized data from the two-year panel survey SOCIALBOND, encompassing approximately 1,372 students in 22 schools in the North Rhine Westphalia region of Germany. Leveraging sociometric peer networks on the grade level, the potential co-dependence of friendship networks and vegetarianism in adolescence is investigated by disentangling social selection and influence effects. This research not only contributes to the broader discourse on social networks but also provides new insights into how dietary choices, such as vegetarianism, unfold within adolescent peer group dynamics.",

It argues that this neglect stems from the field’s colonial roots and paternalistic framings. To re-center the analysis, this chapter applies a decolonial lens, deconstructing the “mainstream” as a product of an invisible racial hierarchy. It then reinterprets empirical findings: reframing “own-culture maintenance” as a defense of racial normativity and “other-culture adoption” as a selective process often governed by dominant interests. Finally, the chapter distinguishes between colonial cultural appropriation and decolonial cultural exchange, advocating for an antiracist psychology that analyzes intercultural relations as a negotiation of power.",

Metadata can be searched via our website (openesmdata.org) to select and download datasets via packages in R and Python. We demonstrate the potential of openESM through an analysis of within-person correlations of positive and negative affect in 39 datasets, providing evidence for a large negative momentary correlation (-0.49, 95% CI: [-0.54, -0.42]).

          "abstract": "AI chatbots are increasingly anthropomorphic, and anthropomorphism is known to increase trust among its users. This increased trust raises the concern that anthropomorphic chatbots can reinforce stereotypical beliefs among individuals from predisposed groups. Consistent with this hypothesis, we report results from two preregistered experiments on U.S. adults (N = 2,065) showing that politically conservative women believe an unsupported sexist stereotype in a chatbot's response to be more accurate when the chatbot has lifelike features. Neither liberal women nor conservative men show this effect. This effect is mediated by perceived anthropomorphism and trustworthiness. We speculate that conservatives’ known propensity toward sexist beliefs and social identity threat may converge in making conservative women more susceptible to sexist stereotypes from anthropomorphic AI chatbots. Future research should test whether this effect of AI’s anthropomorphism occurs for other identity groups with stereotypes which they are predisposed to believe.",

          "abstract": "People tend to forget information once they offload it to an external reminder such as a written note or computer file.  However, the neural basis for this so-called “Google effect” or “digital amnesia” is unknown. We used fMRI to ask: A) to what extent does brain activity overlap between cognitive offloading and deliberate forgetting, and B) what is the neural fate of offloaded information? Participants viewed face or scene pictures, then received a cue either to A) remember them for a memory test, B) offload them, meaning that the test would come with a reminder, or C) forget them because there would be no test. Offload cues generated brain activity that closely resembled forget cues. Moreover, multivariate pattern analysis showed that the neural trace of to-be-remembered information persisted in the remember condition but faded until it was statistically absent in both the offload and forget conditions, which did not differ from each other. Therefore, when people offload memories into external technology, this has similar neural correlates to deliberate forgetting, leading to a weakened neural representation of to-be-remembered information. We argue that this may be an adaptive process that prioritises the most valuable information for limited-capacity neural systems.",

(2000) distinguished three separable but correlated cognitive control functions in young adults: inhibition, shifting, and updating. This three-factor model was later adapted to a bi-factor model with a common cognitive control factor and separate updating and shifting factors. Over the years, these models have been replicated in various young adult samples. However, other studies have failed to confirm these models. Additionally, the variety of different tasks used in these studies hampers replication of the underlying factor structure of cognitive control. It becomes clear that this field would benefit from a uniform, easily accessible, open-source cognitive control test battery with a validated underlying factor structure and designed for the widest possible audience. For this reason, we developed a freely available cognitive control test battery comprising nine behavioral tasks measuring inhibition, shifting and updating. The underlying factor structure of this test battery was assessed in a group of 165 young adults. CFA was used to test the one-factor model with a common cognitive control function, the three-factor model with separate but correlated cognitive control functions, and the bi-factor model. Our findings supported the three-factor model with correlated cognitive control functions as the best fitting model. This test battery can lead to more uniformity in the field. In addition, we offer a critical look on the field and recommendations for future use and adaptations of the test battery.",

          "abstract": "Sacred moments are characterised by the five qualities of boundlessness, deep\ninterconnectedness, transcendence, ultimacy, and spiritual emotions, experienced at one moment\nin time (Pargament et al., 2014). These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes. Notably, every sacred moment\nquality experienced at concerts was described by the participants as exceedingly enjoyable and\nresulted in improved well-being, though the longevity of these effects had limited evidence. The\nhypothesis that sacred moment experiences could be a mechanism through which live music\nexperiences improve people’s well-being was supported by the findings. Limitations and\nimplications for future research are discussed.",

We examine how different interventions motivate individuals with bipolar disorder to share financial data with others. This approach can inform the development of tools for digital monitoring and intervention designed to promote financial stability in this population.\n\nMethods: 500 individuals with BD completed a pre-registered factorial vignette survey to examine level of comfort with hypothetical scenarios involving third-party financial interventions during symptomatic and euthymic periods. Scenario components were systematically varied between third-party actors, mood states, and intervention types. Participants rated sharing comfort on a 0-10 point scale. Multilevel models tested differences alongside clinical and financial histories, relational trust, and personality.\n\nResults: Participants were most comfortable involving care partners in financial planning. They were more comfortable with temporary spending restrictions during symptomatic states than euthymic periods, underscoring the importance of accurate mood detection for intervention delivery. Prior financial help-seeking behavior and higher relational trust predicted greater comfort. Bankruptcy experience — declared by 11.4% and considered by 31.7% — was associated with increased comfort with spending restrictions. Individuals with psychiatric advance directives (8%) were significantly more comfortable sharing spending behaviors than those without. \n\nConclusions: Comfort with financial interventions was higher among those with prior financial challenges or help-seeking histories. Participants distinguished between symptomatic and euthymic periods, favoring targeted, time-limited restrictions over general monitoring. These findings extend prior work on financial data sharing for illness self-management, highlighting the role of trusted third parties in designing acceptable, effective interventions.",

This study is part of a published experiment investigating the effect of age on cognition and metacognition in episodic memory, semantic memory, executive functioning, and visual perception (Meunier-Duperray et al., 2025). Here, we focused on the effect of cognitive reserve on cognition and metacognition in a subsample of 319 participants (aged from 18 to 79). For both cognition and metacognition, we expected an effect of cognitive reserve only on tasks sensitive to age-related decline: episodic memory, executive functioning, and visual perception for cognition and episodic and semantic tasks for metacognition. For cognition, results showed an effect of cognitive reserve (except for visual perception), but no interaction with age. A similar pattern was found for metacognition but only for semantic memory. These results suggest that cognitive reserve acts in a domain-specific way, irrespectively of age in this cohort.",

The online experiment used a 2 (acknowledging resistance: yes vs. no) x 2 (autonomy-supportive language: yes vs. no) factorial between-subjects design in which participants were exposed to a vlog. Our Bayesian analyses show that emerging adults experience less controlling intent and more autonomy support in the autonomy-supportive language conditions.

In the current study, using mobile headmounted eyetrackers, we examined children’s attention to adults’ and children’s faces as they navigated a crowded room with a naturally changing number of adults and children.  Our results reveal that children exhibit a preference for adult over child faces, with a bias towards female faces, and surprisingly, they attend more to unfamiliar than familiar faces.

A sample of 348 adults completed items assessing school knowledge and newly developed items targeting life knowledge, tailored to specific biographical experiences, covering five areas: humanities, natural sciences, life sciences, arts, and social sciences. Besides the knowledge items, participants also answered questions about the associated biographical experiences. Latent factors for both knowledge item sets correlated perfectly with each other. Nonetheless, correlations between biographical experiences and corresponding life knowledge items were slightly stronger than correlations between biographical items and non-corresponding life or school knowledge items.

We rely on three original panel survey datasets from adults (Britain) and young people (Britain and the United States). We find that perceiving politics as more stressful is associated with greater symptoms of depression independently of general stress and exposure to politics, and longitudinally. We find that this relationship is particularly pronounced for those reporting no diagnosis of a mental health problem, who pay more attention to politics, who are low in emotional cognitive control, and who display more negative emotional biases. Lastly, we find that experiential avoidance and two components of rumination (brooding and reflective pondering), which are known risk factors for depression, mediate the association between stressful politics and depression. In summary, this study identifies the psycho-political factors that may harm or protect mental health from stressful politics.",

However, relying solely on standardized (nomothetic) measures may overlook person-specific (idiographic) problems. Idiographic patient-reported outcome measures (I-PROMs) allow patients to formulate their items, capturing therapy-relevant aspects that standardized measures might miss. To provide guidance on implementing I-PROMs and improving item quality, we conducted a pre-registered narrative systematic review (PROSPERO:CRD42022361535).\nMethods: We searched \"Web of Science,\" \"PsycINFO,\" \"PubMed,\" and \"EMBASE,\" along with reference screenings, to identify studies using I-PROMs in therapy settings, including a psychometric evaluation, published before March 18th 2025.\nResults: Our search yielded 32 empirical articles (51 studies) examining 13 I-PROMs and 6,706 participants. Four I-PROMs assessed therapy-relevant aims (three assessed goals, measuring goal-attainment; one assessed values, measuring value-directed behaviour), four problems (measuring problem-duration, -severity or -change), three both goals and problems (measuring motivational variables), and two assessed helpful aspects of therapy (measuring helpfulness/hindrance). Items were generated via self-administration (four I-PROMs), interviews (six I-PROMs), or both (three I-PROMs). We identified two strategies to enhance item quality: improving item-wording (e.g., instructions, examples, (re)formulation guidelines) and ensuring relevance to therapy (e.g., predefined focus-areas, prioritization-procedures). I-PROMs were applied across therapy settings, talking-therapy schools, nationalities, genders, and disorders, but differences in applicability across these remained unclear.\nDiscussion: Our synthesis helps therapists and researchers evaluate I-PROMs' strengths and limitations, enabling informed choices for selection and implementation, and offers guidance to improve item quality – thereby, facilitating comprehensive measurement and promoting a broader adoption of I-PROMs moving forward.",

The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Novel strings of letters (i.e., pseudowords) lack established meaning(s), yet they may still evoke systematic semantic signals that influence human behavior. Here, we tested whether semantic determinants of word memorability generalize to these novel strings. To do so we leveraged a distributional semantic model able to represent in a vector space, not only attested words but also unmapped strings as bags of character n-grams. A ridge model trained on item-level word memorability norms learned a linear mapping from 300-dimensional embeddings to recognition memorability and achieved strong out-of-fold performance. We then applied this model zero-shot to predict memorability for 2,100 phonotactically legal pseudowords whose baseline predictability was captured by orthographic and frequency features. Adding the zero-shot semantic score significantly improved the baseline model. These findings show that distributional representations derived from subword statistics carry mnemonic information that is not reducible to orthographic familiarity, and that novel strings are interpreted within a shared representational space learned from language experience. More broadly, they support the view that memorability is an intrinsic attribute predictable from representational information, even in the absence of learned meanings.",

This study aimed to contribute to the literature by directly gauging incivility, over time, in a non-U.S. context. A preregistered longitudinal content analysis of 34 televised election debates in the Netherlands in the period 1981-2023 was conducted. This dataset included 9,159 speech acts by 68 unique politicians. The results showed that, although most speech acts were classified as civil, the prevalence of political incivility in Dutch televised election debates did increase in the second half of the investigated time period. In addition, incivility was associated with the speaker’s party’s populism, but not gender and incumbency status, and was more likely when a previous comment had been uncivil. Finally, incivility was more prevalent in debates or debate segments featuring only two, rather than three or more, politicians. Potential causes of the increase of incivility in recent years, such as the rise of populism, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Visual illusions are a popular scientific topic frequently shared on social media. When shared online, illusion images are usually accompanied by explanatory statements, which often contain misinformation. Although such posts combining illusion images and misinformation are widely shared, the psychological mechanism underlying this sharing remains unclear. To address this issue, we hypothesized that illusory experiences would shape user’s intention to share misinformation primarily through two mediators: user interest (triggered situational interest) and truthiness. In an online experiment, participants viewed posts that paired an illusion image with explanatory descriptions containing a brief misinformation statement. They then rated their illusory experience, user interest, truthiness, and intention to share. Mediation analysis revealed that illusory experience had a significant total effect on intention to share whereas its direct effect was not significant. Instead, the illusory experience indirectly influenced the intention to share through the two mediators. The pathway via user interest was the strongest, indicating that an increase in triggered situational interest was the principal driver of sharing intentions. The pathway via truthiness was weaker but still significant, suggesting a secondary role of truthiness in shaping sharing intentions. Regarding supplementary factors, neither valence (positive vs. negative) nor presentation format (original vs. repost) exerted significant effects on the outcomes. Overall, the findings indicate that illusory experience influences information-sharing behavior indirectly through psychological mediators, underscoring the importance of considering individual perceptual experience when accounting for misinformation sharing on social media.",

          "abstract": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a prevalent and clinically urgent condition in adolescence, marked by impairments in cognitive flexibility—a capacity thought to be supported by neural variability. However, most research to date has focused on static brain features, leaving the role of variability largely unexplored. Importantly, variability-based metrics have been emerging as promising biomarkers in psychiatry, offering superior test–retest and intersession reliability compared with traditional static metrics. Leveraging resting-state fMRI data from 160 psychiatric patients with NSSI and 50 psychiatric controls, we examined neural variability at two hierarchical levels—connectivity and network topology—and evaluated their clinical relevance using cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Patients with NSSI consistently exhibited heightened variability at both the local and global level, and these measures demonstrated significant discriminative power in classifying NSSI from controls (AUC = 0.75). The functional implications, however, diverged between two levels. Greater connectivity-level variability was associated with better emotional and attentional functioning and predicted larger reductions in NSSI behaviors over three months, suggesting an adaptive or compensatory role. In contrast, greater topology-level variability was linked to higher impulsivity, and predicted poorer behavioral improvement, reflecting maladaptive instability of large-scale organization. These findings reveal that elevated neural variability in NSSI encompasses both adaptive and dysregulated dynamics: increases in local connectivity variability may promote flexible adaptation, whereas excessive large-scale reconfiguration indicates loss of global control. Together, our findings indicate that disruption of the balance between local flexibility and global stability may constitute a neural mechanism underlying self-regulatory dysfunction in NSSI and highlight variability-based metrics as potential biomarkers and intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "One-pedal driving (OPD) is increasingly adopted in electric vehicles (EVs) due to its benefits in energy efficiency and driving comfort. However, this driving mode also raises safety concerns regarding potential pedal misapplication (PM) and sudden unintended acceleration. This study evaluated PM risk in OPD and explored its possible causes by a simulated driving experiment. Behavioral responses and subjective evaluations from 42 participants were systematically analyzed across one-pedal, two-pedal and joystick modes. Results indicate that compared to two-pedal mode, participants in OPD exhibited faster reaction times, reported higher perceived ease of driving and lower cognitive load. However, PM incidence was higher in OPD than both two-pedal and joystick modes. Its potential cognitive explanations were proposed from both innate and acquired perspectives. This suggests that OPD may pose a higher PM risk, thereby increasing the likelihood of collision, particularly in low-speed scenarios with short time-to-collision. The findings can deepen the understanding the cognitive mechanisms of PM in OPD and provide practical guidance for the safety design of OPD systems in EVs.",

          "abstract": "As people engage in tasks over extended periods, their psychological states systematically change due to factors, such as practice, learning, and/or boredom. However, the dominant frameworks for modelling cognitive processes – such as evidence accumulation models – only consider a single estimate of a process across the duration of an experiment, with the justification often being that these changes are not of interest, are likely minimal, and/or can be eliminated by experimental procedures such as practice blocks. Our study proposes, develops, and assesses the ParAcT-DDM framework: the parameters across time diffusion decision model – which unifies previous modelling efforts from practice and decision-making research. Specifically, our framework models time-varying changes to diffusion decision model parameters by assuming that rather than being constant across time, their estimates follow theoretically informed trial-varying or block-varying functions across time. Focusing on two diffusion model parameters – drift-rate (task efficiency) and threshold (caution) – and a large number of candidate time-varying functions, our simulation results suggest that most variants of the ParAcT-DDM framework display robust inference properties, both in terms of the key parameters being well identified, and the different variants being distinguishable from one another. Our empirical results show that ParAcT-DDM variants vastly outperform the standard diffusion model in three existing data sets, including one where participants completed a practice block before data began recording, suggesting that time-varying cognitive processes often occur in typical cognitive experiments, even when the experimental design explicitly tries to remove practice effects. Finally, we find that the existence of time-varying processes cause systematic biases in the parameter estimates of the standard diffusion model, suggesting that our ParAcT-DDM framework can be crucial to ensuring the robustness of inferences against time-varying changes, regardless of whether these changes are of direct interest.",

However, when applied to increasingly complex and large linguistic datasets, traditional methods often encounter challenges and shortcomings related to scalability, quantification, and reproducibility issues. Moreover, languages also change through contact and in response to the social and physical environment, but these changes are mostly opaque to classical historical linguistics and/or hinder attempts to construct robust language phylogenies. This paper reviews past efforts to optimize the methods in historical linguistics by incorporating phylogenetic techniques originally developed by evolutionary biology. These include Bayesian methods, maximum likelihood methods, classic distance methods, and stochastic models. The paper also discusses the potentiality of new phylogenetic algorithms and approaches in evolutionary biology for optimizing even more phylogenetic methods in linguistics.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian Networks provide a principled framework for developing tailored treatment recommendations by estimating conditional probabilities for diagnosis and treatment response from individual patient profiles. As new information becomes available, these probabilities update dynamically, enabling personalized clinical decision-making. However, applying Bayesian Networks to psychological data is challenging because parameter learning in Bayesian Networks can be sensitive to high-dimensional, correlated behavioral indicators across domains. We therefore introduce a Bayesian network–based modeling framework that incorporates Convex Generalized Structured Component Analysis (Convex GSCA) to derive interpretable, low-dimensional summary indexes from multivariate psychological and behavioral data. These summary indexes serve as nodes in a Bayesian network, yielding a parsimonious, theory-consistent model that reproduces clinicians’ treatment recommendations. We illustrate the approach with an empirical application to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), demonstrating how interpretable summary indexes enhance the construction of a Bayesian network for probabilistic, patient-level treatment guidance. We provide commented code and example data to support step-by-step adoption in applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Reading for meaning is foundational for academic success, however, a high percentage of autistic students present with significant challenges in comprehending written texts. While many models of reading comprehension have been proposed, these are commonly based on neurotypical students, with more limited research into their applicability to autistic students. We investigated whether one model of reading, the Direct and Indirect Effects Model of Reading (DIER), could be applied to autistic students. Namely, we sought to determine whether the component skills of the DIER were associated with reading comprehension in this population and whether reading comprehension could be predicted based on significantly associated components. \nMethods: Assessments across the following DIER components were completed with 69 autistic students in the primary school years in Australia: domain general cognition, word reading, listening comprehension (including foundational oral language skills and higher order cognition), text reading fluency, and reading comprehension. \nResults: Reading comprehension was correlated with many of the components of the DIER. Of these, non-verbal IQ, text reading fluency, and listening comprehension (including story comprehension, grammar, and perspective taking) accounted for 60.1% of the variance in reading comprehension, with grammar a significant individual predictor. \nConclusion: These results suggest that the DIER may be applicable to autistic primary school students, however the relative contributions of the components may differ to neurotypical populations. Our findings provide insights into how this model may function across a wider profile of learners, enhancing our understanding of key areas",

The most common examples are onomatopoeias such as “cock-a-doodle-doo” or “woof-woof,” but recent research shows that speakers of various languages perceive a relationship between some meaning in various words of their language. This is the case for English words such as crunchy, zigzag or wiggle, whose sonority is perceived as mapping onto their meaning (Winter et al., 2023). Recently, psycholinguistic research has investigated whether iconicity influence language processing. Sidhu, Vigliocco and Pexman (2020) ran a lexical decision task with words varying in their iconicity level. Their results show that the more iconic a word is, the quicker participants react to it in a lexical decision task, thus suggesting that iconicity may have a facilitatory effect in word recognition. We plan to replicate their study with a sample of Brazilian Portuguese speakers and Brazilian Portuguese words to test their main claim that reaction times in a classic lexical decision task could be influenced by the stimuli’s level of iconicity in a neurotypical population of adults.",

This paper presents an empirical analysis of five CS pilots addressing urban sustainability challenges, conducted within or in close collaboration with six GLAMs. In Barcelona, a university partnered with a public library to assess heat exposure in public spaces. In Delft, children’s perceptions of urban spaces were collected and discussed through a collaboration between a university and a public library. In Tallinn, a community museum supported the testing of a digital visualization tool to enhance citizens’ feedback in urban planning. In Vienna, an urban research institute and an academic library co-designed two pilots addressing urban heat and the transformation of public spaces. Findings draw on GLAMs’ distinct contributions, the structural organization of the pilots, and the perceptions of librarians and researchers, collected through surveys, interviews, and collective writing processes. A strong community-oriented focus and the engagement of underrepresented citizen groups were common features across all pilots, though organizational structures and actor typologies varied by city. GLAMs consistently acted as powerful connectors between researchers, citizens, and local stakeholders. Embedding CS initiatives within social and community-oriented venues helps mitigate power imbalances and foster horizontal, mutual learning between academics and GLAM staff. GLAM can also provide the crucial social infrastructure to significantly embed sustainability challenges-related CS initiatives in many knowledge ecosystems, over different countries and cities.",

          "abstract": "Widowhood is a common yet critical life event, associated with significant risks to mental health.  This study aims to understand the individual and contextual factors that may moderate the short-term decline in mental health and recovery in the medium-term associated with widowhood.  Data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe are applied to between-within random-effects linear regressions to estimate average within-individual change in mental health following spousal death across fifteen countries. Rather than a summary score of depressive symptoms, this study focuses on affective suffering and changes in motivation.  This allows us to differentiate between depressive symptoms that manifest in the course of bereavement (affective suffering) and symptoms that indicate a more severe depressive episode (changes in motivation). In addition, we consider the role of institutional, social and compositional differences between countries to account for cross-national variation.  Widowhood is associated with higher affective suffering in the short-term and recovery in the medium-term across all countries. However, there is more cross-national variation in the appearance of changes in motivation following spousal loss. Findings suggest that compositional differences, specifically the mean age of widowhood and the gender composition of the widowed population, account for cross-national heterogeneities in the consequences of widowhood for affective suffering and motivation.",

          "abstract": "Normative fertility reflects broader societal trends but curiously changed little despite shifts in families. Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

          "abstract": "State Public Service Commissions face complex decisions when utilities incur extraordinary costs\nfrom disasters, fuel price spikes, or emergency infrastructure repairs.

Drawing on a literature review of utility\nregulation theory, financial mechanisms, and empirical evidence, the study synthesizes theoretical\nfoundations including natural monopoly theory and the regulatory compact with practical regulatory\nconsiderations. A detailed hypothetical case study included as appendix demonstrates how a $25\nmillion extraordinary cost would be recovered under each method, providing complete mathematical\ncalculations, customer bill impacts across residential, commercial, and industrial classes, and total\ncost comparisons over recovery periods ranging from three months to twenty years. The analysis\nreveals fundamental trade-offs: immediate recovery minimizes total costs but creates severe bill\nshock, while securitization offers the lowest monthly impact but highest total cost due to extended\ninterest payments. The paper emphasizes that transparent modeling, reproducible calculations, and\nmeaningful public engagement are essential for regulatory legitimacy. It concludes with best practice\nrecommendations for regulators, utilities, and consumer advocates, arguing that method selection\nmust be context-dependent, balancing cost magnitude, customer economic conditions, utility\nfinancial health, and regulatory precedent to achieve equitable and sustainable outcomes.",

Family socioeconomic statuses\nbecome more meaningful in distinguishing participation rates among the youngest generations.\nThese findings offer valuable new evidence of the rise and extent of private club and travel\nsports participation over recent decades and highlight how generational contexts, family\nsocioeconomic statuses, and family and community sport cultures have shaped children’s youth\nsports experiences, especially as they relate to private club and travel sports, over the years.",

          "abstract": "Studies have demonstrated that certain sanctioning institutions can play an essential role in maintaining human cooperation in public goods experiments. However, in reality, the outcome of sanctions can be subject to stochasticity. In a public goods experiment with peer punishment, we investigated the comparative advantage of certain versus uncertain sanctioning institutions by allowing participants to repeatedly choose between the two. In one institution, sanctions issued by individuals were multiplied by three, while in another, the consequences of sanctions were multiplied by a random factor between 0 and 6. Initially, the uncertain institution was the majority choice, but it eventually tended to become the minority choice. We found less punishment, due to less antisocial punishment, in a certain institution, leading to higher contributions and payoffs. Hence, when participants learned about the difference in payoffs, they chose a certain sanctioning institution more often. Especially, prosocial and risk-averse individuals with strong contribution norms were more likely to choose certainty. Additionally, we investigated the motives that may influence pro- and antisocial punishment, as they influence an institution's success. We find that hypersensitivity to punishment, non-prosocial punishment motives, weak contribution norms, and normative hubris reduce the effectiveness of sanctions in establishing cooperation.",

          "abstract": "Switzerland activated temporary collective protection (Status S) in March 2022 to respond to the large-scale displacement caused by the war in Ukraine. This exceptional measure, aligned with the European Union’s Temporary Protection Directive, provided immediate access to residence, employment, education and social support, while deliberately remaining temporary in nature. However, the ongoing and protracted nature of the conflict requires consideration of future steps beyond temporary protection. This article develops a conceptual two-stage model adapted to Swiss context. Phase 1 (2025-2027) focuses on facilitating gradual transitions into existing residence categories, which will strength integration and reduce the risks of institutionalised temporariness. Phase 2 (from 2027 onwards) underscores voluntary, safe and dignified return, where possible, in addition to residual protection for those who cannot be repatriated. The proposed framework aims to reconcile humanitarian obligations, integration policies and long-term sustainability.",

          "authors": "Yoav Roll",
          "abstract": "Over the past three decades, right-wing populism has steadily risen to prominence across the world. Yet a crucial socio-economic context for its development - the household and its underlying gender dynamics - remains under-explored in research on right-wing populism. This study investigates how the income, level of education, and class within cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, shape their support for right-wing populism through three diverse predictors, ranging from behavioural to attitudinal: voting for right-wing populist [RWP] parties, aim to vote for RWP parties, and sympathy towards RWP parties. Four models are tested to explain these relationships: male dominance, sharing, individual, and economic dominance models. Based on previous studies focusing on non-RWP parties, I expected the individual model for men and the sharing model for women to provide the best fit. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences, this paper utilises diagonal reference models [DRM], for men and women separately, to trace the relative influence of the respondent and their partner on their RWP support. As far as I know, DRM has never been used to predict support for RWP parties. As expected, gender differences are evident. However, the data show, contrary to expectation, that the sharing model provides the best fit for men, while the individual model provides the best fit for women when it comes to income and education. Regarding class, as expected, the sharing model provides the best fit for women. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the diverse characteristics of the economic standing predictors and the different facets of RWP support tested. As women increasingly join the workforce and occupy diverse roles, the ways in which men and women perceive their economic circumstances - particularly within households - diverge significantly. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for household context and gender dynamics in understanding the rise of right-wing populism in developed democracies such as the Netherlands.",

This study critically examines the quality of policy briefs from European SBS advisory bodies written during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers independently scored 117 policy briefs from 4 countries using the newly-developed 25-item Policy Brief Checklist. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the results. We found considerable heterogeneity in the quality of policy briefs. Key items like the summary, aim, policy problem addressed, and actionability of the recommendations were adequate in 34% to 59% of policy briefs. Policy briefs containing urgent advice scored better than less urgent briefs on some items (e.g. clear aim) but worse on others (e.g. explication of the policy problem). Hence, although challenging in the high-pressure context of a pandemic, the impact of SBS policy advice during a major infectious disease outbreak could potentially be enhanced if advisory bodies improve the quality of their policy briefs. We recommend that SBS advisory body develop crisis-specific policy brief templates that meet the needs of the advisory body and policymakers, and invest in training so that scientific insights are presented more effectively.",

While previous research has explored various associations between specific aspects of religiosity, such as frequency of prayer or religious service attendance, with flourishing and health, this study makes a distinct contribution by analyzing the effects of an innovative concept of religiosity by Stefan Huber –centrality of religiosity– on a multidimensional human flourishing scale. The analysis is based on survey-weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models, allowing for population-representative estimates across the six countries studied (analytic N =84,399). The findings show that although all forms of religiosity are associated with higher flourishing outcomes, the highly religious benefit the most. Among the dimensions of human flourishing, centrality of religiosity is especially strongly associated with meaning and purpose across all countries. Effect sizes differ substantially between the analyzed countries, suggesting that the religious context and culture shape how religiosity influences flourishing and health. In light of the rapidly progressing secularization in Europe, the results invite a reconsideration of the value placed on of peripheral and central religiosity.",

          "abstract": "In this natural experiment, we study the effects of added years of school and different exposures to Home Economics (HE) on adult men's self-reported time spent on housework. Using data from the Swedish Level-of-Living Survey (LNU), we run difference-in-differences analyses and a cohort analysis. The first test the effect of the Swedish nine-year elementary school reform and its preceding assessment period, with more added years of HE that included teaching of practical housework. The second compares birth cohorts before and after an important curricular change, for the first time adding HE for boys, in Swedish schools 1955/56. The data confirm previous findings about Swedish men’s housework: a general increase over time, mainly driven by more time spent on foodwork (e.g., food shopping, cooking, after-meal clean-up). We also confirm that men’s housework participation is positively associated with their educational level. However, the overarching picture of the study is a null result, except for an effect on time spent on laundry. Thus, while it is clear from previous findings that men in Sweden have increased their time spent on routine housework, especially foodwork, it is difficult to pinpoint any particular policy effect from the statistical noise of reforms and cultural transformation. Our study design could, in theory, identify the causal effect of school reform, focusing both on educational duration and curricular content, yet the findings suggest no such specific effect, indicating instead that other social factors have driven this development.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines how the far right in Germany and Austria responded to Russia’s full-\nscale invasion of Ukraine of February 2022 by societalizing the ensuing energy crisis. Rather\nthan addressing the war as a breach to European values, and a fundamental realignment of\nrelations between Eastern and Western Europe, far-right actors depicted rising energy prices\nand inflation as breaches to national values, in particular industrial power in Germany and\nneutrality in Austria. Through a process of societalization – the dramatization of institutional\nproblems into moral crises threatening society at large –, economic strain was transformed into\na collective moral grievance, allowing far right actors to redirect public anxiety away from\nUkraine and toward domestic narratives of decline. The chapter demonstrates how the relevant\nparties mobilized existing cultural codes of economic power, national independence, and anti-\nEU sentiment to delegitimize support for Ukraine. It argues that civil sphere theory must more\ndirectly engage with the cultural framing of economic crises, especially in times of polycrisis,\nwhere certain actors infuse material disruptions with symbolic meaning to undermine\ndemocratic cohesion.",

          "abstract": "Objective. This study aims to propose the Internationality Index (IdI) and test its applicability in a case study, revealing critical gaps in institutional data availability of a Research Center (RC), the \"Dr. Eduardo J. Usunoff\" Plain River Hydrology Institute (IHLLA) in Argentina, from 2010 to 2018. It introduces and applies the composite Internationality Index (IdI) to assess institutional performance across education, publication, and financing dimensions.\nDesign/Methodology/Approach. The research employed a documentary analysis using IHLLA’s annual institutional reports (2010–2018) and publicly available data. The IdI was constructed from three subindices: International Education Index (IEI), International Publication Index (PI), and International Financing Index (IFI). Due to limitations in explicit reporting, the final analysis relied on adjusted budget figures for financing, raw publication counts, and formal foreign degree attainment among research personnel for education.\nResults/Discussion. Data analysis revealed moderate international engagement in terms of research personnel training, with 41% of scholars and researchers holding a foreign degree. However, inconsistent reporting, a lack of systematic documentation on short-term mobility, and the absence of journal quartile classification in institutional reports constrained a complete longitudinal IdI calculation. The findings underscore the gap between the need for robust evaluation tools and the availability of standardized institutional data.\nConclusions. The IdI is a viable tool for longitudinal analysis and strategic decision-making, but its effectiveness is severely limited by inconsistent institutional reporting of international variables. RCs must adopt systematic metrics to accurately capture internationality, particularly in international short-term training, international financing and publication quality, to enable effective monitoring and strategic improvement.\nOriginality/Value. This study pioneers the application of the IdI as a synoptic measure to assess internationality specifically within Research Centers, distinguishing it from traditional HEI-focused models. It provides empirical evidence on an Ibero-American RC, contributing to the development of robust evaluation frameworks for science policy.",

The rapid adoption of digital innovations by consumers, coupled with their heightened expectations from every business interaction, has rendered digital transformation a necessity. Businesses that fail to successfully implement this transformation will face the threat of extinction sooner than predicted. This disruptive effect has already begun to show its impact on various sectors. In the digital transformation process, businesses’ main goal should be to ensure that all new applications provide added value to their existing or future customers. This study examines changes in customer expectations and behavior in the digital age from a marketing perspective. It states that businesses need to update their marketing mixes to appeal to consumers’ emotions and support their self-expression, while also considering the effort and change required from them and ensuring accessibility anytime, anywhere. Additionally, the concepts of personalization, access instead of ownership (sharing economy), and omnichannel, which have emerged as new trends to meet the expectations of digital customers, are addressed.",

Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

          "abstract": "Semiconductors have become central to geopolitical rivalry and national strategy. This article examines Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) as a paradigmatic case of institutional transformation in strategic industries. More than a technological leader, TSMC has emerged as an institutional mediator—navigating overlapping policy regimes, supply chain fragmentation, and diverging state agendas. Drawing on TSMC’s global expansion, especially its fabs in Arizona and Kumamoto, I show how firms are increasingly expected to perform quasi-sovereign functions: ensuring supply continuity, managing regulatory tensions, and absorbing geopolitical risk. I argue that prevailing discourses of “decoupling” and “reshoring” misdiagnose the problem, treating physical relocation as a proxy for strategic autonomy. Instead, I theorize institutional absorptive capacity as the foundation of long-term sovereignty: the ability of firms and states to learn, adapt, and coordinate across volatile environments. This requires shifting policy focus from industrial control to institutional design—investing in learning systems, governance capacity, and trust-based cooperation. TSMC’s trajectory thus signals a broader reconfiguration of state–firm boundaries and the emergence of a multipolar, narrative-driven political economy. The article concludes by outlining future research on cross-border institutional agency, strategic narrative construction, and techno-industrial governance beyond the U.S.–China binary.",

The empirical literature has overlooked the need for a definition of causality. The definition used when applying IVs is the potential outcomes framework. This framework requires clear definitions of the active and control treatments because the causal effect is defined as the difference in outcome between the groups undergoing these two treatments. Previous research using twin birth IVs has failed to provide clear and accurate definitions of the treatments, making it impossible to accurately interpret the estimated effects or assess the validity of the study design and IVs.",

          "authors": "Mohit Singhal",
          "abstract": "Background:\nThe U.S. opioid epidemic imposes a persistent and disproportionate economic burden on payers and communities, driven by complex interactions among clinical utilization, pharmacy benefit management (PBM) policies, and social determinants of health (SDOH). Despite extensive research on overdose and prescribing risk, few studies have quantified the cost burden of opioid use or examined how policy and community-level factors jointly shape it.\n\nObjective:\nThis study develops an interpretable, machine-learning framework integrating PBM cost levers and SDOH indicators to predict and explain county-level variation in opioid-related spending from 2013–2023. The goal is to identify structural drivers of cost, simulate potential savings under policy and social interventions, and support data-driven resource allocation.\n\nMethods:\nUsing CMS Medicare Part D data linked with County Health Rankings and U.S. Census indicators, a Random Forest regression model was trained on ten years of county-level data (≈3,000 counties, 2013–2023). Key predictors included unemployment, income ratio, obesity, smoking, provider density, and PBM variables such as cost per claim and opioid prescribing rate. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis and policy simulations testing both PBM and SDOH interventions.\n\nResults:\nThe model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97), explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. SHAP analysis revealed unemployment, mental-health-provider density, and income inequality as dominant drivers, while provider access and preventive-care variables exerted cost-mitigating effects. Simulated PBM levers (e.g., formulary tightening, utilization management) reduced predicted costs by 4–6%, while integrated SDOH improvements (e.g., +20% behavioral-health access, +10% primary care) achieved up to 17% savings—equivalent to approximately $23 billion nationally. The combined model demonstrated both statistical robustness and policy relevance.\n\nConclusion:\nThis study reframes the opioid crisis through an economic and structural lens, demonstrating that predictive modeling can translate public-health and PBM data into actionable fiscal insights. The proposed PBM–SDOH integration provides a scalable, transparent framework for targeting interventions in high-burden counties, optimizing healthcare spending, and informing evidence-based opioid policy.\n\nKeywords:\nOpioid costs, pharmacy benefit management, social determinants of health, Medicare Part D, machine learning, SHAP, predictive modeling, public health economics, health policy",

The method used is a descriptive quantitative approach with financial ratio analysis techniques, including effectiveness ratio, growth ratio, and independence ratio. The data used comes from the APBG realization report collected directly from the village office. The results of the study show that the effectiveness of village fund management is relatively high, with an average effectiveness reaching 98%. The income growth ratio shows a positive trend with an average of above 90% per year. However, the village financial independence ratio is very low, which is 0.30%, indicating that the village is still very dependent on central government transfer funds. This finding shows that although the village is able to manage the budget effectively, it has not succeeded in increasing its fiscal independence.\n\nKeywords\nFinancial Performance ; Effectiveness Ratio ; Growth Ratio ; Independence Ratio ; Village ; Fund Allocation",

          "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the influence of economic growth, unemployment rate, and income inequality on crime rates across 23 regencies/cities in Aceh Province during the 2020–2022 period. Using a quantitative approach with panel data and the Fixed Effect Model (FEM) regression method, the results show that economic growth (measured by GRDP per capita) has a positive and significant effect on crime rates, indicating that uneven growth can increase social tension. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has a negative and significant effect on crime, possibly due to the strong role of social networks, government assistance, and the dominance of the informal sector in Aceh. Income inequality (measured by the Gini Ratio) was found to have no significant effect on crime levels. These findings provide critical insights for designing more inclusive, equitable, and context-specific development policies. By strengthening social capital, expanding access to decent employment, and ensuring equitable development outcomes, the results of this study offer a strategic foundation for reducing crime rates while improving the quality of life in Aceh through enhanced public safety, social stability, and sustainable well-being.\n\nKeywords\nCrime ; Economic Growth ; Unemployment ; Income Inequality ; Social Paradox",

          "abstract": "This article advances dual-process theory (DPT) by developing a pragmatist framework for the study of reflective cognition. While dual-process models were introduced to sociology via Bourdieusian practice theory, Bourdieusian DPT has proven inadequate for theorizing reflective cognition and action, with sociologists looking to pragmatism as an alternative. To support these efforts, I provide a synthetic, elemental account of the pragmatist theory of reflection, delineating reflective cognition’s defining characteristics, core components, its relationship with non-reflective cognition, and its interindividual variation. I then outline the merits of the pragmatist theory of reflection for dual-process research, arguing that it addresses major limitations of Bourdieusian DPT, has broad interdisciplinary support, provides advantages in terms of conceptualization, operationalization, and measurement, and offers sociology a novel research agenda. Overall, I argue that pragmatism provides a robust framework to enhance the study of reflective cognition and is a valuable, if not superior, theoretical alternative for dual-process research. I conclude by discussing the implications of this framework for research on discrimination, inequality, and culture.",

          "abstract": "In diverse societies, how do individuals form views about different groups? We argue that individuals learn norms of interaction in bundles: strong signals about norms toward one marginalized group can diffuse to norms about another. Empirically, we study the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, a moment that spurred reckoning with violence against Black Americans. Using a regression discontinuity in time with rich individual-level data, we find the event made Americans more favorable toward other underprivileged groups—including those not defined by race or ethnicity (LGBTQ individuals). Consistent with a norm-change interpretation, effect strength depends more on the ideological orientation of respondents’ local areas than on their personal ideology. These results show how salient events shape intergroup norms and highlight the importance of local preference distributions in processes of normative change.",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

This \nreproduction, which is based on unequal relations in the wider world economy, explains the \nphenomenon of ‘brain drain.’ In accordance with that, the possibility of political \ninterventions within the individual states of the (semi)periphery, which would significantly \ndisrupt the current systemic processes of reproduction, is viewed as pessimistically \ninadequate.",

The analysis demonstrates how the interplay \nbetween global capital and national governments frequently results in the \nmarginalisation of local communities, thereby exacerbating social tensions and \nenvironmental degradation. The work elucidates the contrasting definitions of \nextractivism and neo-extractivism, underscoring the persistent exploitation and \ncentralisation of wealth. By focusing on the socio-political dynamics and ownership \nstructures in these regions, the paper emphasises the necessity for sustainable \nand equitable resource management practices.

          "authors": "Aleksandar Korolija",
          "abstract": "This paper critically examines the American boycott of British goods between 1764 and 1770 through the lens of Herbert Marcuse’s theory of false needs and consumer society, in dialogue with Timothy Breen’s notion of the marketplace of revolution. While Breen emphasizes the transformative role of consumer resistance in forging colonial political identity, this article questions the depth and sincerity of anti-consumerist sentiment during the boycott. It argues that the boycott was pri-marily a tactical reaction to British coercion, rather than a strategic rejection of consumerism. Drawing on secondary sources and historiography, the analysis reveals sharp class contradictions in the organization, enforcement, and symbolic meaning of boycotts across regions and social groups. The article contends that neither Breen nor Marcuse adequately integrate class struggle into their interpretations. By incorporating class analysis, it highlights the different motives of merchants, artisans, planters, and lower classes, showing that the boycott often reproduced existing inequalities. The study concludes that the ephemeral nature of anti-consumerist discourse and the rapid return to consumption following British concessions suggest that marketplace resistance was limited in ideological and political depth and largely failed to really challenge the underlying capitalist logic",

          "abstract": "Background: Creativity is the process of generating contextually useful new outcomes by uniquely reconfiguring existing knowledge and information. While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. \nMethods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure.\nResults: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity.\nConclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.",

          "abstract": "The replication of microscopic surface features on stone tool edges using molds and casts is the only way to carry out use-wear analyses on certain lithic artifacts which cannot fit under a microscope or leave a museum. They are also very important for preserving wear stages in sequential experiments aiming to understand wear formation processes. However, the reliability of these methods for replicating micro-topographic features remains insufficiently explored. This study assesses the fidelity of three impression materials—Genie, President, and Affinis—on chert, dacite, obsidian, and quartzite tools, focusing on surface roughness replication for high-resolution analytical techniques such as confocal microscopy.\nUsing Sensofar S-Neox microscopy, ceramic bead georeferencing, and Number of ISO 25178-based roughness parameters, we evaluated the precision and consistency of each material. Statistical analyses demonstrate that Genie replicated surface features with greater fidelity on dacite and obsidian, while President performed similarly on flint and quartzite. Among the evaluated parameters, Str (Texture aspect ratio), Smr1 (Peak material portion), and Sal (Autocorrelation length) varied the least and thus offered the highest replication quality.\nThis research highlights the importance of selecting replication materials suited to the specific properties of the analyzed artifacts and the requirements of the applied analytical techniques. By providing a systematic framework for evaluating replication fidelity, this study contributes to improving methodological precision in use-wear studies and facilitates the application of advanced imaging technologies to archaeological research.",

          "abstract": "In this contribution, I focus on the shifting assemblages of evidencing that become visible during the public court cases and in the verdicts of Dutch women returnees from Syria. Evidencing emerged as a particularly salient problem, since in the large majority of cases there was not even a suspicion that these women had participated in violent acts. What soon appeared was what I call, following one of the lawyers, the doctrine of the common household. Engaging in housework and childcare for men who were IS-fighters became a ground for conviction for participation in a terrorist organization and/or for involvement in preparatory acts enabling terrorism. These men were, as it were, tried in absentia.\n\nAs the doctrine of the common household was a new legal invention, judges were often inconsistent in how they considered such “evidence.” What, then, was running a common household evidence of, and what counted as evidence of running a common household? How did this focus of attention emerge and develop, and what was left outside the frame? How did the courts deal with IS doctrine on housework and childcare, and with women’s own accounts as evidence? How did these positions intersect with particular turns in public opinion?\n\nThese various issues also raise questions of temporality, not only in terms of how sequencing is taken to imply causality, but also in terms of how a particular historical moment matters, with judges developing, and in appeal cases often rejecting, such new interpretations.",

          "abstract": "Studying teacher career paths offers valuable insights into how teachers´ career decisons impact\neducational inequality. However knowledge on teachers´ career paths across long time horizons is scarce.\nIn this study, I investigate how teachers’ teachers transition between schools in which students have\ndifferent levels of SES, or opt out of teaching, and how these transitions shape teachers career paths\nacross 35 years. Using Danish register data 13283 teachers who graduated between 1980 and 1985, I\nemploy sequence analysis and cluster analysis to map out teacher career paths over 35 years. The main\nfinding of the paper concerns the identification of four distinct types of career paths: 1) Teachers working\nalmost exclusively outside of public elementary schools, 2) Teachers primarily working in schools serving\nless affluent students, 3) Teachers primarily working in schools serving affluent students and 4) Teachers\nworking in schools serving middle-class students. Further, the analysis reveals that teacher career paths\nare highly stable. Once teachers begin their careers in a particular type of school, they tend to remain\nin that type throughout their careers. This contradicts the theoretical expectation that teachers would\nswitch schools or types of schools as they gain experience. Lastly, teacher characteristics such as high\nschool GPA, gender, and age at graduation show weak associations with the type of career path teachers\nfollow. The paper contributes to the literature on teacher sorting by providing a long-term view of teacher\ncareers, emphasizing early career decisions’ lasting effects.

Public education expenditure per school-age individual in Sub-Saharan Africa is about 3% of the level observed in Europe and North America in 2025 in PPP terms (versus 6% in 1980 and 4% in 1950). We also find a large impact of human capital expenditure on productivity growth over the 1800–2025 period, especially for public education and for poor countries. Estimated returns using our macro-historical database are around 10% or more, in line with micro studies. Finally, we present simulations based on alternative human capital expenditure trajectories over the 2025–2100 period. In particular, we analyze the conditions under which convergence in human capital expenditure could lead to global productivity convergence by 2100 (around 100€ per hour in all regions in our benchmark scenario).

          "abstract": "Research on partisan expressive responding suggests that the beliefs people express in surveys are more partisan than their underlying perceptions. This article examines expressive responding's scope and importance through a meta-reanalysis of 44 studies from 25 articles. On average, treatments designed to reduce expressive responding shrink measured partisan bias by about 25 percent. Across the 242 survey questions in the data, treatments increase the correlation between the average Democrat and Republican from 0.81 to 0.86. Contrary to expectations derived from the two leading theories of expressive responding, misreporting (''cheerleading'') and congenial inference, there is no evidence that expressive responding increases in partisan identity strength or educational attainment. As research on expressive responding enters its third decade, greater emphasis on design-based tests of mechanisms may help build a firmer understanding of expressive responding’s nature and substantive importance---namely, whether the forces that produce expressive responding in surveys also shape real-world political judgments.",

          "abstract": "This research examines the practice of marital surname change as a site where identity, autonomy, and tradition intersect. While often dismissed as a personal choice, the act carries cultural and psycho-political weight. This study specifically draws attention to Indian society and its practices regarding surname change. Existing studies have largely talk about the emotional and social aspects of surname change practices and fail to focus on the real-life consequences that people face when met with such a choice. To address this gap, a mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey data from 301 respondents with two qualitative interviews. The findings reveal that surname change is seldom a neutral act; instead reflecting enduring patriarchal expectations that define legitimacy and belonging. Yet, younger participants demonstrate emerging alternatives, with hyphenated, dual, or invented surnames that challenge conventional lineage models. By analysing these evolving practices, this study argues that the politics of naming remain a mirror of social hierarchies while also offering new ways for achieving some degree of equality and self-definition in contemporary cultural and familial life through a chain of uncomfortable questioning.",

To address\nthis challenge, we propose \"ritualizing the machine\" through intentional design principles that\ndevelop students' \"ritual fluency,\" their ability to navigate complete client encounters with\nappropriate relational and contextual responsiveness. We suggest teaching strategies including\npre-session visual context and ritual preparation, during-session temporal pressure and boundary\nchallenges, and post-session reflection on relational impact.

          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "abstract": "While the fundamental link between place and inequality is well investigated, causal studies on neighborhood effects are limited. Using nationwide administrative data from Germany and a quasi-experimental identification approach, we investigate how employed network ties and role models in the residential neighborhood shape individual-level employment. In exploiting variation over time, within cities and between $1\\times1$ kilometer grid cells, we provide a causal estimate of gendered neighborhood employment effects on refugee women's employment probability. Results support job referral effects of full-time employed female neighbors, which is most direct for native neighborhood women. Analyses of locally prevalent female work norms show a positive one-off effect of higher part-time employment shares of native neighbors indicating that neighbors serve as role models only before other structures are settled. In analyzing neighborhood effects by sex and nationality, our study reveals that gendered neighborhood ties can provide valuable resources for disadvantaged social groups in the labor market. Hence, the study stresses the necessity to break down dichotomies such as gender and ethnicity when not only explaining but also finding alternative pathways for circumventing combined hurdles of intersectionality.",

          "abstract": "Monitoring social change at the national level is a crucial aspect of international comparative studies. The environmental module of the International Social Survey Program, conducted four times, provides the opportunity to explore long-term changes in pro environmental attitudes and behaviours across a broad range of societies from 1993 to 2022. Based on data from 24 European countries, this study offers a fresh longitudinal perspective. First, we investigate long-term trends in environmental attitudes (willingness to pay, environmental risk perception) and environmentally significant behaviours (recycling and public sphere behaviours) across various European societies. Second, by applying multi-level within-between random effects models (REWB), we test whether changes in national affluence impact pro environmental attitudes and behaviours, thereby evaluating the affluence thesis for Europe from a longitudinal perspective. Our main findings indicate that since 2010, environmental attitudes and behaviours have been on an upward trend. This suggests an increased awareness of the topic of climate change in Europe and a possible recovery from the negative impacts of the global economic crisis in 2008. Additionally, we can link the affluence thesis to several other dimensions of environmental attitudes and behaviours, contributing to a critical examination of this hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Blockchain-based systems are designed to enable decentralised coordination and open participation, yet large self-organising crypto communities face persistent organisational challenges. In these complex socio-technical systems, tensions emerge around how to coordinate collective action without hierarchy, balance technical rigour with social connection, and sustain engagement amid constant information overload and competition for attention. We argue that participation depends not only on technical proficiency or economic incentives but equally on the social and organisational mechanisms that enable authentic interaction, trust-building, and social cohesion within crypto communities. Drawing on the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews with retail crypto investors, we explore how participants experience the inherent organisational tensions embedded in their crypto community. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational demands rooted in modes of communication, decision-making, and community growth—each reflecting the dual nature of crypto as both a technical protocol and a social system. Our findings suggest that maintaining balance across these tensions, rather than resolving them, is essential for meaningful participation and long-term platform sustainability. The study contributes a user-centred perspective to debates on governance and collective organisation in decentralized, attention-driven ecosystems.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital technologies has created both opportunities and risks for young people. Previous research shows that their digital engagement is often driven by educational or informational needs, social interaction, and entertainment. However, many practitioners and scholars warn of youth-specific risks. Moreover, pre-existing socioeconomic advantages shape not only access but also young people’s digital motivation, mastery, and patterns of engagement. Adopting an inclusive approach that encompasses a wide range of methodologies, we conduct a scoping review to explore the impact of digital engagement on young people's life outcomes, with a particular focus on the role of socioeconomic resources. We selected relevant studies from a systematic search of the Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences. We then categorized the empirical evidence based on its relevance to our topic and analyzed each study's results, determining whether it showed benefit or harm based on the observed direction of the effect. Findings from 57 empirical studies suggest that digital activities are not inherently harmful or beneficial but depend on the specific task in focus and the domain of life outcomes considered. While digital engagement tends to have a positive impact on academic outcomes, its effects on wellbeing are mixed. Socioeconomic resources generally give young people an additional advantage in using digital devices and activities for more positive life outcomes and in balancing online opportunities and risks. However, more research is needed to analyze the channels through which this advantage is realized.",

Comparing Fuzozo (an embodied robotic companion for adult women) and Havivi (a minimally embodied plush toy with an external AI module for children), we analyze user-generated content on Rednote using topic modeling, semantic networks, and sentiment analysis. Results show that Fuzozo elicits emotionally rich, relational discourse—often framed as companionship—but also triggers disappointment when emotional expectations are unmet. In contrast, Havivi generates fragmented, utility-focused comments centered on play, familiarity, and practicality. Network analysis reveals a cohesive, affective community around Fuzozo versus scattered, functional mentions for Havivi. These findings suggest that embodiment transforms AI from a functional accessory into a perceived social entity, fundamentally influencing how users relate to and evaluate AI companions.",

Despite this positive performance of the economy over the last decade, population below poverty line was 36.2% and GINI index of Benin increased from 38.6 in 2003 to 47.8 in 2015, growing at an average annual rate of 11.29%. This unequal distribution of the wealth can be resolved through a system of integrated growth, by fully exploiting high potential sectors such as agriculture and agro-industry in order to avoid a deterioration of the\nsituation of the vulnerable households. This paper examines the impact of alternative growth paths through investments in agriculture and agro-industry sectors combined. We use a micro funded DSGE Model associated with the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Benin of the year 2013 where we simulate an\nincrease of 75% of capital in the agriculture and agro-industry sectors from 2017 to 2022. The results of the model indicate an increase of the GDP by almost 6% per year during the period of investment that will continue to increase after 2021. In addition, this induce more production in agriculture (average yearly\ngrowth of 6 %) and agro industry sectors (average yearly growth of 11%) and also other sectors as fi?nancial services, transport and trade and ameliorate the wellbeing of the society as a whole.",

          "abstract": "Background: Creativity is the process of generating contextually useful new outcomes by uniquely reconfiguring existing knowledge and information. While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. \nMethods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure.\nResults: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity.\nConclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.",

We formalize queue-doping, a queue-priority externality that steepens competitive slopes. We state results on elite tipping, where users with large spawn capacity can tip markets even when most users prefer dispersion, and on two-phase hysteresis, where temporary scarcity windows can lock in permanent dominance. We provide a compact portability threshold and sketch a sectoral segmentation addendum for staggered activation across different economic domains. The results provide simple policy dials -- portability requirements and behavioral governance constraints -- for stabilizing competition and reducing power-driven concentration.

For Adorno and Horkheimer, after Dialectic of Enlightenment, reconciliation merely means the absence of suffering, as is evident for instance in Adorno’s claim that after Auschwitz, progress reduces to the demand “that no one should go hungry anymore, that there should be no more torture”. By contrast, Marcuse frames his entire critical activity in terms of a reactivation of the promise of equality, liberty and happiness that is enunciated by the French Enlightenment and enacted by the French Revolution. For Marcuse, the “demand for happiness” that is expressed in the artwork is to be actualised through a revolutionary politics, in a programme that redeems the promise of the bourgeois ideals whose realization capitalist society blocks, by means of participatory democracy, egalitarian redistribution, cultural tolerance and the restructuring of the instincts through non-repressive de-sublimation. “A Road Not Taken: Critical Theory after Dialectic of Enlightenment,” in Martyn Henry Lloyd and Geoff Boucher (eds), Rethinking the Enlightenment (Lanham, MD: Lexington Press), Chapter 10, 221-245. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17421680",

We assess the hypothesis that the Boycott had no measurable impact on the City of Montgomery’s public finances and find compelling evidence to the contrary. Our analysis demonstrates that the Boycott significantly contracted municipal revenue and simultaneously escalated public expenditures, particularly in policing and fire services, driven by the city's \"get tough\" policy response. Using historical financial records and time-series forecasting (ARIMA), we quantify the growing fiscal strain experienced by the city. Although Montgomery maintained budget surpluses during the Boycott period, projections indicate a rising probability of deficits had the protest continued beyond its resolution. These findings highlight the economic leverage wielded by organized civil resistance and underscore the material costs incurred by municipal governments when confronting movements for racial justice.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between flexible work policies (e.g., time-off, flextime, working from home), workplace culture, and employee work outcomes. Drawing on an original survey of 4,013 employees from a national probability sample of U.S. households, we find that “ideal worker norms,” which emphasize a single-minded commitment to work, largely persist across U.S. work organizations, including those that offer flexible work policies. However, in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented under certain conditions—namely, gender-neutral framing, transparent guidelines and granting processes, easy access, and strong managerial support—employees are less likely to associate “successful employees” with ideal worker characteristics and less likely to view using flexible work policies as a career limiting move. Employees in these conditions also report higher self-assessed job fit, promotion prospects, and job satisfaction, and lower turnover intentions compared to employees in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented in more feminized, discretionary, less accessible, and less supportive conditions. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of flexible work policies depends on their design and implementation, not merely their availability, and that when implemented effectively, these policies can improve workplace culture and employee work outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Criminologists typically invoke theoretical constructs within an implicit reflective measurement paradigm, assuming constructs represent unified entities causing observable indicators. Yet measurement model choices embed fundamental theoretical commitments rarely subjected to systematic examination. Using self-control as a paradigmatic example, we analyze an abbreviated 12-item Grasmick et al. (1993) scale across 30 countries in the ISRD-2 data through confirmatory factor analysis, network analysis, and predictive concordance assessment. Results challenge unidimensional reflective assumptions: modest model fit masks substantial item-level heterogeneity; systematic cross-cultural measurement non-invariance emerges; network structures suggest complex interdependencies rather than common-cause relationships; and substantial individual-level prediction discordance reveals a “correlation paradox” where aggregate statistical success corresponds to individual-level theoretical failure. These patterns suggest alternative structures—multidimensional reflective, formative, or fictional—merit consideration. Persistent anomalies may reflect theorists struggling to articulate complex conceptualizations within disciplines lacking appropriate measurement vocabularies. Rather than advocating specific approaches, we argue for explicit measurement choices and appropriate validation methods. The disconnect between aggregate success and individual-level validity may characterize research programs trapped in degenerating development patterns.",

          "abstract": "Many human groups employ hierarchical decision-making, in which only a few individuals hold the power to make decisions for the collective. A common explanation for the prevalence of hierarchical decision-making is that it provides group-level benefits by speeding up the decision-making process. However, groups can often do better by taking more time to explore a problem space or generate ideas. These contrasting accounts suggest that hierarchical or egalitarian decision structures may emerge under different circumstances. To more clearly distinguish between these circumstances, we studied an evolutionary model of group decision-making that includes both intra-group and inter-group dynamics. We show that the emergent social structure depends critically on the trade-off between speed and decision quality: scenarios that demand rapid decisions favor the evolution of skewed, hierarchical structures, while scenarios that reward extended deliberation favor the evolution of flat, egalitarian structures. Our results suggest that, instead of inevitably becoming centralized and hierarchical, groups and organizations are likely to evolve social structures that reflect the relationship between the speed and the quality of decisions they collectively make.",

This study addresses that gap by analysing migrants’ inclusion as party executives, concentrating on state-level executive committees of German parties, which oversee day-to-day operations and hold substantial power. Examining how accessible these positions are to minority group members is key to understanding broader political inclusion dynamics. How prevalent are migrants in party executive positions, and under what conditions do they attain them? Leveraging multiple original data sources—a unique large-N dataset covering all state-level executive committees across six parties, qualitative interviews and a survey with party executives, and party documents—this study investigates the influence of three party-level factors. First, party ideology matters. Left-leaning parties are generally more likely to have party executives of migrant origin, while surprisingly the radical right has more than expected and the radical left fewer. Second, intra-party structures play an important role. Among left-wing parties, migrant sections help empower their members to reach leadership positions. In other parties, such sections either do not exist or serve different purposes. Third, parties do not appear to strategically select migrants for the party executive to attract new members. In sum, this study highlights how left-wing parties, for ideological reasons, are especially committed to including migrants in high-level executive positions, and how organisational structures shape this process. More broadly, this study seeks to shift the focus from parliaments to the everyday inner life of party organisations, advancing our understanding of migrants’ political inclusion.",

          "abstract": "This paper describes the methodology for geocoding historical Swedish census data from 1878-1950, developed as part of the research project \"Cities and Socioeconomic Segregation in the Long Term, 1880-2017.\" While Sweden's historical demographic data is renowned for its quality and coverage, geocoding this data presents unique challenges that cannot be solved using modern geocoding APIs. The primary obstacles include temporal changes in address-coordinate relationships, street relocations, and the complete disappearance of spatial units through demolition and redevelopment. Historical Swedish census data varies in geographic precision, ranging from village-level information in rural areas to property-level detail in urban centers like Stockholm. The paper proposes a solution based on constructing a \"canonical\" historical address and property database that incorporates temporal dimensions, allowing for accurate matching at specific time points. This database is compiled from multiple sources and validated against georeferenced historical city maps. The methodology addresses the distinction between property-level (block name and number) and address-level (street name and house number) geocoding, with property coordinates proving more temporally stable. Manual data collection and quality assurance are essential components of the process, particularly for areas subject to major urban redevelopment such as Stockholm's Klara neighborhood. This approach enables accurate geocoding of historical census data while maintaining spatial precision appropriate for demographic analysis of urban segregation patterns over more than a century.",

In this study, we evaluated the quality of information in 109 French-language TikTok videos on autism, ADHD, and dyslexia (with over 66 million cumulative views) to capture variation across disorders. The videos were identified using an ecologically valid keyword search and assessed by healthcare professionals with relevant scientific expertise. Results showed that 41% of autism videos, 56% of ADHD videos, and 41% of dyslexia videos were rated as “very poor” or “fairly poor” in terms of information quality because they contained major inaccuracies. Across all three disorders, higher-quality videos did not attract more views or interactions.",

Perhaps no approach has been more inspirational than the walkthrough method. However, the walkthrough method’s apparent popularity hides the fact that few studies actually use the method as presented. While many studies cite it, only some make use of its technical walkthrough, and almost none draw on its theoretical proposal called the environment of expected use. This article proposes a new approach, the EnAppment Promenade, that aims to address the walkthrough method’s incoherent aims and theoretical perspective. It combines the walkthrough method’s technical walkthrough with a theoretical perspective that replaces the concept of affordances with enactment. This new approach attempts to deliver on the original promise of the walkthrough method: the rigorous and systemic study of apps where the researcher engages directly with an app’s interface.",

          "authors": "Orestes P Hastings",
          "abstract": "Existing research finds that differences in economic resources explain a much larger share of the spending gap between married and single parents than between married and cohabiting parents. This study focuses on extracurricular spending and considers three non-economic explanations for why children in cohabiting families receive less than those in married households: the greater prevalence of non-biological parents in cohabiting households, the relatively shorter duration of cohabiting relationships, and potentially lower levels of relational commitment. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and its 2014 and 2019 Child Development Supplement (5,422 observations of 4,361 children in 2,635 households), I first reproduce established differences in parental spending by family structure. Accounting for biological parent status and relationship duration does little to further reduce the gap between married and cohabiting parents. These findings suggest that unmeasured aspects of commitment may shape family-structure differences in extracurricular investments, but they also highlight the need for continued research given the growing complexity of U.S. family living arrangements and the importance of parental financial investments for children’s development and long-term outcomes.",

          "abstract": "While research recognizes how the spatial and temporal organisation of science impacts its processes and products, questions remain about how dynamic spatiotemporal conditions constitute science in action. As crises can provide an avenue to understand science amidst rapidly shifting spatiotemporal conditions, we present findings from a case study on a multi-omics project during COVID-19. We draw on the concept of chronotopes to illuminate how the “spacetime” properties of individuals, collectives, and the COVID-19 pandemic co-produce COVID-19 science. We present how different actors enact and engage during the crisis spacetime, illustrating how these enactments result in chronotopic convergences that could progress the project or in divergences that could delay it. We examine how the synchronisation of convergences and divergences in the chronotopes of actors and the crisis shape the progression of the project chronotope. Our analysis illuminates key features of science during a crisis, where projects continuously adapt to rapidly shifting crisis conditions, require recursive experiments and regulatory compliance, need to navigate divergent chronotopic expectations, and necessitate convergences beyond individual and experimental spacetimes. Ultimately, chronotopes are not just static backdrops for science, they can enable and constrain actions, and their active governance defines science both in and out of a crisis.",

          "abstract": "The rapid rise in smartphone use among adolescents has transformed modern education and communication, but has also introduced new behavioral risks. This study examines the relationship between academic apathy and smartphone dependency among Korean adolescents, with a specific focus on parental attitudes. Data were drawn from the Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) Wave 2, using the Middle Cohort. Key variables included smartphone dependence, academic apathy, and parental attitude dimensions measured. Results showed that academic apathy significantly predicted smartphone dependency (𝜷 = 0.372, p &lt; .001), indicating that disengaged students are more likely to rely on smartphones for distraction or gratification. Moderation analyses demonstrated that chaotic (𝜷 = 0.050, p &lt; .001), rejecting  (𝜷 = 0.074, p &lt; .001), and coercive (𝜷 = 0.043, p &lt; .001) parenting styles significantly strengthened the positive link between academic apathy and smartphone dependency. These findings highlight that negative parental attitudes amplify the impact of academic apathy on smartphone dependence, underscoring the importance of family dynamics in adolescent technology use. The results suggest that interventions addressing smartphone dependency should also focus on reducing household chaos and coercive parenting practices.",

While prior research has documented this effect, some empirical evidence has also challenged its existence. In this paper, we design a lab-based online experiment to test whether the glass cliff phenomenon arises in a controlled environment. Moreover, little is known about whether other social categories beyond gender, such as ethnicity, are similarly affected. The experiment aims to detect both gender- and ethnic-based glass cliff effects. In the experiment, participants assumed the role of employers tasked with selecting leaders under stable and crisis conditions. Our results show no evidence of glass cliff effects based on either gender or ethnicity. These findings challenge the generalizability of the glass cliff phenomenon. We discuss the lack of a plausible economic mechanism by which it could systematically emerge in incentive-compatible environments. This suggests that future research and policy design should move away from the search for universal evidence of the glass cliff and instead focus on identifying the specific contexts and conditions under which it may occur.",

          "authors": "Julia Graf; Renate Renner; Thomas Klebel",
          "abstract": "Effective risk communication is a core element of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030), emphasizing the importance of early warning and public information in mitigating disaster impacts. However, existing research often treats risk communication as a uniform process, lacking systematic differentiation between short-term warnings for acute hazards and long-term adaptation strategies. This scoping review analyzes 194 peer-reviewed studies to examine how risk communication strategies vary according to the temporal dimension (short-term, long-term, or hybrid), hazard types by group (atmospheric, geophysical, hydrological, and biophysi-cal), and intended purpose. Communication goals are categorized through an inductively developed approach—Act, Prepare, and Aware—and mapped across the four major hazard groups. A focused analysis of 141 studies reveals that differences, such as atmospheric hazards, are predominantly addressed through hybrid (41%) and short-term (25%) strategies, often combining real-time alerts with awareness and preparedness. Geophysical haz-ards are strongly associated with hybrid approaches (43%), which emphasize participatory and educational for-mats. Hydrological hazards display the widest variation, combining short-term, hybrid, and complex strategies. Purely long-term formats, however, are rarely found across all hazard types (1.4%), despite their strategic im-portance for resilience. Findings suggest that the choice of communication strategy can be tied to the nature and dynamics of each hazard type. This review identifies key patterns, research gaps, and a structured basis for further evaluation and the development of risk communication. It provides an overview of current literature and guidance for developing context-sensitive, temporally integrated communication strategies.",

          "abstract": "Marriage is consistently associated with better health and longevity, often attributed to economic advantages, health monitoring by a partner, and emotional support. Conversely, spousal death increases the risk of immediate mortality, known as the “widowhood effect.” Although these patterns are well-documented in contemporary populations, less is understood about their prevalence in historical populations, where extended family households may have mitigated the adverse effects of being unmarried or widowed. We investigated the effects of marital status on survival probabilities from age 40 onward, focusing on socioeconomic variability. Access to resources and coping mechanisms likely differed by social class, influencing how marital status affected survival across age groups and socioeconomic strata. We analyzed historical church book data from Finland (1730–1910), applying discrete-time event models to estimate annual survival for men (n = 5,802) and women (n = 6,203) aged 40 to 90. Time-varying marital statuses were categorized into five groups: never married, married, recently widowed, widowed, and remarried. Survival differences by marital status were strongly mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Among high-SES individuals, never-married men and women had 15% and 21% higher survival rates, respectively, compared to their married counterparts. In contrast, among the moderate and lowest socioeconomic classes, survival probabilities for the never-married did not differ from those of the married. The survival advantage of never-married women was limited to ages below 60. Both men and women experienced sharp declines in survival during the two years following spousal loss (15–27%, depending on sex and class). Beyond this acute period, widowed men exhibited 5–10% lower survival rates across all classes compared to married men, while only high-SES widowed women faced a 6% survival disadvantage. Remarriage was associated with survival rates comparable to those of first-time marriage. This study provides insight into the survival advantages of pair-bonding in historical societies, characterized by high mortality rates, extended family structures, and the absence of modern medical resources.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Niko Eskelinen; Laura Jernström; Henri Salokangas",
          "abstract": "Using high-quality administrative data, we study how parental labor market shocks\naffect children’s socioeconomic disadvantage. We find that the job loss of both fathers\nand mothers significantly increases the likelihood that children will experience\na range of socioeconomic disadvantage indicators in adulthood, including being not\nin education, employment, or training (NEET), reliance on social assistance, and the\nuse of unemployment benefits. In relative terms, we find that parental job loss increases\nchildren’s risk of socioeconomic disadvantage by up to 4.5% for sons and up\nto 3.9% for daughters. These effects persist for more than a decade after parental job\ndisplacement. The adverse impacts are particularly pronounced for boys and children\nexposed at older ages, suggesting heterogeneous vulnerability based on gender\nand developmental stage. Our results indicate that good labor market conditions –\nparticularly in the case of fathers – may mitigate the adverse effects of parental job\nloss.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Kunlan Feng; Yanyan Xu",
          "abstract": "This study selects otome game as a typical case for mixed human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-human interaction (HHI) scenarios, as it simultaneously encompass deep interactions between players and virtual characters (HCI) and within player communities (HHI), and exhibit the unique phenomenon of identity differentiation into \"dream girls\" and \"fellow bearers\". Previous research has primarily focused on the unidirectional impact of HCI on HHI, while neglecting the reverse effect of HHI on HCI and the behavioral pattern differences arising from identity differentiation. The research methods include: 1) Netnographic analysis (3-5 years of gaming experience &amp; 19,861 online comments); 2) In-depth interviews (19 players); 3) Grounded theory (inductively identifying 5 thematic categories); 4) Descriptive phenomenological approach. This study innovatively proposes the \"Dual Interactive Construction Circles\" (DICC) framework, integrating theories of social presence, symbolic interactionism, and social constructivism. It describes the influence of the inner circle (psychological mechanisms) on the outer circle (behavioral codes), where identity labels represent specific behavioral patterns. This study finds that players collaboratively construct an anthropomorphic perception of virtual characters through HCI and HHI, and that community interactions can partially and reversely shape in-game experiences. This framework breaks through the traditional unidirectional perspective in HCI research and provides a systematic analytical tool for mixed interaction scenarios.",

          "title": "From Scent to Scene: Unveiling the Generation of Olfactory Mental Imagery via LLM-Driven Text Mining",
          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Zongping Liu; Yanyan Xu",
          "abstract": "Method: This study explores the relationship between perfume scents and consumer imagery associations. Based on the analysis of online reviews, a four-dimensional framework was constructed to decode the patterns of imagery associations in perfume reviews. The research adopts a mixed-methods approach, including text mining, content analysis, multiple regression and fsQCA validation, as well as semantic network mapping. \n\nOpen Practice Statement: This study only involves text data analysis, poses no ethical risks, and therefore does not require pre-registration. \n\nKey Findings: 1) natural materials and cultural symbols significantly enhance product ratings (β=0.0114 and β=0.0132), yet cultural symbols negatively affect popularity (β=-0.0296); 2) fsQCA identifies two high-rating pathways, highlighting the synergistic effects between natural materials and cultural symbols; 3) semantic network analysis reveals distinctive imagery sets for twelve fragrance families and constructs a “ingredient–imagery–scene” mapping chain. \n\nSignificance: Innovatively, this study proposes a four-dimensional model to quantify the mechanisms underlying olfactory mental imagery generation, filling a theoretical gap in sensory marketing and neuroaesthetics. It also provides practical tools for fragrance brands to leverage dual-driven storytelling through culture and emotion, enabling scene-based customization in response to emerging market trends. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how generative AI can transform unstructured consumer feedback into actionable insights, opening new avenues for consumer experience research in the digital era. In summary, this work offers essential theoretical tools for understanding the core logic of the olfactory economy and provides practical guidance for perfume brands to pursue strategic differentiation.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin; Jinjia Gui; Yueqi Wang; Wei Xu",
          "abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of generative AI-driven digital immortality (DI) technology, focusing on two distinct user groups: Digital Legacy Giver (DLG), who plan their posthumous digital presence, and Digital Legacy Receiver (DLR), who interact with digital representations of deceased loved ones. Through a mixed-methods approach—analyzing 305 DLG and 307 DLR questionnaires supplemented by 18 in-depth interviews—the research identifies divergent adoption drivers. Key findings reveal DLG exhibit significantly higher DI adoption intent (DIA) than DLR (mean DIA: 3.46 vs. 3.21, p&lt;0.001). For DLG, Presence Extension Need (PEN) (β=0.175, p&lt;0.001) and Data Snoop Concern (DSC) (β=−0.341, p&lt;0.001) are primary motivators and barriers, reflecting desires for symbolic identity continuity and privacy fears. Conversely, DLR prioritize Ritual Substitution Need (RSN) (β=0.252, p&lt;0.001) but are deterred by Relationship Desecration Concern (RDC) (β=−0.336, p&lt;0.001), emphasizing technology’s role in sustaining daily emotional rituals while fearing relational inauthenticity. The study innovatively frames adoption through a \"Demand-Concern-Individual\" ternary model, highlighting an individual-centric logic (DLG seeking self-continuity) versus socio-centric logic (DLR preserving relational bonds). It expands the concept of \"ritual\" beyond traditional memorials to encompass technology-mediated daily interactions. Practical implications include designing personalized security features for DLG and ethically calibrated emotional interfaces for DLR.",

          "authors": "Mengjiao Yin",
          "abstract": "This study investigates whether artificial intelligence can emulate human mystical experiences through algorithmic rationality, focusing specifically on the generative mechanisms of “Perceived Sacredness” within AI-assisted tarot divination. Grounded in the original “Triadic Framework for Human-AI Spiritual Interaction,” three sequential experiments systematically examine how sacredness perception is shaped by three contextual layers: “who speaks” (agent subjectivity), “how it speaks” (interaction modality), and “what is spoken” (question typology). Study 1 reveals that spiritual believers report significantly lower perceived sacredness, service quality, and trust when explicitly informed that AI is involved, whereas non-believers show no such difference—supporting the “in-group bias” hypothesis. Study 2 demonstrates that oral conversation significantly enhances perceived sacredness compared to touch-screen interaction, aligning with Media Richness and Social Presence theories. Study 3 found no significant difference between open-ended and closed-ended questions in eliciting sacred experiences. Collectively, while AI cannot intrinsically “possess” spirituality, it can effectively “evoke” subjective sacred experiences through carefully designed interaction contexts. This research provides empirical grounding for understanding the reconfiguration of spiritual experience in the technological age and offers critical implications for the ethical and experiential design of AI in spiritual service domains.",

          "title": "Predicting Rates of Food Insecurity in the United States  in the Absence of Official Data Collection",
          "authors": "Sophie Collyer",
          "abstract": "As of 2023, more than 47 million people in the United States (14.3%) lived in food-insecure households. In the coming years, however, we will not know whether the national prevalence of food insecurity has risen, fallen, or remained stable, as the USDA recently announced the permanent suspension of food security data collection on the Current Population Survey (CPS). The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.",

          "authors": "Angus Lewis; Oliver Xie",
          "abstract": "Many firms borrow predominantly in foreign currencies from foreign lenders. Access to these foreign lenders may have large impacts on firm borrowing costs and quantities. We propose a model of firm debt financing across debt markets which are segmented by currency. Firms face separate credit supply curves in each debt market. A key theoretical takeaway is that existing approaches to estimating cost of borrowing savings based on estimates of savings on the marginal unit of debt are only valid if firms face perfectly flat credit supply curves. We then measure key empirical quantities and estimate the parameters in our model using a comprehensive, security level dataset of global corporate debt issuance which covers firms in 41 countries. We find that credit supply curves are not perfectly flat and that there are meaningful inframarginal gains. We estimate that many firms reduce the interest rates on their debt liabilities by up to 2 percentage points by accessing foreign currency debt markets. We perform model counterfactuals in which we change barriers to financial integration.",
